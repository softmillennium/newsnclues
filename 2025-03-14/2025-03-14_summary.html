The 79-year-old Duterte, the first Asian former leader arrested on an ICC warrant, was read his rights and formally informed of the charges of crimes against humanity that the court's prosecutors filed against him after a lengthy investigation.

Harry Roque, also a lawyer seeking to represent him in the ICC case, said the question of jurisdiction over the Philippines, which withdrew from the global court when Duterte was president, should be addressed before any further proceedings.

Sara Duterte spoke outside the court, telling reporters she expected the ICC to “give us permission” to visit her father and hoped the court would “allow our request to move the initial appearance.” The 79-year-old Duterte, the first Asian former leader arrested on an ICC warrant, will be read his rights and formally informed of the crimes against humanity charge that the court's prosecutors filed against him after a lengthy investigation.

Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was being flown to the Netherlands on Wednesday to face an International Criminal Court charge of crimes against humanity linked to the deadly crackdown on drugs he oversaw while in office.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — Jailed former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte appeared Friday by videoconference before judges at the International Criminal Court, days after his arrest in Manila on murder charges linked to the deadly “ war on drugs ” that he oversaw while in office.

The 79-year-old Duterte didn't show up at the court in The Hague, but appeared on a video screen from the detention center where he is being held, about a mile (1½ kilometers) away.

For families of victims of the drugs crackdown, Duterte's appearance in court was a long-awaited sign of hope. Duterte's vocal supporters call the arrest illegal. 

His lawyer, Salvador Medialdea, used the hearing to slam his arrest in Manila as a “pure and simple kidnapping.” He said Duterte “was denied all access to the legal recourse in the country of his citizenship, and this all in the nature of political score-settling.”

Presiding Judge Iulia Antoanella Motoc set a pretrial hearing date of Sept. 23 to establish if prosecution evidence is strong enough to merit sending the case to trial. If a trial does go ahead, it could take years, and if Duterte is convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Estimates of the death toll during Duterte's presidential term vary, from the more than 6,000 that the national police have reported and up to 30,000, according to numbers from human rights groups.




The ICC judge said that Duterte had been allowed to participate in his first hearing by videoconference because he had just come off a long flight.

AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is scheduled to stand before judges today at the International Criminal Court, days after his stunning arrest in Manila on murder charges.

Duterte, wearing a jacket and tie, listened to the hearing through headphones, often with his eyes closed. He spoke in English to confirm his name, and his date and place of birth. He was not required to enter a plea. The hearing, which started about a half-hour late, lasted around 30 minutes.

Medialdea said that Duterte had been under observation at a hospital because of health issues. 

The judge, addressing Duterte, said: “The court doctor was of the opinion that you were fully mentally aware and fit.”

Duterte was arrested Tuesday amid chaotic scenes in the Philippine capital after returning from a visit to Hong Kong. He was swiftly put on a chartered jet and flown to the Netherlands.

His daughter, Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte, visited him in the court's detention center Friday and met with supporters outside the court. Duterte is a political rival of the current president.

She said her father is ″in good spirits″ and ″well taken care of,″ and his only complaint about his conditions is that he misses Filipino food. 

She too decried what she called a political arrest. ″There will be a day of reckoning for all,″ she said, as excited crowds around her chanted ″Duterte!″ and ″yes, yes!″

Meanwhile, activists marched in the Philippine capital region, demanding justice for the thousands of suspects killed in Duterte's brutal crackdowns. Families of those killed watched the ICC proceedings on screens set up around the country, some holding portraits of their slain loved ones, as they listened to charges read out against Duterte in a courtroom across the world.

Prosecutors accuse Duterte of involvement as an “indirect co-perpetrator” in multiple murders, amounting to a crime against humanity for allegedly overseeing killings from November 2011 until March 2019, first while he was mayor of the southern city of Davao and later as president of the Philippines.

According to the prosecution request for his arrest, Duterte, as Davao mayor, issued orders to police and other “hitmen” who formed so-called Davao Death Squads, or DDS.

He told them “that their mission was to kill criminals, including drug dealers, and provided clearance for specific DDS killings,” prosecutors allege, adding that he recruited, paid and rewarded the killers and “provided them with the necessary weapons and resources, and promised to shield them from prosecution.”

The document seeking an ICC warrant for Duterte said that prosecutors built their case using evidence including witness testimony, speeches by Duterte himself, government documents and video footage.

Human rights groups and victims' families have hailed Duterte's arrest as a historic triumph against state impunity, while the former president's supporters have slammed what they call the government's surrender of a political rival to a court whose jurisdiction they dispute.

“We are happy and we feel relieved,” said 55-year-old Melinda Abion Lafuente, mother of 22-year-old Angelo Lafuente, who she said was tortured and killed in 2016.

“Duterte's appearance before the ICC is a testament to the courage and determination of the victims, their families, and Filipino activists and journalists to pursue justice no matter how long it takes,” said Bryony Lau, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Other leaders facing ICC arrest warrants, like (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu, should take note that even those who seem untouchable today can end up in The Hague.”

Duterte's legal team said that Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration shouldn't have allowed the global court to take custody of the former leader because the Philippines is no longer a party to the ICC.

Medialdea said that “two troubled entities struck an unlikely alliance. An incumbent president who wishes to neutralize and choke the legacy of my client and his daughter,” and “a troubled legal institution subject to delegitimization.”

Judges who approved Duterte's arrest warrant said that the court has jurisdiction because the crimes alleged in the warrant were committed before Duterte withdrew the Philippines from the court in 2019.

Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday called on Ukrainian troops fighting in the Kursk region to surrender, after US President Donald Trump urged him to "spare" the lives of Ukrainian soldiers.

Trump and Putin said that the Russian army had Ukrainian forces surrounded there -- claims rejected by Kyiv, even as President Volodymyr Zelensky conceded that his forces were coming under increasing pressure.

Russia has mounted a rapid counteroffensive over the last week, recapturing swathes of land and settlements in the western border region from Ukraine.

"We are sympathetic to President Trump's call," Putin said in televised remarks.

"If they lay down their arms and surrender, they will be guaranteed life and dignified treatment," he added.

"In order to effectively implement the US president's call, (there needs to be) a corresponding order from Ukraine's military-political leadership to its military to lay down their arms and surrender," Putin added.

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump had appealed to Putin over what he said were "thousands" of Ukrainian troops "completely surrounded by the Russian military, and in a very bad and vulnerable position".

"I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II," he said.

Moscow has recaptured the vast majority of territory Kyiv seized in its cross-border assault into Kursk last August, including in a rapid counteroffensive over the last week.

Ukraine denied Trump's and Putin's claims and said it was holding on to territory there.

"There is no threat of our units being encircled," the General Staff wrote in a statement on social media.

But Zelensky admitted his troops were under intense Russian pressure.

"The situation in the Kursk region is obviously very difficult," Zelensky told reporters -- including AFP journalists -- in Kyiv.

He said, however, that Ukraine's offensive there had forced Russia to pull its troops from other embattled areas of the front, easing pressure on Ukrainian troops fighting to keep control of the eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk.

"I think the situation in the Pokrovsk sector is now stable, and it will be very difficult to find an opportunity to occupy Pokrovsk again," Zelensky said.

Some say incursion achieved many goals while others wonder if it cost Ukrainian lives for no tangible gain

Under constant attack from drones attached to fibre optic cables, the soldiers scrambled in groups of two or three along hidden tracks or through fields, often walking miles to reach Ukrainian territory.

The Ukrainian retreat from the Kursk region, carried out in stages over the past two weeks, appears to mark the end of one of the most audacious and surprising operations of the conflict, and strips Ukraine of one of its few solid bargaining chips in possible peace negotiations with Russia.

For seven months, Ukraine held on to a chunk of Russian territory, including the town of Sudzha, which had a prewar population of about 5,000. It was the first time a foreign army had occupied Russian land since the second world war.

Russia, with the help of North Korean troops, has been pushing Ukrainian forces back, and in recent weeks the pressure on Ukrainian positions has become overwhelming. On Wednesday, Vladimir Putin donned military fatigues to visit a command post in the region, and on Thursday, Russia announced it had regained full control of Sudzha.

While Ukrainian troops continue to hold a few remaining villages in Kursk, soldiers involved in the operation said it was probably only a matter of time before the retreat was concluded.

“The Russians are already pushing into Sumy region [in Ukraine], all the tasks now are defensive,” said Serhiy, a special operations commander who recently left the region.

The demand by Putin that troops create a “buffer zone” close to the border suggests a Russian offensive pushing back into Ukraine may be on the cards, and authorities have already evacuated several settlements close to the border.

The end of the seven-month operation has led to mixed assessments in Ukraine, with some saying it achieved many of its goals, and others wondering if it was a distraction from the main war effort and cost Ukrainian lives for no tangible gain.

“Kursk displaced the conflict on to Russian territory, and Russia used some of its best units to fight for it, but it also required a sizeable number of Ukraine's elite units to hold the pocket,” said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

Now, the Russian offensive may change the dynamic of the war again, at a moment when the US is pushing Moscow and Kyiv to sign a ceasefire agreement. “My worry is that this gives the Kremlin and the Russian army a new bout of enthusiasm and adrenaline,” the Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko said.

The initial incursion into Kursk happened last August. It was planned by a very small circle to retain an element of surprise, and Kyiv did not even brief western allies until after the operation was under way. Troops arrived in nearby Sumy in small groups, and many stayed in rented apartments.

Documents recovered from Russian army positions showed that Moscow's military planners had warned of the threat of an incursion for months, but when it came Ukrainian troops were able to overrun Russian positions, taking hundreds of prisoners of war.

In Sudzha, officials and police fled without even destroying or taking away sensitive documents, leaving them for Ukrainian troops to seize and send to Kyiv for analysis.

Those with knowledge of the planning say Ukrainian officials were taken aback by just how well the initial stage of the operation went, as Ukraine took control of about 500 sq miles within a few days.

“At the beginning, the idea was just to create a diversion and to draw troops away from Donbas. But it went better than expected and suddenly we were digging in,” said one source.

“We have no wish to occupy this territory,” Zelenskyy's aide Mykhailo Podolyak told the Guardian in late August. “Our tasks are to push Russian artillery and other systems further away, destroy the warehouses and other military infrastructure that is there, and also to affect public opinion in Russia.”

For the first time in the war, the shoe was on the other foot and Ukraine became an occupying power. The Ukrainian army took journalists on tours of Sudzha, where stunned residents could not believe the war they had seen on their television screens had arrived on Russian territory. A historian from Sumy recorded a podcast in Sudzha's small history museum, explaining how Sudzha and the rest of the region was historically Ukrainian land, a nod to Russian claims about Ukrainian territories.

At one point, there were plans to ask Russians who were fighting alongside Ukraine to enter the region and take over police functions. The idea would have been to troll Russia, which masked its 2014 intervention in Donbas as the work of Ukrainian separatists. However, the plans were quickly discarded as unworkable and incendiary.

The capture of hundreds of prisoners allowed Ukraine to offer an exchange for captured Ukrainians held in Russian jails, and the operation was also credited with providing a morale boost to Ukrainian troops and society after months of setbacks.

The longer Ukrainian troops held on to the land, the more it became clear that the endgame of the operation was now the chance to use Kursk as a card at future negotiations. Zelenskyy told the Guardian last month that Kyiv would “swap one territory for another”.

However, as time went on, Russia upped the pressure on Ukrainian positions in the region. By the beginning of this year, Ukrainian military planners could see Russia making a sustained effort to concentrate forces on Kursk.

“Everything is going to Kursk,” one military source said in early February. “At the beginning they didn't seem to pay that much attention to it, but then the North Koreans came, and then since the beginning of the year they are throwing everything at Kursk, perhaps to try to take it back before negotiating.”

Some of Russia's best drone units were relocated to the Kursk theatre. Because Ukrainian forces can use radio jammers to block Russian FPV (first person view) drones, Russia has increasingly begun using fibre optic drones, which unspool a thin cable over several miles and are immune to jammers.

“The fields we are retreating through are like a spider's web with all the fibre optic cables,” said Serhiy, the special operations commander.

He criticised the failure to build nets around the main road between Sumy and Sudzha to protect it from drones, as the Russians have done in part of the front in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. “Only in the last two weeks they started trying to do this, but now it's too dangerous. They should have done it in September, October, when everything was calm,” he said.

Ukrainian officials say that while ultimately the operation will not provide the hoped-for bargaining chip, it was able to change the narrative of the war, at a time when gloominess over Ukrainian prospects for any kind of advance had set in. They say that while the withdrawal may be fraught, it has so far passed without enormous loss of life or stubbornly holding on to undefendable positions.

“After seven months, we simply withdrew. There was no encirclement,” said one senior security official, painting the operation as a success. “There were political goals, military goals, there was getting the Russians to move troops from Pokrovsk [in Donetsk] to Kursk. And we showed how shameful it is for the Russians, that they can't fight Ukraine without North Koreans.”

Others had a more mixed assessment, noting that the offensive stretched Ukraine's already understaffed forces, and did not slow the Russian advance in the east. “Tactically it was successful, but the offensive changed little in the overall dynamic of this war, and failed to achieve its wider operational objectives,” Kofman said.

US President Donald Trump urged Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday to spare Ukrainian troops being pushed back out of Russia's Kursk region and said there was a "very good chance" the war could end.Trump posted on social media after his envoy, Steve Witkoff, held a lengthy meeting with Putin on Thursday night in Moscow that Trump described as "very good and productive."  "We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end," Trump said in a Truth Social post, adding that he had requested that Putin spare the lives of "completely surrounded" Ukrainian troops."I have strongly requested to President Putin that their [Ukrainian soldiers in Russia's Kursk region] lives be spared," he wrote. "This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II."

(credit: REUTERS/YAN DOBRONOSOV)No Ukraine war, Israel-Hamas war under Trump?Trump asserted that the war in Ukraine, which began when Russia illegally invaded the country, would not have happened if he had been president at the time. "Millions of people are needlessly dead, never to be seen again…and there will be many more to follow if we don't get the Cease Fire and Final Agreement with Russia completed and signed. There would have been NO WAR if I were President. It just, 100%, would not have happened," he wrote. He went on to say that "there would have been no October 7th with Israel," if the Hamas attacks had happened during his presidency. Trump's post comes after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent back a list of demands in response to a US-brokered ceasefire to stop the three-year-old conflict.    Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Putin said on Friday that he was aware of Trump's requests, but that he would only spare the lives of Ukrainian troops on the frontlines in Russia's Kursk region if Kyiv called for them to surrender, TASS reported.  AdvertisementPutin said on Thursday that he supported Trump's proposal in principle, but that fighting could not be paused until several crucial conditions were worked out, raising the prospect of longer negotiations.“We agree with the proposal to cease hostilities but we have to bear in mind that this ceasefire must be aimed at a long-lasting peace and it must look at the root causes of the crisis,” Putin said at a Russian news conference, as reported by CNN.Putin's demands included that Ukraine stop training troops, that other nations stop sending Kyiv military support, and that Russia would keep all of the land it annexed in the war, which amounts to approximately 20% of Ukrainian territory.   Despite its heavily qualified nature, Trump called Putin's statement "very promising."Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that Putin - who has expressed concern that Ukraine would exploit any truce to regroup - had used the late-night meeting with Witkoff to convey information and "signals" to Trump."There are certainly reasons to be cautiously optimistic," Peskov said. "(Putin) said that he supports President Trump's position in terms of a settlement, but he voiced some questions that need to be answered together".Ukraine, US pushes for peaceOnly hours after Trump's post on Truth Social, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that those who can push the Kremlin to sign a peace agreement should do so."I strongly urge everyone who can influence Russia, especially the United States, to take strong steps that can help. Pressure must be applied to the one who does not want to stop the war. Pressure must be put on Russia. Only decisive actions can end this war, which has already lasted for years," he wrote in a post on X/Twitter.

Trump posted on social media after his envoy, Steve Witkoff, held a lengthy meeting with Putin on Thursday night in Moscow that Trump described as "very good and productive."  "We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end," Trump said in a Truth Social post, adding that he had requested that Putin spare the lives of "completely surrounded" Ukrainian troops."I have strongly requested to President Putin that their [Ukrainian soldiers in Russia's Kursk region] lives be spared," he wrote. "This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II."

Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Friday that Russia would ensure the safety of Ukrainian troops in the Kursk region if they choose to surrender.

In a statement to the Russian Security Council, Putin called on Ukrainian authorities to direct their soldiers to lay down their weapons.

The statement comes shortly after US President Donald Trump requested Putin to spare Ukrainian forces retreating from the Kursk area, expressing hope that the conflict could end soon.

US President Donald Trump requested Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday to ‘spare' Ukrainian troops being pushed back from Russia's Kursk region, expressing hope that the war could soon end.

Donald Trump's comments followed a meeting between Putin and his envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Moscow on Thursday night, which Trump described as “very good and productive.” Trump was optimistic, stating, “There is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end.”

The US president warned that thousands of Ukrainian troops were “completely surrounded” by Russian forces, in a “very bad and vulnerable position.” He said, “I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!”

Taking to his Truth Social platform, Donald Trump said, “We had very good and productive discussions with President Vladimir Putin of Russia yesterday, and there is a very good chance that this horrible, bloody war can finally come to an end — BUT, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, THOUSANDS OF UKRAINIAN TROOPS ARE COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY THE RUSSIAN MILITARY, AND IN A VERY BAD AND VULNERABLE POSITION. I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared. This would be a horrible massacre, one not seen since World War II. God bless them all!!!.”

Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky said Friday that Ukrainian troops were under mounting pressure in the western Russian region of Kursk but that the operation had eased pressure on Ukrainian troops elsewhere.

"The situation in the Kursk region is obviously very difficult," news agency AFP quoted Zelensky as saying at a briefing in Kyiv, adding that fighting in the eastern Donetsk region had stabilised.

While carefully avoiding an outright rejection of US ceasefire proposals, Moscow is playing for time

For once, the US president and European leaders were on the same page.

Grasping for a familiar metaphor, a chorus of western heads of state declared this week that “the ball was in Russia's court” after Ukraine agreed in talks with the US on Tuesday to an immediate 30-day ceasefire.

Rather than making a play, Vladimir Putin on Thursday picked up the ball, scrawled a fresh set of conditions across it, and lobbed it back – insisting the game could not move forward until the other side played by his rules.

“The idea itself is the right one, and we definitely support it,” Putin said, sitting alongside his longtime ally Alexander Lukashenko at a press conference in the Kremlin.

It was the “but” that followed that did all the heavy lifting.

“There are questions that we need to discuss, and I think we need to talk them through with our American colleagues and partner,” he added, suggesting that Ukraine should neither rearm nor mobilise and that western military aid to Kyiv be halted during the ceasefire.

Meanwhile, the message was clear: Russia had no intention of halting its own rearmament. Ukraine fears that Putin is preparing to do exactly what he accuses Kyiv of: exploiting the ceasefire to rearm and intensify his offensive if talks fall apart, as Russian forces press their advantage on the ground.

Over the past month, the geopolitical landscape has shifted dramatically in favour of the Russian leader, as Donald Trump reshaped US foreign policy to Moscow's advantage while straining relations with American allies.

But the introduction of a joint ceasefire proposal from the US and Ukraine turned the tables on Putin, forcing him to navigate the growing tension between his ambitions for a decisive victory in Ukraine and his efforts to maintain a close relationship with Trump.

By steering clear of an outright rejection of Trump's proposal, Putin appeared to be buying time – walking a fine line between avoiding an open rebuff of Trump's peace initiative and imposing his own stringent conditions, effectively prolonging the negotiations.

To his admirers, it was a masterclass in Putin's diplomatic manoeuvring, flanked by the seasoned foreign policy veterans Sergei Lavrov and Yuri Ushakov – both with decades of experience.

“Putin used one of his favourite phrases … A firm ‘Yes, but … '” quipped Andrei Kolesnikov, the chief political reporter for Russia's Kommersant newspaper and one of the few journalists with direct access to the president.

Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, predictably viewed Putin's ambivalent response as yet another cynical trick, dismissing it as “manipulative”. Putin, he said, was “afraid to say directly to President Trump that he wants to continue this war”, accusing the Russian leader of “framing the idea of a ceasefire with such preconditions that nothing will work out at all, or for as long as possible”.

For longtime observers, it was a familiar Russian tactic. Moscow has long excelled at delaying negotiations, offering just enough hope of progress to keep talks alive while avoiding major concessions.

Putin's remarks and Zelenskyy's response have drawn a clear dividing line between the two sides' positions.

Ukraine envisions a two-step approach: an immediate ceasefire followed by negotiations for a long-term settlement backed by western security guarantees.

Russia, on the other hand, insists that both issues must be settled within a single, comprehensive agreement, one that extends far beyond a simple ceasefire.

The contours of Russia's demands were discussed behind closed doors on Thursday, as Putin held late-night talks with Steven Witkoff, the billionaire friend of Trump and chief Ukraine negotiator.

Moscow is expected to push for sweeping concessions, including the demilitarisation of Ukraine, an end to western military aid and guarantees that Kyiv will remain outside Nato.

Foreign troop deployments in Ukraine remain a non-starter for Moscow, which is also seeking international recognition of its claims to Crimea and the four Ukrainian regions annexed in 2022. Putin may further revive broader security demands from 2021, including limits on Nato's military presence in countries that joined the alliance after 1997, when its expansion into former communist states began.

The Washington Post reported on Friday, citing classified US intelligence assessments, including one from earlier this month, that the Russian president had not “veered from his maximalist goal of dominating Ukraine”.

Trump, in his push for a deal to halt the war in Ukraine, started with the low-hanging fruit – pressuring Zelenskyy, whose military relies on American support.

But Trump had “few options to counter either a Russian rejection or prolonged feigned compliance”, said Alexander Baunov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

While Trump had pledged to intensify sanctions against Russia, the reality was that the US had little room left to escalate pressure – aside from increasing military support, which he had said he was reluctant to do.

Instead, Baunov argued, the most effective way to influence Russia would be the carrot rather than the stick – offering the prospect of sanctions relief and reintegration into western economies.

From the outset, Trump had dangled financial investment and a return to normal relations as incentives for Russia, or as his transactional administration put it, “the incredible opportunities that exist to partner with the Russians” – both geopolitically and economically.

But there was also a far darker possibility for Ukraine. “Faced with the reality that he has no real leverage over Putin for a quick deal, Trump could once again align himself with the Russian leader – turning Putin's demands into a joint agenda,” Baunov said.

Early signs will be worrying for Kyiv. On Friday, Trump echoed Putin's claims that thousands of Ukrainian troops were encircled by the Russian army in the Kursk region – a claim refuted by Ukrainian sources and independent analysts.

Trump wrote on his Truth Social app that he had asked Putin to spare the lives of Ukrainian soldiers – a favour Putin may gladly grant, given that, according to reports, no Ukrainian troops appear to be actually trapped.

By allowing Putin to play the role of the merciful leader, Trump subtly slips yet another card into Russia's ever-growing deck.

The Loess plateau was the most eroded place on Earth until China took action and reversed decades of damage from grazing and farming

It was one of China's most ambitious environmental endeavours ever.

The Loess plateau, an area spanning more than 245,000 sq miles (640,000 sq km) across three provinces and parts of four others, supports about 100 million people. By the end of the 20th century, however, this land, once fertile and productive, was considered the most eroded place on Earth, according to a documentary by the ecologist John D Liu.

Generations of farmers had cleared and cultivated the land, slowly breaking down the soil and destroying the cover. Every year, the dust from the plain jammed the Yellow River with silt (this is how the river gets its name), sending plumes of loess, a fine wind-blown sediment, across Chinese cities – including to the capital, Beijing.

And so in 1999 the Chinese government took drastic emergency action with the launch of Grain to Green, a pilot project backed by World Bank funding, to regreen the plateau and reverse the damage done by overgrazing and overcultivation of the once forested hillsides that would become what the bank described in 2004 as “the largest and most successful water and soil conservancy project in the world” (pdf).

The primary focus was to restore agricultural production and incomes in the plateau, but the dust storms descending on already polluted cities, “making people cough even more”, also became a driver, says Peter Bridgewater, an honorary professor at the Australian National University's Centre for Heritage and Museum Studies.

World Bank participants spent more than three years designing the project, working with experts as well as communities, officials and farmers on how to overturn the longstanding but unsustainable grazing and herding of livestock. Tree-cutting, planting on hillsides and uncurbed sheep and goat grazing were banned. The sustainable practices demonstrated in some small villages were scaled up.

The project was extraordinarily ambitious, and was powered through by China's authoritarian system. “If you want major change, the Chinese system is well adapted to making major change,” says Bridgewater wryly.

There were grain and cash subsidies for people converting farmland to grassland, economic forest or protected ecological forest. There were tax subsidies and benefits to offset farming losses, long-term land use contracts and conversion to more sustainable farming including orchards and nuts, and widespread tree-planting employment programmes.

By 2016, China had converted more than 11,500 sq miles of rain-fed cropland to forest or grassland – a 25% increase in vegetative cover in a decade, according to a study published in Nature Climate Change. Other studies showed large reductions in erosion and positive changes in plant productivity.

“When the environment improved, all the birds returned. The forest has developed its ecological system naturally,” the forestry worker Yan Rufeng told the state-run news channel CGTN.

It wasn't straightforward, however. There was some community resistance, particularly to demands to plant trees on farming land. “What about the next generation? They can't eat trees,” said one man interviewed for Liu's documentary.

In the early years there also appeared to be a correlation between the project and a sudden drop in grain yield. Over the years, officials would debate whether the programme was harming China's food security, although studies found there to be several factors at play, and that yields later improved.

In hindsight, the early methods employed to regreen the dusty hills were also problematic. “There was a lot of mass tree planting – not necessarily natives – and in plantation format, in other words, monocultural stands,” says Bridgewater.

Mass-species planting eventually began to replace the monoculture plantations, helping to increase wildlife, but there were also issues with water management, with the burgeoning tree cover and agriculture taking more and more water out of the Yellow River system.

“It's looking like there is a point at which the revegetation will become too successful in that it actually then swings the water balance of the landscape, reducing the potential for water to go into the rivers and be available for human use,” says Bridgewater.

“So this is another element that was not really thought about at the start, because the aim wasn't ‘let's stabilise the system'. But it's a good lesson as to how all these interconnecting factors need to be thought about very carefully before you launch into these things.”

A big factor in the success and demands of the programme was and remains the changing climate. The plateau sits in a transition zone between arid and semi-humid climates. The varied natural factors of the region, combined with unsustainable human activity, had contributed to the fragility of the plateau, a 2021 study found. “At the same time, the climate in this region has shown warming and wetting, particularly in the south in which precipitation increased by 20-50 mm from 2000 to 2014.”

The climate around the Loess plateau is changing, which means what existed, or even thrived, several decades ago can't necessarily be put back, says Bridgewater. “But we can produce something, a system that will produce ecosystem services at a better range and a better quality and more regularly than the systems that we've destabilised.”

Bridgewater adds: “Given the speed of climate change, and not just climate but hydrology and all the other associated global changes, we need to be thinking about what we want. What we want out of our ecosystems are actually services.

“We need to think actually in multi-dimensions … to develop a whole new way of thinking as to how we manage the landscape. And in a way, the whole Loess plateau project is a good example of that, [even if] that wasn't the way of thinking at the start.”

Lu FuChin, a former farmer, told the official state news outlet Xinhua that the programme had boosted local employment. “I used to cut trees for firewood, but now I grow them instead,” said the 52-year-old forestry worker. “It used to be that people had to go far for work, but now they can find employment by the Yellow River. As the environment is improving, I believe the villagers' lives will become more prosperous too.”

Iraq's Prime Minister announced that the leader of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been killed, calling him as "one of the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and the world."

Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rufayi, also known as Abu Khadija was killed by Iraqi security forces, with the support of the US-led coalition, Iraq Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani informed on Friday.

Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rufayi "was considered one of the most dangerous terrorists in Iraq and the world", Sudani said in a post on X.

The Islamic State ruled with a hardline Islamist approach over millions of people in Syria and Iraq for several years and is now attempting to make a comeback in the Middle East, the West, and Asia.

In 2014, former ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared a caliphate over at least a quarter of Iraq and Syria, before he was killed in a raid by US special forces in northwest Syria in 2019, which led to the group's collapse.

The US Central Command reported last July that the group has been attempting to rebuild itself after several years of diminished capabilities.

The command based its assessment on ISIS's claim of launching 153 attacks in Iraq and Syria during the first half of 2024, suggesting a trend that could see the group "more than double" its attacks compared to the previous year.

Over the years the terrorist organisation has faced a number of challenges in leadership and recently the death of their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019.

Since then, the leadership of ISIS has been in a state of disorder with several of his successors being killed shortly after ascending to the position.

Nonetheless, ISIS still presents a significant security risk through its branches and connections in the Middle East and other regions.

Betar US is among far-right groups supporting Trump effort to deport students involved in pro-Palestinian protests

A far-right group that claimed credit for the arrest of a Palestinian activist and permanent US resident who the Trump administration is seeking to deport claims it has submitted “thousands of names” for similar treatment.

Betar US is one of a number of rightwing, pro-Israel groups that are supporting the administration's efforts to deport international students involved in university pro-Palestinian protests, an effort that escalated this week with the arrest of Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who recently completed his graduate studies at Columbia University.

This week, Donald Trump said Khalil's arrest was just “the first of many to come”. Betar US quickly claimed credit on social media for providing Khalil's name to the government.

Betar, which has been labelled an extremist group by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), a Jewish advocacy group, said on Monday that it had “been working on deportations and will continue to do so”, and warned that the effort would extend beyond immigrants. “Expect naturalized citizens to start being picked up within the month,” the group's post on X read. (It is very difficult to revoke US citizenship, though Trump has indicated an intention to try.)

The group has compiled a so-called “deportation list” naming individuals it believes are in the US on visas and have participated in pro-Palestinian protests, claiming these individuals “terrorize America”.

A Betar spokesperson, Daniel Levy, said in a statement to the Guardian that Betar submitted “thousands of names” of students and faculty they believe to be on visas from institutions like Columbia, the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA, Syracuse University and others to representatives of the Trump administration.

The group claims to have “documentation, including tapes, social media and more” to support their actions. It claims to be sharing names with several high-ranking officials, including the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; the White House homeland security adviser, Stephen Miller; and the attorney general, Pam Bondi, among others.

The White House and state department did not respond to questions about whether they are working with Betar or other groups to identify students for deportation.

Ross Glick, who was the executive director of the US chapter of Betar until last month, told the Guardian that the list began forming last fall. He noted that when they started compiling names, it was unclear who the next president would be, but that the change in administrations had been beneficial to their initiative.

During the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to deport foreign students involved in pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses and frequently framed demonstrations against Israel's actions in Gaza as expressions of support for Hamas. Last week, it was reported that the US state department plans to use AI to identify foreign students for deportation.

The arrest of Khalil last week, who served as a lead negotiator for the Gaza solidarity encampment at Columbia University, aligned with Trump's executive order aimed at combatting antisemitism. An accompanying fact sheet pledged the administration would cancel the student visas of those identified as “Hamas sympathizers” and deport those who participated in “pro-jihadist protests”.

After the election, Glick said he met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including the Democratic senator John Fetterman and aides to the Republican senators Ted Cruz and James Lankford, all of whom, he said, supported the efforts.

In a phone call this week, Glick said he discussed Khalil with Cruz in Washington DC just days before he was arrested.

Cruz's office did not respond to a request for comment on the meeting with Glick.

Glick said that the individuals on Betar's list were identified through tips from students, faculty and staff on these campuses, along with social media research. He also claimed he had received support from “collaborators” who use “facial recognition AI-based technology” to help identify protesters that can even identify people wearing face coverings. He declined to elaborate on the specific technology used.

Glick mentioned that in recent months he had been inundated with messages from students, professors and university administrators across the country, all providing him with information on protesters' identities. He said that he vetted the legitimacy of those tips and that he believed Khalil and other pro-Palestinian protesters were “promoting the eradication, the destruction and the devolution of western civilization”.

Glick described Khalil as an “operative”. When asked who he was an operative for, he responded: “Well, that has to be determined.”

Khalil is being held in a Louisiana detention center after being moved from New York. His detention is being challenged in a Manhattan federal court.

The arrest has sparked outrage and alarm from free-speech advocates who see the move to deport Khalil as a flagrant violation of his free speech rights and on Wednesday, protests erupted outside the Manhattan courthouse, where hundreds gathered demanding his freedom.

Betar is not alone in its efforts to support Trump's deportation campaign, an effort that has divided American Jews in whose name the administration is purporting to act.

In the days leading up to his arrest, videos featuring Khalil and others at a sit-in at Barnard against the expulsion of two students who disrupted a class on Israel began circulating on social media.

Pro-Israel social-media accounts, including that of Shai Davidai, a vocal assistant professor at Columbia's business school who was temporarily barred from campus last year after the school said he repeatedly intimidated and harassed university employees, identified Khalil and tagged Rubio in posts urging him to revoke his visa and deport him.

The video of Khalil that was circulating was first posted by Canary Mission, an online database that publishes the names and personal information of people that it considers to be anti-Israel or antisemitic, focusing mainly on those at universities across the US.

When Khalil was arrested, Canary Mission said that it was “delighted that our exposure of Mahmoud Khalil's hatred has led to such deserved consequences”, adding that it had “more Columbia news on its way”.

On Monday afternoon, Canary Mission released a video naming five other students and faculty it believes should be deported.

It was revealed this week by Zeteo that Khalil had emailed Columbia University the day before his arrest, appealing for protection and telling the university's interim president that he was being subjected to a “dehumanizing doxxing campaign” that week led by Davidai and David Lederer, a Columbia student.

“Their attacks have incited a wave of hate, including calls for my deportation and death threats,” Khalil said.

He added: “I haven't been able to sleep, fearing that Ice or a dangerous individual might come to my home. I urgently need legal support, and I urge you to intervene and provide the necessary protections to prevent further harm.”

In another email, Khalil reportedly cited a threatening post by Betar, in which the group claimed he said: “Zionists don't deserve to live.” Khalil “unequivocally” denied ever saying that.

In that post, Betar wrote that Ice⁩ was “aware of his home address and whereabouts” and said it had “provided all his information to multiple contacts”.

After the arrest, Karoline Leavitt, the spokesperson for the White House, said that Columbia University had been given the “names of other individuals who have engaged in pro-Hamas activity” but said that the school was “refusing to help DHS identify those individuals on campus”.

Khalil's arrest has divided American Jews, many of whom have harshly condemned the activist's arrest.

The ADL, a group that describes its focus as fighting antisemitism and all forms of hate and that is also known to view campus protests as antisemitic, welcomed the escalation and said it appreciated “the Trump administration's broad, bold set of efforts to counter campus antisemitism.

“Obviously, any deportation action or revocation of a Green Card or visa must be undertaken in alignment with required due process protections,” the group said. It added: “We also hope that this action serves as a deterrent to others who might consider breaking the law on college campuses or anywhere.”

But many mainstream, progressive and leftwing Jewish groups have condemned the administration's actions as a dangerous violation of free speech.

“It is both possible and necessary to directly confront and address the crisis of antisemitism, on campus and across our communities, without abandoning the fundamental democratic values that have allowed Jews, and so many others, to thrive here,” said Amy Spitalnick, head of the liberal Jewish Council for Public Affairs.

In a letter on Thursday to the US Department of Homeland Security, several groups including the New York Jewish Agenda, Aleph: Alliance for Jewish Renewal, Habonim Dror North America and others, said that they were “deeply disturbed by the circumstances surrounding the apprehension and detention of Mahmoud Khalil”.

“Irrespective of the content of Mr Khalil's speech, we firmly believe that his arrest does nothing to make Jews safer,” the groups said. “In the past, laws and policies that limit the right to free speech have often been wielded against the Jewish community, and we are worried that we are seeing signs that they are being wielded against Muslim, Arab, and other minority communities now.”

David Myers, a distinguished professor and the Sady and Ludwig Kahn chair in Jewish history at the University of California Los Angeles, told the Guardian he believed the Trump administration was instrumentalizing and weaponizing “antisemitism for political gain”.

“I think ultimately, [the administration] is interested in something larger than defending Jewish students, it's really interested in bringing the university to its knees as a way of removing a key liberal, progressive actor from the American political game,” he said.

Myers described Betar's decision to compile a list of people to be deported as “horrifying” but “not a total surprise”, he said, given what Betar has historically represented, which he called an “embrace of Jewish fascism”.

“I find it distasteful, un-Jewish and collaborationist to forge together lists of people who fail to meet a political litmus test,” Myers said.

He believes universities should resist pressure from the government and uphold the principles of fairness and democracy.

“It's a moment of reckoning about where one's values really lie,” he said.

“If universities submit, that's removing an extraordinarily important site of free and open thinking from the American political conversation. I think that would be very ominous for this country, a further step in the move towards a fully authoritarian regime.”

THE BBC has agreed a settlement with four of its female news presenters over employment tribunal claims including age and sex discrimination.

Presenters Martine Croxall, Karin Giannone, Kasia Madera and Annita McVeigh launched an employment tribunal against the BBC which was due to start next week, but will now not go ahead following the settlement.

In reaching a resolution there is no acceptance of liability by the BBC, the PA News agency understands.

Croxall, McVeigh and Madera alleged discrimination on the grounds of age, sex, being a union member and wages, while Giannone had alleged discrimination based on age, sex and wages.

Croxall, who has worked for the BBC since October 1991, has been a chief presenter with the BBC News Channel and BBC World News since 2001.

She has also appeared on BBC One network news bulletins.

Since March 2012, Madera has been a chief presenter with the BBC News Channel and BBC World News and also appeared on BBC1 network news bulletins.

McVeigh, who has worked for the BBC since October 1995, has been a chief presenter with the BBC News Channel and BBC World News, since 2006.

She has also appeared on BBC network news.

Giannone started working for the BBC in January 2005.

She became a permanent staff member in April 2008 and has been a chief presenter on BBC World News and the BBC News Channel.

A statement from BBC presenters Martine Croxall, Karin Giannone, Kasia Madera and Annita McVeigh said: “We can confirm that we have reached a resolution with BBC management that avoids the need for a tribunal hearing in respect of our employment-related claims.

“A protracted process lasting almost three years is now over.

“We've been deeply moved by the support we've received.”

JERUSALEM (AP) — Palestinian militant group Hamas said Friday that it has accepted a proposal from mediators to release one living American-Israeli hostage and the bodies of four dual nationals who had died in captivity. The Israeli prime minister's office cast doubt on the offer, accusing Hamas of trying to manipulate talks underway in Qatar on the next stage of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. 

Hamas, which rules over what remains of the Gaza Strip, didn't immediately specify when the release of soldier Edan Alexander and the four bodies would take place — or what it expected to get in return.

Alexander was 19 when he was abducted from his base on the border with Gaza in southern Israel during Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023 that sparked the war, which has been the deadliest and most destructive fighting ever between Israel and Hamas.

It wasn't clear which mediators proposed what Hamas was discussing. Egypt, Qatar and the U.S. have been guiding negotiations, and none had confirmed making the suggestion as of Friday night. 

U.S. officials, including envoy Steve Witkoff, said Friday that they had presented a proposal Wednesday to extend the ceasefire a few more weeks as the sides negotiate a permanent truce. The officials said in a statement that Hamas was claiming flexibility in public while privately making “entirely impractical” demands.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said that Israel had “accepted the Witkoff outline and showed flexibility,” but that Hamas was refusing to do so.

“At the same time, it continues to use manipulation and psychological warfare — the reports about Hamas' willingness to release American hostages are intended to sabotage the negotiations,” read a letter from the government to hostage families.

It added that Israel's negotiating team would return Friday from Qatar's capital, Doha. Netanyahu said that he plans to convene his ministerial team Saturday night to hear from the negotiators and decide on the next steps. 

Hamas, meanwhile, sent a delegation to Cairo to discuss the ceasefire negotiations with Egyptian officials. 

Hamas official Husam Badran reaffirmed Friday what he said was the group's commitment to fully implementing the ceasefire agreement in all its phases. He warned that any Israeli deviation from the terms would return negotiations to square one.

The White House announced last week that American officials had engaged in “ongoing talks and discussions” with Hamas, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with the militant group. That prompted a terse response from Netanyahu's office.

The U.S. said Friday that under its proposal, Hamas would release Alexander and other living hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and increased humanitarian aid to Gaza. The militants were told that the proposal would have to be accepted soon, the U.S. statement said, adding that delay would not pay off for Hamas. 

The first phase of the ceasefire ended two weeks ago, but the pause in fighting has held — if tensely — for now. The initial phase allowed the return of 25 living hostages and the remains of eight others in exchange for the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.

Israeli forces have withdrawn to buffer zones inside Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have returned to northern Gaza and hundreds of trucks of aid entered daily until Israel cut off supplies to the territory's 2 million people two weeks ago. 

Hamas is believed to be holding 24 living hostages and the bodies of 35 others.

The Hostage Families Forum, which represents most captives' families, said Friday it welcomed plans for any releases, but “without a comprehensive deal, we risk sealing the fate of all remaining hostages.” 

Israel has been urging Hamas to release half of the remaining hostages in return for an extension of the first phase, and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. The supply cutoff came as Israel pressed the militants to agree. About 80% of Gaza's residents have lost access to food sources, and 90% can't access clean drinking water, according to the Hamas-run government media office in Gaza.

Hamas wants to start negotiations on the ceasefire's more difficult second phase, which would entail the release of the remaining hostages, the withdrawal of Israeli forces and a lasting peace.

The developments came as Jews began celebrating the Purim holiday, and Muslims continued marking the holy month of Ramadan. Around 80,000 Muslim worshippers prayed Friday at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound, according to the Islamic Trust, which monitors the site. Israel is allowing only men over age 55 and women over 50 to enter from the occupied territory.

“The conditions are extremely difficult,” said Yousef Badreen, a Palestinian who left the southern West Bank city of Hebron at dawn to make it to Jerusalem. “We wish they will open it for good.”

Hamas accused Israel of escalating a “religious war” against Palestinians, casting the Al-Aqsa restrictions as “systematic targeting of Muslim religious practices.” The Israeli government didn't immediately respond.

Liberal party leader Mark Carney was sworn in as Canada's new prime minister on Friday amid a raging trade dispute with neighbouring United States triggered by President Donald Trump.

Carney (59) replaced Justin Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January and remained the caretaker prime minister until the Liberal Party elected a new leader.

The former head of the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England was officially sworn in during a ceremony in Ottawa on Friday. Francois-Philippe Champagne will be his finance minister as Dominic LeBlanc was shifted to manage international trade amid a raging tariff dispute with Trump. Melanie Joly will continue as foreign minister, and David McGuinty will remain the public safety minister.

Carey was chosen overwhelmingly by the Liberal Party as the prime minister without a single term at the House of Commons or Senate. The former banker is widely expected to trigger a general election in the coming days or weeks.

The opinion polls have indicated a slide in the popularity of the Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, which lost its early lead in recent weeks. The ruling party's rebound was attributed to Trudeau's resignation in January. Carey hopes to ride the momentum and secure a stable term amid threats of further tariffs and annexation from Donald Trump.

The US president has vowed to use “economic force” to make Canada a US state and has slapped steep tariffs, which drew immediate and proportional retaliation from Trudeau's government. Economic uncertainty triggered by tariffs has hampered businesses and spending plans, Bloomberg reported.

Carney has expressed willingness to meet Trump if he shows “respect for Canadian sovereignty″ and is willing to take a common approach over trade disputes. 

He has also touted achievements in his banking career to establish himself as a leader in uncertain times. During his first year as Bank of Canada governor, he slashed interest rates to almost zero to deal with the 2008 global financial crisis. As Bank of England governor, he also helped steer the UK economy during the turmoil of Brexit.

Mark Carney was sworn in as Canada's prime minister on Friday in Ottawa. Carney took oath in the office in the presence of General Mary Simon, the personal representative of King Charles.

In light of the deteriorating relations with the US under President Donald Trump's administration, his leadership marks a significant change in the country's political landscape. Carney, a 59-year-old former governor of the Bank of Canada and Bank of England, took the oath in both English and French, pledging allegiance to King Charles III and vowing to serve as a "faithful and true servant to his majesty".

Carney's defeated his rivals on Sunday in a race to become leader of the ruling Liberal Party, despite lacking prior political experience. This unprecedented move has sparked interest, especially given Carney's background in navigating complex economic crises. His first major challenge will be addressing the strained US-Canada relations, which have hit an all-time low.

To tackle this, Carney plans to reshape his cabinet, with Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc shifting to the international trade portfolio and Innovation Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne taking over as finance minister. This strategic move aims to bolster Canada's alliances in Europe, particularly in London and Paris, where Carney is scheduled to visit next week.

Carney replaces Justin Trudeau, who served as prime minister for over nine years. Carney's outsider status, combined with his experience in managing crises, was seen as a major factor in his victory.

In a statement, Carney emphasised his commitment to defending Canadian sovereignty, saying he would only meet with Trump "when there is respect for Canadian sovereignty." He also reiterated his intention to maintain retaliatory tariffs on US goods until the US demonstrates respect for Canada.

Efforts are currently underway to arrange a call between Trump and Carney, according to Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly.

Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte failed to attend in person at the International Criminal Court on Friday at the opening of the crimes against humanity hearing over his deadly crackdown on narcotics.

The 79-year-old, the first ex-Asian head of state to face charges at the ICC, followed by videolink during a short hearing to inform him of the crimes he is alleged to have committed, as well as his rights as a defendant.

Sounding frail and wearing a blue suit and tie, he spoke briefly to confirm his name and date of birth. Presiding Judge Iulia Motoc allowed him to follow proceedings in absentia due to his long flight to The Hague.

His lawyer Salvador Medialdea told the court his client had been "abducted from his country."

"He was summarily transported to The Hague. To lawyers it's extrajudicial rendition. For less legal minds it's pure and simple kidnapping," said Medialdea.

Medialdea also said Duterte was suffering "debilitating medical issues," adding: "Other than to identify himself, he is not able to contribute to this hearing."

Duterte appeared sleepy during the proceedings, closing his eyes frequently for long periods.

But Motoc told Duterte: "The court doctor was of the opinion that you were fully mentally aware and fit". She set a date of September 23 for the next stage of the process, a hearing to confirm the charges.

Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed thousands.

In the prosecutor's application for his arrest, he said Duterte's alleged crimes were "part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in the Philippines."

"Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated," the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs.

Victims' families have welcomed the trial as a chance for justice, while Duterte supporters believe he was "kidnapped" and sent to The Hague amid a spectacular fall-out with the ruling Marcos family.

A group of family members, lawyers and human rights activists was to gather in Manila to watch a livestream of the ICC hearing, said organisers Rise Up and the Duterte Accountability Campaign Network.

- 'Kill all of you' -

According to international law experts, his whirlwind arrest and surrender to the ICC offers a welcome boon to the embattled court, which is being attacked from all sides and sanctioned by the United States.

"I see the arrest and handing over of Duterte as a gift at an important moment in time," Willem van Genugten, Professor of International Law at Tilburg University in The Netherlands, told AFP.

Earlier Friday, his daughter Sara Duterte, vice president of the Philippines, said she had submitted a last-minute bid to get the hearing moved.

"We are praying and hoping that the court will grant our request to move the initial appearance just so that we can properly sit down with the former president and discuss the legal strategies since we haven't talked to him yet," she told AFP outside the court.

Duterte supporters gathered outside the hulking glass building in the Hague shouting "bring him home."

But Ecel Sandalo, an anti-Duterte demonstrator, told AFP the fact the former president was on trial had given him "hope that despite all the injustices in the world, there are still small victories that we can celebrate."

As he landed in The Hague, the former leader appeared to accept responsibility for his actions, saying in a Facebook video: "I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible."

In his application for arrest, the prosecutor quotes from some of Duterte's pronouncements when he was running for president.

He is cited as saying the number of criminal suspects killed "will become 100,000... I will kill all of you" and the fish in Manila Bay "will become fat because that's where I will throw you."

At the confirming of charges hearing, a suspect can challenge the prosecutor's evidence.

Only after that will the court decide whether to press ahead with a trial, a process that could take several months or even years.

	More than 50 universities are being investigated for alleged racial discrimination as part of President Donald Trump's campaign to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs that his officials say exclude white and Asian American students.


	The Education Department announced the new investigations on Friday, one month after issuing a memo warning America's schools and colleges that they could lose federal money over race-based preferences in admissions, scholarships or any aspect of student life.


	Students must be assessed according to merit and accomplishment, not prejudged by the colour of their skin, Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement. We will not yield on this commitment.


	Most of the new inquiries are focused on colleges' partnerships with the PhD Project, a nonprofit that helps students from under-represented groups get degrees in business with the goal of diversifying the business world.


	Department officials said that the group limits eligibility based on race and that colleges that partner with it are engaging in race-exclusionary practices in their graduate programmes.


	The group of 45 colleges facing scrutiny over ties to the PhD Project include major public universities such as Arizona State, Ohio State and Rutgers, along with prestigious private schools like Yale, Cornell, Duke and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.


	A message sent to the PhD Project was not immediately returned.


	Six other colleges are being investigated for awarding impermissible race-based scholarships, the department said, and another is accused of running a programme that segregates students on the basis of race.


	Those seven are: Grand Valley State University, Ithaca College, the New England College of Optometry, the University of Alabama, the University of Minnesota, the University of South Florida and the University of Tulsa School of Medicine.


	The department did not say which of the seven was being investigated for allegations of segregation.


	The February 14 memo from Trump's Republican administration was a sweeping expansion of a 2023 Supreme Court decision that barred colleges from using race as a factor in admissions.

US and Israel reportedly contacted officials in Sudan, Somalia and Somaliland 

Sudanese officials say they have rejected a request from the US to discuss taking in Palestinians displaced from Gaza under Donald Trump's plan to turn the territory into a “Riviera on the Mediterranean”.

According to an Associated Press report, the US and Israel contacted officials in Sudan, Somalia and Somaliland about resettling uprooted Palestinians. The contacts suggested both countries are determined to press ahead with Trump's proposal despite international outrage and massive practical difficulties – or at least use the plan to force other actors in the region to come up with their own ideas for Gaza when hostilities finally end.

Two officials from war-torn Sudan confirmed to the Associated Press that the Trump administration had approached the military-led government about accepting Palestinians.

One said the contacts began even before Trump's inauguration with offers of military assistance in the army's fight against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, assistance with postwar reconstruction and other incentives. Both officials said the Sudanese government rejected the idea. “This suggestion was immediately rebuffed,” said one official. “No one opened this matter again.”

Ahmed Moalim Fiqi, Somalia's foreign minister, did not confirm or deny any requests from Israel or the US but said Somalia rejected any plan that would involve the use of its territory for the resettlement of other populations or would undermine the Palestinian people's right to live peacefully on their ancestral land.

Under Trump's plan, Gaza's more than 2 million residents would be permanently displaced to allow massive reconstruction as a high-end “international” leisure and business destination. Experts said any forced resettlement was illegal under international law.

Initially, Egypt and Jordan were suggested as destinations for displaced Palestinians, but both strenuously opposed the plan. 
 Palestinians in Gaza have also rejected the proposal and dismiss Israeli claims that the departures would be voluntary. Arab nations have offered an alternative multibillion-dollar reconstruction plan that would leave the Palestinians in place.

The White House says Trump “stands by his vision”.

Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a secret diplomatic initiative, US and Israeli officials also described to the Associated Press news agency contacts with Somalia and the breakaway Somaliland region. They said it was unclear how much progress the efforts made or at what level the discussions took place.

Outreach from the US and Israel to the three potential destinations began last month, days after Trump floated the Gaza plan, according to the US officials, who said that Israel was taking the lead in the discussions.
 Israeli officials and the White House have declined to comment on the efforts. The offices of Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and Ron Dermer, the Israeli minister who has been leading Israel's postwar planning, also had no comment.
 Netanyahu has hailed Trump's proposal as a “bold vision”, while Bezalel Smotrich, Israel's far-right finance minister and a longtime advocate of what he calls “voluntary” emigration of Palestinians, has recently said that Israel was working to identify countries to take in Palestinians.

International legal experts have told the Guardian that, given the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, any such emigration could be unlawful and potentially constitute a war crime.

Sudan was among the four Abraham accord nations that agreed to normalise diplomatic relations with Israel in 2020 but was plunged almost immediately into a civil war marked by widespread atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the UN and rights groups.

US officials, seemingly aware that few Palestinians would be keen to relocate to such a precarious state, attempted to sweeten any deal by offering a range of incentives to Sudan's government, including an offer of assistance to the army in its fight against the RSF which, in turn, is backed by the United Arab Emirates, a significant US ally.

The proposal, if accepted, would have meant the US backing a side it has accused of war crimes and joining the same side in the conflict as Russia, at a time when Vladimir Putin is contemplating the American proposal for a ceasefire in Ukraine.

Before the revelations, Sudan had already indicated it would not entertain any attempt to resettle Palestinians in a country coping with the world's worst humanitarian crisis. The head of Sudan's army and de facto president, Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan – subject of the US sanctions – last week told a summit in Cairo that his country “categorically rejects” any plan that aims to transfer “the brotherly Palestinians from their land under whatever justification or name”.

The Guardian has contacted Sudan's ministry of foreign affairs for comment.

Somaliland, a territory of more than 3 million people in the Horn of Africa, seceded from Somalia more than 30 years ago, but it is not internationally recognised as an independent state.

An American official involved in the efforts confirmed to the Associated Press that the US was “having a quiet conversation with Somaliland about a range of areas where they can be helpful to the US in exchange for recognition”.
 An official in Somaliland, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media, said his government had not been approached and was not in talks about taking in Palestinians.
 Somalia is an even more unlikely destination. Mogadishu has been a vocal supporter of the Palestinians, and joined the recent Arab summit that rejected Trump's plan. A Somali official told the Associated Press the country had not been approached about taking in Palestinians from Gaza and there had been no discussions about it.

In recent years, Somalia has developed strong ties with Arab states and with Turkey. Much of the country is ruled by al-Shabaab, an extremist Islamist militia allied with al-Qaida.

Chuck Schumer supports bill, but AOC and Nancy Pelosi warn against Republican legislation as shutdown looms

Prominent Democrats are at odds over whether to support a bill to fund the government, with the Senate set to vote on the legislation on Friday as a government shutdown looms at midnight.

The California Democratic representative and former House speaker Nancy Pelosi came out against the continuing resolution (CR) on Friday after the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, announced on Thursday he would urge Senate Democrats to advance the bill. Schumer argued that allowing a government shutdown would be “a far worse option” than passing the “deeply partisan” Republican legislation, but Pelosi called the bill a “devastating assault on the wellbeing of working-class families”.

“Democratic senators should listen to the women,” she said in a statement. “Appropriations leaders Rosa DeLauro and Patty Murray have eloquently presented the case that we must have a better choice: a four-week funding extension to keep government open and negotiate a bipartisan agreement. America has experienced a Trump shutdown before – but this damaging legislation only makes matters worse.”

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also condemned Schumer for caving to Republican demands on a government funding bill, saying the move had created a “deep sense of outrage and betrayal” among Democrats.

Speaking to reporters in Leesburg, Virginia, where House Democrats were gathered for their annual policy retreat, Ocasio-Cortez said she was mobilizing Democratic supporters to push Schumer to oppose what she characterized as an “acquiesce” to the GOP bill.

“We have time to correct course on this decision. Senate Democrats can vote no,” the New York Democrat said.

The rift has reportedly sparked such anger among House Democrats that some are encouraging Ocasio-Cortez to challenge Schumer in a primary election, according to CNN. When asked about these suggestions, she declined to comment.

On Thursday, Schumer said on the Senate floor: “The Republican bill is a terrible option. But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.”

Trump praised Schumer on Truth Social, writing: “Congratulations to Chuck Schumer for doing the right thing – Took ‘guts' and courage!”

Schumer reiterated his support for the spending bill on the Senate floor on Friday, warning that a government shutdown would mean that Trump, Elon Musk and the so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) would be free to make even more disruptive cuts to federal agencies.

“If government were to shut down, Doge has a plan in place to exploit the crisis for maximum destruction,” Schumer said. “A shutdown will allow Doge to shift into overdrive. It would give Donald Trump and Doge the keys to the city, state and country. Donald Trump and Elon Musk would be free to destroy vital government services at a much faster rate than they can right now and over a much broader field of destruction that they would render.”

But the Federal Unionists Network, a group of federal employees that opposes the administration's campaign to dramatically downsize government, disagreed, saying the funding bill under consideration would make the situation worse.

“Once again, Congress is failing in its responsibility to the American people,” spokesperson Chris Dols said in a statement. “If passed, this CR will give Trump and Musk the power to complete their assault on federal workers.”

The Senate majority leader, John Thune, a Republican, told reporters on Friday that he may allow some amendment votes on the spending bill, which could potentially offer a way to assuage Democrats' concerns.

The funding bill represents the first major leverage point in Trump's second term, with House Democrats urging the Senate to instead consider a 30-day funding stopgap to allow more time for negotiations.

Unlike the House vote, where all but one Democrat voted against the government funding bill, the response in the Senate is fractured. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, and the Kentucky senator Rand Paul is expected to vote against the bill. If that is the case, eight Democratic votes will be needed to send the bill to Trump's desk.

While facing intense pressure from within their party to resist Trump and his billionaire ally Musk, the Senate Democrats who are leaning yes are worried about the impacts of a government shutdown, and what bill they could get passed from their minority position anyway.

The yes crowd includes the Pennsylvania senator John Fetterman, who told MSNBC on Tuesday: “We don't agree with what's been sent to us but, you know, if we withhold our votes, that is going to shut the government down.”

Still, Ocasio-Cortez particularly criticized Senate Democrats for even considering withdrawing support from a vote that nearly all battleground House Democrats were willing to take.

“There are members of Congress who have won Trump-held districts in some of the most difficult territory in the United States who walked the plank and took innumerable risks in order to defend the American people,” she said. “Just to see Senate Democrats even consider acquiescing to Elon Musk, I think, is a huge slap in the face.”

Steve Witkoff, the special envoy of US President Donald Trump, landed on Friday morning in the capital of Azerbaijan after an overnight visit to Moscow, in what appears to be a well-coordinated diplomatic move between Israel, the US, and Azerbaijan.According to a report by the official Russian news agency RIA, Witkoff's plane departed from Vnukovo Airport in Moscow around 2:00 a.m. and arrived in Baku within a few hours. Although the Kremlin has not officially confirmed it, various sources claim that a closed meeting took place between Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Sources involved in Israeli-Azeri relations reveal that coordination for the visit became particularly intensive after March 5, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emphasized his commitment to the trilateral partnership between the countries in the Knesset.Meanwhile, a significant letter from senior rabbis to President Trump, calling for the expansion of the Abraham Accords and strengthening the strategic alliance between Israel, the US, and Azerbaijan, led to considerable resonance in political and diplomatic corridors. The letter directly influenced the preparations for the visit to Baku.

Mark Carney says Canada will "never" become part of the US in his first speech as the country's prime minister

The new PM, who is facing a stand off with Donald Trump over an escalating trade war, says he "expects respect" from America and calls US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's latest comments on a 51st state "crazy"

Carney says he will visit France and the UK on his first overseas trip in the job, adding that he currently has "no plans" to meet Trump but "looks forward" to speaking to him

Asked about when a general election can be expected in Canada, the PM declines to say when it will be called, joking that Canadians can expect to vote before November. The election must be held before October

Canada's new prime minister: 'We will never' be part of the US

Edited by Brandon Livesay, Caitlin Wilson and Alys Davies

Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre starts off by wishing farewell to former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. He says it is time to take back control of the economy, strengthen the country's border and the military.

He says it's time to become a stronger, more independent and sovereign country, while accusing new Prime Minister Mark Carney of doing "exactly what [President] Trump wants". 

Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre is now speaking, in response to Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech earlier today.

Stick with us, we'll bring the latest as it happens.

Yves-Francois Blanchet, the leader of Bloc Québecois, is now speaking to reporters. 

He says the new set of ministers are there to "send a message" to Canadians, and collaborating with them will be important. 

But Blanchet says he has "the right to wonder who exactly will be speaking for Quebec". 

Reacting to the new cabinet, leader of the left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP) Jagmeet Singh says Mark Carney is sending a message to progressive Liberals that there is no room for them in the party under his leadership. 

He criticises Carney for not creating separate cabinet portfolios for minister of women, youth, or people with disabilities. 

Singh also criticised him for not having a minister of labour (there is, however, a Minister of Jobs and Families). 

"He might say it's just the name, well the name means something," Singh says, calling it a "problematic" omission. 

Singh also criticised Carney as someone who has made billionaires "very rich at the cost of workers".

Jessica MurphyReporting from Toronto

In his first media appearance as prime minister, Mark Carney sought to paint his government as one of action - ready to hit the ground running as Canada faces an escalating trade war with the US, its closest ally and largest trade partner. 

He said he would be heading in the coming days to the UK and France as the country seeks to deepen ties with "reliable" - a word he underscored - trade partners. 

But it's clear Canada will soon head into a general election. Carney took a few open jabs at the Conservatives, who are currently polling slightly ahead, or even, with the Liberals. 

Asked directly about election plans, Carney was more coy. He gave a nod to the fact that, by law, there must be an election by October, but added that in the coming days he would have more to say about getting "as strong a mandate that is needed for the time". 

This was a get to know you news conference - generally friendly as reporters queried Carney on major issues, like how he would handle Trump. 

But the job will only get more challenging from here. 

Soon, we'll be hearing from Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, who is expected to respond to Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech. 

Stick with us, we'll bring the latest as it happens.

As Canada's new prime minister, Mark Carney will inherit the country's response on a number of key global and domestic issues. 

Here is where he stands on some of them:

And with that, we've finished the news conference with Canada's new
Prime Minister Mark Carney.

Stick with us for more updates, including from Conservative
Party leader Pierre Poilivre. 

Carney is asked again about US-Canada relations.

Carney says he "looks forward" to speaking with
President Trump.

The prime minister says he understands Trump's agenda and the
goal of getting rid of the "scourge" of fentanyl, which affects
Canada as well.

But he wants Trump to understand the importance the country puts
on Canadian jobs and workers.

Carney says his cabinet has many familiar faces from the previous
government, but it is smaller.

He says the smaller team is more focussed and everybody in it is
"senior".

One of the top issues is the trade war "crisis" with
the US, he says, and so keeping some continuity from the previous government is
very important.

Carney delivers his first barb as prime minister towards his
political opponent, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.

Asked about the value of his assets that were recently placed in
a blind trust, Carney notes that "by definition, you don't know the assets
because the trustees take over that responsibility."

But he adds: "I'd like to assure you that the assets I have
were earned through employment income."

"Employment in the private sector is something the leader
of the opposition has never experienced," he remarks - a dig at Poilievre,
who has been a member of Parliament since the age of 25.

A French-speaking reporter asks Carney about the change of the
ministerial portfolio of Canadian Heritage to Canadian Culture and Identity.

The new PM says the change is about strengthening Canadian identity,
with language at the centre of it.

He adds that the question of the country's identity is much
broader than just official languages - it also includes nature, oceans and
biodiversity.

"To ensure those things are protected and promoted."

Back to the election Canada has to hold before November and Carney
is asked where in the country will he choose to run. 

He is the first prime minister to never serve as a member of
Parliament, and must run for a seat once the election is called.

"Today is not the day to announce where I will run,"
Carney says.

Canada's new prime minister: 'We will never' be part of the US

Carney is now asked if he will be seeking reassurances in Europe
that Canada will never become the "51st state" of the US, as President
Trump has claimed recently.

"We will never, in any shape or form, be part of the
US," he tells the crowd, echoing similar remarks he has made previously.  

Carney says a ceremony like the swearing in today, and the group
of ministers behind him, are nothing like America's system of government.

"We are very fundamentally a different country,"
Carney says, adding that the country "expects respect" from America
and Trump.

Carney is now asked about when Canadians can expect to go to an
election.

He responds by joking they can expect to vote “before November”. The federal election must be held before October.

The news today, he adds, is the new Cabinet that stands behind
him.

"There will be other news in the coming days with respect
to ensuring that we have a stronger mandate,” he tells reporters. 

Staying on a US theme and Carney is asked about Secretary of
State Marco Rubio's comments this morning saying that "economically
speaking Canada would be better as the 51st state of the United States."

Rubio said this during a G7 foreign ministers' meeting that is
being held in Quebec.

"It's crazy," Prime Minister Carney says in response.
"That's all you can say."

Canada's new prime minister is now taking questions from
reporters. He is asked first if he has plans to go meet with President Donald
Trump in the US.

Carney replies saying he has plans to go to France and the UK to
meet with leaders there, and adds that reinforcing security and diversifying
trade partners is important.

Right now, he says, he has no plans to meet with Trump, but will
do so "at the appropriate moment".

Carney now says that protecting Canadian workers and their families "in the face of unjustified foreign trade actions" is one of two priorities his new government will focus on.

It's an apparent reference to US tariffs recently imposed by President Trump.

He then declares that "negativity wont win a trade war," or bring down the price of groceries, adding that the Canadian government is united and strong.

He says they will get to work immediately with a cabinet meeting to be held soon after this news conference.

Carney then moves on to take questions from the media.

Carney is talking about how the new government will approach its
leadership.

He says new ministers have new ideas and are ready to respond to
new threats and new opportunities.

Some of the economic goals, Carney says, are to grow more higher
paying jobs and improve affordability.

The new smaller team of ministers, Carney says, is "made to
meet the moment we are in".

Carney says the swearing in ceremony is a reflection of Canada
as a country that is "built on the bedrock of three peoples: Indigenous,
French and British."

"On these foundations, Canadians have built a dynamic
nation that celebrates its diversity, that cares for the vulnerable in society
and that always strives for a better tomorrow," he says.

He adds that his new cabinet is fully confident in its
responsibility to strengthen the foundation of Canada in the midst of the
crisis it faces, and to build a country that is "even better."

Thousands have fled into Lebanon after tensions between Syria's Alawite minority and forces backing the new government exploded last week.

MASSOUDIEH, Lebanon — The Syrian man was carrying his disabled 7-year-old son on his shoulders as the family arrived at a mosque just inside Lebanon to find shelter, fleeing the sectarian violence that erupted late last week in Syria's coastal region.

The boy clung to his mother's hand while his brother, 10, cradled a bandaged arm.

“The bullet went in one side and straight out the other,” the man said Wednesday, not long after reaching Massoudieh, a village less than a mile from the Syrian border. “Monsters,” he said, referring to those whom he accused of executing members of his Alawite minority. He spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals, like most others interviewed for this article.

Thousands of largely Alawite refugees have crossed into Lebanon over the past week after attacks on Syrian security forces by Alawite gunmen affiliated with the ousted regime of Bashar al-Assad triggered a surge of reprisals and sectarian bloodletting.

About 500 families have sought shelter in Massoudieh alone, according to local officials. Many of the refugees had waded across the Nahr el-Kabir river marking the border, hoisting their few possessions overhead.

The wave of killings in coastal Syria has posed the biggest test so far for the country's interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose forces overthrew Assad in December. He has accused “remnants of the former regime” of trying to drag Syria into renewed civil war and vowed to hold accountable those who have “overstepped the authority of the state.”

Sharaa has not named who was responsible for the violence. It remains unclear how much of the killing was carried out by government forces or loosely affiliated militias or Islamist extremists drawn to Syria during its 14-year civil war.

Syria has seen a proliferation of armed Sunni Muslim extremist groups that consider Alawites and some other minorities to be apostates, while many Syrians remain aggrieved by Alawites' support for Assad during his brutal rule. Sharaa, who was formerly affiliated with al-Qaeda, has yet to demonstrate that he is willing or able to control the gunmen who have targeted the Alawites.

Sharaa's pledge of accountability has done little to reassure the refugees.

“They say, ‘You are safe, don't worry,' and then they kill you,” said the man who had carried his son to Lebanon. “It's impossible to go back.”

He and his family fled their home in the coastal town of al-Sanobar on March 7 as masked gunmen approached, he recounted. Residents of a neighboring village had warned that executions had begun.

The family hid in a pine forest surrounding the town. His 10-year-old son was shot when gunmen opened fire into the trees. Local officials in al-Sanobar said they have documented 193 deaths in that town alone.

The fleeing family traveled 70 miles to Lebanon, walking and hitchhiking, avoiding security forces along the roads. “This is from all the walking,” the man said, pointing to the rubber sole peeling off his shoe. He said they are wearing the same clothes in which they fled.

Fadel Abdulghany, director of the Syrian Network for Human Rights, said armed groups loyal to the former Assad regime also had targeted civilians. He said these groups had taken control of neighborhoods and villages, and their snipers had targeted vehicles with license plates from Idlib — the governorate that Sharaa and his Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham movement had ruled before capturing the country.

The monitoring group said it has documented 803 deaths as of Wednesday, including 172 members of Syria's new police, military and other security forces. Members of the Assadist militias are not included in the count, which tallies only killings considered unlawful.

Many refugees in Massoudieh, a largely Alawite village, were reluctant to discuss the attacks by Alawite gunmen that set off clashes between Alawite militias and government forces, prompting a major deployment of security forces to the coast.

A couple from Dahlia, a village in Syria's Latakia province, where the clashes first erupted, said some people who had lived there were wanted by authorities. So the fighting that erupted was in “self-defense,” said the husband, sitting on the steps of a half-constructed house where his family is sheltering. Plastic film was taped over the unfinished windows to keep out the cold.

His 24-year-old wife was unabashed about her political stance. “We want Bashar al-Assad to come back,” she said of Syria's former president, whose image still adorns posters hung around her largely Alawite village.

Another man, sitting outside another half-built house, said he had no choice but to flee his village, Kartu, because his name was on a government wanted list of people suspected to be activists in Assad's Baath Party He dismissed the Alawite insurgency as “individual acts.”

Yet other refugees viewed the violence as an attempt at ethnic cleansing by Syria's new rulers.

“Why is this happening to us? It's because we are Alawites,” said a 24-year-old woman from the village of Tanita, where the Syrian government has said there were fierce clashes with armed groups.

She, her husband and their 5-year-old child share a small cinder-block structure erected in the yard of an old school with another family of 10. About 120 people are camped out in the school's classrooms and yard. Elsewhere in the village, private homes are teeming with refugees, and the local mosque is sleeping 305 families.

Lilian Hussein, 33, one of the few who was willing to be named, said government-aligned fighters who had been dispatched to the coast used the pretext that there were “remnants” of the regime to attack unarmed villagers. “We fled under gunfire,” she said. Her cousin was shot in the back, she said.

The pace of refugees crossing the river has slowed in recent days as the violence abates, according to smugglers who help families make the illegal crossing.

But refugees continued to arrive this week, scrambling from the Syrian side down the river's steep banks. Some led farm animals through the water. One woman, weak from exhaustion, had to be held up by relatives. A thick plume of smoke rose over Syria's Tartous province in the distance.

On Wednesday, many of the refugees were from Safita, about 10 miles from the border, and said they'd been unable to flee until now.

“There are a lot of armed men in our town. They didn't let people go in or out,” said a 45-year-old woman who crossed the knee-high waters with two relatives.

After civil war engulfed Syria following a popular uprising in 2011, Lebanon took in more than 1 million Syrian refugees. The vast majority of the refugees then were Sunni Muslims, who made up much of the movement against Assad. Today, the tides have shifted.

“We welcomed the earlier refugees, and we welcome these,” said Ali Alali, the mayor of Massoudieh. Outside his office, aid workers handed out mattresses and blankets to the newly arrived.

“People have seen their men, women and children slaughtered,” the mayor said. “After they were robbed of gold and money, they ask them, ‘What is your religion?'”

Some Syrians who fled said they had waited in hiding for days for the right moment to cross, fearing government patrols near the border.

“They shoot anybody that's not a Sunni,” a man from Safita said as he emerged from the river. “It's sectarian war.”

The latest: The covid wave this winter is less severe compared with previous years, with hospitalization rates down and wastewater levels lower.

Combined coronavirus and flu vaccine: A combined coronavirus-influenza vaccine may be on the horizon after Moderna's shot produced a higher immune response in older adults than separate vaccines for those viruses administered together. Moderna officials say the earliest that the combined vaccine could hit the market is the fall of 2025, pending regulatory approval.

Covid isolation guidelines: Americans who test positive for the coronavirus no longer need to routinely stay home from work and school for five days under new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Here are the latest guidelines.

        A raft of new national security measures was needed in response to China's increased efforts to undermine the island's security, says Taiwanese President William Lai Ching-te.
    

Taiwan's leader William Lai Ching-te has called China a "hostile foreign force" while setting out a raft of new national security measures.

In a speech on Thursday, the island's president said he would reinstate a military court system for crimes such as spying, and tighten residency criteria for those from China, Hong Kong and Macau.

His speech drew an immediate reaction from Beijing, who called Lai a "destroyer of cross-Straits peace" and a "creator of crisis". 

China views self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory, while Taiwan sees itself as a separate entity from the Chinese mainland. 

Lai explained that his measures came in response to a recent string of spying incidents involving China. 

"We need to step up our legal safeguards to prevent and detect such incidents," he said.

Beijing had tried to "subvert, obtain secrets, lure members of the armed forces and influence public opinion", Lai added.

A re-established military court system would see the prosecution of crimes including sedition, aiding the enemy, leaking confidential information, dereliction of duty and disobedience. 

On Wednesday, Taiwan's Defence Ministry confirmed that a retired air force major had leaked classified military intelligence to China in exchange for payment. 

Taiwan's government expelled the Chinese wife of a Taiwanese citizen this week, after the woman repeatedly posted short clips on social media praising Beijing's leadership and claiming China could conquer Taiwan in half an hour. 

The island has been bulking up its defences in response to Chinese expansionist rhetoric, including adding new missiles and US tanks and planes, along with self-made submarines. 

It also recently extended the length of mandatory national military service for all men from four months to one year.

Despite the growing criticism, Israel is standing firm in its attempt to banish the United Nations Relief and Works Agency from operating in its territory.Since its ban came into effect on January 30, Israeli authorities have severed coordination ties with the agency, shut down schools in east Jerusalem, and effectively forced international staff to leave.  The government's decision was largely driven by its expanding allegations that UNRWA employees hold links to terrorist organizations.The fallout has been swift. Countries such as the United States, Canada, New Zealand, and the European Union have suspended or withdrawn funding, citing concerns over neutrality. AdvertisementBeyond the political maneuvering and aid cuts, the issue has added fresh scrutiny to a decades-old debate that remains unresolved: Who qualifies as a Palestinian refugee? And should this status be inherited indefinitely – even by millionaires? UNDER UNRWA's unique framework, all descendants of Palestinian refugees “who lost both their home and means of livelihood... are eligible for refugee status,” regardless of wealth or nationality. Here, billionaire Zahwa Arafat poses in front of a portrait of her late father Yasser Arafat in 2011. (credit: MATTHEW MIRABELLI/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES)A refugee definition unlike any otherUNRWA was created shortly after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war to assist 750,000 Palestinians displaced by the conflict. Today, its registry lists over six million refugees. Critics argue that no other refugee group in the world operates with this mandate.“Unlike every other refugee crisis in history, Palestinian refugees don't decrease in number – they increase. UNRWA doesn't resettle, it perpetuates,” says Dina Rovner, legal adviser for UN Watch.​ “The result? A crisis that has lasted decades longer than any other.”   Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter   Subscribe Now  Among those classified as Palestinian refugees is Jordanian-American real estate mogul Mohamed Hadid and his five millionaire children, including supermodels Bella and Gigi Hadid. Twenty-nine-year-old Zahwa Arafat, the billionaire daughter of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, also retains this status. AdvertisementUnder UNRWA's unique framework, all descendants of Palestinian refugees “who lost both their home and means of livelihood in Mandate Palestine between 1946-1948 are eligible for refugee status,” regardless of wealth or nationality – a stark contrast to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which removes individuals from its registries once they are resettled or naturalized.UNRWA, though, asserts that Palestinian refugee status is determined by the UN General Assembly, not the agency itself.“Palestinian refugees were recognized under Resolution 194 before UNRWA existed, where human rights were not subjected to economic status,” says Jonathan Fowler, UNRWA's senior communications manager. “In mass displacements, refugee status applies collectively and passes through generations, as seen with Afghan, Sudanese, and Sahrawi refugees”  Yet, the difference is striking. After WWII, millions were displaced, primarily in Europe, but around 1.5 million were resettled by temporary UN agencies before UNHCR took over in 1952. In contrast, 77 years later, UNRWA remains a permanent institution, even as many, like the 2.4 million in Jordan who hold citizenship, continue receiving its assistance.This raises a pivotal question: Does UNRWA's approach maintain statelessness rather than resolving it?The debate over disparitiesThe controversy extends beyond definitions. Critics hold that UNRWA's budget and staff allocation raise questions about its efficiency compared to other refugee agencies.When first established, UNRWA's annual budget was 110 times greater than UNHCRs. Today, it employs 30,000 staff for nearly six million refugees – a 1:200 ratio. In contrast, UNHCR, which serves around 32 million refugees globally, operates with 20,000 staff, translating to one staff member per 1,600 refugees.“There is a clear inconsistency in how the world treats the Palestinians compared to other refugees,” says Rovner. “If they were under the UNHCR, the majority would not be considered eligible.”Fowler counters the criticism, explaining that UNRWA's economic and service model is fundamentally different and of significant value. “It was designed as a sustained relief and works program until a viable solution is achieved, much like the 1930s US Tennessee Valley Authority.” Moreover, he adds, “the value for money is extraordinary – hiring locals not only brings local benefits but also costs 40%-50% less than employing internationals.”UNRWA under fireAs the debate over refugee classification rages on, Israel's reports of UNRWA's connections to terrorism have also dominated recent discussions. Citing its intelligence findings, Israeli authorities maintain that 10% of the agency's senior educators in Gaza have ties to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.“UNRWA's response is always the same – to deflect, deny, and cover up. They never take responsibility. They claim to be a ‘humanitarian backbone' in Gaza but promote Hamas propaganda, like it did with the Gaza famine narrative, which has been totally debunked,” charges Rovner.However, there are also claims that UNRWA is being targeted politically, as Fowler indicates: “There's a barrage of misinformation about who we are and who we're not. We share all our staff lists with regional authorities, including Israel, and have never received pushback about specific employees before.”Despite Israel's push to dismantle UNRWA, many European nations have since reinstated funding after reviewing oversight measures and accounting for its critical humanitarian role. Fowler points to the recently commissioned and independent Colonna Report, which found UNRWA to have more robust neutrality standards than any other UN agency. Still, critics like Rovner, remain unconvinced, contending that the problem is systemic.What happens if UNRWA does disappear?With increasing calls within Israel and the United States to abolish UNRWA, the question arises: If UNRWA disappears, what happens next?Fowler says that the organization has no intention of existing indefinitely, but it continues so far as the situation remains unresolved.“Abolishing UNRWA ignores reality,” observes Fowler. “We are often thanked by Israeli authorities, albeit at the moment not so openly, for the work we do, because without us, the responsibility will fall on them.”The topic of reform has come up quite a lot where UNRWA and the UN at large are concerned. Some believe that redefining Palestinian refugees under UNHCR rules could force a shift in the political deadlock. Others, though, insist not only is it too little, too late for reforms, but that they are insufficient in addressing the deeper issues."As long as UNRWA exists, there will always be a Palestinian right-of-return narrative that keeps the conflict alive. Palestinians have to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their own future,” says Rovner.Questions without answersWith funding cuts, Israeli bans, and growing global pressure, UNRWA finds itself at a crossroads. Today, it is continuing to operate, even on a limited scale – holding that as long as millions remain classified as refugees, it has a job to do.Still, fundamental questions continue to go unanswered: Who should be classified a Palestinian refugee? Should refugee status be hereditary forever – even for those who live in luxury? Who should be responsible for the Palestinians? And what is Israel's role?With neither Israel disappearing nor the Palestinian refugee issue nearing resolution, UNRWA persists as a central fault line in one of the world's most protracted conflicts. Whether the agency serves as a crucial humanitarian lifeline or a political roadblock to lasting peace depends entirely on whom you ask.

AdvertisementUnder UNRWA's unique framework, all descendants of Palestinian refugees “who lost both their home and means of livelihood in Mandate Palestine between 1946-1948 are eligible for refugee status,” regardless of wealth or nationality – a stark contrast to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which removes individuals from its registries once they are resettled or naturalized.UNRWA, though, asserts that Palestinian refugee status is determined by the UN General Assembly, not the agency itself.“Palestinian refugees were recognized under Resolution 194 before UNRWA existed, where human rights were not subjected to economic status,” says Jonathan Fowler, UNRWA's senior communications manager. “In mass displacements, refugee status applies collectively and passes through generations, as seen with Afghan, Sudanese, and Sahrawi refugees”  Yet, the difference is striking. After WWII, millions were displaced, primarily in Europe, but around 1.5 million were resettled by temporary UN agencies before UNHCR took over in 1952. In contrast, 77 years later, UNRWA remains a permanent institution, even as many, like the 2.4 million in Jordan who hold citizenship, continue receiving its assistance.This raises a pivotal question: Does UNRWA's approach maintain statelessness rather than resolving it?The debate over disparitiesThe controversy extends beyond definitions. Critics hold that UNRWA's budget and staff allocation raise questions about its efficiency compared to other refugee agencies.When first established, UNRWA's annual budget was 110 times greater than UNHCRs. Today, it employs 30,000 staff for nearly six million refugees – a 1:200 ratio. In contrast, UNHCR, which serves around 32 million refugees globally, operates with 20,000 staff, translating to one staff member per 1,600 refugees.“There is a clear inconsistency in how the world treats the Palestinians compared to other refugees,” says Rovner. “If they were under the UNHCR, the majority would not be considered eligible.”Fowler counters the criticism, explaining that UNRWA's economic and service model is fundamentally different and of significant value. “It was designed as a sustained relief and works program until a viable solution is achieved, much like the 1930s US Tennessee Valley Authority.” Moreover, he adds, “the value for money is extraordinary – hiring locals not only brings local benefits but also costs 40%-50% less than employing internationals.”UNRWA under fireAs the debate over refugee classification rages on, Israel's reports of UNRWA's connections to terrorism have also dominated recent discussions. Citing its intelligence findings, Israeli authorities maintain that 10% of the agency's senior educators in Gaza have ties to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.“UNRWA's response is always the same – to deflect, deny, and cover up. They never take responsibility. They claim to be a ‘humanitarian backbone' in Gaza but promote Hamas propaganda, like it did with the Gaza famine narrative, which has been totally debunked,” charges Rovner.However, there are also claims that UNRWA is being targeted politically, as Fowler indicates: “There's a barrage of misinformation about who we are and who we're not. We share all our staff lists with regional authorities, including Israel, and have never received pushback about specific employees before.”Despite Israel's push to dismantle UNRWA, many European nations have since reinstated funding after reviewing oversight measures and accounting for its critical humanitarian role. Fowler points to the recently commissioned and independent Colonna Report, which found UNRWA to have more robust neutrality standards than any other UN agency. Still, critics like Rovner, remain unconvinced, contending that the problem is systemic.What happens if UNRWA does disappear?With increasing calls within Israel and the United States to abolish UNRWA, the question arises: If UNRWA disappears, what happens next?Fowler says that the organization has no intention of existing indefinitely, but it continues so far as the situation remains unresolved.“Abolishing UNRWA ignores reality,” observes Fowler. “We are often thanked by Israeli authorities, albeit at the moment not so openly, for the work we do, because without us, the responsibility will fall on them.”The topic of reform has come up quite a lot where UNRWA and the UN at large are concerned. Some believe that redefining Palestinian refugees under UNHCR rules could force a shift in the political deadlock. Others, though, insist not only is it too little, too late for reforms, but that they are insufficient in addressing the deeper issues."As long as UNRWA exists, there will always be a Palestinian right-of-return narrative that keeps the conflict alive. Palestinians have to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their own future,” says Rovner.Questions without answersWith funding cuts, Israeli bans, and growing global pressure, UNRWA finds itself at a crossroads. Today, it is continuing to operate, even on a limited scale – holding that as long as millions remain classified as refugees, it has a job to do.Still, fundamental questions continue to go unanswered: Who should be classified a Palestinian refugee? Should refugee status be hereditary forever – even for those who live in luxury? Who should be responsible for the Palestinians? And what is Israel's role?With neither Israel disappearing nor the Palestinian refugee issue nearing resolution, UNRWA persists as a central fault line in one of the world's most protracted conflicts. Whether the agency serves as a crucial humanitarian lifeline or a political roadblock to lasting peace depends entirely on whom you ask.

“Unlike every other refugee crisis in history, Palestinian refugees don't decrease in number – they increase. UNRWA doesn't resettle, it perpetuates,” says Dina Rovner, legal adviser for UN Watch.​ “The result? A crisis that has lasted decades longer than any other.”   Stay updated with the latest news!

This raises a pivotal question: Does UNRWA's approach maintain statelessness rather than resolving it?The debate over disparitiesThe controversy extends beyond definitions. Critics hold that UNRWA's budget and staff allocation raise questions about its efficiency compared to other refugee agencies.When first established, UNRWA's annual budget was 110 times greater than UNHCRs. Today, it employs 30,000 staff for nearly six million refugees – a 1:200 ratio. In contrast, UNHCR, which serves around 32 million refugees globally, operates with 20,000 staff, translating to one staff member per 1,600 refugees.“There is a clear inconsistency in how the world treats the Palestinians compared to other refugees,” says Rovner. “If they were under the UNHCR, the majority would not be considered eligible.”Fowler counters the criticism, explaining that UNRWA's economic and service model is fundamentally different and of significant value. “It was designed as a sustained relief and works program until a viable solution is achieved, much like the 1930s US Tennessee Valley Authority.” Moreover, he adds, “the value for money is extraordinary – hiring locals not only brings local benefits but also costs 40%-50% less than employing internationals.”UNRWA under fireAs the debate over refugee classification rages on, Israel's reports of UNRWA's connections to terrorism have also dominated recent discussions. Citing its intelligence findings, Israeli authorities maintain that 10% of the agency's senior educators in Gaza have ties to Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad.“UNRWA's response is always the same – to deflect, deny, and cover up. They never take responsibility. They claim to be a ‘humanitarian backbone' in Gaza but promote Hamas propaganda, like it did with the Gaza famine narrative, which has been totally debunked,” charges Rovner.However, there are also claims that UNRWA is being targeted politically, as Fowler indicates: “There's a barrage of misinformation about who we are and who we're not.

Others, though, insist not only is it too little, too late for reforms, but that they are insufficient in addressing the deeper issues."As long as UNRWA exists, there will always be a Palestinian right-of-return narrative that keeps the conflict alive. Palestinians have to step up to the plate and take responsibility for their own future,” says Rovner.Questions without answersWith funding cuts, Israeli bans, and growing global pressure, UNRWA finds itself at a crossroads. Today, it is continuing to operate, even on a limited scale – holding that as long as millions remain classified as refugees, it has a job to do.Still, fundamental questions continue to go unanswered: Who should be classified a Palestinian refugee? Should refugee status be hereditary forever – even for those who live in luxury? Who should be responsible for the Palestinians? And what is Israel's role?With neither Israel disappearing nor the Palestinian refugee issue nearing resolution, UNRWA persists as a central fault line in one of the world's most protracted conflicts. Whether the agency serves as a crucial humanitarian lifeline or a political roadblock to lasting peace depends entirely on whom you ask.

UNITED NATIONS — The conflict in Sudan has created the “largest and the most devastating humanitarian crisis in the world” as the warring parties lay siege to towns and block aid deliveries, top aid officials told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday.

The war erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule. The United Nations says that nearly two-thirds of Sudan's population – more than 30 million people – will need aid this year.



“The Rapid Support Forces, the Sudanese Armed Forces, and other parties to the conflict are not only failing to protect civilians – they are actively compounding their suffering,” said Christopher Lockyear, head of MSF (Doctors Without Borders).

The RSF denies blocking aid or harming civilians and attributes the activity to rogue actors. The RSF has said it would investigate allegations and bring perpetrators to justice.

The SAF also denies blocking aid or harming civilians. Sudan's U.N. Ambassador Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed told the Security Council that the Sudanese government has a national plan for the protection of civilians and added Lockyear did not raise any issues with him when they met privately.

Famine has taken hold in at least five locations in Sudan, where an estimated 1.3 million children under five live, the head of the U.N. children's agency UNICEF, Catherine Russell, told the Security Council.

“Over 3 million children under five are at imminent risk of deadly disease outbreaks, including cholera, malaria, and dengue, due to a failing health system,” she said.

Sudan's U.N. ambassador said the country's Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry confirmed this week the stability of the food situation.

Hundreds of boys and girls were also raped in 2024, Russell said, noting that in 16 recorded cases the children were under the age of five. She paused before adding: “Four were babies under the age of one.”

“The data only gives us a glimpse into what we know is a far larger, more devastating crisis,” Russell said, citing a database the UN said was compiled by Sudan-based groups helping survivors of sexual violence.

Lockyear said MSF teams had provided support for 385 survivors of sexual violence in 2024.

“The vast majority — including some younger than 5 — had been raped, often by armed men. Nearly half were assaulted while working in the fields. Women and girls are not merely unprotected; they are being brutally targeted,” he said.

A U.N. fact-finding mission reported in October that the RSF and allies have committed “staggering” levels of sexual abuse. The RSF has previously said it would investigate allegations and bring perpetrators to justice.

The U.S. determined in January that members of the RSF and allied militias committed genocide in Sudan.

Gaza's children lost over a year of education due to war damage, with many struggling to resume learning through rebuilt schools and online platforms.

For 15 months, Gaza's children were unable to attend school as the ongoing conflict left schools destroyed or repurposed as shelters for displaced families. 

The Israel-Hamas war has resulted in hundreds of thousands of children losing at least one academic year. 

Despite the devastating impact, efforts to rehabilitate schools began after the January ceasefire. 

"We're trying to salvage what we can of the educational process," said Mohamed al-Asouli, head of the education department in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis.

With 95% of schools damaged, 785,000 students have been affected, many struggling with online learning due to electricity and internet shortages.

            President Donald Trump rarely stops bragging about his “great relationship” with Vladimir Putin.
    


            A skeptical world will soon find out whether the supposed mind-meld counts for anything.
    


            The Russian president, author of an unprovoked and brutal invasion of Ukraine, responded in time-honored Moscow fashion Thursday to the US plan for an immediate ceasefire that the administration forced Kyiv into supporting. Putin produced a long set of obfuscations and new demands that would be unacceptable to Ukraine. But they may have been designed to tempt a US president who is desperate for the kind of win a truce would represent.
    


            Putin did not reject Trump's overture. He called it “great and correct” and said he supported it in principle. He was careful not to alienate a US president who has already offered a series of concessions to Russia before formal peace talks begin, including an understanding that Ukraine would never have a path to NATO membership.
    


            But Putin's objections and calls for further discussions, including with Trump, were an attempt to buy time, with his troops on the cusp of pushing Ukrainian forces out of Russia's Kursk region — one of the few bargaining chips Kyiv would have at future peace talks.
    


            Putin also raised questions about the monitoring  of any ceasefire, and whether Ukraine would be allowed to rearm during any cessation of fighting, in a way that suggested he was already seeking to shape any eventual agreement to ensure Russian dominance. Putin also referred to the need to tackle the “root causes” of the war. This is code for a number of Russian grievances that include the existence of a democratic government in Kyiv. It also refers to Moscow's claims that it is threatened by NATO expansion after the Cold War and to its desire to see alliance troops withdrawn from former communist states once in the Soviet Union's orbit, such as Poland and Romania.
    


            Russia's response is out of its classic diplomatic playbook, which typically seeks to suck interlocutors into exhausting negotiations that stack up delays and conditions that enable the Kremlin to pursue its strategic goals in the meantime.
    


            Thursday's events showed just how hard it will be for the Trump administration to move Russia away from its position and into serious negotiations on a ceasefire.
    


            Russia's stalling contrasted with Trump's rush for a valuable breakthrough as his trade policies set off stock market slumps and cast a cloud over the economy.  “I think we're going to be in very good shape to get it done. We want to get it over with,” Trump said at the Oval Office on Thursday, in an outburst of optimism that jarred with reality.
    


            Trump put the best spin on Putin's response, saying he'd issued a “very promising statement, but it wasn't complete.” He added: “Now we're going to see whether or not Russia's there. And if they're not, it will be a very disappointing moment for the world.” Trump's optimism was understandable as he seeks to build momentum for a fledgling diplomatic initiative. But his willingness to ignore a new set of onerous conditions from Putin made for a stark contrast with his fury when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky sat in the Oval Office and tried to explain why he wouldn't trust Russia's word in a peace deal without security guarantees.
    


            Retired Adm. James Stavridis said Thursday the Russian leader was staking out a careful line: “If you put it on a scale between ‘nyet,' ‘no,' and ‘da,' ‘yes,' he's right in the middle,” he told CNN's Jim Sciutto. Stavridis, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, said the Russian president would take a couple of punches from Trump but would not stop pressing toward his own goals.
    


            Trump repeated Thursday his frequent refrain that there is ocean between the continental US and the largest land war in Europe since World War II. Those closer to the threat are far less optimistic about America's peace proposals. “I am pessimistic and skeptical about Russia's intentions and Russia's will to proceed with a just and sustainable peace,” Latvian Defense Minister Andris Sprūds told Isa Soares on CNN International. He said that Russia was using its typical “salami” tactics to reach its strategic goals, namely by slicing up its overarching political goals and dealing with them “piece by piece.”
    


            Should Trump forge a lasting, sustainable peace in Ukraine, he will deliver a great achievement that might be worth the Nobel Peace Prize that he reportedly craves. More importantly, thousands of lives — Ukrainians and Russians — will be saved. There may also be some truth to the frequent claim of administration officials that only this president has a chance to end the war. While President Joe Biden rallied the Western alliance effectively to provide Ukraine with arms, ammunition and financial aid that saved its independence, there was never a track for peace talks with Putin, who was ostracized after his invasion of Ukraine three years ago.
    


            Trump may also be tapping into fatigue among many Americans at the cost of that support, although his claim that the US has spent $350 billion is a wild exaggeration. And some analysts believe that the new administration is only stating the obvious — that Ukraine will be unable to liberate eastern regions captured by Russia and Crimea, annexed by Putin in 2014. Furthermore, there's agreement, even among European governments that have sided with Zelensky after Trump's bullying, that some kind of partition will be needed to end the war.
    


            But Trump's excessive deference to Putin in his first term and his early praise for the invasion of Ukraine, along with his longtime fascination with the Russian leader, raise doubt about his motives in his push to quickly end the war. Since taking office for a second time, the president has strong-armed Zelensky in a notorious Oval Office photo op and switched official American government sympathies from the victim of a vicious onslaught to its perpetrator, Putin. The president cut off vital US intelligence-sharing that helps Ukraine on the battlefield and to protect its civilians from waves of drone attacks. He also halted US military assistance to force Zelensky to accept his demand for an immediate ceasefire. US supplies and intelligence are flowing again, but the interruption sent a clear message to Zelensky that Trump could end the war on his terms if he wanted.
    


            But will any such pressure be brought to bear on Putin, now that he, unlike the Ukrainian leader, has spurned Trump's terms? After all, the US president has said for weeks that he was convinced that Putin wanted to stop the fighting. Thursday's response shows that, at least for now, the Kremlin wants to keep the war going.
    


            The president has this week threatened tariffs on Russian imports and banking sanctions that he said would devastate Moscow's finances — but after three years of efforts to cut Russia out of the global economy, business interactions between it and the United States are minimal. And Moscow has established channels, including through China, to support its wartime economy.
    


            Trump refused to say on Thursday what leverage he could bring to bear on Putin that might work. But it's been clear ever since the president took back the White House that he sees Ukraine as a stepping stone on the way to a restored superpower relationship with Russia. The president has, for example, called for Moscow's return to the Group of Seven. The rich-nations club was known as the G8 until Russia was kicked out after it snatched Crimea. He appears barely able to wait for the opportunity to hold a summit with Putin in person that would restore the Russian leader's place on the world stage. And Trump's expansionist rhetoric about folding Canada and Greenland into the US recall Putin's justifications for the invasion of Ukraine. So there could come a time when the incentives for a broader relationship with Washington convince Putin that it's time to shelve, probably temporarily, his obsession with Ukraine.
    


            In Trump's first term, there was rampant speculation about whether he was compromised by Russia; why Moscow intervened in the 2016 election to help him, as US intelligence agencies assessed; and why he admired Putin so much.
    


            The roots of Trump's obsessions remain unclear, though the allegations he's an asset of Moscow were never proven and still seem far-fetched.
    


            But in his second term, Trump has attacked longtime US allies and blamed Zelensky for the war instead of the Russian leader who started it.
    


            That's why traditional US foreign policy experts and governments worry about what the answer would be if Putin asked Trump to help oust Zelensky as a condition for a peace deal — especially since the US president has already suggested, falsely, that the Ukrainian leader who got caught up in his first impeachment was a dictator. And how would the president respond if the Russians called for him to withdraw NATO troops in Eastern Europe to address what Putin falsely calls “the root causes” of the Ukrainian conflict?
    


            The question is whether Trump is negotiating with Putin or whether the Russian leader is manipulating him.

Canadian officials said a Thursday meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick was constructive and lowered temperatures amid the ongoing trade war launched by U.S. President Donald Trump last month — but they expected no immediate changes to punishing tariffs. 

"This was a constructive discussion," said Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne in Washington. "We have our disagreements, but as long as you have dialogue you are making progress."

Trump's plans to massively realign global trade have thrown markets on both sides of the border into disarray and are forcing layoffs in some of Canada's critical industries like steel production.

Champagne was joined by Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's Ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman and Ontario Premier Doug Ford for the meeting at the end of another roller-coaster week in trade relations between the two countries.




On Tuesday, Trump threatened to double steel and aluminum duties on Canada in response to Ford slapping a 25 per cent surcharge on the province's electricity exports to three U.S. states. Before the end of that day, Ford backed off the surcharge and Trump backed down on doubling the steel and aluminum tariffs.

Trump went ahead Wednesday with an additional 25 per cent import tariff on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., including from Canada.

Canada responded with 25 per cent tariffs on another $29.8 billion worth of American goods, which took effect just after midnight Thursday. Canada last week applied 25 per cent tariffs to $30 billion in U.S. goods in response to the first round of tariffs from the U.S.

"We're like a family. Sometimes there's tension between families," Ford said Thursday in Washington at a separate news conference from the federal ministers. "But that was an extremely productive meeting."




A news release from the U.S. Department of Commerce said the Canadian and American officials discussed the Trump administration's "goal of fair trade with Canada and the province of Ontario, while working to secure America's border and eliminate fentanyl."

"Both countries recognized the strength and history of their relationship," it said. 

Jamieson Greer, Trump's recently confirmed United States trade representative, was also at the meeting. 

Champagne and LeBlanc were not clear whether much will change in the relationship between the two countries after Mark Carney replaces Justin Trudeau as prime minister Friday.

Champagne said he expects Carney and Trump to have a conversation in the coming days.

Trump and Trudeau have had a difficult and often tumultuous relationship. Trump has goaded Trudeau for months about Canada becoming the 51st state, referring to him repeatedly as "Governor Trudeau."




The comments continued Wednesday as Trump met with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte in Washington.

"To be honest with you, Canada only works as a state," Trump sad.

Trump called the international border between the two countries an "artificial line" and said there's no chance he'll relent on tariffs.

"Now there will be a little disruption ... it won't be very long," he said. "But they need us, and we really don't need them … We have to do this. I'm sorry. We have to do this."

That issue was front and centre Thursday as the man set to become America's top diplomat in Ottawa took questions at his congressional confirmation hearing.

When asked about Trump's repeated annexation threats during his Senate confirmation hearing, Pete Hoekstra said that "Canada is a sovereign state."




When senators asked him whether a "joke" about annexation is ever appropriate, Hoekstra said he could not comment on the president's relationship with Trudeau.

If confirmed, the former Michigan congressman will become ambassador at a fraught time in U.S.-Canada relations. 

Trump linked some tariff actions to the flow of deadly fentanyl but Canadian officials have said the president's goal is to use economic force to annex Canada.

Hoekstra told the hearing Trump has a series of priorities for Canada, which include freer trade and fighting the flow of fentanyl.

New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen pushed back on Hoekstra, saying that the volume of fentanyl coming from Canada is minuscule and noting that Canada has one of the lowest tariff regimes.




Hoekstra later acknowledged "it's not a huge amount" of fentanyl coming from Canada.

Shaheen's state borders Canada and she said businesses there were operating according to the rules in the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement, also called CUSMA, which was negotiated by Trump during his first administration.

Shaheen said she's fielded calls from business owners whose orders from Canada were cancelled as a result of Trump's tariffs and rhetoric.

A panel of residents from Boston, Denver and Chicago weigh in on the sanctuary city mayors' heated testimony on Capitol Hill during 'Fox & Friends First.'

An accused child rapist illegally in the U.S. was recently arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement Boston, the agency announced on Thursday.

ICE Boston said Stivenson Omar Perez-Ajtzalan, 19, was arrested on Jan. 30 for aggravated rape of a child in Lawrence, Massachusetts. The victim is said to be more than 10 years younger than Perez, who is a Guatemalan national.

He was arraigned on the felony charges in Lawrence District Court on Dec. 20, 2024.

ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia Hyde said Perez not only displayed a "blatant disregard" for America's immigration laws, but he also sexually assaulted a child.

"He came to this country to do harm, and now he must be made to face the consequences of his actions. ICE Boston will remain dedicated to our mission of protecting public safety by arresting and removing illegal alien offenders from New England," Hyde said.

BOSTON POLICE COMMISSIONER DOUBLES DOWN ON ICE RESISTANCE: 'WE DON'T ENFORCE' DETAINERS 

Perez was allegedly released back into the community by the court, who did not inform ICE of his release, according to Fox News' Bill Melugin. ICE was also unable to file a detainer because the court released him so quickly.

"Massachusetts continues to be the only state I've seen in my coverage that frequently releases aliens not only charged with child rape, but aggravated child rape, without any notice to ICE," Melugin said.

Perez was given a notice to appear before a Justice Department immigration judge after his arrest and he was placed into removal proceedings, according to ICE Boston. He remains in ICE custody.

Massachusetts has made headlines since President Donald Trump was elected for acting in defiance of his administration's immigration crackdown. 

Gov. Maura Healey said in November that her state police will "absolutely not" be cooperating with mass deportation efforts and warned that she will use "every tool in the toolbox" to "protect" residents of her state.

Healey changed her tune in January, noting that her state is not a sanctuary state, despite a 2017 ruling by the state Supreme Judicial Court that severely limits law enforcement cooperation with ICE.

While offering a cautious assessment on ceasefire chances, spy agencies say the Russian leader is determined to hold sway over Kyiv.

Classified U.S. intelligence reports, including one earlier this month, cast doubt on Vladimir Putin's willingness to end the war against Ukraine, assessing that the Russian president has not veered from his maximalist goal of dominating his western neighbor, according to people familiar with the analysis.

One of the secret assessments distributed to Trump administration policymakers, dated March 6, says Putin remains determined to hold sway over Kyiv, a person familiar with the document said. Like others in this article, they spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss classified intelligence.

The reports are not intended to assess President Donald Trump's high-stakes diplomacy to end the three-year Ukraine war or the prospects of a 30-day ceasefire proposal that U.S. and Ukrainian officials agreed on this week. But they underscore the tough task Trump and his national security team face, and raise the question of whether the White House is misreading Putin's willingness to seek peace.

Putin on Thursday reacted cautiously to the ceasefire proposal. While not rejecting it outright, he hinted that Moscow might place conditions on any agreement. The Russian leader spoke in advance of a planned meeting in Moscow with Trump envoy Steve Witkoff to discuss the ceasefire plan. Russian troops, meanwhile, appear to be making significant progress in ousting Ukraine from a sliver of territory in Russia's Kursk province that Kyiv had hoped to use as a territorial bargaining chip.

Some current and former U.S. officials said that the Russian leader, even if he agreed to a temporary truce, would use it to rest and refit his troops — and was likely to break the terms of the deal by creating a provocation that he would blame on Ukraine.

Other officials said the reports were more cautious on what peace terms Putin might accept. But they acknowledged that there is no sign Putin has relented in his demand that Ukraine be brought into Russia's security and economic orbit. “He has a long-standing desire to restore ‘Mother Russia,'” one official said.

The CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment.

“I don't believe a ceasefire or even a truce or a treaty will be an end to the story,” said Eugene Rumer, a former U.S. intelligence official and Russia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “This is the new permanent standoff between Russia and the rest of Europe.”

Other analysts said they thought the talks could yield a positive outcome if Washington and Europe play their cards right.

“For Putin to stop fighting, he has to think he can win in a negotiation,” said Eric Ciaramella, who is also a former U.S. intelligence official and Russia expert at Carnegie. “But that doesn't mean he will win. The key to making a favorable and lasting ceasefire deal will be setting up security arrangements for Ukraine that would allow it to rebuild its military strength and deter a renewed attack.”

While it is unclear whether Trump was personally briefed on the March 6 intelligence report, the person familiar said it is the type of analysis that has traditionally been shared with the president.

Some of the U.S. assessments on Putin's intransigence have appeared to irk Trump, another person familiar with the matter said. Indeed, Trump and his aides in recent days have raised the prospect of stiff new sanctions on Russia if it refuses to agree to end the war. They have not specified what those sanctions would be, though Trump on Wednesday said they “could be devastating.”

“The president desperately wants a deal,” the person said. “And the Russians are showing no signs of relenting. They're ramping up their demands.”

The ceasefire proposal announced Tuesday after U.S.-Ukraine talks in Saudi Arabia would include a 30-day halt in fighting to freeze military positions along 1,800 miles of front lines. It was the latest turnabout in a two-week stretch that saw a near-rupture in relations between Washington and Kyiv following a confrontational Oval Office meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Trump cut off U.S. military and intelligence aid to Ukraine last week to prod Zelensky to engage in peace talks. Once the agreement in Saudi Arabia was reached, Washington said it was lifting the prohibition on arms and intelligence.

On Wednesday, Trump refused to assess the odds of striking a deal with Putin. “I think it makes sense for Russia,” Trump told reporters. “We've also discussed land.”

Russia, which seized and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 before launching a full-scale invasion in 2022, controls about 20 percent of Ukrainian territory and illegally annexed four eastern provinces near Russia's borders. Ukrainian officials say they want to restore the totality of the country's pre-2014 borders, although many officials and analysts say it is unlikely to regain Crimea through diplomacy or force.

The contours of an eventual territorial settlement are unclear. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov last month briskly rejected a French-British proposal for European peacekeeping troops to deploy to Ukraine to safeguard any peace agreement.

Throughout President Joe Biden's tenure, U.S. spy chiefs said publicly that they saw no sign the Russian leader had scaled back his aims for Ukraine, despite significant military setbacks in the months after Russia invaded in February 2022.

Putin has stated publicly that his terms for a peace deal include keeping full control of the four eastern Ukrainian provinces Russia has occupied, preserving a “land bridge” between Russia and Crimea, and gaining possession of territory that Ukraine currently controls, such as the cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. He also wants Ukraine to be nominally independent but subservient to Moscow, a former U.S. official said.

Putin's calculations could change if his military situation begins to deteriorate, the former official said. While much larger and more populous than Ukraine, Russia has seen more than 95,000 of its soldiers killed in the past three years, according to a BBC analysis. Some estimates put the total of killed and wounded near 500,000.

Meanwhile, a European intelligence official, citing intelligence gathered within the past month, said officials in Moscow believe that Trump is weak, lacks a core set of principles and may be open to manipulation.

The European intelligence official said that if a permanent ceasefire is achieved, Moscow probably will revert to “hybrid” or nonmilitary means of undermining Ukraine, as it did in 2014 after it invaded Crimea and eastern Ukraine and on through the full-scale invasion in 2022.

Those means include economic and diplomatic coercion; penetrating Ukrainian elites, business circles, security services and the military; and exerting influence through the Russian church in Ukraine, the official said. Russia's leaders have long painted Zelensky as a puppet of the West and tried to undermine his legitimacy.

“The 2022 invasion happened because the hybrid tools did not bring results,” the European official said.

Russia has stepped up its use of hybrid techniques in Europe in recent years, attempting an assassination of the CEO of a German arms maker, carrying out arson in Britain and other European countries, and meddling in elections in Moldova.

Trump Administration

Shutdown breakthrough: Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, broke with his party on Thursday and said he would vote for a Republican-written bill to keep federal funding flowing past a midnight Friday deadline. Mr. Schumer argued that if Democrats refused to do so, it would lead to a shutdown that would cede too much power to President Trump and Elon Musk. Read more ›

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, broke with his party on Thursday and lined up enough Democrats to advance a Republican-written bill to keep federal funding flowing past a midnight Friday deadline, arguing that Democrats could not allow a government shutdown that many of them have demanded.

During a private luncheon with Democrats, Mr. Schumer stunned many of his colleagues by announcing that he planned to vote to allow the G.O.P. bill to move forward, and indicated that he had enough votes to help Republicans break any filibuster by his own party against the measure, according to attendees and people familiar with the discussion.

It was a turnabout from just a day earlier, when Mr. Schumer proclaimed that Democrats were “unified” against the legislation, and a remarkable move at a time when many of the party's members in both chambers and progressive activists have been agitating vocally for senators to block it in defiance of President Trump.

In a speech hours later on the Senate floor, Mr. Schumer announced his plan to vote to move forward with the Republican measure, which would fund the government through Sept. 30. He argued that if Democrats stood in the way, it would lead to a shutdown that would only further empower Mr. Trump and Elon Musk in their bid to defund and dismantle federal programs.

“The Republican bill is a terrible option,” Mr. Schumer said in his evening speech. “It is deeply partisan. It doesn't address far too many of this country's needs. But I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.”

In a shutdown, Mr. Schumer said, “the Trump administration would have full authority to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel nonessential, furloughing staff with no promise that they would ever be rehired.”

He also warned that if the government closed, Mr. Trump and Republicans would have no incentive to reopen it, since they could selectively fund “their favorite departments and agencies, while leaving other vital services that they don't like to languish.”

His announcement came little more than 24 hours before a shutdown deadline. If Congress fails to approve legislation extending federal funding, it will lapse at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday.

In a meeting with reporters after his remarks, Mr. Schumer declined to confirm that he had sufficient Democratic votes to move the legislation past procedural hurdles, saying that senators were making their own decisions. But other Democrats said they were confident that he had the backing to push the measure forward.

Senate Republicans are expected to need the support of at least eight Democrats to steer around a filibuster. Other than Mr. Schumer, only one Democrat, Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has said he will support the bill.

Mr. Schumer has long seen responsibility for government shutdowns as a political albatross. But many Democrats on Capitol Hill have refused to go along with the stopgap spending measure, regarding it as their only leverage against Mr. Trump. All but one House Democrat voted against the plan on Tuesday, and many of them, along with their colleagues in the Senate, have spent the last few days pressing to hold firm against it to challenge the president.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said on CNN that it would be a “mistake” for Mr. Schumer not to block the bill.

“I hope that individuals that are considering that reconsider it,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said. “I genuinely do. I don't think it's what New Yorkers want.”

In lengthy closed-door group discussions over the past three days, Senate Democrats have agonized over how to handle the spending bill, which would keep government funding largely flat over the next six months.

Many of them described an impossible choice between two evils: supporting a bill that would give the Trump administration wide latitude to continue its unilateral efforts to slash government employees and programs, or a shutdown that would also give Mr. Trump and his team broad leeway to decide what to fund.

Several Democrats — including both centrists and progressives — declared that they could not back legislation that would give that kind of power to the president and Mr. Musk. They groused that Republicans had unilaterally drafted the legislation and refused to consider any changes to win their votes, essentially daring them to take the blame for a politically toxic shutdown.

“What everyone is wrestling with is that either outcome is terrible,” said Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico. “This president has put us in a position where, in either direction, lots of people's constituents are going to get hurt and hurt badly. So people are wrestling with what is the least worst outcome.”

Thursday's session was particularly emotional, stretching on for two hours and at times growing heated. At one point, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York could be heard through closed doors shouting, “This will not be a normal shutdown!”

Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, who had widely been seen as one of the Democrats who might be willing to join Republicans to overcome a filibuster, announced that he would oppose the measure, adding that his decision was the most difficult call he had made since he was elected five years ago.

“That is a calculation I've been struggling with for days — weeks, in fact,” he said. “It's a tough call, and that's why we spent a lot of time talking. That's one of the challenging things on either path: There's a lot of unknowns out there.”

But he added that Mr. Musk “had been wreaking havoc on our government,” and said that the Republican-written bill, drafted in consultation with the White House, “is designed to give him more influence, more power.”

“This is not the way we should be funding the government,” Mr. Kelly said.

Republicans sought to escalate the pressure on Democrats to relent and end the spending fight, and warned on Thursday that the moment for making a decision was at hand.

“As the expression goes, it's time for Democrats to fish or cut bait,” said Senator John Thune, the South Dakota Republican and majority leader. “Democrats need to decide if they're going to support funding legislation that came over from the House or if they're going to shut down the government. So far it looks like they plan to shut it down.”

At the same time, residents of the District of Columbia were protesting on Capitol Hill to demand that Senate Democrats block a spending bill that would amount to a $1 billion budget cut for the District over the next six months. Crowds of school-age children carried signs made with crayons and colored markers, one of which read, “You cut my dad's job and now you want to cut my school,” punctuated by four sad faces.

Some Democrats said they were still trying to assess whether the best approach to reining in Mr. Trump was defeating the spending plan or allowing it to become law.

“We are intent on stymying and stopping the slide toward Trump's tyrannical and autocratic power, which is happening in real time and inflicting harm on real people,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who said he would vote to block the spending bill. “I'm respectful of my colleagues who have a different opinion with the same goal, which is to prevent unchecked and unbridled dictatorial power for President Trump and Elon Musk.”

The Trump administration escalated its dispute with Columbia University on Thursday, demanding the school make dramatic changes before it would discuss lifting the cancellation of $400 million in government grants and contracts.

The leader of the U.S. Postal Service said in a letter to lawmakers on Thursday that he had reached an agreement with Elon Musk's cost-cutting team allowing it to help in “identifying and achieving further efficiencies.”

The Postal Service has long struggled with its finances, and Mr. Musk and President Trump have both suggested it should be privatized. But Mr. Musk's cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, has not targeted the Postal Service's roughly 635,000 workers.

Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who took his position during the first Trump presidency and moved to shrink the agency's ranks during the Biden administration, said he had signed an agreement with Mr. Musk's group on Wednesday.

Mr. DeJoy, a Republican megadonor, wrote in the letter that Mr. Musk's initiative was “an effort aligned” with his efforts.

He said that the Postal Service's work force had shrunk by 30,000 since the 2021 fiscal year, and that the agency planned to complete a “further reduction of another 10,000 people in the next 30 days” through a previously established voluntary-retirement program.

Last week, Mr. Musk said at a tech conference organized by the bank Morgan Stanley that the Postal Service should be privatized, declaring, “We should privatize anything that can reasonably be privatized.”

Mr. Trump has by turns suggested privatizing the independent agency and merging it with the Commerce Department. Union officials and Democratic lawmakers have been alarmed by the talk of privatization, and have argued that such a move would hurt workers, drive prices higher and disproportionately damage service in rural areas.

The agreement described by Mr. DeJoy on Thursday was comparatively less disruptive, but it drew a stern rebuke from Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which oversees the Postal Service.

Mr. Connolly said in a statement that the deal would bring “catastrophic consequences for all Americans — especially those in rural and hard-to-reach areas — who rely on the Postal Service every day.”

The “only thing worse for the Postal Service,” Mr. Connolly said in the statement, would be if the agency were turned over to Mr. Musk so that he could “undermine it, privatize it, and then profit off Americans' loss.”

In his letter, the postmaster general argued that the service had transformed in recent years from a “battered government bureaucracy” on the verge of financial collapse into an agency “experiencing an unprecedented period of growth and innovation.”

“Our strategies have focused on maintaining a modified, but sustainable, universal service mission that was noble when constructed, still meritorious today, and that can be financially self-sufficient with the changes we are pursuing,” Mr. DeJoy wrote.

The Postal Service was once a Cabinet-level department of the government, but was turned into an independent agency under President Richard Nixon. In 2021, the agency reported it had lost $87 billion in the previous 14 years.

Brian L. Renfroe, the president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said in an interview on Thursday that he was “skeptical of DOGE.”

But Mr. Renfroe said Mr. Musk's team had not yet done “anything that raises big alarms.”

“We will be in wait-and-see mode,” he said, adding that any new cuts at the Postal Service would “almost directly result in challenges providing the service that we provide every single day.”

It was supposed to be a moment of celebration: Vice President JD Vance was attending a concert at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington on Thursday evening for the first time since President Trump's stunning takeover of the institution.

Instead, as Mr. Vance took his seat in the box tier with the second lady, Usha Vance, loud boos broke out in the auditorium, lasting roughly 30 seconds, according to audience members and a video posted on social media. Mr. Vance was shown in the video waving to the audience as he settled into his seat.

The incident put on display the outcry over Mr. Trump's decision last month to purge the Kennedy Center's once-bipartisan board of its Biden appointees and have himself elected its chairman. (The president, who broke with tradition during his first term by not attending the Kennedy Center Honors after some of the artists being celebrated criticized him, complained that the center had become too “wokey.”)

Mr. Vance attended Thursday's performance by the National Symphony Orchestra, one of the Kennedy Center's flagship groups. The ensemble, under the baton of its music director, Gianandrea Noseda, performed Shostakovich's Violin Concerto No. 2, with Leonidas Kavakos as the soloist. After an intermission, the orchestra played Stravinsky's “Petrushka.”

The Vances stayed for the entire concert, audience members said. Ms. Vance was recently appointed by Mr. Trump to serve as a board member at the Kennedy Center, alongside other Trump allies like Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and Laura Ingraham, the Fox News host.

The concert started about 20 minutes late because of added security measures, audience members said.

A White House spokesman did not immediately return a request for comment.

Richard Grenell, whom Mr. Trump named as the center's new president, posted on social media on Friday morning that the video showing Mr. Vance being booed “should challenge us all to commit to making the Kennedy Center a place where everyone is welcomed.”

“It troubles me to see that so many in the audience appear to be white and intolerant of diverse political views,” he wrote. “Diversity is our strength. We must do better. We must welcome EVERYONE. We will not allow the Kennedy Center to be an intolerant place.”

In February, President Trump ousted the Kennedy Center's longtime chairman, the financier David M. Rubenstein, the center's largest donor. His new board of loyalists elected him chairman and fired Deborah F. Rutter, the center's president for more than a decade. At least three other top staff members were also dismissed.

Performers, including the actress Issa Rae and the musician Rhiannon Giddens, have dropped out in protest amid fears that Mr. Trump's calls to rid the center of “woke” influences, drag shows and “anti-American propaganda” would result in a reshaping of programming. The musical “Hamilton” recently scrapped a planned tour there next year.

While Mr. Trump has not yet articulated his vision for the center, his appointees have provided some hints. Mr. Grenell recently said that the center planned “a big, huge celebration of the birth of Christ at Christmas.”

A federal judge in Maryland issued an even more sweeping restraining order than one earlier in the day on Thursday, broadly barring the Trump administration from carrying out any future “reductions in force” like this week's ordering the termination of half the Education Department's workers. The order also directed agencies to offer to rehire probationary employees they had recently laid off, and applied to 18 agencies — up from the six mentioned the case earlier in the day.

Tim Balk

On “The Ingraham Angle” on Fox News Thursday night, Vice President JD Vance addressed an argument that erupted last week in the White House between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Elon Musk, saying that Rubio was doing an “incredible job” and that Musk was doing a “great job.” 

“The fact that you have a disagreement at a meeting, that does not mean that you have misalignment,” Vance said of the dispute, which took place in a Cabinet meeting and was reported by The New York Times. Vance added, “It does annoy me that that leaked.”

The Senate has adjourned for the night, meaning the critical procedural vote on advancing the spending bill will take place Friday afternoon. At the moment, Republicans, with help from Schumer and a handful of other Democrats, appear to have the votes to pass the bill and avoid a shutdown.

Tim Balk

Vice President JD Vance told Laura Ingraham on Fox News that he could not rule out a recession after the Trump administration imposed heavy tariffs on its biggest trade partners. “You never can predict the future,” Vance said in an interview on “The Ingraham Angle” that aired Thursday night.

Tim Balk

The prospect of a recession this year came up earlier this week in another interview on Fox News that aired Sunday. President Trump declined to dismiss the possibility of a recession, telling Maria Bartiromo on Fox News that there would be a “period of transition, because what we're doing is very big.” The remark has contributed to anxiety on Wall Street this week, and the S&P 500 fell into a correction Thursday.

Not only did Senator Chuck Schumer of New York announce that he planned to vote to allow the G.O.P. bill to move forward at a private luncheon at the Capitol today, but he made it clear that he had enough votes to help Republicans break any filibuster by his own party against the measure, according to attendees and people familiar with the discussion. The news stunned some Democrats in attendance, who have been vociferously opposed to the measure, those people said.

Elon Musk met with the head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command this week, an N.S.A. spokesman said on Thursday, a sign that the effort to shrink the size of the federal work force could soon turn to a critical arm of the intelligence community.

Mr. Musk, who is leading efforts to reorganize the federal government, traveled to the National Security Agency at Fort Meade, Md., on Wednesday, his first visit there as a special adviser to Mr. Trump, according to the N.S.A. spokesman, who said Mr. Musk had met with General Timothy Haugh, who leads both the N.S.A. and Cyber Command.

The spokesman, who did not allow his name to be used, also said that General Haugh was holding meetings with key White House advisers to ensure the N.S.A. and Cyber Command were “aligned” with the priorities of Mr. Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence.

Mr. Musk's visit was reported earlier by The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal.

The N.S.A. is one of the most bureaucratic of the U.S. spy agencies but collects some of the most valuable intelligence, scooping up telephone and computer communications around the world.

Cyber Command, while a separate organization, is also headquartered at Fort Meade.

While Mr. Musk has criticized the federal government's computer systems, the N.S.A. has some of the most expert cryptologists and computer network experts in the world.

Mr. Musk this week complained about a disruption of service attack on X that caused service outages. On Monday, he said on Fox News that the cyberattack originated from “IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area.” However, an activist hacking group, Dark Storm, claimed responsibility, and experts have cast doubt that the attack actually originated from Ukraine.

Panamanian officials responded to a news report that the White House had directed the U.S. military to draw up plans for sending troops to the Panama Canal with a statement in which they said that while Panama valued its partnership with the U.S. and remained committed to regional security, “our sovereignty over the Panama Canal is absolute and not the basis of any negotiation.” The report by NBC News was based on the accounts of two American officials and said that President Trump and his advisers wanted to see “a U.S. military presence in Panama and on the canal itself.”

Annie Correal

The American officials told NBC News that the administration's possible strategies around the Panama Canal ranged from ensuring that U.S. ships had safe passage through the waterway to restoring total American ownership of the U.S.-built canal, which has been owned and operated by Panama since 1999.

Annie Correal

Panamanian officials continued: “Since 1999, we have successfully managed and secured this global trade route without foreign military presence. Our security strategy is built on varied cooperation, not deployment, and any move to increase foreign forces in Panama would challenge our neutrality and sovereignty.”

Zach Montague

A federal judge declined to require a coalition of states suing the Trump administration to post a bond covering the federal government's legal costs if the challenged failed. A week ago, the White House circulated a memo directing agencies to increasingly make that demand of parties suing the government in an attempt to stem the tide of lawsuits it is facing.

Zach Montague

In explaining the decision, the judge cited legal precedent allowing “an exception to the bond requirement in suits to enforce important federal rights or public interests.”

Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, a progressive Arizona Democrat who was one of the first to publicly urge President Biden to end his re-election campaign last year, died from cancer, his office said in a statement. He was 77.

Mr. Grijalva had lived for a year with his illness, which caused frequent absences from the Capitol that affected the balance of power in recent months, as Republicans held a slim majority.

Mr. Grijalva, as durable as a cactus in Arizona's political scene, represented a border district in his state — covering parts of Tucson, tribal reservations and the vast desert along the U.S.-Mexico border — for more than two decades. He was a liberal fixture of a fast-changing state powered by new arrivals, neighborhoods and businesses eating into the Sonoran desert that Mr. Grijalva, a passionate conservationist, cherished and tried to protect.

His liberal stances often put him out of step with Arizona's Republican-heavy congressional delegation and even Democratic leaders who often tacked to the center in the bitterly contested swing state.

But his progressivism endeared him to voters in his left-leaning district and earned loyal support from tribal leaders. One of his final major legislative efforts sought to block a copper mining project at Oak Flat, a sacred area to Western Apache people.

As the son of a Mexican father who came to the United States as part of the bracero-guest-worker program, Mr. Grijalva espoused staunch support for immigrants, unions, tribal rights and environmental protections. He got his start in politics in Tucson, serving as a school board member and county supervisor before being elected to Congress in 2002.

Mr. Grijalva announced in April that he had been diagnosed with cancer. Months later, he said that he would retire at the end of his current term in January 2027.

Gov. Katie Hobbs of Arizona is required to call a special election for the seat within 72 hours. A special primary election must then be held between 120 and 130 days later, followed by a special general election 70 to 80 days afterward. Mr. Grijalva won re-election with 63.4 percent of the vote in 2024, and whoever wins the Democratic primary for the seat would be the favorite to replace him.

A spokesman for Ms. Hobbs said that it was too soon for any announcement on the timing of an election. Ms. Hobbs also praised Mr. Grijalva in a separate statement as a “true champion for the people of our state.”

She continued: “To his last day, he remained a servant leader who put everyday people first while in office. I join every Arizonan in mourning his passing.”

Schumer's argument for why a shutdown would give Trump more power than if Democrats approved the stopgap funding bill: “Under a shutdown, the Trump administration would have full authority to deem whole agencies, programs and personnel nonessential, furloughing staff with no promise they would ever be rehired. The decision on what is essential would be solely left to the executive branch.”

He added that if the government shut down, House and Senate Republicans could “pursue a strategy of bringing bills to the floor to reopen only their favorite departments and agencies, while leaving other vital services that they don't like to languish.”

Carl Hulse

After declaring that he would vote to keep the government open, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, is to meet with reporters. What remains unclear is if sufficient Democrats will join him in advancing the Republican bill and what the timing for such a vote might be. Senators have not yet been sent home for the night.

Minho Kim

Kari Lake, a special adviser to Voice of America's parent organization said that she had directed VOA, a federally funded news agency, to cancel all contracts with news wire services provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse. President Trump named her as the next director for VOA, but she has not yet assumed the job, as a bipartisan board that oversees federal news agencies must confirm leadership positions, including those at VOA.

Minho Kim

Lake has rebuffed calls from Elon Musk to abolish VOA altogether. But she has said the broadcaster's coverage will be free from what she described as “Trump derangement syndrome,” or T.D.S. “It won't become Trump TV,” Lake said during a speech last month at the Conservative Political Action Conference, an influential gathering of conservatives. “But it sure as hell will not be T.D.S.” 

Catie Edmondson

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, says on the Senate floor of the Republican funding bill, known as a C.R.: “While the C.R. bill is very bad, the potential for a shutdown has consequences for America that are much, much worse. The Republican bill is a terrible option. It is not a clean C.R. It is deeply partisan. It doesn't address far too many of this country's needs, but I believe allowing Donald Trump to take even much more power via a government shutdown is a far worse option.”

Catie Edmondson

“A shutdown would give Donald Trump, Elon Musk and DOGE the keys to the city, state and country,” Schumer says. We reported earlier that Schumer told colleagues at the party's private luncheon at the Capitol on Thursday that he would vote to clear the way for a final vote on the bill.

Resignations. Retirements. Firings.

And now large-scale layoffs, as agencies faced a Thursday deadline to turn in their plans for executing the next phase of President Trump's goal of significantly reducing the government payroll.

Agencies were given guidance and a timeline last month to submit outlines for “reductions in force” — a bureaucratic term meaning shrinking of an organization. Many agencies have not yet announced detailed plans. But some plans have trickled out, pointing to a downsizing effort exceeding the number of probationary workers already fired and the number of workers who accepted voluntary resignation offers.

At least some planned cuts could be blocked by the courts. On Thursday night, a federal judge temporarily restrained the government from carrying out any reductions in force across 18 agencies. 

And if the layoffs go forward, there are rules governing how government agencies can make them. Part of the process is assigning scores to individual employees based on their length of service, performance and veteran status. Those with the highest scores are supposed to be prioritized for finding other jobs in the agency.

Here is what we know about the reduction in force efforts at various agencies.

More than 1,300 workers were fired this week.

This is in addition to the 572 who took resignation packages and 63 probationary workers who have been fired. The reductions have cut the size of the agency, which started the year with 4,133 workers, in half.

Last month, the agency sent an email offering employees a buyout ahead of “very significant” layoffs.

The department has planned to cut 80,000 people. That number could include people who are retiring or taking a buyout, however.

In total, the department is looking to shrink its work force from 482,000 to 399,957.

The agency has planned to cut at least 1,000 people. This is in addition to 1,300 workers who have resigned or were laid off.

Together, the reductions would represent nearly 20 percent of NOAA's approximately 13,000-member work force.

The agency held a meeting with employees on Thursday but did not say how many cuts they were looking to make, according to two employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Officials presented workers with a list of job categories that were eligible for voluntary separation packages. This included staff focused on laboratory safety, ethics management, records management and the Freedom of Information Act, which enables the public to access government records. Workers were told those jobs could also be targeted for layoffs.

The agency has planned cuts of about 7,000 workers, including those opting to retire or resign. The goal is to reduce the work force to 50,000, according to the agency.

The agency said it would cut jobs by closing specific offices. The Office of Technology, Policy and Strategy; the Office of the Chief Scientist; and the Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility were targeted, as well as some other employees in the Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity, according to a March 10 memo shared with The Times.

The agency did not provide a total number of cuts.

A recent memo stated that the department hopes to make reductions through voluntary early retirements and resignation incentives, like buyouts. Plans to make additional work force cuts are due to the department's head of civilian personnel policy by March 20, the memo said.

The agency previously announced layoff plans for 144 employees in its Office of Field Policy and Management. It has not disclosed other details about future cuts.

Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York said she planned to meet with President Trump at the White House on Friday. The visit comes days after Thomas D. Homan, who is overseeing Trump's deportation operation and threatened to bring more federal immigration agents to New York, visited the State Capitol in Albany and faced protests over the detention of a recent Columbia graduate. Hochul told reporters Thursday that she hadn't paid attention to Homan and would be talking about the benefits of congestion pricing.

Reporting from Washington

A federal judge in Washington has ordered Elon Musk and operatives involved with his Department of Government Efficiency to hand over documents and answer questions about its role in directing mass firings and dismantling government programs.

The judge, Tanya S. Chutkan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said on Wednesday that the plaintiffs in the case — a coalition of 14 Democratic state attorneys general challenging Mr. Musk's authority — had demonstrated a clear need to shed light on the inner workings of Mr. Musk's team. It was the first time a judge has ordered Mr. Musk's division be subject to discovery.

In the weeks after Mr. Musk's team fanned out across federal agencies demanding access to federal offices and databases, lawyers seeking to stop the group's advances have been forced to rely on news reports and anecdotal evidence about what, exactly, Mr. Musk's team has been doing.

In many cases, federal judges have grown frustrated by the inability of the government's own lawyers to answer straightforward questions about what data Mr. Musk's associates have viewed, or to what extent the group had directly spearheaded recent downsizing efforts. In filings in another case, the government has also downplayed Mr. Musk's role, claiming he was not officially the group's leader.

The group of states had asked Judge Chutkan to grant the request to let them probe Mr. Musk's team for information in order to confirm details about its operations and its future plans, and to “illustrate the nature and scope of the unconstitutional and unlawful authority” they said Mr. Musk has so far exercised.

Judge Chutkan agreed, writing in an opinion that “the requests seek to identify DOGE personnel and the parameters of DOGE's and Musk's authority — a question central to Plaintiffs' claims.”

The order on Wednesday was more limited than the states' slightly more ambitious request, which included a demand for two members of Mr. Musk's team to sit for depositions — an ask Judge Chutkan denied. But the order still requires Mr. Musk and his office to provide a broad array of information about its engagement with federal agencies, employees, contracts, grants and databases within three weeks.

Judges in other cases have responded similarly to demands for more clarity about Mr. Musk's team, which has largely been shrouded in secrecy.

On Thursday, a judge in California required an associate of Mr. Musk's who was detailed to the Office of Personnel Management, the government's human resources arm, to be deposed about any role he had in helping steer the mass firings of federal workers.

And on Monday, a judge in Washington ruled that Mr. Musk's office was subject to the Freedom of Information Act, and ordered it to rapidly produce records that a public ethics group had sued to obtain.

The Trump administration on Thursday demanded that Columbia University make dramatic changes in student discipline and admissions before it would discuss lifting the cancellation of $400 million in government grants and contracts.

It said the ultimatum was necessary because of what it described as Columbia's failure to protect Jewish students from harassment.

The government called for the university to formalize its definition of antisemitism, to ban the wearing of masks “intended to conceal identity or intimidate” and to place the school's Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under “academic receivership.”

“We expect your immediate compliance,” officials from the General Services Administration, Department of Education and Department of Health and Human Services said in a letter.

They said that since the Trump administration had announced it was cutting the funding, “your counsel has asked to discuss ‘next steps.'” The administration demanded a response to its letter within a week as “a precondition for formal negotiations regarding Columbia University's continued financial relationship with the United States government.”

The Trump administration sent a letter to Columbia on Thursday demanding that the university make dramatic changes in student discipline and admissions before it would discuss lifting the cancellation of $400 million in government grants and contracts.

The Trump administration's move to cut Columbia's grants and contracts represented an extraordinary escalation of the government's actions against the university.

Columbia, it said, “has fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.”

A Columbia spokeswoman said Thursday evening that the school was “reviewing the letter" from the three government agencies, adding, “We are committed at all times to advancing our mission, supporting our students, and addressing all forms of discrimination and hatred on our campus.”

On social media, Jameel Jaffer, director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia, described the government's letter as essentially saying, “We'll destroy Columbia unless you destroy it first.”

Hours earlier, the school announced a range of disciplinary actions against students who occupied a campus building last spring, including expulsions and suspensions.

The punishments levied include “multiyear suspensions, temporary degree revocations and expulsions,” according to a statement. The school did not release the names of students who would be punished, in compliance with federal privacy laws, according to a university spokeswoman. It is unclear how many students have been punished.

The announcement came one day after Gregory J. Wawro, a professor of political science who also serves as the university's rules administrator, said in a statement that the hearings for students accused of violations “in connection with the April 17-18 encampment on the South Lawn and the occupation of Hamilton Hall” had been completed.

Student defendants were allowed to bring two advisers, including legal counsel, to hearings, which were held over video conference, according to a Columbia employee with knowledge of the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak publicly.

Late Thursday, Columbia's interim president, Katrina Armstrong, said that the Department of Homeland Security had searched two dorm rooms after presenting two federal search warrants. In an email to students and staff, and a news release, Ms. Armstrong said that no one was detained and nothing had been taken. She did not say what the target of the warrants was.

Columbia University and the D.H.S. did not immediately respond to requests for comments after working hours.

The Trump administration has placed increasing scrutiny on universities in recent weeks. On Monday, it warned 60 other universities they, too, could face penalties from pending investigations into antisemitism on college campuses.

Last spring, Columbia began to issue suspensions of pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had been encamped for more than a week on campus as they protested the university's investment in Israel, including its dual-degree program with Tel Aviv University.

A protest that had mostly been nonviolent then took a turn, with demonstrators breaking into and seizing Hamilton Hall, an academic building. After about 20 hours, Columbia's president at the time, Dr. Nemat Shafik, called in the city's Police Department. Officers in riot gear arrested dozens of people.

A maintenance worker who was trapped in the building was physically injured in the melee.

In all, nearly 50 pro-Palestinian demonstrators who had been inside Hamilton Hall were arrested, along with more than 100 others who were protesting in and around the campus.

Questions about how the university administration was handling discipline have dogged the school since.

In February, the House Committee on Education and Workforce sent a letter to Ms. Armstrong, and Columbia's board chairs, David Greenwald and Claire Shipman, listing “numerous antisemitic incidents” that it said had taken place in the last two academic years.

Those incidents include the student occupation of Hamilton Hall last April, the protest against a class taught by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the disruption of an Israeli history class.

Representative Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan who is the chair of the House committee, said he was glad that there has been forward movement but expressed frustration that the school has not provided the detailed disciplinary records his committee seeks.

“I welcome the news that some lawbreaking individuals are being held accountable,” Mr. Walberg said, “but I remain skeptical about Columbia University's long-term ability to continue to hold pro-terror supporters accountable given the school's obfuscation.”

The university said that it began its judicial process last summer, filing its complaints against students with the University Judicial Board, which is an independent panel of faculty, students and staff.

Students notified on Thursday of the sanctions have five business days to file an appeal, on grounds that there was a procedural error, availability of new information or “excessiveness of sanction.” A university appellate board has 10 days to issue a ruling.

Columbia University Apartheid Divest, a group that helped organize the protests and last fall asserted its support for “armed resistance,” said on its Instagram page Thursday that “the university's extreme repression is a panicked attempt at silencing the movement for Palestinian liberation,” adding that “they have seen our unyielding commitment to Palestine firsthand over the last year, and they are terrified.”

The announcement of sanctions can be seen as a sign that “Columbia has turned the corner,” said Professor Joshua Mitts, a professor in the law school who this semester is teaching a seminar on free speech and civil liberties on campus. He is also the adviser to Law Students Against Antisemitism, a campus group.

Calling the judicial process “fair and transparent,” Mr. Mitts said that the university showed its fidelity to due process, free speech and academic freedom as it sought to upend antisemitism.

“This is Columbia at its best,” he said.

Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, a progressive Arizona Democrat who was one of the first to urge President Biden to end his re-election campaign last year, has died from cancer, his office said in a statement. Grijalva, 78, was first elected to Congress in 2002.

Chris Cameron

Grijalva had been absent from the Capitol in recent months as he battled cancer. Those absences — and vacancies from House Republicans stepping down to take jobs in the Trump administration — has significantly affected the balance of power in the House, in which Republicans have a very slim majority.

Johns Hopkins University, one of the country's leading centers of scientific research, said on Thursday that it would eliminate more than 2,000 workers in the United States and abroad because of the Trump administration's steep cuts, primarily to international aid programs.

The layoffs, the most in the university's history, will involve 247 domestic workers for the university, which is based in Baltimore, and an affiliated center. Another 1,975 positions will be cut in 44 countries. They affect the university's Bloomberg School of Public Health, its medical school and an affiliated nonprofit, Jhpiego.

Nearly half the school's total revenue last year came from federally funded research, including $365 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development. In all, the university will lose $800 million in funding over several years from U.S.A.I.D., which the Trump administration is in the process of dismantling.

Johns Hopkins is one of the top university recipients of the funding that the administration is aiming to slash. And it appears to be among the most deeply affected of the major research institutions that are reeling from cuts — or the threat of cuts — to federal money that they depend on for research studies and running labs.

In a statement on Thursday calling it a “difficult day,” Johns Hopkins said it was “immensely proud” of its work on the projects, which included efforts to “care for mothers and infants, fight disease, provide clean drinking water and advance countless other critical, lifesaving efforts around the world.”

In a statement last week describing Johns Hopkins's reliance on federal funding, Ron Daniels, the university's president said, “We are, more than any other American university, deeply tethered to the compact between our sector and the federal government.”

Of the school's total operating revenue in 2023, $3.8 billion, or nearly half, came federally funded research. The Trump administration has said that it wants to make the government leaner and more efficient by, among other measures, dramatically cutting financial support for the program, which promotes public health and food security in low-income countries.

In ordering cutbacks in the agency, which amount to a 90 percent reduction in its operations, President Trump said that it was run by “radical left lunatics” and that is was riddled with “tremendous fraud.”

Critics of the decision, however, have said the cuts are ushering in a new era of isolationism that could prove to be dangerous. Sunil Solomon, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, said the cuts would lead to a resurgence in the spread of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.

“What true great nations do is help other nations, but now, it seems, we're America first,” Dr. Solomon said.

The administration has also sought to reduce the amount of money that the National Institutes of Health sends to university for research, cuts that have been blocked for now in the courts. If they go into effect, those cuts would reduce federal payments to Johns Hopkins by more than $100 million a year, according to an analysis of university figures.

The university, which receives about $1 billion a year in N.I.H. funding and is currently running 600 clinical trials, is one of the plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging those cuts.

Separately, the Trump administration also has targeted specific schools for cuts. It slashed $400 million from Columbia's budget last week based on accusations that it had failed to protect students and faculty from antisemitism.

Johns Hopkins and Columbia are on a list of 10 schools that the administration says are being scrutinized by an executive branch antisemitism task force. The administration has threatened to reduce federal funding for schools on the list, and others, that it views as being noncompliant with federal civil rights laws.

In addition to the more than 2,000 employees whose jobs have been eliminated, the university said that an additional 78 domestic employees and 29 international would be furloughed at reduced schedules.

The cuts at Johns Hopkins involve programs funded by U.S.A.I.D. through which American universities have worked with global partners, largely to advance public health and agricultural research. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that 5,200 of the agency's 6,200 contracts had been canceled and that the remaining programs would be operated directly by the State Department, eliminating the need for U.S.A.I.D., which is under the State Department.

Research projects that are being eliminated include international work on tuberculosis, AIDS and cervical cancer, as well as programs that directly benefit residents of Baltimore.

Dr. Solomon, the epidemiologist, runs a $50 million, six-year program to improve H.I.V. outcomes in India. He said the budget cuts in his program alone would result in layoffs of about 600 people in the United States and India. The program had led to, among other things, the diagnosis of almost 20,000 people with H.I.V. through contact tracing.

“It's heartbreaking,” Dr. Solomon said. “Stopping funding isn't going to kill you today, but in six months you're going to see an impact around the world.”

Dr. Judd Walson runs the department of international health at Johns Hopkins, which oversaw a five-year, $200 million program to diagnose and control tuberculosis in 20 countries funded by U.S.A.I.D.

In Kampala, Uganda, he said, the program was the only way children were diagnosed.

“That's just one example of how the sudden withdrawal of support is having real impacts on survival,” he said.

In addition to the loss of jobs at Johns Hopkins, he said, the loss of the programs will lead to a spike in communicable diseases worldwide.

What is essentially a shutdown of U.S.A.I.D. has had significant effects at universities around the country.

An organization called USAID StopWork, which is tracking the layoffs, said that overall, 14,000 domestic workers had lost their jobs so far, with thousands more anticipated.

Research by the Federal Reserve shows that universities serve as major economic engines in many agricultural regions, from Iowa to Florida, meaning that the impact of the administration's cuts to science research will be felt in both red states and left-leaning communities like Baltimore.

The elimination of a $500 million agriculture project called Feed the Future, which funded agriculture labs at 19 universities in 17 states, means many of those labs must shutter.

At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, 30 people have lost their jobs at a Feed the Future lab that worked on improving soybean cultivation in Africa, according to Peter D. Goldsmith, a professor of agriculture who ran that laboratory.

At Mississippi State University in Starkville, Miss., a fisheries laboratory was shut down, according to Sidney L. Salter, a university spokesman, who did not disclose the number of jobs lost.

Economic ripple effects of the funding cuts are expected to spread through the Baltimore area. Johns Hopkins, which enrolls about 30,000 students, is also one of Maryland's largest private employers.

An earlier version of this article misstated the amount that Johns Hopkins received in one year from the U.S. Agency for International Development. It is $365 million, not $800 million.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, one of the nation's most prominent Democratic governors and among those seen as considering running for president in 2028, said she had a one-on-one meeting with President Trump at the White House Thursday afternoon. 

“I had a productive meeting at the White House today with President Trump where we discussed bringing good paying jobs to Michigan,” Whitmer said. “We also discussed tariffs, the importance of keeping our great lakes clean and safe, and additional defense investments in the state. I'm grateful for his time today.”

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, told colleagues in their private luncheon at the Capitol on Thursday that he would vote to clear the way for a final vote on the Republican bill extending government funding, according to multiple people familiar with the comments. That is the clearest signal yet that Democrats could relent and let the bill to avert a shutdown at the end of the week pass despite deep reservations among virtually the entire conference.

Tesla, Elon Musk's electric car company, warned the Trump administration not to impose tariffs in ways that could hurt U.S. manufacturers. The government ought to “ensure that U.S. manufacturers are not unduly burdened by trade actions that could result in the imposition of cost-prohibitive tariffs on necessary components, or other import restrictions on items essential to support U.S. manufacturing jobs,” the company said in an unsigned letter to the U.S. trade representative, Jamieson Greer, dated March 11.

Tesla joins many businesses sending letters seeking to influence the trade representative's office, but its message carries perhaps more weight given that Musk is playing a very active role in the administration's efforts to reshape the federal government. Tesla makes all the cars it sells in the United States at factories in California and Texas. It also has factories in Nevada and New York.

The world's most widely followed stock-market benchmark slid into a correction on Thursday, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration.

The move stems from investors' growing pessimism about the whipsawing policy pronouncements from Washington over the past few weeks. On-again, off-again tariffs and mass layoffs of federal workers have fomented unease on Wall Street.

On Thursday, the S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent. After weeks of selling, the index is now down 10.1 percent from a peak that it reached less than one month ago and is in a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its peak, and a line in the sand for investors worried about a sell-off gathering steam.

Other major indexes, including the Russell 2000 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, had already fallen into correction. On Thursday, the Nasdaq fell 2 percent, while the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which tend to be more exposed to the ebb and flow of the economy, was 1.6 percent lower.

The deeper worry among investors is that uncertainty around the effects of President Trump's policies is causing consumers to spend less and discouraging businesses from investing. That reticence could, in turn, drive the economy into a downturn, forcing investors to reassess company valuations.

“I think what markets are telling us is that they are very concerned about the potential for a recession,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “That is certainly not what markets expected going into 2025.”

This is the 11th correction in the S&P 500 since the 2008-9 financial crisis, according to data from Yardeni Research. Three of the previous downturns turned into bear markets, defined as a more severe decline of at least 20 percent.

Since the 2008-9 financial crisis, there have been nearly a dozen corrections — declines of 10 percent — in the S&P. Three of those resulted in bear markets — declines of 20 percent.

Note: The vertical is adjusted so percentage changes are comparable.

So far, the administration has brushed off the market turmoil. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday that he was focused on the “real economy,” downplaying signals sent by business leaders and investors. “I'm not concerned about a little bit of volatility over three weeks,” he said.

As stocks have been falling in recent weeks, the Trump administration has emphasized that its economic policies are designed to promote job growth over the long term, but could cause some market turmoil in the short term.

Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the economy had already begun to be “negatively impacted.”

The pain has been acutely felt among the behemoth tech companies that drove the market higher in recent years, but their once rallying share prices have since reversed course. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has fallen roughly 14 percent from its peak in December.

The sell-off has also spread to other corners of the market, signaling broader concerns than simply a re-pricing of highly valued technology companies. The Russell 2000 has fallen 18 percent from its peak in November, close to a full-fledged bear market.

Sectors of the stock market exposed to tariffs, like food producers, have slumped. The effects are being felt by other companies, like retailers and airlines, that are worried about a pullback among consumers should the economy enter a downturn. On Thursday, the low-cost retailer Dollar General said customer traffic fell in its most recent quarter, and the company predicted continued financial pressure. Delta Air Lines cut its financial forecast this week for the first three months of the year, citing less demand for domestic travel.

“So far in 2025, the U.S. economy has only faced headwinds,” Ms. Shah said.

On Thursday, Mr. Trump threatened to impose 200 percent tariffs on European wine and champagne, one day after the European Union announced retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. whiskey and several other American products. The president has already added tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and a wide swath of products from China.

And when asked by reporters about tariffs on Canada — one of the United States' largest trading partners — he was adamant that he would not offer a reprieve.

“I'm sorry, we have to do this,” Mr. Trump said.

The constantly moving goal posts have left investors so rattled that even recent good news about the economy hasn't had a calming effect. On Thursday, a report on weekly unemployment claims came in lower than expected. On Wednesday, a better-than-expected reading of the Consumer Price Index had briefly helped bolster stocks.

Investors are worried that tariffs, once in full effect, will push prices higher — hurting business and consumers. Mr. Trump's immigration policies and firings of federal employees through the so-called Department of Government Efficiency are also looming in the backdrop, as is the threat of an impending government shutdown.

“The outlook for inflation depends more on tariffs, deportations and DOGE than the backward-looking data releases right now,” Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said on Thursday.

The S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent today, pushing the benchmark index into a correction — a Wall Street term for when an index falls 10 percent or more from its recent high. The index is down 10.1 percent from its mid-February peak, a drop that underscores how the two-year-long bull market is running out of steam in the early days of the Trump administration as investors are rattled by trade wars and an uncertain economic outlook.

Four fair housing organizations sued the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department of Government Efficiency on Thursday, faced with the sudden rescission of approximately 30 million in critical grant dollars.

The organizations — in Massachusetts, Idaho, Texas and Ohio — were among 66 housing rights nonprofits across the country that received a letter in late February informing them that key funding used to help individuals fight eviction and seek redress for discrimination had been cut off. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of a proposed class of the groups.

According to the lawsuit filed in Massachusetts district court, HUD and DOGE, operating at the direction of President Trump, made an “egregious overstep” when they canceled dozens of grants connected to the Fair Housing Initiatives Program. The program and the grants distributed to state and city organizations are used to enforce the federal Fair Housing Act that prohibits discrimination in housing based on race, ethnicity, religion and other factors, like gender identity and disability.

Most fair housing complaints in the United States are handled by local housing organizations: In 2022, these groups received more than 33,000 complaints.

Local fair housing organizations generally have annual budgets of less than $1 million, and the grants account for a significant portion of their revenues. The groups say they had no warning that the funding would end abruptly. “The impact of these dollars is concrete and profound,” the complaint reads.

“It's how they pay their bills,” said Yiyang Wu, a lawyer at the civil rights law firm Relman Colfax, which is representing the fair housing organizations. “It's their bread and butter.”

In its letters, HUD told the organizations that each grant being canceled “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”

HUD and DOGE launched a joint task force they said would eliminate waste, fraud and abuse last month. In a news release announcing the task force on Feb. 13, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that under his leadership, the department would be “detailed and deliberate about every dollar spent” to “better serve the American people.”

The department has made widespread slashes to initiatives that it said promoted diversity, equity and inclusion programs. “DEI is dead at HUD,” Mr. Turner has repeatedly said in recent weeks.

Since receiving notice of the funding cuts, some fair-housing groups are now leaning on their reserves to pay bills. Others are already struggling.

The San Antonio Fair Housing Council, which previously had four full-time staff, three part-time staff and three per-diem workers, was forced to lay off more than half of its work force.

The Massachusetts Fair Housing Center was forced to turn away clients, including a domestic violence survivor who was facing displacement from her temporary shelter. And the Intermountain Fair Housing Council, which serves the entire state of Idaho, has been forced to “narrow its service area, leaving 10 counties without any eviction prevention or fair housing services,” the lawsuit reads.

The grant termination, said Lila Miller, another lawyer at Relman Colfax, was illegal because the grants had been allotted by Congress. She said Congress has not authorized DOGE to direct another agency's operations.

“Congress makes the law and Congress sets the bounds of agency action,” she said.

Elon Musk paid an unannounced visit to the National Security Agency on Wednesday and met with its chief, an NSA spokesperson said, days after he called for revamping the country's top cyberespionage hub.

It was Musk's first publicly confirmed visit to an intelligence agency since he launched the Trump administration's effort to drastically slash the federal workforce.

The NSA is one of the country's most valuable tools for collecting intelligence, according to experts, overseeing a vast eavesdropping operation, as well as sophisticated cybersecurity capabilities.

Musk, the billionaire businessman who has come under criticism for his aggressive tactics and sweeping secrecy, posted on his social media platform, X, last week, “The NSA needs an overhaul.” Musk's post and his visit suggested the long secretive agency, known as the “puzzle palace” for its famed codebreaking abilities, may be next. 

During his visit to the NSA's headquarters at Fort Meade, Maryland, Musk held talks with Air Force Gen. Timothy Haugh, who oversees the agency, as well as the military's Cyber Command, the spokesperson said. Musk was also given a tour of the NSA's Remote Operations Center, according to a source with knowledge of the matter.

Asked about the focus of the meetings, the NSA spokesperson said in an email that the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command are focused on priorities outlined by the president, the defense secretary and the director of national intelligence and that “meetings with key advisors ensure we are aligned."

The Wall Street Journal first reported Musk's visit.

Some former intelligence officials and Democrats in Congress have warned against rushing to fire employees without careful planning to avoid losing talented officers and damaging national security. For decades, the federal government has struggled to compete with the private sector when it comes to hiring talented tech workers. 

The Defense Department oversees the budgets of parts of the intelligence community, and, as a result, some spy agencies are under instructions to meet a goal set by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to reduce the civilian workforce by 5% to 8%, the source said.  

“As part of the defense secretary's direction to streamline operations, bolster readiness and prioritize critical missions, the Department of Defense will continue efforts to eliminate positions that are non-mission critical and reduce the civilian workforce by 5 to 8 percent over the coming months,” according to a Pentagon memo signed by the acting deputy assistant defense secretary for civilian personnel policy, which was obtained by NBC News.

The Defense Department memo encourages managers to use early retirement or other buyout options to meet the goal by June. 

To try to meet the administration's orders to reduce its workforce, the NSA is looking at offering employees early retirement and/or other buyout options, the source said.  

Other intelligence agencies are also grappling with how to reduce their numbers of employees without damaging their missions. The CIA has started to fire some employees who were hired in the past two years, NBC News has reported.

The head of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Navy Vice Adm. Frank Whitworth, acknowledged this week that there is some concern among employees about plans to cut the workforce across the federal government.

“There is nothing like mission to help people stay focused no matter what else is going on,” SpaceNews quoted Whitworth as saying at an event Monday in Washington. “That said, they're humans, they have stresses.”

When Congress pushed ahead last year with adding 10 new daily flights to Washington D.C.'s Reagan National Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration had data showing an unnerving number of near misses in the already-crowded skies — something lawmakers apparently did not know.



The FAA, which manages the nation's airspace and oversees aviation safety, had data on dozens of incidents that experts said documented a safety concern. That data didn't prompt any action before January's deadly midair collision between an American Airlines jetliner and a military helicopter that killed 67 people.

“Why someone was not paying attention to those numbers and those events are questions yet to be answered,” said James Hall, a former National Transportation Safety Board chair during the Clinton administration. “What not to do is to ignore that many incidents.”



Data collected by the FAA shows close calls were far more frequent than travelers and outside aviation experts knew at Reagan National, which was built to handle 15 million passengers a year, not the 25 million traveling through it annually. 



Now, safety experts and family members who lost loved ones in the Jan. 29 crash are asking why action wasn't taken earlier.



The NTSB said airplane pilots were alerted to take evasive action to avoid hitting helicopters at least once a month from 2011 through 2024, citing data compiled by the FAA, and that there were 85 near misses when aircraft were within a few hundred feet (meters) of each other during recent years. 






“How does that happen in this day and age and somebody doesn't do something about it?” asked Doug Lane, whose wife, Christine Conrad Lane, and their 16-year-old son, Spencer, died in the crash. 



Pilots have long worried about the congested and complex airspace around Reagan National, near the heart of the capital, where flights must maneuver around military aircraft and restricted areas. It was no secret there had been previous close calls, but the numbers found by the NTSB were alarming. 



FAA officials have not yet addressed who inside the agency saw the data and whether it prompted discussions about possible changes. Messages seeking comment were not immediately returned Thursday.

Current NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who oversees the FAA, both said they were angry that the number of close calls were not recognized earlier by the FAA.



“If someone was paying attention, someone was on the job, they would have seen this,” Duffy said. He also announced he will move forward with banning some helicopter flights around the airport, a move that was temporarily made after the crash. 



Safety advocate Mary Schiavo, a former inspector general of the U.S. Transportation Department, said that while there was plenty of blame to go around for the midair collision, the FAA was shockingly complacent.



“They literally wait for a disaster,” she said. ”I can't even fathom how the families of those lost in this crash can even deal with this. I mean this would be so maddening to hear.”



In Kansas, some officials also argue the FAA's data should have been readily accessible to the public. State Rep. John Carmichael, from Wichita, where the airliner's flight started, said Thursday that it's not enough for people to get data through Freedom of Information Act requests when that can take months.



“The public absolutely needs to know about statistics like that because we all put our lives in the hands of pilots and air traffic controllers every time we get on a plane,” said Kris Kobach, the state's attorney general. “I'm hopeful that the Trump administration will make this kind of information available to the traveling public.”



Commercial passenger airlines are authorized to make a total of 864 landings and departures from Reagan National from 6 a.m. to midnight each day, or 48 an hour, according to the airport's website. Of those, 64 have been added by Congress since 2000. Local airport authorities have objected to the increases. 



The crowded airspace around Washington drew attention last year when Congress debated an aviation safety bill that allowed 10 more flights a day at Reagan National, despite strong objections from Virginia's Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner.



Squeezing in more flights would only increase the risks, they warned, calling a near miss between two planes on a runway last April a “flashing red warning light.”



While Congress did OK the extra flights, they had not started as of the deadly January collision.



Kaine told reporters Thursday he was troubled by the number of near misses and the lack of action by the FAA. “What were they doing with the information if they weren't making the changes that needed to be made?” he said.



The FAA limits arrival and departure slots at three of the nation's busiest airports where demand exceeds the airport's capacity: Reagan National and New York City's LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy International airports. 



But Congress has a history of directing the FAA to add slots at Reagan, even though Washington's other international airport, Dulles, has capacity to handle them. Reagan is closer to the capital and most federal departments and therefore more convenient, particularly for lawmakers. 



Mike McCormick, coordinator of the Air Traffic Management program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said the congestion at Reagan National clearly contributed to the midair collision because the American Airlines jetliner, which was on a newly added route from Wichita, Kansas, was diverted to a different runway closer to the helicopter flights.



“In this instance, the sole reason for doing it was because they were too busy,” McCormick said. “This is something that controller has probably done thousands of times.”



The flight from Wichita to Washington began operating in early 2024, the first direct flight from Kansas' largest city to Reagan National. It was not among the 10 added last year, but announced by American Airlines and Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran separate of any congressional action in July 2023. Moran said it was “vital” to link the nation's capital with the city, which has a long history as an aircraft manufacturing hub. 



U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Kansas Democrat who serves on an aviation subcommittee, said the cause of the accident and the congestion at Reagan National are for now, “two different conversations.” 



“I understand, the desire for us all to be able to connect these dots,” she said. “Right now that is not a connection that has been made by the NTSB.”

Hudson's Bay Company is nearly a billion dollars in debt, according to court filings that paint a dire portrait of the struggling Canadian department store chain's finances. 

The documents were submitted as part of its creditor protection filing last week. The company owes a total of $950 million to nearly 2,000 secured and unsecured creditors, including well-known apparel and beauty brands like Adidas Canada, Estée Lauder, L'Oréal Canada, Levi Strauss Canada, Michael Kors Canada, Nike Canada and Ralph Lauren.

"The scale is certainly monumental for insolvency proceedings as far as Canada goes. It's a very large one," said Dina Kovacevic, editor-in-chief of Insolvency Insider Canada. But it's not a surprise, she said.

"Retailers in the last several years since the COVID pandemic have really been having a hard time with less foot traffic and all of the economic issues that have been going on in the world. So while it is monumental, I think we were probably expecting it. There have been a lot of retailer filings in the last several years."

The company owes more than $1 million to Canada Post, and is in debt to over a dozen municipalities. The list doesn't include debts owed to government agencies, a figure that the filing says is unknown at this time. The amount owed to employees is to be determined, per the filing.

At the beginning of the year, Hudson's Bay had just $3 million in cash and cash equivalents, the documents show. The $1.1 billion it owes in secured debt includes $724.4 million in mortgages.

Secured creditors are lenders, like banks, which give out loans to companies. To ensure they are paid back, the creditor takes on some of the company's assets as collateral. Unsecured creditors are usually employees and suppliers, "and unfortunately they tend to be at the bottom of the food chain, so to speak," said Kovacevic.

"For any employees that get terminated throughout the process, unfortunately their termination and severance pay will be an unsecured claim, which means that they will likely receive cents on the dollar for those claims," she explained.

The Bay announced last week that it was seeking creditor protection, with its chief executive pointing to the COVID-19 pandemic and an ongoing trade war with the U.S. as external factors that have put financial pressure on the company.

Some experts say that the Bay's decline began long before the pandemic, tracing its issues back to its 2008 acquisition by the American investment firm NRDC Equity Partners, and saying that the company's new ownership prioritized its real estate over a cohesive retail strategy.

The company's lack of investment in its stores became evident in recent years, with floors understaffed, escalators and elevators in disrepair and faulty HVAC systems leading to temporary closures last summer.

 The Jefferson Parish Council has reached a deal with the Archdiocese of New Orleans to purchase Hope Haven in Marrero, the former orphanage where dozens of children were physically, sexually and psychologically abused decades ago by priests, brothers and nuns charged with caring for them.

The parish has been leasing the 15-acre campus, with its sprawling grounds and century-old, Spanish mission-style buildings, from the local Roman Catholic Church since 2018, and has already built a walking trail and recreational area on a portion of the site.

Now, it is moving forward with plans to purchase the property for $3.8 million and turn it into a multi-use complex that could include expanded recreational areas, festival grounds, educational attractions and, potentially, offices or apartments.

The redevelopment of Hope Haven by the parish is seen as a way to breathe new life into what stands as a stark reminder of one of the darkest chapters in the clergy abuse scandal, said Republican state Sen. Pat Connick, who represents the area and has been leading efforts to facilitate the deal between the parish, state, archdiocese and abuse survivors.

As part of the deal, the parish has agreed to create a memorial on the site in honor of the victims.

“This could be a win-win-win for everybody -- to put the property back into commerce and bring good life back to the campus,” Connick said. “Evil, sick things took place there but it is time to try to heal.”

The archdiocese, which filed for bankruptcy court protection nearly five years ago amid mounting claims of clergy sex abuse, will need permission from the court to sell the property. Thus far, it has not finalized a purchase agreement.

But all parties have agreed to the deal in principle, according to leaders with the parish, state and archdiocese.

“There are still some details to be worked out,” archdiocese spokesperson Sarah McDonald said in a statement Thursday. “But the site will become home to a permanent memorial to the memory and strength of abuse survivors."

Attorneys for the committee of abuse victims did not return a call seeking comment on the deal. But another attorney, Frank LaMothe, who has represented dozens of Hope Haven survivors over the years, said he thinks his past and current clients would be supportive of creating a monument there.

“It would mean a lot to them to know there is a recognition of what they went through,” Lamothe said, adding that he could not comment on the sale specifically because he has not been involved in the negotiations.

Hope Haven opened in 1925 on the west side of Barataria Boulevard, next to what is now Archbishop Shaw High School, to provide care for needy children and wards of the state. A few years later, Madonna Manor opened across the street.

Madonna Manor took in young children from families unable to care for them and children placed there by courts as wards of the state. Hope Haven was a home for older children.

In the early 2000s, nearly two dozen lawsuits were filed against the archdiocese and its affiliate, Catholic Charities, by adults who claimed they were molested, beaten and berated as children in the 1950s and 1960s by the priests and nuns that ran the two orphanages.  The archdiocese settled the suits for nearly $5.2 million in 2009.

Fresh lawsuits were filed nearly a decade later, alleging abuse that occurred at Hope Haven and Madonna Manor in the 1970s and 1980s. The suits were filed in 2018, after Archbishop Gregory Aymond released a list of credibly accused priests that included the names of eight priests who had worked at the orphanages.

In May 2020, the archdiocese filed for bankruptcy. In the years since, some 550 abuse survivors have filed claims alleging past abuse.  

Hope Haven would be the latest of nearly a dozen properties the church has sold as it seeks to raise money to settle claims. So far, the property sales have generated about $15 million, a fraction of the amount sought by victims, who have asked the archdiocese and local parishes to pony up more than $200 million, not including separate contributions they are seeking from church insurers.

At $3.85 million, the 15-acre campus Hope Haven campus, ringed with live oaks, might seem like a relative deal. The complex includes two large, century-old buildings of around 30,000 square feet each; a gymnasium dating back to 1930, and several smaller buildings. It was last appraised for $8 million, Parish Council member Deano Bonano said.

But since Jefferson began leasing the property from the archdiocese in 2018, the parish and state have spent nearly $5 million gutting, shoring and stabilizing the historic main building, which the archdiocese had allowed to deteriorate.

It has also spent a considerable amount developing a portion of the site into a recreational area with a 1/3-mile walking trail that snakes around the campus, a children's playground and an adult fitness area.

“Given what we have in it, we felt this was a fair price and it was in our best interest to buy it,” Bonano said.

Under the terms of the deal, the parish will put up $1.4 million towards the purchase price, money that the council approved at its meeting earlier this month. The state is contributing $2.4 million.

For Connick, who led the efforts to get the state money, the revival of Hope Haven has become something of a passion project.

“This could be something so positive for the community,” said Connick, whose grandfather ran a dairy farm near the campus a century ago.

There's no timeline for the deal to be finalized. But, once it is, the parish will begin advertising for proposals from developers interested in the site. A master plan for the property in 2022 suggests developing an aquatic center with indoor and outdoor pools and an outdoor concert venue, as well as an expanded recreational area.

Bonano says parish leaders envision it as “the center for health and fitness in West Jefferson,” much as Lafreniere Park is on the East Bank.  

The master plan also suggests leasing the two main buildings for use as senior or assisted living facilities, medical offices or apartments, and using the lease proceeds to pay for the other amenities.

The YMCA is also potentially interested in the site.

Connick said he'd like to see a children's museum in one of the buildings.

“Why not think big?” he said. “This is an opportunity to create something special for this side of the parish.”

U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose 200% tariffs on alcohol from Europe would serve a major blow to drinks makers on the continent, but it could have one unlikely beneficiary — the struggling beer industry.

President Trump said Thursday that he may target wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from France and other European nations after the European Union moved to reinstate an import tax on American whiskey in response to earlier Trump tariffs.

Such a levy, if enacted, could "literally wipe out" all global profits for some European drinks producers, Trevor Stirling, managing director and European beverages analyst at Bernstein, said Friday.

"If you take it at face value, for some of the producers, it could literally wipe out all of their global profits," Stirling told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe."

French spirits maker Rémy Cointreau — which derives around one-third of its global sales from the U.S., would likely be among the worst affected — Stirling said, noting that markets were currently failing to fully price in the impact of the proposed tax.

Wine and spirits firms Pernod Ricard, Rémy Cointreau and Davide Campari all fell more than 3% Thursday, following Trump's comments, with the latter two slipping again during Friday's session. LVMH, which owns Moët & Chandon and Hennessy among others, briefly turned positive Friday before slipping back in the red following nine negative sessions.

"Investors are perhaps being a little bit too blasé about the potential that there is a real risk it could be a 200% tariff," Stirling said, acknowledging that the rate was unusually high relative to those leveled against other countries and sectors. "One has learned never to underestimate the Trump administration."

The levies form part of Trump's broader vision to relocate global production to the U.S. — a strategy many analysts have questioned, particularly within the production-specific drinks and luxury sectors.

"Provenance matters when selling premium spirits and wine — cognac has to be from Cognac, champagne from Champagne etc. As a result, it is not a category that the Trump administration will encourage onshoring with," Chris Beckett, head of equity research at Quilter Cheviot, wrote in a note Thursday.

Nevertheless, the proposals could provide a boon for the already highly localized beer industry, which has been under pressure over recent quarters amid declining sales and shifting consumer habits.

"Beer is just not in the crosshairs of this. Beer looks like an island of stability right now," Stirling told "Squawk Box Europe."

AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, which owns brands including Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois, told CNBC last month that it sees limited impact from tariffs given its high levels of domestic production.

"We don't think that we're going to have big topics to discuss during this year in terms of tariffs," CEO Michel Doukeris said.

Heineken CEO Dolf van den Brink, meanwhile, in February described proposed U.S. tariffs, including on aluminum used in beer cans, to be "relatively manageable."

"The beer industry is capital intensive and it's very local. So, as such, it's an industry that's a bit less susceptible to disruption in international trade flows," he told "Squawk Box Europe" last month.

Oops, something went wrong

Gold made the sprint to $3,000 on Friday as uncertainties about the economy and an escalating trade war drove up demand for the safe-haven asset.

Gold (GC=F) futures rose to hover above $3,008 per ounce while spot gold reached above $3,001.

The precious metal was on track for a second straight week of gains amid new data indicating moderating inflation and the announcement of retaliatory tariffs from the United States' trading partners.

"Though it feels like a psychological threshold, gold at $3,000 might just be a stepping stone if trade wars deepen," said Tony Redondo, founder of Cosmos Currency Exchange. "That said, it's not all about Trump. Central banks, interest rate bets, geopolitical tensions, and inflation concerns are all stoking the flames."

Trade tensions grew this week after President Trump threatened 200% tariffs on wine and spirit imports from Europe on Thursday. The threat followed the EU's announcement of retaliatory tariffs after the US put a 25% duty on steel and aluminum.

Gold is up more than 12% year to date after making multiple record highs in recent months.

"All eyes are on how gold continues to play a role as a safe haven asset," said Joe Cavatoni, market strategist at the World Gold Council. "With rising inflation expectations, lower rates, and continued uncertainty, we continue to see support for gold looking ahead.”

Wall Street has been playing catch-up by raising price targets to keep pace with gold's rise.

In a note on Thursday, Macquarie Group predicted the precious metal will touch $3,500 in the third quarter.

"Year-to-date, gold has been running ahead of our expectations," wrote Marcus Garvey, head of commodities strategy at Macquarie.

"We are raising our gold price forecast to a 3Q25 quarter average peak of $3,150 per ounce and our single point price high to $3,500 per ounce," he added.

Wall Street strategists have attributed much of these gains to continued central bank buying and tariff uncertainty, including the possibility that even imports of the precious metal into the US won't be spared.

Institutional investors have shipped elevated amounts of physical gold bars to vaults in New York in a move to front-run tariffs and take advantage of a price disparity between London and New York.

The Ravens' approach to the initial wave of free agency has been on brand.

While other teams have gone on shopping sprees in a seller's market, General Manager Eric DeCosta prioritized signing his own players (left tackle Ronnie Stanley, fullback Patrick Ricard, and reportedly wide receiver/special-teamer Tylan Wallace) and making selective additions (wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, special teams ace/inside linebacker Jake Hummel).

The Athletic's Jeff Zrebiec said it's been a good week for the Ravens, but there is still "serious business" to be done.

"So far, the Ravens have done just fine. Better than that," Zrebiec wrote. "Their personnel losses have been minimal, and they were winners in free agency at the very moment when they agreed to the three-year deal with Stanley. Navigating the next couple of months of roster-building without a bona fide left tackle on the roster would have been a nightmare scenario. Reaching an agreement less than 48 hours before Stanley hit an open market filled with offensive tackle-needy teams willing to hand him a blank check was clutch.

"So, with the first wave of free agency already over, where does that leave them? They still have several needs — cornerback, safety, inside linebacker and edge rusher stand out — and next to no cap space to fill them. That's where the serious business comes in."

Zrebiec noted that the Ravens will probably have to make moves to create more salary-cap space in the coming days.

One way to do so is by contract restructures, and that process has already started. According to Russell Street Report's Brian McFarland, the Ravens have reworked cornerback Marlon Humprey's contract to create more than $13 million in cap space.

The Ravens have done a max restructure w/Marlon Humphrey by reducing his $18M salary & roster bonus to the league min of $1.255M & converting $16.745M to a bonus. Two void yrs were added. Restructure creates $13.396M in 2025 cap space.

While restructures are helpful, Zrebiec said the Ravens "ultimately are probably going to have to check off some big-ticket items." That could include a contract extension for Lamar Jackson.

"His 2025 cap number is $43.65 million, but it rises to $74.65 million in 2026 and 2027," Zrebiec wrote. "The 2025 number is manageable. The 2026-27 one is not, meaning at some point within the next 12 months, the Ravens and Jackson will need to hammer out a new deal anyway. What better time than the present, when it would give DeCosta some much-needed salary-cap breathing room?"

Zrebiec said a contract extension for running back Derrick Henry also could help. Furthermore, he said the Ravens would "have to at least weigh the benefits" of trading tight end Mark Andrews "if they get an enticing offer."

"To be clear, the Ravens don't have to do anything with their standout tight end," Zrebiec wrote. "Yet, Andrews is due a $4 million roster bonus on March 20, so a decision could come relatively soon."

It bears repeating just how big re-signing Stanley to a three-year deal reportedly worth $60 million before the start of free agency is for the Ravens.

NFL.com's Gregg Rosenthal said on “The Mina Kimes Show” that it speaks volumes about the Ravens' culture that Stanley chose to remain in Baltimore rather than spark a bidding war on the open market.

"The Patriots I think were going to go over the top with money, but the Chiefs I think were building their offseason plan around signing Ronnie Stanley, and he chose to stay with the Ravens," Rosenthal said. "They made him take a pay cut before last season. You have to be a pretty great organization from the top to the bottom, from the coaching staff to the administration, to make a dude take a pay cut and then the following year he's taking maybe less money or at least he's giving you the benefit of the doubt and wanting to stay home. This is how great teams can stay great, so I just love that."

Kimes agreed, saying: "The Ronnie Stanley deal was my favorite of the entire free agency from a team perspective. I think this is a huge win for the organization."

Both @greggrosenthal and I agree: The Ravens' deal with Ronnie Stanley was one of the biggest wins any team had in free agency. We discussed why on the pod 👇🎧: https://t.co/4OOdMhzjmE📺: https://t.co/PUdp4MUPch pic.twitter.com/e11EFxB2xX

NFL.com's Kevin Patra also named the Ravens re-signing Stanley as one of the best moves of the opening wave of free agency.

"The top tackle heading into free agency isn't even in the top 10 in per-year average salary among OTs. That's a W for the organization," Patra wrote. "The deal became a good one when the Ravens weren't forced to get to a $23 million- or $25 million-per-year figure to retain their left tackle. I also like the short-term nature of the pact for both sides. The structure allows Baltimore to get out of the deal relatively free after two years if the injury bug respawns. Likewise, if Stanley stays healthy and keys a Super Bowl run in Baltimore, he can push for a re-up in 2027 when no guaranteed money is left."

One item on the Ravens' to-do list is signing a backup quarterback.

Journeyman Josh Johnson, who had the job last season, is a free agent. Other veterans on the market include former Ravens Joe Flacco and Tyler Huntley, Jameis Winston, Trey Lance, Drew Lock, Carson Wentz, Desmond Ridder, Cooper Rush, and Teddy Bridgewater.

Flacco returning to the Ravens would be a great story, but could it actually happen?

"I think they'd be all for it if the price was right," Zrebiec wrote on X. "He's beloved in that building. I don't know if it's something he'd be interested in. He's never been the nostalgic type and if he's still playing, he's probably going to want to go to a place where he has better chance to start."

Flacco reportedly met with the New York Giants Thursday.

After being released by the 49ers, free-agent Pro-Bowl FB Kyle Juszczyk is meeting today with the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Republican Sen. Ted Cruz supports President Trump's use of tariffs, just not for the long term.

"I fully support the president using the threat of tariffs to incentivize Mexico and Canada to help secure the border. Now that being said, my home state of Texas does an enormous amount of trade with Mexico and Canada. I don't want to see the long-term economic policy being big tariffs against Mexico and Canada," Cruz told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).

"And so my hope is that those policies stay as an incentive rather than an ongoing feature of economic policy."

The president has paused 25% duties on Canadian and Mexican imports that comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada agreement (USMCA). But Trump on Wednesday hit Canada with 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum, backing off a floated 50% duty.

On Thursday, Trump said that if the European Union didn't remove a 50% tariff on whiskey, the US would place a 200% tariff on wine, champagne, and other alcoholic products.

Trump has implemented a second round of 10% duties on Chinese imports after instituting 10% in February.

The targeted countries wasted no time hitting back.

China unveiled a 15% tariff on US chicken, wheat, corn, and cotton products and an additional 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. The new tariffs from China began on Monday.

Canada announced a 25% tariff on 30 billion Canadian dollars of US imports.

As for Cruz, there is a lot at risk for his home state of Texas after brisk 3.9% GDP growth in 2024.

Mexico has been Texas's biggest trade partner for the past 16 years. Texas's top imports from Mexico include electric machinery, sound and TV equipment, various fuels, and medical and surgical equipment.

Texas houses about one-third of US refining capacity and refines crude oil imported from Canada and Mexico.

Businesses in the state may already be wary of the tariff pinch.

The latest Dallas Fed survey for February saw its production index — a barometer of state manufacturing conditions — plunge 21 points from January. The new orders index fell 11 points and the capacity utilization index declined 14 points.

Perceptions of broader business conditions worsened in February too.

"It's clear in the next four years, we will see more tariffs than we had the previous four years," Cruz said. "What I've urged him [the president] is two things. No. 1, focus on China. I have said for a long time that China poses the greatest geopolitical risk to the United States over the next hundred years. And so I want to see our economy delink from China."

"And then secondly, what I've urged the president to do is focus on reciprocity," he explained. "And the virtue of reciprocity is if President Trump imposes tariffs on a foreign country and the foreign country doesn't like those tariffs, they already have a solution to that, which is lower the tariffs they're putting on US goods."

 

Investors have reacted harshly this month to the flurry of tariff headlines.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.4% on Thursday, the 10th daily decline this year with a loss above 1% according to data from Creative Planning chief markets strategist Charlie Bilello. Last year, at this point, the S&P 500 had only three big down days, which Bilello said was "abnormally" low.

The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are each down by about 5% in March.

Some of the market's often most popular stocks, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR), have seen pullbacks of more than 10% from their 52-week highs.

Wall Street recession calls have begun to creep into the picture too.

"Well, look, there's no doubt there has been some uncertainty," Cruz said. "When I talk to business leaders, the most consistent question I get from them is what's going to happen on the tariff front? So I understand that uncertainty, and I think it'll take some time to have a clearer picture of what the exact tariff landscape is going to look like."

Elon Musk's electric carmaker Tesla has warned it and other US exporters could be harmed by countries retaliating to Donald Trump's trade tariffs.

Mr Musk is a close ally of the US president and is leading efforts to reduce the size of the federal government.

But in an unsigned letter addressed to the US trade representative, Tesla said while it "supports" fair trade it was concerned US exporters were "exposed to disproportionate impacts" if other countries retaliated to tariffs.

The letter was dated the same day that Trump hosted an event at the White House where he promised to buy a Tesla in a show of support for Mr Musk.

It is unclear who at Tesla wrote the letter as it is unsigned, or if Mr Musk was aware of it.

Tesla's share price has dropped 40% since the start of the year. Mr Musk is the carmaker's chief executive and while some have argued his alignment with the Trump administration is hurting its brand, market analysts say the share fall is more about worries over Tesla meeting production targets and a drop in sales over the past year.

In the letter, Tesla said it was making changes to its supply chains to find as many local suppliers for its cars and batteries so it was less reliant on foreign markets. 

"None the less," it warned, "even with aggressive localisation of the supply chain, certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the US."

The US president has imposed an additional 20% tariff on all imports from China, prompting Beijing to respond with retaliatory levies including on cars. China is Tesla's second biggest market after the US.

"For example, past trade actions by the United States have resulted in immediate reactions by the targeted countries, including increased tariffs on EVs imported into those countries," the letter reads. 

The EU and Canada have both threatened sweeping retaliations for tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into the US, which went into effect earlier this week.

Demonstrators have targeted Tesla showrooms in recent weeks in protest against Mr Musk's cost-cutting role in Trump's administration, where he is head of the  Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).

Earlier this week, Trump hosted an event at the White House where he said people protesting against Tesla should be labelled domestic terrorists, while sitting in the driver's seat of a brand new red Tesla that he said he planned to buy. 

Trump said demonstrators were "harming a great American company", and anyone using violence against the electric carmaker would "go through hell".

Car sharing has not taken off, but will electric cars boost its appeal?

The  deputy first minister has said she engages "with the office of president" rather than his "particular personal views".

Wine and spirits will be taxed, Trump says, if the EU does not remove tariffs on US whiskey.

The tariffs imposed by Donald Trump could not come at a worse time, says the steel industry body.

The Irish Whiskey Association urged the US and EU to engage in dialogue amidst an escalating trade war.

What we're reading

Economic data releases and earnings

The stock market is used to the wait-and-see approach from the Fed. But now the president is riffing on that game plan too.

Their deliveries contrast sharply. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is explicit. We can wait and are in a position to do so. And as the outlook evolves and the tariff landscape takes shape, the central bank can take action with its powder dry.

Trump is opaque. When a sympathetic business journalist recently asked him to offer clarity to the market, he scoffed. The stock market's tanking? So what. Another day, another tariff. But the similarities between the two leaders come in the form of detachment from Wall Street panic and a longer-term view.

Trump isn't exactly known for his patience. But on the issue of levies, he's been both unyielding in thought and transactional in practice. Mexico and Canada received some reprieve, but Europe is under new threats. And the dizzying back-and-forth has created a conceptual traffic jam of economic paralysis that has reverberated through consumer sentiment.

Trump is daring heads of state to respond, Powell is waiting for Trump to make up his mind and data to change, and Wall Street is looking for the White House and the Fed to get off the fence.

If Trump's distinctive tariff policy is a time bomb, the explosion of them taking effect isn't the only dangerous part. It's the ticking, the randomness of the timer, the affliction caused by the endless anticipation. Businesses may dislike tariffs. But what they really hate is uncertainty.

Meanwhile, the Fed has to make sense of fluctuating pricing pressures.

On Thursday, new inflation data showed price increases slowed in February — but economists saw warning signs that the central bank may interpret as reasons to continue waiting.

"Thursday's inflation data is backward looking, and the real worry is the inflationary effects that may come from tariffs, which is a wildcard for markets and the Federal Reserve," said Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management. "It's too early to tell what tariffs mean for inflation because we don't know yet the extent of the tariffs or if the administration will end up reversing course and adopting a more dovish tariff policy."

But if tariff clarity is delayed indefinitely, it's hard to imagine rate cuts not sharing that itinerary.

The waiting game has other ripple effects. As this newsletter has discussed this week, Wall Street is struggling to calibrate the timing of Trump's pronouncements with their potential longer-term consequences. What triggers a stock market sell-off today might actually boost corporate profits later this year. That's a favorable way of viewing Trump's America First strategy.

“If the Fed makes monetary policy decisions based on policies enacted today, they could make substantial cuts to interest rates in 2025," said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank. "On the other hand, if they assume that the overall fiscal stance will be more supportive of growth after factoring in decisions likely to be made later in the year, they may reduce rates only a little, if at all, in 2025."

Investors are used to the Fed's approach — and its straightforward dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. But they are still coming to grips with Trump's agenda. And as hard as it is to accept the sequencing of pain first and pleasure later, it's still not a guarantee.

So far, the only sure thing is discomfort for today and uncertainty for tomorrow.

Two recent readings on inflation showed price increases decelerated in February — but within the details, economists see warning signs.

Thursday's report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that its "core" Producer Price Index (PPI) — which tracks the price changes companies see and excludes food and energy — rose 3.4% from the year prior, down from the 3.6% seen in January. The day before, the bureau's Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed core prices rose 3.1% in February, the lowest yearly increase in core CPI since April 2021.

But the components from CPI and PPI that pass through to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure — the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index — indicate the closely followed inflation metric didn't fall in February.

Bank of America economists and several other Wall Street research teams now estimate that "core" PCE, which excludes food and energy, will show prices increased 2.7% in February, up from the 2.6% increase seen in January.

"This would indicate progress on inflation continues to stall and reinforces our call for the Fed to remain on hold," Bank of America US economist Stephen Juneau wrote in a note to clients.

The readings come amid investor fears that inflation may remain sticky while economic growth slows. In recent weeks, concerns over the latter have pushed markets to price in the possibility of a Fed interest cut in May. But after the two inflation readings, those bets have faded.

As of Thursday, markets were pricing in just a 30% chance the Fed cuts rates at its May meeting, down from a 52% chance seen a week ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool.

Economist Thomas Ryan also expects the two inflation readings to lead to an increase in the Fed's preferred inflation gauge for February.

"This is the opposite of the downward progress on inflation the Fed needs to see to justify easing policy further and reinforces our view that the window for cuts has already closed this year," the Capital Economics North America economist wrote.

Newsmax agreed to pay Smartmatic $40 million as part of a settlement last year following the voting technology company's election defamation lawsuit against the right-wing news outlet, according to a new regulatory filing.

The settlement, reached in September, included a cash payment and an option to purchase stock in Newsmax, the media company said in its filing. Newsmax said payments totaling $20 million have already been made, with the rest coming before July.

“Management believes the settlement with Smartmatic will, subject to the payment of all consideration in a timely manner, eliminate future legal expenses the Company would have expected to bear related to this suit, which could have included costly appellate legal actions and other matters,” Newsmax wrote.

Newsmax did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.

Details of the payments provide insight into the confidential settlement agreement that were not publicly available last year. The 2021 lawsuit centered on Newsmax's false claims that Smartmatic's machines manipulated the 2020 presidential election in favor of Joe Biden. A deal was reached shortly before the case was set to go to trial.

After the settlement last year, Newsmax said in a statement that it “acknowledges that the Court found that ‘allegations regarding whether the [2020 U.S. presidential election] and its results were somehow altered or manipulated by Smartmatic are factually false/untrue.'”

Smartmatic settled a related defamation lawsuit in April against One America News for a sum that also was not disclosed publicly.

 J. Erik Connolly, an external lawyer for Smartmatic, said in a statement Thursday that the company is now focused on a similar case against Fox News.

"We look forward to presenting our evidence to a jury and finally having the opportunity to hold Fox accountable for its harmful actions,” Connolly said.

Fox has said it covered newsworthy events and people surrounding the 2020 election.

Fox News' parent company, Fox Corp., reached a settlement in 2023 to pay $787.5 million to the election technology company Dominion Voting Systems to settle defamation claims.

Oops, something went wrong

The new year started off with considerable fanfare for the cryptocurrency market. Under President Donald Trump's crypto plan, America was going to become "the crypto capital of the world." That meant deregulating the crypto market, promoting innovative uses for blockchain technology within the financial markets, and becoming a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) superpower.

Those promises mostly have been kept. The White House even hosted a Crypto Summit on March 7. But broader macroeconomic weakness -- in the form of tariffs and recession fears -- have sent crypto markets tumbling. Cryptocurrencies are down across the board, so it's hard to tell what's hot, and what's not. So let's take a closer look at key Trump priorities for crypto.

The three hottest crypto sectors right now are decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and stablecoins. The easiest way to see this is by examining the crypto portfolio of World Liberty Financial, the Trump-affiliated crypto company that uses the tag line, "Shape a New Era of Finance." It went on a highly publicized crypto buying spree ahead of the inauguration as a show of support for Trump's crypto plan.

Currently, some of the biggest holdings of World Liberty Financial include Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK), Ondo, Aave, and Ethena. The company also holds two stablecoins: Tether and USDC. All of these holdings, in one way or another, reflect a core idea of Trump's crypto plan: creating new linkages between the world of traditional finance and the world of decentralized finance.

Decentralized finance really just refers to putting the traditional financial system on blockchain rails. Once you have a Layer-1 blockchain like Ethereum, it's possible to build on top of it. You can create new decentralized exchanges for trading digital assets. You can create new ways to borrow and earn money. And you can create enormous value by reducing the inefficiencies of the modern financial system.

Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is one of the hottest trends on Wall Street right now, and it's supported by top asset managers such as BlackRock. Tokenization refers to the transformation of traditional assets (such as stocks and bonds) into digital assets that can be traded on the blockchain. Once you do that, you can create new efficiencies and open up markets to new participants. For example, it's now possible to tokenize very illiquid assets (such as private equity and real estate) and put it all on the blockchain in the form of tradable crypto tokens.

It might be hard to believe that stablecoins are hot right now. After all, they are pegged 1-to-1 to the U.S. dollar, so they are supposed to trade for $1 at all times. You really can't speculate in stablecoins (unless you're betting that they will lose their peg), and many investors might not want to hold an asset like USDC or Tether that trades for $1 day in and day out.

But as Coinbase Global recently pointed out, stablecoins might just end up being the biggest story of the year for crypto. The Trump crypto plan calls for using stablecoins as the way to guarantee that the U.S. dollar remains the top reserve currency in the world.

To buy stablecoins, you need dollars. And right now, dollars are pouring into stablecoins at an unprecedented rate. The top five stablecoins now have a total market cap of more than $200 billion.

Three not-so-hot cryptocurrency sectors include meme coins, artificial intelligence (AI), and anything related to consumer-facing applications of blockchain technology (such as gaming, Web3, and the metaverse).

Remember the last crypto bull market rally? Prices of meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu were skyrocketing in value. Celebrities were spending millions of dollars to buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection. And people were buying digital real estate in the metaverse as a way of getting rich quick.

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of view), that type of speculative froth is unlikely to return anytime soon. The new Official Trump meme coin is down about 85% from its highs, nobody is buying expensive NFTs when the threat of recession is looming, and early attempts to combine AI and crypto -- such as by creating the brand-new position of White House AI & crypto czar -- have thus far been very low-key.

Still not convinced that consumer-facing crypto sectors are out of favor? Just search for images of the White House Crypto Summit that took place on March 7. The event looks unlike any crypto event you've ever seen. One iconic image from The New York Times looks like a formal Wall Street board meeting: The participants are dressed in dark business suits and ties, clapping politely, and sitting at a long, drab table under a gold chandelier and the watchful eye of Abraham Lincoln.

At this point, you're probably wondering: Why haven't you mentioned Bitcoin? For one, Bitcoin is not a sector, it's a single asset. And second, the Trump crypto plan is primarily focused on economic competitiveness and financial innovation. The stated goal is to "Make America Great Again."

To the extent that Bitcoin can help to accomplish that goal, it's important. For example, if it can help to strengthen the U.S. dollar, boost investor confidence in the American economy, help to pay down the nation's $36 trillion debt load, or bring new jobs to America, then it's important.

For now, though, it's perhaps more important to understand how the worlds of traditional finance and blockchain finance fit together, and what that means for America's financial future. I'm convinced that this is the key to figuring out which under-the-radar cryptocurrencies are the best investment opportunities right now.

Sellers of risk assets are taking a breather on Friday, with crypto markets posting sizable gains along with U.S. stocks after a week of lame price action.

Bitcoin topped $85,000 at one point during U.S. hours and is now trading at $84,400, up 4.7% over the past 24 hours. All cryptos in the CoinDesk 20 Index were higher during the same period, with Chainlink's LINK, Solana's SOL and SUI leading gains.

The price action happened as risk appetite returned to traditional markets as well. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq indexes were 1.7% and 2.3 up, respectively. Meanwhile, gold, whose price action trounced that of bitcoin during the selling of the past few weeks, backed down below $3,000 after crossing the level yesterday for the first time in its history.



"To see the market bouncing off these recent lows is most likely a combination of the macro news around risk assets (inflation/tariffs) and a sign that a more stable base for cryptocurrencies is coming into place given the drawdowns from the top just months ago,” Paul Howard, senior director of crypto trading firm Wincent, said in a Telegram note.

Some $2.6 billion in leveraged crypto derivatives positions have been liquidated over the past 7 days, predominantly longs, Howard pointed out, leaving the market on a healthier footing with flushing excessive leverage.



Today's bounce also propelled BTC back above its 200-day moving average after dipping below that trendline for the first time since last August's crypto correction. The 200-day moving average is a widely-used benchmark for traders and investors to gauge long-term trends for asset prices, often serving as support for prices to bounce in a bull market, while losing the level providing a risk-off or bear market signal.

Closing the day above the moving average, currently at $83,767, would be a win for bulls, fueling hopes that the worst of the correction might be over for now. Otherwise, confirming the moving average as resistance could foreshadow a deeper pullback.





Well-followed cross-asset trader Bob Loukas noted that bitcoin and stocks have more room to run "at least for a while," bouncing from oversold levels. "Feels like should be close to end of panic, for now at least, and spend at least a few weeks back recovering," he said earlier this week. "Then the market reassess."

Bitcoin price remained constrained within a tight 8% channel between $76,000 and $84,472 this week. With conflicting market catalysts preventing prolonged directional swings, here are key factors that moved BTC prices this week, as well as key indicators to watch in the weeks ahead. 

Bitcoin (BTC) faces considerable volatility this week. With conflicting market signals counteracting short-term, traders were unable to establish any dominant directional trend across the crypto markets this week.

The current price chart shows BTC  trading above the $83,300 mark on Friday. In relative terms: Bitcoin is posting 3% gains for the week, rising from the opening price of around $80,700 on Sunday. 

This represents a significant recovery compared to last week when United States President Donald Trump's confirmation of trade tariffs on Canada and Mexico had triggered an 8% sell-off with over $900 million in liquidations. 

In other notable price movements this week, Bitcoin prices briefly plunged below the $80,000 support for three consecutive days between Tuesday and Thursday. 

Bitcoin price may face weaker support if prices plunge that low in the coming week, as recent retests may have prompted traders to adjust their stop losses or close out long positions to avoid losses from the next retest. 

The Trump trade war narrative intensified this week, with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promising retaliatory measures.

Heading into the week, global markets were on edge due to inflation risks in the initial US Nonarm Payrolls data released last Friday.

However, those fears eased momentarily after the US CPI and PPI data showed easing inflation metrics this week.

Historically, Bitcoin demand surges when markets anticipate less hawkish Fed decisions, but current macro pressures surrounding the trade war are suppressing risk appetite, especially among retail traders. 

Bitcoin ETFs saw $143 million in outflows on Thursday, following $13 million in inflows on Wednesday—the first positive flows since the start of March.

In total, investors withdrew another $830 million this week, bringing total outflows in March to $1.7 billion.

Persistent ETF sell-offs continue to fuel short-term volatility in Bitcoin prices as uncertainty around the US trade war and Trump's crypto strategic reserve proposal unsettles investors. 

Florida governor candidate Byron Donalds is preparing to introduce legislation to codify Donald Trump's executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Bloomberg reported on Friday.

The bill aims to prevent future administrations from overturning Trump's policy, which allows the US Treasury to hold 200,000 Bitcoin and prohibits the sale of reserve Bitcoin. Donalds positioned the move as a defense against what he calls the Democrats' “war on crypto.”

The bill faces significant hurdles, requiring 60 votes in the Senate and a majority in the House of Representatives to advance. 

Texas lawmakers have introduced HB 4258, a legislative proposal to allocate $250 million from the state's economic stabilization fund to Bitcoin and other digital assets.

The bill follows SB 778, which recently gained bipartisan support in the Texas Senate. If enacted, HB 4258 would take effect in 2025 and allow municipalities and counties to invest up to $10 million in digital assets.

The overhang of multiple bearish macro pressures means that Bitcoin price remains at major downside risks despite 3% gains this week. 

On the positive side, crypto bettors on prediction market platforms Polymarkets anticipate a Fed rate pause next week, while others are counting on easing geopolitical pressure between Russia and Ukraine.

If these expectations materialize, improved risk appetite could drive renewed inflows into Bitcoin and crypto assets, supporting further upside momentum next week.

Bitcoin price is trading at $84,833.67 after posting 5% gains the week.

However, with BTC yet to recoup last week's 8% losses, technical indicators show that bulls are not in complete dominance of the markets. 

First, the Parabolic SAR dots remain above the current BTC price, indicating bearish momentum.

Likewise, the Bollinger Bands show tightening volatility, with resistance at $110,676 and support near $76,505.



Bitcoin Price Forecast | BTCUSD Weekly Chart

If delayed Fed rate hike and easing geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia ease up, Bitcoin price must break above the mid-Bollinger Band at $93,591, it could signal a return to bullish momentum. 

Conversely, a bearish breakdown could see Bitcoin testing the lower Bollinger Band at $76,505.

Increased sell volume, as seen in recent weeks, suggests a risk of deeper downside. In this scenario, a close below $75,000 could accelerate selling pressure, leading to a potential retest of $68K or lower.

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 13 Best Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) stands against other best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now.

Cryptocurrency stocks are on the move in the aftermath of US President Donald Trump announcing plans for a “Crypto Strategic Reserve.” The possibility of a cryptocurrency reserve is a significant step toward Trump's goal of making the United States the global center of cryptocurrency.

The United States already possesses several strategic stockpiles, such as medical and military assets. In times of need, the government draws from these unique reserves. To keep the Federal Reserve afloat, the government would probably be actively purchasing and disposing of cryptocurrencies as part of the strategic reserve push.

“This move signals a shift toward active participation in the crypto economy by the U.S. government,” said Federico Brokate, head of U.S. business at 21Shares, a digital assets investment management firm. “It has the potential to accelerate institutional adoption, provide greater regulatory clarity, and strengthen the U.S.'s leadership in digital asset innovation.”

Additionally, some Bitcoin holders think that a cryptocurrency reserve may act as an inflation hedge. They contend that at times of global economic crisis, the value of Bitcoin may surpass that of the dollar, citing the currency's declining worth over time. However, cryptocurrencies have shown to be highly volatile during recent geopolitical events, like Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, some experts believe that the US government purchasing Bitcoin could endanger the dollar's standing internationally.

Critics contend that cryptocurrency is a speculative investment and has historically been volatile, while proponents claim that the proceeds may be used to pay down the country's massive debt. Approximately 200,000 Bitcoin tokens are thought to be held in the United States due to illegal seizures. The total value of that exceeds $17 billion. With a reserve, these holdings might be expanded to include three lesser-known cryptocurrencies, XRP, Solana, and Cardano, in addition to Ethereum.

Amid the “crypto strategic reserve” push, cryptocurrency stocks' popularity is growing as investors explore ways of diversifying their investment portfolio beyond traditional asset classes. The stocks stand out partly because they offer crypto exposure without requiring one to own the underlying volatile crypto asset. Additionally, the stocks provide both growth potential and innovation. Many experts regard them as being safer than direct cryptocurrency investments.

To determine the 13 best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now, we analyzed the US market for companies with exposure to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Our in-depth analysis focused on firms with solid prospects due to their investments in cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology. We reviewed ETFs and financial media reports to compile a preliminary list. Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on the hedge fund stakes in them during Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) operates a technology platform that enables digital payments for merchants and consumers worldwide. The company has sought to strengthen its growth prospects by pursuing opportunities in the crypto space. As it pursues its goal of making it easier for people to use cryptocurrencies in everyday commerce, it is emerging as one of the best stocks to own to gain exposure in the burgeoning sector.

In an effort to broaden its customer offerings, PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) began allowing merchants to purchase, hold, and sell cryptocurrency from their business accounts late last year. With the most users of any peer-to-peer money movement app, Venmo could become a leading cryptocurrency platform with its new feature. It serves as a solid access point for investors who wish to buy significant cryptocurrencies and then use them to purchase Altcoins or access decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

For quicker, less expensive transactions, its stablecoin, PYUSD, which was first introduced on Ethereum, was extended to Solana. Additionally, PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) collaborates with more than 25 businesses to further incorporate PYUSD into the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

Overall, PYPL ranks 1st on our list of best cryptocurrency stocks to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of PYPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than PYPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have remained in a strong downtrend this year, shedding over $1 trillion in value. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has crashed from the year-to-date high of $109,300 to $82,000, while popular altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) have had deeper dives. 

Crypto prices have fallen due to rising fear in the financial markets. The crypto fear and greed index has dropped to the extreme fear zone of 19. Similarly, the fear gauge tracked by CNN Money has dropped to 20.

The main catalyst for this sell-off is growing concern that the United States is heading toward a self-inflicted recession due to Donald Trump's tariffs. 

These fears have outweighed positive news in the crypto industry. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission has ended numerous lawsuits affecting companies like Uniswap, Kraken, and Coinbase. 

Further, Donald Trump has signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital coins stockpile. Also, more institutional investors like Citadel, Blackrock, Rumble, and Trump Media have started to acquire Bitcoin.

Bitcoin and altcoins could face further declines if the S&P 500 index forms a death cross pattern — a technical formation that occurs when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross each other. This pattern often signals the start of a prolonged bear market.

The spread between the 50-day and 200-day weighted moving averages (WMA) of the S&P 500 index has continued to narrow. The 50-day WMA is at $5,900, while the 200-day WMA is at $5,857. A crossover would likely lead to further downside, as the index dropped 23% the last time it formed this pattern in 2022.

The S&P 500 index is often seen as a reliable indicator for the crypto market since both are considered risky assets and tend to move in correlation.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price has already formed a death cross, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossing each other. This cross happened after Bitcoin dropped below key support at $89,000 — the neckline of the double-top pattern at $108,500. A double top is one of the most bearish patterns in technical analysis.

Therefore, the most likely scenario is that Bitcoin drops to either $73,722 or $68,960 before bouncing back. The initial target is the highest swing in March last year, while the second is the highest point in November 2021.

A potential catalyst that may prevent further S&P 500 and crypto market crash is the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week. A more dovish tone as the US dollar index and the bond market suggests would likely lead to a rebound.

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

Russia has begun using cryptocurrencies in oil transactions with China and India to circumvent Western sanctions, Reuters reported on March 14, citing four sources familiar with the matter.

The cryptocurrency scheme currently represents a small fraction of Russia's $192 billion annual oil trade, according to the International Energy Agency, but its usage is reportedly increasing. 

According to the report, Chinese and Indian buyers of Russian oil pay intermediary trading firms in yuan or rupees. 

The funds are then deposited into offshore accounts, converted into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Tether stablecoins, and withdrawn to another account before being exchanged for rubles in Russia.

Reuters' sources suggested that Russia will likely continue using digital currencies in energy trade even if Western sanctions are lifted, citing the speed and flexibility of cryptocurrency transactions. 

Meanwhile, China's state-owned oil companies are reportedly reducing purchases of Russian crude due to concerns over U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported, citing industry sources. 

The move comes as the Trump administration on March 13 declined to renew an exemption that previously allowed Russian banks to access U.S. payment systems for energy transactions.

The decision is expected to complicate Russian oil purchases and could contribute to higher global energy prices.

Ethereum is preparing for its Pectra upgrade, which aims to boost the network's scalability and offer better staking flexibility, by launching a testnet on Monday codenamed Hoodi. This comes after two previous testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, encountered technical issues.

If all goes to plan, it could hit mainnet as early as April 25.

The second largest cryptocurrency's price appears unmoved by this news. Over the past 24 hours, the Ethereum price has gained only 0.5% and is currently trading at just over $1,900, according to CoinGecko data. Zooming out, ETH has lost 13.3% in the past week amid macro pressures from President Trump's trade war.

The Pectra uprade will be the third upgrade to the network since The Merge in 2022, which saw Ethereum move from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. Pectra looks to boost Ethereum's scalability, efficiency, and staking flexibility as it expands storage capacity for layer-2 networks. It'll reduce fees, too.

Previous tests of the upgrade faced challenges, most notably Holesky saw an uptick in invalid blocks. As a result, devs are launching Hoodi on Monday, March 17 in hopes it'll address the issues seen with the last testnet.

Ethereum has become the butt of many jokes across the broader crypto community, with fans of other networks mocking the network for its slow development rate and ETH's poor price action. Over the past year, according to TradingView, Ethereum has lost 52% of its share of market cap dominance. That's left room for coins like XRP to gain 258.98%.

But slow and steady wins the race—or so Ethereum maxis would have other investors believe.

Pectra aims to allow users to pay gas fees with multiple tokens, including stablecoins like USDC. It'll also allow for third-party fee sponsorship, which allows an entity to pay gas fees on behalf of the user—something that has become hugely important on layer-2 scaling networks.

On top of this, Ethereum validators will have a significantly increased capacity for how many tokens they can stake—from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. The uptick will be coupled with more flexibility for when and how the staked Ethereum can be withdrawn.

Pectra will also lay the groundwork for social recovery, which allows users to rely on trusted contacts to help them regain access to a wallet that they've forgotten or lost the key to.

With this, many believe that Pectra will be the biggest upgrade to Ethereum since The Merge and one of its largest in its history.

Once Ethereum's core developers “feel confident” in the state of testing, a mainnet update will be scheduled at least 30 days after the Hoodi fork. This means that the earliest the network could see the Pectra upgrade go live is April 25.

March 14, 2025 - Washington, D.C. - On Thursday, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter to United States Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urging the Department to cease all attempts to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, citing President Trump's glaring conflicts of interest. 

“I write regarding President Trump's recent executive order on the creation of a strategic reserve for cryptocurrency—an asset class that Mr. Trump initially wrote off as a ‘scam.'  Such a reserve provides no discernible benefit to the American people but would significantly enrich the President and his donors.  It would also constitute unsound fiscal policy by picking winners among currencies via social media and wasting taxpayer dollars on a plan that one federal reserve official described as ‘the dumbest idea' ever.  I urge you to cease all attempts to create the strategic cryptocurrency reserve,” wrote Ranking Member Connolly. 

The letter follows President Trump's announcement on Truth Social of plans to create a cryptocurrency reserve including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano as part of the Administration's January 23, 2025, Executive Order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” as well as President Trump's March 6, 2025 Executive Order on the “Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile.”

In his letter, the Ranking Member notes that at no point during the process of instituting such a cryptocurrency reserve has the President consulted with Congress, nor has the President indicated his intention to seek congressional authorization to create the strategic reserve. 

Ranking Member Connolly highlighted President Trump's conflicts of interest in this endeavor, including: 

“The creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve is poised to enrich the President and his closest allies at the expense of American taxpayers.  I urge you to cease all plans to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, and request that you provide a briefing to the staff of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,”  concluded Ranking Member Connolly. 

The Ranking Member also requested answers to his questions no later than March 27, 2025.

While oil firms embrace digital currencies, Russia's digital ruble initiative faces delays and technical hurdles.

Russia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters reported on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.

According to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins like Tether's USDT. This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.

Typically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.

These transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.

Although crypto adoption in Russia's oil trade remains limited, it is part of a broader trend. Over the past year, the country has introduced new regulations governing crypto mining, taxation, and international trade.

Western sanctions imposed over Russia's military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.

While Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.

Last month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina announced an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.

However, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.

The survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.

Meanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.

At the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.

Given these challenges, Russia's national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.

Russia is turning to bitcoin and crypto to facilitate oil trades with China and India, circumventing sanctions imposed on Ukraine. 

Amid ongoing sanctions over the war in Ukraine, Russia has turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate some of its oil trade with major buyers China and India.

According to a Reuters report, Russian oil companies and traders increasingly conduct transactions in bitcoin and crypto, allowing them to circumvent restrictions from Western nations. Sources say monthly trade volumes are already in the tens of millions of dollars.

The mechanism involves Chinese or Indian buyers purchasing oil and depositing yuan or rupees into an offshore account owned by a middleman company. The middleman then converts the fiat currency into crypto and transfers it to an account in Russia, where it is exchanged into rubles.

While crypto-based oil payments are still a fraction of Russia's $192 billion total oil trade, the practice is growing as sanctions bite. The trend highlights the utility of bitcoin and crypto in enabling transaction settlement for sanctioned nations. Iran and Venezuela have adopted similar crypto strategies. Bitcoin and crypto's censorship resistance allows value transfer beyond the reach of sanctions.

In late 2024, Russia's finance minister publicly endorsed using crypto in foreign trade. The Kremlin sees bitcoin and crypto as one of several effective strategies to overcome financial penalties imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. The Bank of Russia also recently proposed legalizing crypto investments for wealthy citizens.

However, Russia's oil trade still relies primarily on fiat currencies. President Donald Trump's administration is debating whether to ease some restrictions to improve relations with Moscow.

With the Ukraine conflict still unresolved, Russia's pivot toward leveraging bitcoin and decentralized technologies appears to aim to reduce its reliance on traditional finance and dollar settlements. Other countries under U.S. sanctions are likely to be monitored closely.

Users searching for pirated software are the target of a new malware campaign that delivers a previously undocumented clipper malware called MassJacker, according to findings from CyberArk.

Clipper malware is a type of cryware (as coined by Microsoft) that's designed to monitor a victim's clipboard content and facilitate cryptocurrency theft by substituting copied cryptocurrency wallet addresses with an attacker-controlled one so as to reroute them to the adversary instead of the intended target.

"The infection chain begins at a site called pesktop[.]com," security researcher Ari Novick said in an analysis published earlier this week. "This site, which presents itself as a site to get pirated software, also tries to get people to download all sorts of malware."

The initial executable acts as a conduit to run a PowerShell script that delivers a botnet malware named Amadey, as well as two other .NET binaries, each compiled for 32- and 64-bit architecture.

The binary, codenamed PackerE, is responsible for downloading an encrypted DLL, which, in turn, loads a second DLL file that launches the MassJacker payload by injecting it into a legitimate Windows process called "InstalUtil.exe."

The encrypted DLL incorporates features that enhance its evasion and anti-analysis ability, including Just-In-Time (JIT) hooking, metadata token mapping to conceal function calls, and a custom virtual machine to interpret commands as opposed to running regular .NET code.

MassJacker, for its part, comes with its own anti-debugging checks and a configuration to retrieve all the regular expression patterns for flagging cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard. It also contacts a remote server to download files containing the list of wallets under the threat actor's control.

"MassJacker creates an event handler to run whenever the victim copies anything," Novick said. "The handler checks the regexes, and if it finds a match, it replaces the copied content with a wallet belonging to the threat actor from the downloaded list."

CyberArk said it identified over 778,531 unique addresses belonging to the attackers, with only 423 of them containing funds totaling approximately $95,300. But the total amount of digital assets held in all these wallets prior to them being transferred out stands at around $336,700.

What's more, cryptocurrency worth about $87,000 (600 SOL) has been found parked in a single wallet, with over 350 transactions funneling money into the wallet from different addresses. 

Exactly who is behind MassJacker is unknown, although a deeper examination of the source code has identified overlaps with another malware known as MassLogger, which has also leveraged JIT hooking in an attempt to resist analysis efforts.

Chinese scientists have unveiled an artificial intelligence (AI) "agent" that makes its own decisions without requiring specific instructions from a human operator.

The AI agent, Manus, was developed by Chinese startup Butterfly Effect. Its representatives claim it is the world's first general AI agent — meaning it demonstrates a level of autonomy that current AI models lack. The scientists who created Manus say it shows a potential glimpse of what artificial general intelligence (AGI) may one day be capable of.

This emerging type of AI responds to text prompts, similar to chatbots such as ChatGPT or DeepSeek. However, unlike chatbots, they work on different tasks, without the need for frequent, step-by-step instructions.

Manus isn't available to the general public yet, but a limited distribution of invite codes has given a select few access, sparking a flurry of interest online. Some users appear to have created playable video games from simple prompts, while others have used Manus to design and launch websites.

It's still early days for Manus, however, with some users reporting crashes and other issues such as a tendency to get stuck in an infinite feedback loop. The company is also aware of relatively high failure rates in Manus versus ChatGPT. Chief scientist Peak Ji acknowledged these as part of the teething issues in launching a new tool on the social media platform X.

Reporter Caiwei Chen, who had access to Manus for MIT Technology Review, wrote that the experience was "like collaborating with a highly intelligent and efficient intern." However, Chen also noted that Manus sometimes lacked understanding of what it was supposed to do, made incorrect assumptions and cut corners. "Ultimately, it's promising but not perfect," Chen wrote.

Manus AI is the second Chinese AI tool to send shock waves through the tech industry this year. In January, DeepSeek changed the landscape of AI by achieving similar or better chatbot results than its American competitors for reportedly a fraction of the cost. Manus, on the other hand, could represent the first of an entirely new generation of AI.

Chatbots usually run on a single large language model (LLM), while Manus uses multiple LLMs and other independently operating software to work autonomously on a variety of tasks, MIT Technology Review reported. This is also known as a multi-agent architecture, in which multiple components communicate and collaborate to process tasks.



In a head-to-head between Manus and ChatGPT, the agent will often provide more detailed responses than the chatbot — a claim which the company has reinforced with testing data from the GAIA benchmark. However, Manus also takes a lot longer to provide those responses as it does deeper research, Tom's Guide reported.

In other words, Manus will effectively go its own way and figure out what to do in response to a prompt, rather than relying on step-by-step instructions like a chatbot does. It's designed to start tasks on its own and dynamically adjust its approach along the way, Forbes reported.

—'Math Olympics' has a new contender — Google's AI now 'better than human gold medalists' at solving geometry problems

—Older AI models show signs of cognitive decline, study shows — but not everyone is entirely convinced

Give Manus a single prompt, and it will navigate the web, write code and analyze data for its reply, without requiring further intervention as a conventional LLM-powered chatbot would.

Some examples Manus AI has demonstrated on its website include planning a detailed holiday itinerary, analyzing the stock market and screening job resumes. The difference between this and a tool like ChatGPT is that Manus can break down and complete complex tasks without continuous input. The system works from the cloud, too, so users can close their computers at any time, and Manus will keep working in the background.

The arrival of a general AI agent brings a new wave of ethical questions and considerations surrounding the use of AI. Agents behave more like humans, but unlike humans, they can work fast and continuously — provided they don't crash — and never get tired.

Dark energy, the mysterious phenomenon that powers the expansion of the universe, may undergo periodic 'violent transitions' that reverse the growth of the cosmos, a new pre-print study hints.

Dark energy may have switched directions sometime in the distant past — and this violent transition may explain why cosmological observations aren't adding up, researchers propose in a new paper.

The modern picture of the evolution of the universe is known as ΛCDM (or lambda-CDM), for dark energy (represented by the Greek letter Λ) and cold dark matter. Dark energy is the mysterious force driving the accelerating expansion of the universe, and cold dark matter refers to the mysterious, invisible substance that provides most of the mass of almost every single galaxy.

This model has explained a wide variety of observations, such as the behavior of galaxies and clusters, the growth of large-scale structures, and the appearance of the cosmic microwave background. But in recent years, two troubling tensions have popped up.

One such problem, known as the Hubble tension, is a difference in measuring the present-day expansion rate of the universe, a number known as the Hubble constant. Probes of the distant, early universe seem to be giving estimates significantly lower than probes of the nearby, late universe do.

Related: After 2 years in space, the James Webb telescope has broken cosmology. Can it be fixed?

Related to this issue is the second problem, known as the sigma-8 tension. This is a measure of how clumpy matter is in the universe, and once again, different probes are yielding different results.

Something in the ΛCDM model has to be wrong, but we're not sure what. One hypothesis is that dark energy might be more dynamic than we originally thought. In the usual ΛCDM picture, dark energy is a cosmological constant. It stays the same through cosmic history.

But in a recent model that's been gaining interest, dark energy changes. And not by a little; it undergoes a complete phase transition, from decelerating the universe to accelerating the universe.

Now, adding a twist to that theory, a research team has explored the possibility that the phase change is even more dramatic. In a paper posted to the preprint server arXiv in February but not yet peer-reviewed, dark energy doesn't just switch signs; it also changes strength, so that it powers an acceleration differently than it powers a deceleration.

Then, the researchers tested their model against a wide variety of observations and datasets. These included the Planck space observatory's measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the oldest light we can see in the universe; a measurement of a phenomenon called the baryon acoustic oscillation, a pattern in the arrangement of galaxies at very large scales; the Pantheon dataset of supernova distance measures; and a weak lensing map that provides details accounting for the effects of dark matter.

—Cosmic voids may explain the universe's acceleration without dark energy

—'Heavy' dark matter would rip our understanding of the universe apart, new research suggests

—Something invisible and 'fuzzy' may lurk at the Milky Way's center, new research suggests

They found that the new model alleviated some of the Hubble and sigma-8 tensions, and thus they contend that this approach might be a promising way forward.

That said, the researchers noted that this model isn't exactly grounded in known physics. It's just a toy, a way to explore the physical consequences of a model without knowing the underlying physics. But because it seems like a promising direction, this approach could motivate theorists to come up with mechanisms to explain how dark energy might switch like this.

No matter what, it appears that the universe — especially dark energy — is more complicated than we assumed.

Skywatchers snapped photos of the "blood moon" hovering above North and South America last night. Here's a gallery of images to celebrate the total lunar eclipse.

A "blood moon" was visible from Earth last night, marking the first total lunar eclipse since 2022.

A total lunar eclipse occurs when a full moon passes directly through Earth's shadow, casting our planet's natural satellite in a reddish, blood-like hue — often called a blood moon.

Skywatchers across the Americas snapped photographs of this unusual phenomenon as the moon completed its lunar phase on Thursday night and into Friday morning (March 13 to 14).



In North America, one photographer captured the "blood moon" rising over the Statue of Liberty in New York, while another caught it peaking out of the clouds above the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

Further south, photos revealed the moon passing by the Little Prince monument in El Salvador and the Young Woman of Amajac statue in Mexico City.



A lunar eclipse is the opposite of a solar eclipse, when the moon slides between Earth and the sun. During a lunar eclipse, the moon travels behind Earth relative to the position of the sun, meaning the satellite is cast in shadow.

The moon is still visible during this lunar phase because some light from the sun refracts through Earth's atmosphere and hits the satellite before reflecting back to the surface of our planet facing the moon. The sun projects a spectrum of different colors in its light — the seven colors of the rainbow, plus infrared and ultraviolet light. However, particles in Earth's atmosphere scatter blues and other short-wavelength light, while allowing the longer-wavelength oranges and reds to pass through — similar to a sunset or sunrise — and then splash onto the moon.

—Earth's moon could've had Saturn-like rings, new study hints

—Is the moon still geologically active? Evidence says it's possible

Not every full moon results in a lunar eclipse. The event only happens when the moon is perfectly aligned behind our planet. If that alignment is slightly off, then the sun's light can still directly reach some of the moon — meaning it's a partial eclipse.

The next total lunar eclipse will occur on the night of Sept. 7 to 8, but it will only be visible in western North America. Around this time next year, there will be another blood moon that will be visible in all of North America.

About 10 minutes with a therapy dog soothed kids who felt anxious about being emergency room patients.

A clinical trial found that after spending time with a dog, young patients reported a significantly larger decrease in their anxiety than kids who didn't have dog time. The patients' parents also perceived significantly reduced anxiety in their kids, researchers report March 14 in JAMA Network Open.

Managing kids' anxiety and pain while receiving emergency medical care is a key part of the treatment plan, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Many pediatric emergency departments have child life specialists, who explain procedures in developmentally appropriate ways and help young patients cope with stress through play therapy and other methods.

The new clinical trial, which took place at Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis from early 2023 to mid-2024, investigated whether adding a dog therapy visit would calm young patients even further. Riley Children's Hospital has a dog therapy program in place. The dogs are vaccinated, have yearly vet checks and are certified as therapy animals.

All 80 participants in the trial, admitted patients 5 to 17 years old, worked with child life specialists. Forty of the patients also spent around 10 minutes with a therapy dog and the dog's handler. Kids who were fearful of dogs or had allergies to the animals were excluded from the trial.

The research team evaluated the kids' anxiety, and parents' perception of their kids' anxiety, with the FACES scale, which shows a series of faces in different amounts of distress. The scale ranges from zero, or no anxiety, to 10, or very severe anxiety.

The baseline, self-reported score for all 80 patients was 5.4 on average. Forty-five minutes after time with the child life specialists and, for those receiving it, the dog therapy visit, the research team assessed anxiety again. The kids getting the usual care saw an average drop in their score of 1.5, while the kids who hung out with therapy dogs had an average drop of 2.7 points. The pattern held true when the parents of the kids assessed their kids' anxiety over time.

The End-Permian mass extinction killed an estimated 80% of life on Earth, but new research suggests that plants might have done okay.

The mass extinction that killed 80% of life on Earth 250 million years ago may not have been quite so disastrous for plants, new fossils hint. Scientists have identified a refuge in China where it seems that plants weathered the planet's worst die-off.

The end-Permian mass extinction, also known as the "Great Dying," took place 251.9 million years ago. At that time, the supercontinent Pangea was in the process of breaking up, but all land on Earth was still largely clustered together, with the newly formed continents separated by shallow seas. An enormous eruption from a volcanic system called the Siberian Traps seem to have pushed carbon dioxide levels to extremes: A 2021 study estimated that atmospheric CO2 got as high as 2,500 parts per million (ppm) in this period, compared with current levels of 425 ppm. This caused global warming and ocean acidification, leading to a massive collapse of the ocean ecosystem.

The situation on land is far hazier. Only a handful of places around the world have rock layers containing fossils from land ecosystems at the end of the Permian and beginning of the Triassic.

A new study of one of these spots — located in what is now northeastern China —revealed a refuge where the ecosystem remained relatively healthy despite the Great Dying. In this place, seed-producing gymnosperm forests continued to grow, complemented by spore-producing ferns.

"At least in this place, we don't see mass extinction of plants," study co-author Wan Yang, a professor of geology and geophysics at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, told Live Science.

The finding, published Wednesday (March 12) in the journal Science Advances, adds weight to the idea that the Great Dying was more complicated on land than in the seas, Yang said.



Yang and his colleagues looked at rock layers in Xinjiang that span the mass extinction event.

A major advantage of this now-desert site is that the rocks include layers of ash that hold tiny crystals called zircons. The zircons include radioactive elements — lead and uranium — that gradually decay, which enables researchers to determine how long it has been since the crystals formed. This means the researchers can more accurately date the rock layers here than they can at other sites.

Some of these layers also hold fossil spores and pollen. These fossils reveal that there wasn't a massive die-off and repopulation but a slow changeover of species, Yang said.

This is consistent with other evidence from Africa and Argentina, where plant populations seemed to have shifted gradually rather than dying off dramatically and then repopulating, said Josefina Bodnar, a paleobotanist at the National University of La Plata in Argentina who was not involved in the research.

Land plants "have a lot of adaptations that allow them to survive this extinction," Bodnar told Live Science. "For example, [they have] subterranean structures, roots or stems, that can survive perhaps hundreds of years." Seeds can also persist a long time, she added.



This survival may have been particularly possible at humid, high-latitude regions. The site in Xinjiang was once dotted with lakes and rivers, a few hundred miles from the coast. Other places where plant refuges have been found, such as Argentina, were also high-latitude in the Permian, far from the equator where temperatures were the hottest.

Yang and his colleagues found that during the late Permian and early Triassic, the climate became a bit drier in what is now Xinjiang — but not enough to cause deforestation.

This may have been a consequence of location, said Devin Hoffman, a researcher in paleontology at University College London who was not involved in the new study. Marine animals had no escape from global ocean acidification. But climate change on land wasn't uniform. The impact would have been most pronounced in the center of Pangea, which was a vast desert.

This means that in more temperate regions on land, survival could have been possible, Hoffman told Live Science. "You essentially have everything being pushed toward the poles and towards the coast, but on land you're able to escape some of the effects," he said.



These findings have led to some debate over whether the greatest mass extinction ever deserves the moniker on land. "I will call it a crisis on land. I will not call it an extinction," said Robert Gastaldo, an emeritus professor of Geology at Colby College who was not involved in the new study, but who has collaborated with Yang in the past.

The end-Permian extinction is particularly interesting to scientists because it was driven by greenhouse gases, much like climate change today. The situation was far more extreme then: The polar ice caps melted completely — a situation that would cause sea levels to rise a staggering 230 feet (70 meters) today.

But humans may be nearly as deadly as giant volcanoes. A 2020 study, for example, found that a smaller extinction event at the end of the Triassic (201 million years ago) was driven by greenhouse gas pulses from volcanoes that were on a similar scale to what humans are expected to emit by the end of this century. Studying these ancient catastrophes can give us a sense of what to expect under atmospheric carbon dioxide levels people have never experienced, Gastaldo said.

"The planet has experienced it," he said. "The planet's memory is in the rock record. And we can learn from the rock record what happens to our planet under these extreme conditions."

	This wasn't the first time a spacecraft watched an eclipse from the moon

From the surface of the moon, the Firefly lander captured this photo of a lunar eclipse — or from its perspective, a solar eclipse — on March 14 at 4:30 am EDT, capturing the "diamond ring" effect of the sun about to emerge from totality from behind Earth.

The privately-owned Blue Ghost moon lander, built by Texas-based company Firefly Aerospace, has captured rare views of a lunar eclipse from the moon's surface.

The lander, which touched down March 2 in a volcanic plain on the moon's nearside, has spent its time deploying instruments and collecting data. On the night of March 13, as Earth's shadow covered the moon in a total lunar eclipse, Blue Ghost turned its cameras back toward Earth. 

Around 4:30 a.m. EDT, the lander captured the “diamond ring effect,” as a single point of sunlight emerged from behind our planet at the end of totality. Earth itself, appearing as a dark disk in the black lunar sky, is encircled by glowing ring of light.

The first image from the eclipse, captured about three hours earlier, was deceptive — the sun appeared to still be shining brightly. But a reflection in the lander's solar panels revealed an otherwise hidden detail: an arc of light wreathing Earth with just a spot of sunlight sneaking through. 

Since landing, the spacecraft has put eight of its 10 science instruments to work. These include a device that uses a blast of pressurized nitrogen gas to collect and sort lunar soil; a dust shield demonstration, using electrical forces to lift lunar dirt from glass surfaces, which could help keep future spacecraft clean of famously sticky moondust; another experiment to measure the stickiness of that dust; a drill to measure heat flow from the moon's interior; and an experiment to test a form of lunar GPS.

Cameras on the lander's underside also took a video of the lander's engine plumes interacting with the lunar surface, which could provide insights for making future landings smoother and cleaner.

This is not the first time a spacecraft has observed an eclipse from the lunar vicinity. In 2009, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency's Kaguya orbiter saw a penumbral eclipse, in which the Earth mostly blocked the sun. And NASA's Surveyor 3 moon lander saw an eclipse way back in 1967.

Mount Washington is a prominent mountain in New Hampshire, known for its dramatic weather and conditions that are extremely dangerous for hikers and climbers.

Name: Mount Washington

Location: New Hampshire

Coordinates: 44.270631129317565, -71.30324713195401

Why it's incredible: The mountain has some of the wildest weather on Earth.

Mount Washington is the tallest peak in the Northeast. The mountain is famous for attracting extreme weather, with winds that exceed the force of a hurricane more than 100 days per year.

The mountain is home to "the world's worst weather" for three main reasons. Firstly, at 6,288 feet (1,917 meters) tall, it is the highest mountain in New England. Winds pick up speed when they can blow unobstructed, and the mountain is directly exposed to winds from the west that travel for hundreds of miles without obstruction. The closest mountains of a similar height to Mount Washington along this westerly windpath are the Black Hills of South Dakota about 1,600 miles (2,500 kilometers) away, according to the Mount Washington Observatory.

Not only do these winds hit Mount Washington at full speed but they are also siphoned toward the peak by the surrounding landscape. The mountains to the west of Mount Washington form a 75-mile-wide (120 km) funnel that channels westerly winds toward the mountain, accelerating already-fast winds until they reach breakneck speeds, according to the observatory.

Finally, Mount Washington sits on the confluence of three major storm tracks. Storms hit the summit every three days on average in the winter, bringing high winds and huge amounts of precipitation, according to the observatory. Record levels of precipitation for Mount Washington were measured in 1969, when 4.1 feet (1.3 m) of snow fell within 24 hours.

As a result of its unique position, Mount Washington is a contender for the world's fastest recorded wind speed. On "calm" summer days, instruments on Mount Washington's summit record wind speeds of 40 mph (65 km/h). But when storms roll in, these winds can whip up gusts exceeding 100 mph (160 km/h).

In the midst of making sure instruments were working well, the summit crew took some time to show us (safely) what 100mph winds looked like... and had some fun doing it. Tune in tonight at 5pm for the weekend's Higher Summits Forecast on Facebook Live. pic.twitter.com/6TSShijLgkMarch 7, 2025

On April 12, 1934, instruments at the summit measured a record wind speed of 231 mph (372 km/h), which is equivalent to wind speeds inside a level-5 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Such winds have the power to level well-constructed buildings, blow away structures with weak foundations and throw cars over large distances. The record still stands today as the second-fastest natural wind gust ever recorded, with the fastest occurring on Barrow Island in Australia on April 10, 1996 and reaching speeds of 253 mph (407 km/h).

Even wind speeds of 100 mph can rip huge chunks of ice off the mountain and the Mount Washington Observatory building at the summit, which poses a severe risk for hikers and climbers in the winter. The observatory has bulletproof windows to mitigate the risk of one of these chunks smashing into the building, according to its website.

As well as flying ice, people climbing Mount Washington in the winter are faced with the risk of avalanches, hypothermia and frostbite. Temperatures on the mountain average 27.1 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2.7 degrees Celsius), which can create extreme wind chill conditions, according to New Hampshire State Parks.

Several rescue teams monitor Mount Washington, and volunteers regularly save the lives of hikers who get lost or caught out by changing weather conditions.

People find AI more compassionate and understanding than human mental health experts, a new study shows. Even when participants knew that they were talking to a human or AI, the third-party assessors rated AI responses higher.

People find responses from artificial intelligence (AI) to be more compassionate and understanding than those from human mental health experts, a new study shows. The finding again demonstrates that AI can outperform humans in fields in which we've long assumed only people with shared experience are good at.

In the study, published Jan. 10 in the journal Communications Psychology, scientists conducted a series of four experiments to find out how 550 participants rated empathetic responses for compassion and responsiveness generated by AI versus those from professionals. Specifically, the participants gave information about personal experiences and then assessed the answers for compassion, responsiveness and overall preference.

The tests revealed that AI responses were considered more compassionate than those from professional crisis responders, even when the author of the responses was revealed to the participants.

The results suggest AI has uses in "contexts requiring empathetic interaction, with the potential to address the increasing need for empathy in supportive communication contexts," the researchers wrote in the study.

On average, AI-generated responses were rated 16% more compassionate than human responses and were preferred 68% of the time, even when compared to trained crisis responders.

Study lead author Dariya Ovsyannikova, a lab manager at the University of Toronto's psychology department, attributed the AI's success to its ability to identify fine details and stay objective as crisis experiences were described. This made the AI better able to generate attentive communication that gave the user the illusion of empathy. At the same time, the humans may have performed worse because human responders are susceptible to fatigue and burnout, she added.

Live Science asked Eleanor Watson, IEEE member, AI ethics engineer and AI faculty at Singularity University, what the finding means, not just for the future of AI-human interactions but the ongoing debate about which jobs AI can't or shouldn't do when human understanding and input seems critical.

Watson called the finding "fascinating" but wasn't altogether surprised. "[AI] can certainly model supportive responses with a remarkable consistency and apparent empathy, something that humans struggle to maintain due to fatigue and cognitive biases," she told Live Science.

"Human practitioners are constrained by their direct clinical experience and cognitive limitations. The scale of data AI can process fundamentally changes the equation of therapeutic support. It can also potentially enable patients to gain perspectives or approaches their therapist has not been trained in," she said.

Globally, mental health care is in crisis, and the study raises the possibility of AI filling the gaps. According to the World Health Organization, more than two-thirds of people with mental health conditions don't get the care they need. In low and middle income countries that figure rises to 85%.

Watson said the ease in accessing AI versus human therapists could make it a useful tool to help with mental health provision. "The availability of machines is a welcome factor, especially compared with expensive practitioners whose time is limited," Watson said.

"Also, people often find dealing with a machine less daunting, particularly with more sensitive topics. There's less fear of judgment or gossip."

But finding AI-generated responses more empathetic doesn't come without risks. Watson warned of the specter of supernormal stimulus, which is the tendency to respond more strongly to an exaggerated version of a stimulus.

—People are falling in love with AI. Should we worry?

—Many kids are unsure if Alexa and Siri have feelings or think like people, study finds

"AI is so enticing we become entranced by it," Watson said. "AI can be flirty, insightful, enlightening, fun, provocative, forbearing and accessible to the point where it's impossible for any human being to measure up."

Content about mental health also exacerbates the privacy issues associated with AI. "The privacy implications are stark," Watson noted. "Having access to people's deepest vulnerabilities and struggles makes them vulnerable to various forms of attack and demoralization. Scrupulous governance of systems and the organizations behind them must be upheld to defend against exploitation by bad actors."

Measles cases are rising in the U.S. as outbreaks grow in Texas and New Mexico.

Measles is continuing to spread across the United States, as outbreaks grow in western Texas and New Mexico.

Between the two states, 256 cases have been confirmed as of Thursday, mostly in those who are unvaccinated or with unknown vaccination status, according to state health officials. At least one unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas has died and another suspected death is being investigated in New Mexico in an unvaccinated adult. At least 10 other states have also confirmed cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

As health care professionals work to care for patients, they are also attempting to combat the proliferation of misinformation about how to prevent and treat the disease, some tell ABC News.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been one of the prominent voices on measles, making comments that public health experts say are not accurate.

In multiple interviews, Kennedy has claimed that vitamin A and cod liver oil are effective treatments for measles. He also said that poor diet contributes to severe cases of measles and that -- while vaccines prevent illness -- they also cause severe illnesses and even death.

Some public health experts told ABC News these statements are not rooted in scientific evidence and could be quite dangerous for the public.

"I think it's really important to try to stay away from these ideas of fringe theories or ideas that have not been scientifically proven," Kirsten Hokeness, director of the school of health and behavioral sciences at Bryant University, in Rhode Island, told ABC News.

During an interview on Fox News with Sean Hannity on Tuesday, Kennedy said that HHS was currently providing vitamin A to measles patients for treatment. He claimed vitamin A can "dramatically" reduce measles deaths.

The World Health Organization recommends two doses of vitamin A in children and adults with measles to restore low vitamin A levels, which can help prevent eye damage and blindness.

However, experts who spoke with ABC News said it is not an antiviral treatment against measles (meaning it does not prevent infections), nor is there one available.

"Because it has been described that patients with vitamin A deficiency can have a more severe course, the WHO recommends low doses of vitamin A for children diagnosed with measles," Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas, told ABC News. "This is a supplementation in case of deficiency, and it is not intended to treat the virus. High doses of vitamin A can have serious consequences."

"Neither vitamin A nor cod liver oil will treat measles," she concluded.

Kennedy has claimed that poor nutrition plays a role in causing severe measles disease and that a healthy diet can lessen severity.

While malnutrition can be a factor in severe disease, malnutrition and nutritional deficits in measles patients have historically been seen in underdeveloped countries, according to experts.

Additionally, studies have found that mass nutritional supplementation "followed by an increase in vaccination coverage" can reduce measles infection and mortality.

"Certainly, good nutrition can promote a healthy immune system, and it's a good idea for everyone to try to maintain good nutrition, but it's certainly not a substitute for vaccination," Dr. Scott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch, told ABC News. "There's no evidence that it can prevent infection, no evidence that it can prevent an infected person from spreading the virus and contributing to one of these outbreaks."

"So, I want to be very clear, good nutrition is absolutely no substitute for vaccination to prevent someone's own risk for developing severe, maybe fatal, measles," he added.

The CDC currently recommends that people receive two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old.

One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster.

Kennedy has said vaccines do "stop the spread of the disease" but also said they cause "adverse events."

"It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself [causes], encephalitis and blindness, et cetera," he told Hannity, without providing evidence.

Weaver said there is no vaccine that is without risks but that the MMR vaccine is incredibly safe and effective.

"There's no evidence that it has severe outcomes … similar to what the measles virus infection causes," he told ABC News. "It certainly can cause very minor reactions at the site of injection, like just about every vaccine, but it's one of the safest vaccines that's ever been developed."

Weaver added that the risks of complications from a measles infection far outweigh any risks from the MMR vaccine.

As for Kennedy's unfounded claim that the MMR vaccine causes death, a 2015 CDC review published in the journal Vaccine found such claims are deaths reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System – a voluntary reporting system "that accepts any submitted report of an adverse event without judging its clinical significance or whether it was caused by a vaccination."

The review found that many of the deaths reported to VAERS claiming to be linked to the MMR included children who has serious underlying medical conditions or had deaths that were unrelated to the vaccine, including accidental deaths.

"These complete VAERS reports and any accompanying medical records, autopsy reports and death certificates have been reviewed in depth by FDA and CDC physicians and no concerning patterns have emerged that would suggest a causal relationship with the MMR vaccine and death," the review stated.

Kennedy claimed in an interview with Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Seigel over the weekend that is "almost impossible" for measles to kill a healthy individual.

Some people who contract measles may suffer severe complications as a result of infection. While those most at risk include children younger than age 5, pregnant people and those with weakened immune systems, anybody can experience complications.

About in 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who contract measles are hospitalized and about 1 in 20 children with measles develop pneumonia, which is the most common cause of death in young children who get infected.

About one in 10 children infected with measles develop ear infections as well, which can lead to hearing loss, data shows.

Additionally, about 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis -- which is the swelling of the brain and can lead to brain damage -- and up to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications, the CDC says.

Recently, Texas health officials reported the death of an unvaccinated school-aged child, the first death from measles recorded in the U.S. in a decade. The child was healthy and had no preexisting conditions, officials said.

"The CDC estimates that 1 in 5 people [who] get infected with measles ends up in the hospital," Hokeness said. "So, this approach to relying on sort of this natural immunity doesn't make sense when we have a vaccine which prevents it in the first place."

"But, in short, there's really no benefit to this idea of natural immunity and naturally acquiring the virus. That's why we've developed the vaccines that work so well," she added.

Kennedy also claimed in his interview that natural immunity from measles may protect against cancer and heart disease. There is no evidence to suggest either of those are true, experts said.

"If you want to take your chances with getting natural infection, hoping that there might be some very small benefit to that, it's a very big risk to take, because you may very well get severe measles infection," Weaver said.

Overall, experts advised relying on scientifically proven medical information.

"We should leverage the knowledge that we've gained over the years and not spend our time focusing on alternative possibilities," Hokeness added.

As one of the most famous scientists of the 20th century, Albert Einstein has become synonymous with genius. He taught himself geometry and calculus while living in Germany in his teens before training in Switzerland to become a math teacher. Unable to find a teaching position, Einstein bounced around until he completed a doctorate in physics in 1905 and began publishing groundbreaking scientific papers that ultimately changed the world.

But Einstein had other interests that are less well known — he was a staunch pacifist, invented an early refrigerator and called himself a "deeply religious non-believer." What do you know about the man, the myth, the genius Einstein? Time to take a quantum leap, because this quiz will test what you know about the famous physicist!

As Web3 adoption accelerates, the demand for robust security solutions has never been more urgent. Over $2.3 billion was lost to hacks in 2024 alone , highlighting persistent vulnerabilities in decentralized applications and blockchain ecosystems. This growing threat underscores the need for cutting-edge security measures which are critical to sustaining trust and innovation in the blockchain industry .

India has emerged as a key player in the global Web3 space. The country's share of the Web3 developer base has surged from just 3% in 2018 to 12% in 2024. Also, since 2023, India has onboarded the most new crypto developers, moving past the US, reflecting increased interest and expertise in blockchain technology. As more Indian developers and startups build on decentralized platforms, the demand for scalable and AI driven security solutions to protect smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure has also intensified.

Traditional smart contract auditing methods are often slow, expensive, and limited in scope, leaving room for critical security gaps. Recognizing this challenge, CredShields, a blockchain security firm, has introduced SolidityScan, an AI-powered security solution that automates smart contract auditing.

“Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to devastating financial losses. SolidityScan offers a scalable, real-time, and cost-effective way to detect and mitigate these risks before they can be exploited. Unlike traditional audits , SolidityScan instantly analyzes smart contracts with its 450+ AI powered vulnerability detectors for weaknesses, enabling developers to focus on innovation without compromising security,” said Shashank, co-founder of CredShields.

With blockchain adoption increasing across finance, gaming, and decentralized governance, cybersecurity remains a major concern. “The decentralized nature of Web3 makes it both powerful and vulnerable. SolidityScan is designed to provide proactive, AI-driven security solutions that adapt to evolving threats,” said Indranil, co-founder of CredShields.

There is one downside though - all tech and everything that comes with it costs money, and usually a pretty penny too! This can leave us feeling deflated about the money we're spending on something that's essentially, a pass time. Luckily, there are clever ways in which you can save money on these luxuries and in this article, we're going to tell you exactly how!

If you're someone that loves gaming, you'll know all too well how expensive new games can be. It can be anything from £40 and upwards, and that's usually just for the base game! However, there are really smart ways around this. Depending on what console you use for gaming, you'll be able to get some sort of game pass. For example, for Playstation users, you can subscribe to a PSN account for much cheaper per month than buying a brand new game. And, you'll have access to a myriad of new games while you're subscribed.

The same goes for Xbox users or even PC gamers. There's the Xbox game pass or EA subs you can activate for around £15 a month that will give you access to loads of games under their umbrella. While it's still costing you some money each month, you can enjoy more games for less money!

Not only that, when you're subbed to these kinds of services, you'll notice that your system will detect and download updates for your games, meaning you no longer have to wait around for downloads or installations.

As mentioned briefly above, there sometimes comes a time when you either don't have time for certain games and tech, or you've outgrown it and would like to make some money from them to put towards your next upgrade. Lots of stores buy all sorts of games, consoles, phones, and other tech from people in exchange for cash. While you can do this on the website, it might be easier to head to your nearest store so that your items can be checked there and then in store, and you can walk away that day with the cash. Selling your old phone, games or console is a great way to make extra money when you're in a pinch.

It's all too easy to wake up one day and realise that you're paying an extortionate amount for your broadband deal. The first step that you should take is to phone your current provider and ask them for a cheaper deal. More often than not they will be able to lower your price by a small amount.

However, you shouldn't always settle for this figure as there are many other internet providers around the world that would be more than willing to do you better broadband deals. Make sure that you know you've got the cheapest price before settling for a company so that you can save yourself that little bit of extra money each month and not feel so guilty!

There are so many free trials these days, so why not make the most of them? Services like Netflix and Spotify offer a month's trial completely free of charge. If you use these kinds of trials in a clever way, you can enjoy lots of free entertainment without having to spend a single penny. For example, you could trial Netflix for a month and then try out Disney+ for a month.

It's not just entertainment deals you should be looking out for either. Services like Canva offer free pro trials that are a month long, meaning you could create high-quality media if you need it for work or a personal blog. The same goes for cloud storage - there are loads of services that will give you the space for free for a whole month! The only thing you have to do is remember when your free trials are ending so that you can cancel the subscriptions before they renew!

Like many, there's a chance that you have games on your phone or you use it for personal reasons like social media and chatting to family and friends via text message. Like with your internet bill, it's too easy to add on features and then end up with a large bill that you don't truly need. Most providers will claim that they cannot reduce your bill because obviously, they want to continue receiving money from you. This however, is untrue, so make sure that you push it with them so that they offer you a much cheaper deal. You may even find that your cheaper deal doesn't actually change many of your current terms, so it's definitely worth a shot!

If you're on pay as you go, it might be an idea to use a messaging service like Whatsapp with your friends and family so that all of you can save some money on your phone bills. Whatsapp runs on the use of the internet, so if you're in Wifi range you're able to text, video, and call for absolutely nothing!

It's understandable that when a new game comes out on a console that you don't have, that you want to rush out and buy that console so that you can join in on the fun that everyone is having. However, new consoles no matter how long they've been out can still cost you a fair amount of money. Instead, consider buying second hand consoles so that you can still join in on all of the fun, but save yourself a nice amount of money! Often people sell their consoles because they are simply too busy for them, so there's actually nothing wrong with them! Just be sure to have it all turned on before handing over any cash!

Try these easy yet clever ways of saving money on your tech so that you can have some spare cash for other things in life that you want to enjoy!

Tony Han, WeRide's Founder, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “WeRide continues to drive the future of autonomous mobility across the globe. Our success is built upon our endless commitment to innovation and safety. This has enabled us to expand our presence globally in new markets as well as deepen and refine our operations in existing markets. Internationally, we grew our footprint in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, by engaging with partners and regulators to identify the best solutions for each market. We made significant progress in our international robotaxi deployment in 2024, including launching the largest robotaxi fleet outside the U.S and China. This achievement validates all of our efforts and is proof of our continued momentum for further expansion in 2025. In China, we made significant strides with fully unmanned commercial operations on our latest generation GXR robotaxi in Beijing, as well as multiple launches of our robobus and robosweeper services across multiple domestic cities. As the first publicly listed robotaxi company, we remain committed to pushing the boundaries of autonomous technology, delivering safer, smarter, and more sustainable transportation solutions worldwide.”

Jennifer Li, WeRide's Chief Financial Officer, added, “Amidst a challenging macro environment, we adopted a comprehensive approach in 2024 to optimize revenue and customer structure through internationalization, competitive pricing, and strategic partnerships. This strategy delivered meaningful results in 2024, including achieving record-high robotaxi revenue and the strongest growth of international revenue since company's inception. As we expand into new markets and scale our autonomous fleet, we continue to break through in technology, optimize operations, and enhance overall efficiency. Collaborating with local partners and stakeholders enables us to execute a cost-effective, rapid go-to-market model, allowing us to adapt quickly to diverse competitive landscapes. By leveraging strategic alliances and real-world insights, we are building a scalable mobility ecosystem that prioritizes innovation, reliability, and sustainable success.”

Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars are made at a rate of RMB7.2993 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of December 31, 2024.

Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures 

In evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses the non-IFRS financial measure of adjusted net loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. The Company believes that adjusted net loss provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company's consolidated results of operations in the same manner as it helps the Company's management. The Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss for the year/period excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of financial liabilities measured at FVTPL, fair value changes of financial assets at FVTPL and changes in the carrying amounts of preferred shares and other financial instruments subject to redemption and other preferential rights.

The Company presents the non-IFRS financial measure because it is used by its management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net loss enables the Company's management to assess the Company's operating results without considering the impact of the aforementioned non-cash adjustment items that it does not consider to be indicative of its core operations. Accordingly, the Company believes that the use of this non-IFRS financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors.

This non-IFRS financial measure is not defined under IFRS and is not presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using the adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all items of expenses that affect the Company's operations. Further, this non-IFRS measure may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited.

The non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the year/period or any other measure of performance information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the Company's historical non-IFRS financial measure in light of the most directly comparable IFRS measure, as shown below. The non-IFRS financial measure presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measure presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing the Company's data comparatively. It is encouraged that you review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Good Samaritan Pulmonologist Johnathon Grant, DO, during an Ion procedure.

Good Samaritan announced in a recent press release the addition of the Ion Endoluminal System, a state-of-the-art robotic-assisted platform for minimally invasive lung biopsies.

"This innovative technology enhances precision and access when diagnosing lung nodules, potentially leading to earlier detection and treatment of lung cancer," the press release read.

Good Sam reported that lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, but early detection significantly improves survival rates. The Ion Endoluminal System, developed by Intuitive—the makers of the da Vinci Surgical System—offers a revolutionary approach to lung biopsies. By allowing physicians to navigate deep into the lungs with enhanced stability and precision, this technology enables tissue sampling from hard-to-reach nodules while reducing the need for more invasive procedures.

“With the introduction of Ion, we can provide our patients with a more advanced and minimally invasive approach to lung biopsy,” said Good Samaritan Pulmonologist Johnathon Grant, DO, in the press release. “This means greater accuracy, faster results, and ultimately, better outcomes for those at risk of lung cancer.”

Compared to traditional bronchoscopy methods, the press release shared that the Ion system offers increased reach and flexibility, which allows for more successful biopsies with fewer complications. This means patients can receive a diagnosis sooner, helping them and their care teams make informed treatment decisions more quickly.

Tata Technologies Ltd, a subsidiary of Tata Motors encountered a ransomware attack earlier this year that affected the company's network and forced it to suspend some of its services. Now, TechCrunch has reported that a ransomware group that goes by the name Hunters International has published what it claims to be data stolen from the Pune headquartered company.

According to TechCrunch, who claims to have seen the data published on the gang's dark web leak site said it includes personal details about current and former employees along with some confidential information like purchase orders and some contracts with customers in India and the United States.

The leaked data, which amounts to about 1.4TB in size includes more than 7,30,000 documents like Excel spreadsheets, PDF files and PowerPoint presentations. However, it is still unclear if the data shared by the Hunters International group is in any way related to the recent ransomware attack.

In a filing with the Indian stock exchanges, Tata Technologies had said that an investigation was underway “in consultation with experts to assess the root cause and take remedial action as necessary.”

For those unfamiliar, Hunters International is a relatively new ransomware-as-a-service group that offers its infrastructure to hackers and takes a cut of the ransom payments. It is also affiliated with the Hive gang, which may have previously leaked stolen data from Tata Power back in 2022.

Founded in 1989 as an automotive unit of Tata Motors, Tata Technologies focuses on automotive design, aerospace engineering and research and development and has an annual revenue of $600 million, operating in more than 18 locations in India, Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America.

Freedom House program graduates.

A group of Harrisburg area residents are ready to kickstart their health careers, thanks to a local program.

UPMC Health Plan on Friday celebrated the graduation of its first cohort of students from the Dauphin County Freedom House Foundation training program.

The workforce development initiative, which also has cohorts in Erie and Allegheny counties, provides a free, five-week course to lower-income students interested in the healthcare field.

“They have put in a tremendous amount of hard work and shown immense dedication to learn not only valuable clinical skills, but professional development skills and interpersonal skills that will serve them really well as they embark on this new chapter of their journey,” said Leah Franklin, workforce development manager at UPMC.

In the course, 13 students learned the foundations of healthcare, setting them up for entry-level positions or for further education in the future.

“We are giving our students a very foundational knowledge that gives them a lot of opportunities,” said Trevor Mathey, project manager for Freedom House. “So whether they want to go and immediately become a medical assistant or a patient care technician or community health worker, they have that option. But they also have the option to continue their education and go on and become an EMT or a nurse or pursue many of the other health care professions.”

Not only was the course free, but students were paid while they took the classes and assisted with things like childcare, transportation and finances, which can often serve as barriers to education.

During the program, students attended training at Tech Centro Workforce Development in Harrisburg.

“My mom's a nurse, and I see how many people she helps,” said Tiana Higgins, a Harrisburg native and one of Friday's graduates. “I want to be able to have that impact on people also and change people's lives.”

Higgins said that the courses were hands-on, giving them chances to shadow healthcare professionals, take a CPR training course and learn to take a blood pressure reading, among other things. She plans to now begin working and eventually pursue her LPN and RN certifications.

According to Mathey, there is already a waiting list for the next cohort of the Freedom House program, which will likely begin in a few months.

March 14 (UPI) -- Dr. Mehmet Oz, speaking during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing Friday, said fixing the American healthcare system would be a top priority.

If confirmed, the former TV show host will lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
President Donald Trump last November announced the 64-year-old Ohio native as his pick to head up the agency.
"We have a generational opportunity to fix our healthcare system and help people stay healthy for longer," Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon and author, told the committee Friday.

Oz hosted "The Dr. Oz Show" from 2009 until 2022 before deciding to run for a Pennsylvania Senate seat. He ultimately lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.
The university professor and author has no experience running a large agency.
Critics have accused Oz of wanting to cut Medicare and Medicaid services, and pointed to his close ties with drug and pharmaceutical companies.
Oz has also previously made comments about privatizing Medicare.
On Friday, Oz told committee members at the hearing he would not rule out making cuts.
"Dr. Oz will be calling the shots of what gets cuts, or what stays," committee chair Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said during Friday's hearing.

Wyden also took aim at Oz's previous promotion of unproven health remedies on his show.
"Dr. Oz is another rich guy who doesn't care if your health care costs go up or an insurance company denies you coverage," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D- Mass., said on X Friday morning.
"He's about to testify in front of the Senate Finance Committee, and I've got questions."
Some of those questions also related to Oz's record on abortion. While campaigning in 2022, Oz said "local political leaders" should play a role in a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy.

According to the state's Health Policy Commission, healthcare costs are growing faster than inflation, labor and wages.

As healthcare costs continue to skyrocket in Massachusetts, employer groups and taxpayer advocates once again told state officials that the affordability crisis is hurting business competitiveness and sustainability.

The Health Policy Commission held its annual health care cost benchmark hearing to review healthcare cost data with the Legislature's Joint Committee on Health Care Financing. The commission and other healthcare stakeholders assessed the most recent report from the Center for Health Information and Analysis, which confirmed that healthcare spending in the state is far exceeding targets. 

According to the HPC, healthcare costs are growing faster than inflation, labor and wages. 

Business leaders, speaking at the hearing and in written testimony, said it's not just individuals feeling the rising costs. The increasing healthcare spending is impacting all businesses, said Eileen McAnneny, president of the Employer Coalition on Health, a business group which launched last year to represent business interests in health policy.

McAnneny said the cost growth benchmark — a cap on growth to which healthcare organizations are intended to adhere — should be lower than the 3.6% it was in the past year. Statewide, spending growth was more than double that rate in 2023, the most recent year tracked in CHIA's reporting.

“If we want to reduce costs, we have to reduce the benchmark and impose stricter penalties,” McAnneny said. Doing so, she said, would “signal we are finally serious about getting healthcare costs under control.”

McAnneny pointed to Mass General Brigham's recent cost-cutting measures, which involve significant layoffs, as an example of ways providers can reduce unnecessary spending, along with adopting artificial intelligence tools to improve efficiency.

"Something's got to give," she said. 

Jon Hurst, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Retailers Association, said in a written statement that his members —  employers with less than 100 employees — are seeing big hikes in the cost of health insurance for employees. 

“Small business premium increases of two to three times the inflation rate and the benchmark are unacceptable, unaffordable, and extremely damaging to the competitiveness of the commonwealth,” Hurst said. 

Hurst said the benchmark needs “some level of teeth for real enforcement” — a critique of the agency that's been made repeatedly.

According to the HPC, “the healthcare cost growth benchmark is the centerpiece of the state's cost containment efforts.” As it stands, however, there is no specific enforcement action that the HPC can take against entities that exceed it. 

The HPC can put individual organizations on performance improvement plans if their costs increases are deemed excessive. It has so far done this only one time to compel Mass General Brigham, the state's largest healthcare organization, to control its spending. 

Lora Pellegrini, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, said that despite the fact that the benchmark has been exceeded frequently in recent years, it's still an important tool. Health insurers are struggling, she said, pointing to significant losses at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Point23Health, the parent company of Harvard Pilgrim and Tufts. Pellegrini said that the HPC should take steps to prevent providers from charging what she said are “excessive” prices and  double down on pharmaceutical oversight. 

“Pharmaceutical spending continues to rise unabated with limited accountability to the benchmark,” she said. She urged the commission and the joint committee to take steps to expand that oversight authority and establish a drug affordability board. 

The commission will meet in April to vote on the 2026 benchmark.

On March 13, 11 leading civil rights and health equity organizations held a joint press briefing to release a report analyzing the Medicaid cuts passed recently by the U.S. House of Representatives. In a news release, UnidosUS stated that the House-passed Budget Resolution framework would make the largest Medicaid cuts in American history, placing at risk the health and financial security of more than 70 million children, seniors, people with disabilities, and working families.

“While people of all backgrounds would be in danger, the report finds that communities of color would suffer especially widespread harm: nearly 42 million people, or approximately a third of all people of color in the U.S., rely on Medicaid for healthcare and would be placed in harm's way if the House's cuts become law.” 

The House Budget Resolution would cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The report illustrates how communities of color are especially at risk, with Medicaid covering half of all children of color and more than a fourth of adults of color aged 65 and older.

Shavon Arline-Bradley, president and CEO, National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) said in a statement, “It is deeply concerning that the U.S. would consider cutting Medicaid. There is no humanity behind these budget cuts. Not having a safety net for healthcare for the least of us says that you do not understand the needs of the American people and are clearly out of touch.”

“Slashing Medicaid isn't just a policy choice—it's a direct attack on the health and well-being of millions of Americans, especially people of color who already face systemic barriers to care. These cuts would rip away essential coverage, forcing families to forgo doctor visits, life-saving medications, and critical treatments,” said Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL-9), Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), in a statement. “Gutting Medicaid would only deepen inequality and push the most vulnerable further to the margins. No one should have to choose between putting food on the table and getting the care they need to survive.”

The report concluded that many people's commitment to Medicaid comes from personal experience. “For almost two in five Americans, including 38 percent of people who voted for then-candidate Trump, Medicaid covers them or someone in their immediate family.”

Hoover Healthcare Policy Working Group Convenes Experts to Explore State of America's Health System

The Hoover Institution's Healthcare Policy Working Group convened a two-day conference March 3–4, 2025, examining major challenges facing the healthcare system, from Medicare and Medicaid to private insurance markets and pharmaceutical policies.

Hoover Institution (Stanford, CA) – The Hoover Institution's Healthcare Policy Working Group convened a two-day conference March 3–4, 2025, examining major challenges facing the healthcare system, from Medicare and Medicaid to private insurance markets and pharmaceutical policies. Throughout the discussions, participants highlighted the unsustainable fiscal trajectory of federal healthcare programs, regulatory barriers to competition and innovation, and potential market-based reforms that could enhance consumer choice while addressing cost challenges. While participants generally favored increasing the role of markets and consumer decision making in healthcare, they acknowledged the political and structural obstacles to comprehensive reform, resulting in a focus on identifying incremental changes that could improve system efficiency without disrupting access to care.

Medicare Reform

The Medicare session highlighted the program's central role in federal fiscal challenges, with projections showing its costs rising to almost a quarter of the non-interest federal budget by 2050. Participants discussed structural problems, including the complexity of beneficiary enrollment options, outdated administrative pricing structures, and shortcomings in Medicare Advantage payment systems. Reforms ranged from bold measures, like means testing or premium support models, to more targeted approaches, such as delivery system reforms and value-based purchasing. In Medicare Advantage, reform ideas centered on standardizing benefits across traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage programs to improve comparability, implementing competitive bidding instead of benchmark-based payments, and reforming risk adjustment to address favorable selection and upcoding issues.

Health and Technology

The health technology discussion focused on how artificial intelligence and automation could address healthcare's productivity challenges while improving quality and reducing costs. Panelists highlighted that the United States spends more on healthcare administrative costs than France, Germany, and Italy combined spend on their entire healthcare systems, with a complex system of 318,000 different health plans, 600,000 billing codes, and 57 billion negotiated prices. Technology applications discussed included AI-generated clinical notes, automated prior authorization processes, augmented radiology and pathology readings, and remote monitoring systems for high-risk patients. Participants debated whether technology would ultimately lower healthcare costs or simply redirect spending, with some suggesting AI could reduce administrative costs by 5 to 8 percent in the near term. Barriers to technology adoption included state regulatory variations, product liability concerns, and misaligned incentives that fail to reward efficiency gains. Participants agreed that administrative simplification represents a substantial opportunity across healthcare sectors.

Drug Pricing and Approvals

The pharmaceutical policy session examined tensions between drug innovation, affordability, and access, with participants noting that while drug spending may increase healthcare costs in the short term, it often reduces overall healthcare spending in the long run as generics become available. Critics of the Inflation Reduction Act's drug price negotiation provisions argued it targets high-volume, low-price drugs rather than truly overpriced medications, creates a “pill penalty” by treating small and large molecules differently in terms of exclusivity, and establishes an unofficial cost-effectiveness threshold through the Medicare drug price negotiation program. Participants also discussed international pricing disparities—with the United States funding approximately 70 percent of global pharmaceutical earnings despite that sector representing 23 percent of global GDP—and debated potential reforms to Food and Drug Administration approval processes to reduce the “valley of death” between product approval and insurance coverage, which can delay patient access by up to six years.

Medicaid Reform

The Medicaid session examined structural problems with the federal-state partnership, where states have incentives to expand eligibility and services because the federal government covers most costs. Speakers highlighted how the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, with its 90 percent federal match for the expansion population, exacerbated these incentives and led to enormous improper payments. Reform ideas included phasing down the enhanced federal match rate, moving people above 100 percent of poverty to the marketplace exchanges with premium tax credits, limiting state financing gimmicks like provider taxes, capping state-directed payments, and improving coordination for dual Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries. Georgia was highlighted as a case study for expanding coverage only to 100 percent of the poverty line while directing those above that threshold to the exchanges, demonstrating how this approach led to increased private market competition and potentially better care access for beneficiaries.

Private Health Insurance

In the private insurance session, participants contrasted the lack of innovation in health insurance with dramatic improvements in other technologies over similar time frames, noting that insurance products remain largely unchanged despite decades of rising costs. Participants advocated for deregulating healthcare markets, expanding individual coverage health reimbursement arrangements (ICHRAs) to give employees more choice, enhancing healthcare savings accounts (HSAs), creating functional cash markets for healthcare services, and addressing price transparency and cross-subsidization issues. Several speakers highlighted Georgia's approach to health insurance exchanges, which uses private-sector entities for enrollment while achieving cost savings and increased carrier competition. The session featured debates about the nature of health insurance and healthcare as services, with some arguing that unique characteristics of healthcare necessitate different approaches than pure market solutions, while others contended that most healthcare could function effectively in a properly structured market environment.

Affordable Care Act and Health Policy Beyond 2025

The final session addressed the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and health policy directions, with panelists suggesting the ACA will likely remain in place with only incremental reforms rather than be repealed. Participants noted that Republicans are focusing primarily on tax reform rather than healthcare reform for 2025, with healthcare provisions potentially included in reconciliation only if they generate savings for tax cuts. Participants discussed a vision of a robust free-market healthcare system with true price discovery and competition, while acknowledging the challenges of transitioning from the current system with its entrenched cross-subsidies and regulatory structures. Others offered a pragmatic view of the 2025 political landscape, suggesting potential policy changes like making HSAs an alternative to cost-sharing reduction subsidies.

General Themes Across Both Days

Several consistent themes emerged across the two-day conference. First, participants generally agreed on the unsustainable fiscal trajectory of federal healthcare programs, but they often differed on the appropriate balance between market-based and regulatory solutions. Second, there was broad recognition that excessive administrative complexity drives significant costs in the system, with potential for technology and standardization to address these inefficiencies. Third, discussions revealed a tension between ideal policy solutions and politically feasible reforms, with acknowledgment that healthcare reform faces substantial obstacles from institutions and interest groups. Fourth, many participants advocated for approaches that provide more consumer choice and control while recognizing the limitations of consumer decision making in healthcare contexts. Finally, there was agreement that any reforms must consider implementation realities at the state level, with successful state models potentially offering pathways for broader system improvements.

Attendees of the Healthcare Policy Working Group's roundtable on pressing healthcare system challenges are seen in Annenberg Conference Room on March 3, 2025.

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 10 Best Healthcare Stocks For Long-Term Investment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) stands against other best healthcare stocks for long-term investment.

In the US, healthcare expenditures and costs have been increasing. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, US healthcare spending increased 7.5% from 2022 to $4.9 trillion in 2023. In 2023, the healthcare industry made up around 17.6% of the US economy, up 17.4% from 2022. The expansion of Medicare and commercial health insurance are the two main forces behind this growth.

The impact of tariffs on this continuing trend has become a major topic of contention in the healthcare sector, as more and more US corporations are turning to China for deals on the next promising molecule, whether in the obesity or cancer arena. Versant Ventures managing director Carlo Rizzuto spoke on the effects of tariffs on healthcare on CNBC's “Fast Money” on February 7. Tariffs might affect the sector in two ways, according to Rizzuto. Products developed in China and introduced to the US or other markets would be the first. The sector would need to see how the tariffs are set up in the market to comprehend how they would impact such trade operations.

Second, and more concretely, the US healthcare industry uses China as a huge hub for contract production and research. As a result, anything that raises that expense is probably going to make the market more difficult. An increase in costs will not improve the running of the healthcare sector, which is already facing pressure from investors.

Speaking about China's enormous influence in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, Rizzuto stated that the vast majority of healthcare organizations use a Chinese CRO or manufacturing partner in some capacity during the research and development phase. As a result, it plays a crucial role in the way biotech and pharmaceutical companies function in the nation. From the tiniest businesses to the biggest, this pattern is very common.

Simply said, the United States lacks the infrastructure to handle the transfer, thus healthcare corporations cannot reshore all of their externalized R&D and production to the country. Therefore, it is quite hard to understand how such a large-scale reshoring might occur. With the quantity of tariffs applied, the costs to accomplish this achievement can be computed linearly.

According to McKinsey, healthcare EBITDA is projected to rise from a baseline of $676 billion in 2023 to $987 billion in 2028 at a 7% CAGR. Recovery from post-pandemic lows is anticipated to support the improvement in several segments, while growth is anticipated to be faster in other areas (such as specialist pharmacy and HST). Software platforms are essential to the healthcare ecosystem because they make it possible for payers and providers to operate more effectively in a complicated setting.

By automating processes, fostering data connectivity, and producing actionable insights, technological innovation (such as generative AI and machine learning) keeps opening doors for stakeholders across all segments. McKinsey went on to say that increased utilization and pipeline expansion (as in cancer) are projected to drive substantial growth in specialty pharmacy revenue. Specialty pharmacy profit pools are still growing as a result of the rise in the use of specialty medications.

For our methodology, we used a Finviz screener and picked stocks with a market cap of over 2 billion, a 5-year annual return of over 10%, and a low PE ratio under 20. We then ranked these stocks based on their total number of hedge fund holders as of Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

LAS VEGAS - As AI is transforming all aspects of healthcare, it's affecting the care model for payers.

Health insurers have end-to-end visibility into individual care needs and utilization patterns across providers and settings.

Virtual care, technology and AI have helped payers define a more active role in care delivery.

Barriers include resistance to change and lack of better payer and provider alignment, panelists said during the first Emerge Innovation Experience at HIMSS25.

Edward Marx, CEO of Marx Advisory and a former global chief information officer at Cleveland Clinic, moderated the panel of experts from Clover Health, SCAN Health Plan and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey and Humana.  

The session "Voices of Innovation: Transforming Healthcare in a Payer-Driven World," mirrors the title of the book "Voices of Innovation - Payers," co-edited by Marx and Sakshika Dhingra, medical strategy director for Humana.

Clover Health has developed AI powered technology which enables it to harness big data and run algorithms to help with early diagnoses and better outcomes, said Aric Sharp, CEO of Value-Based Care at Clover Health.

"Culturally we encourage everyone to use AI," Sharp said. "The core of our focus is at the point of care."

Point-of-care solutions for most payers now include AI assistants and Chatbox, which can streamline member interactions.

Members want information quickly, said Heather Lavoie, chief information officer and executive vice president of Enterprise Operations for Blue Cross Blue Shield New Jersey. One of the pain points for patients is calling their insurer, she said. 

"People don't want to call us," Lavoie said. What they want is answers, she said. 

A more automated approach is helping with staff turnover, said Khin-Kyemon Aung, senior director of Healthcare Services, medical director and primary care physician for SCAN. 

It's difficult to find people to work in a call center, Lavoie said. AI can be used to do a summary of information for what's covered. This makes it easier for people to work at a higher level. 

"We're asking people to do the same job, but do it more effectively," Lavoie said.

AI is also helping with the bigger aims such as allowing outbound calls to be labeled correctly so case managers can implement stratification and nurses can rout cases appropriately by disease state, according to Lavoie.

It's being used for voice interpretation for patients with Parkinson's disease, she said. 

SCAN has started working with Cresta, Aung said. The AI-powered contact center platform provides real-time automation and guidance to chat agents as they navigate complex care conversations.

"It's listening in the background," she said.

Direct to consumer AI is making it easier for members, though there's real root causes that AI can't Band-aid over, Aung said.

"AI is an accelerator to all of these other technologies," Lavoie said. "We're excited about technology." . 

Plans focused on claims, but there's so much more, including member preference information, she said. 

"We're bringing in sensor data, health risk assessments to create better profiles of members," Lavoie said. 

Right now, AI is being used to make the way healthcare runs more efficiently, according to Sharp.

"We have to think about breaking the way the system works in its entirety," Sharp said, even suggesting that "revenue cycle could go by the wayside if we look at entirely different models."

Sharp said one of the biggest barriers to innovation is culture and people wanting to stay entrenched.

Aung mentioned the challenge of payer and provider alignment.

Sharp said payers and providers are solving problems in different ways. What's needed, he said, is to get on the same page and have one path.

LAS VEGAS – This past week at HIMSS25, a panel of healthcare interoperability leaders convened for an ad hoc discussion about the ongoing evolution of FHIR API-based data exchange: How it can be advanced, how it can be expanded across the payers-provider-pharmacy-patient ecosystem, how certification should evolve and what the role of policymakers, agencies such as CMS and ASTP and technology developers should be over the next decade or so.

The session, "Ditch the Clipboard: Policy Ideas for DOGE and the Trump Administration," shares a name with a recent Leavitt Partners whitepaper that served as the basis of the discussion.

Despite its title, session moderator, Leavitt Partners Principal Ryan Howells, emphasized that the panel talk was not a political discussion.

"The election is over," said Howells. "We are now in a phase, for the next four years, of what the administration's priorities are. This will not be a political discussion in terms of what's right or what's wrong or what's happening with the administration. It's more a discussion about what the priorities of this administration are and how do we align with those priorities to advance interoperability policy.

"It's clear they want to do big, bold things. It's clear that they're actually doing generational change in the federal government," he explained. It's clear that they actually want to eliminate waste. Those things are clear. The question now becomes, how do we understand what those priorities are and how actively provide recommendations that could meaningfully move the ball in terms of interoperability and policy over the next decade plus."

Howells was joined by Michael Westover, vice president of population health at Providence; Anna Taylor, associate VP for population health & value-based care at MultiCare Connected Care; and Jason Teeple, interoperability strategy leader and senior director of enterprise architecture at Cigna Healthcare.

Among the questions they sought to answer: What federal technology policies are needed – or are no longer needed – to create a truly patient-centered health care system? How does CEHRT need to evolve to support a modern, API-based, interoperable ecosystem? And what can we expect on this front from the new administration in the years ahead?

"What do we need to do over the next decade?" Howells asked. "Not the next administration, not the next couple of years. What do we need to do over the next decade to meaningfully advance data interoperability and data exchange? Because that's how long it takes. Remember HITECHtook about 10 years, right? FHIR has taken more than 10 years.

"And so when we think about: What does this look like over the next decade? We need to really expand our thinking in terms of what's needed. You see all those awesome vendors that are on the show floor there. They talk about things like AI, cloud-based computing, all the solutions that they have, which is really cool. But what do we need to do in order to enable that innovation ecosystem to thrive?"

Howells made the case that some current interoperability policies are "antiquated," and, also, that there's simply too many of them.

"We have too much regulation," he argued. And we have a lot because we started to grow off of a certain program and started to add a bunch of things to start to certify individual functionality inside the EHR, to build the EHR.

"Well, now we've built them. We are now going to have to figure out a way to get the data to move between the systems. We don't have a problem in building the functionality of the EHR anymore. We have a problem in exchanging the data between not only the EHR, but the payers, the pharmacies, the patients, everyone else in the ecosystem. How do we actually do that?

Howells also advocated for ironing out some discrepancies with policies between different agencies, and better alignment on timing of rule compliance.

"We're a little out of sync based on policies in terms of the timing," he said, for example, "for when USCDI is being in place and when the CMS rules need to take advantage. And that's just the nature of the federal government. Sometimes we get a little bit out of sync."

We also need to move towards a "more modern computing architecture," he said.

"We believe that we need to redefine CEHRT," said Howells. "We go back to the original definition of the HITECH Act, where it talks about hardware, software or packaged solutions sold as services that are designed for or support the use by healthcare entities or patients for the electronic creation, maintenance, access, or electronic health information.

"It does not say EHRs. This could be EHRs. It could be payers. It could be cloud-based solutions. It could be others as well. So if we think out, if we would redefine CEHRT and start to certify the APIs, which is the outbound call to the other systems – rather than certify the functionality inside the APIs – that becomes a different paradigm."

For once, most representatives from both parties agreed that action is necessary.

“I was encouraged by the engagement from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle,” Empath Health CEO Jonathan Fleece told me in an email after the March 11 hearing, at which he testified. “There was real recognition that home-based care is not only what patients and families want – it's a cost-effective, patient-centered solution that benefits the entire health care system.” 

At the hearing, Fleece offered compelling arguments regarding the paramount importance of home-based care. 

“Home-based care isn't just for those actively dying,” Fleece testified. “It supports people managing chronic illnesses, recovering from surgery and navigating terminal diagnosis. Patients want it. Families need it, and taxpayers benefit. Keeping patients at home prevents costly hospitalizations and reduces strain on the health care system. Today, in a time of financial and workforce challenges, we should be expanding access to care at home, not cutting it.” 

The hearing was not the only action in the nation's capital this week, as the House also passed a continuing resolution that includes extensions of the hospital-at-home and telehealth waivers that at-home care providers have been pushing for. 

While that is welcome news, the ongoing wrangling over the budget also underscores just how unlikely it will be that the bipartisan tenor of the hearing will translate into actual policy changes. And the hearing also surfaced some of the tensions about policies that could benefit some post-acute providers but might not be the best moves for at-home care.

In this week's exclusive HHCN+ Update for members only, I provide an analysis and key takeaways, including: 

In his testimony, Fleece laid out policy priorities and also emphasized the high stakes involved.

He called on lawmakers to pursue three goals: expanding government investment in home-based care, expanding pay-for-performance models to reward high-quality providers and enhancing value-based care models. 

“These are not just policy decisions,” Fleece said. “They represent urgent threats to access, quality and patient choice. The decisions made here will shape the future of home care. Let's protect and expand access before it's too late.” 

As of 2024, 58.9 million Americans age 65 or older were enrolled in Medicare. Nearly 40% of Medicare beneficiaries are discharged to post-acute care, with home health being the most commonly used setting, according to the National Institutes of Health. 

Most seniors want to receive care in this setting — in the comfort of their surroundings with family and friends — often achieving better patient outcomes than facility-based services. However, further reimbursement cuts threaten these positive outcomes, and in some cases, patient lives are at stake. 

My 78-year-old mother had a knee replacement a couple of years ago. She was told she would need physical therapy after her surgery. She resisted because she thought that meant remaining in the hospital. 

While in the hospital, she experienced heightened anxiety and depression due to being away from her home and animals. After she was assured a therapist would come to her house to deliver care, she agreed immediately and was discharged within a day. 

Without home health care, my mother would have declined a much-needed service. She has since had a second knee replacement surgery and lives a healthy, active life.  

With the policy and regulation changes currently on the table, this type of care could become obsolete, and seniors like my mother will walk away from acute-care settings with only a fraction of the care they need being provided. Our aging population deserves better than that. 

Fleece acknowledged that the hearing was a step forward, but work is still left to do. 

“I hope that Congress takes meaningful action to support home-based care – expanding access, reducing barriers and investing in the people who make this care possible,” he said. “I look forward to continuing this conversation in the weeks and months ahead.” 

As Fleece made clear in his comments, the need for more comprehensive support for post-acute care is urgent, but different types of providers do not necessarily agree on the specific actions to be taken. One case in point, which was a topic of the hearing, is a unified post-acute care payment system.

In 2014, the Improving Medicare Post Acute Care Transformation (IMPACT) Act was signed into law. The main goal of this Act was to establish a unified post-acute care prospective payment system (PAC PPS). Congress mandated CMS to deliver operational specifications of a payment system that is ready for implementation.

The Trump administration's 2021 budget proposal included reforms to implement the PAC PPS. If implemented, the reform would have saved $80 billion in the 10-year budget window, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). 

“To further advance efforts toward a unified PAC PPS, CMS submitted the technical prototype to Congress in 2022,” Lisa Grabert, Marquette University research professor, testified during the hearing. “The main finding was the prototype is capable of Congress's intent toward a unified payment approach for post-acute services. Simply put, the unified PAC PPS is ready. I strongly recommend that Congress give CMS the authority to implement the unified PAC PPS.” 

Grabert went on to say that a unified PAC PPS may eliminate the need for several existing policies, including the home-bound requirement for home health services, the three-day inpatient hospital stay requirement for nursing homes, the 60% rule for rehab hospitals and the site-neutral payment criteria for long-term care hospitals. 

“There may also be rules that are appropriate to waive in the interim while the transition to a unified PAC PPS is underway,” she noted. “Congress should only consider regulatory relief in tandem with a unified PAC PPS. These regulatory policies are of high value to the industry-specific providers who receive FFS payments and are likely to add to the deficit. Revenue generated from implementing a non-budget-neutral unified PAC PPS is necessary to offset spending related to regulatory relief.” 

Not all industry insiders believe Grabert's proposal is good for home-based care. 

“The panel of witnesses brought many of the concerns we see in post-acute care,” Kornetti & Krafft Health Care Solutions CFO Sherry Teague told me. “However, the unified payor bill that Ms. Grabert lauded does not consider the uniqueness of home health. All other settings have a consistent brick-and-mortar aspect. We in home health never know what we are walking into. I feel she disregarded Medicare Advantage's impact on everything in post-acute care. This impact is almost always negative and more costly than traditional fee-for-service Medicare.” 

In a small win for home-based care, the House passed a continuing resolution on March 11, including a provision to extend the CMS Hospital-at-Home (HaH) waiver program and telehealth flexibilities through Sept. 30, pending Senate approval. 

The HaH program was initially scheduled to end on March 31. In February, the in-home care advocacy group Moving Health Home and nearly 100 backers sent a letter to Congress urging a five-year extension for the waiver. 

As of November 2024, 378 hospitals across 140 systems in 39 states have received approval to provide HaH services to patients, according to the American Hospital Association (AHA).

And Fleece spoke about the importance of telehealth to home-based care organizations.

“Telemedicine is a critical part of ensuring access to care, whether its recertification of hospice eligibility or ensuring that in crisis we can get access from a communications perspective to all of our patients,” Fleece said. “It is also mission critical to our home-based care organizations that those that are suffering chronic disease or are post-acute to ensure that home-based care is there for the rural communities through telemedicine to reduce hospitalizations, readmissions that home-based care has been proven to demonstrate.”

 Telehealth flexibilities are important to a variety of providers, with the AHA also weighing in on their potential extension.

“The American Hospital Association appreciates the House of Representatives extending these vital health policies that enable hospitals and health systems to serve their patients and communities without disruption,” an AHA spokesperson told me. “We remain committed to advocating for long-term solutions that advance health within Congress this year.”  

Now, it is all in the hands of the Senate. Hopefully, we will see an acceptable resolution soon that will extend the telehealth and HaH programs. But even more than that, here's hoping that the hearing this week is a step toward Congress considering not just money matters but what really matters – quality patient care at home.

Click Holdings (NASDAQ: CLIK) hat eine 25%ige Übernahme eines führenden Wettbewerbers im Bereich der Pflege in Hongkong angekündigt. Das übernommene Unternehmen bringt über 9.000 Pflegekräfte in die bestehende Datenbank von Click, die 11.000 registrierte Fachkräfte umfasst, und schafft so einen kombinierten Talentpool von mehr als 19.000 Gesundheitsarbeitern.

Die strategische Übernahme stärkt die Position von Click im Bereich der Gesundheits-Personalvermittlung, insbesondere im Pflegebereich für Senioren. Das Zielunternehmen hat über 10 Jahre Erfahrung in der Betreuung von Senioren in Hongkong. Dieser Schritt steht im Einklang mit der Mission von Click, die Lösungen für die Belegschaft zu verbessern und der wachsenden Nachfrage nach qualifizierten Pflegekräften gerecht zu werden.

Die Übernahme wird voraussichtlich betriebliche Synergien schaffen und das Dienstleistungsangebot, insbesondere im Bereich Häusliche Pflege für Senioren, erweitern. Click plant, im Rahmen seiner strategischen Vision 'Intelligente Häusliche Pflege-Lösungen für Senioren' zu entwickeln. Weitere Details zu Integrationsplänen und langfristigen Strategien werden in den kommenden Monaten bekannt gegeben.

CLIK's 25% acquisition of a nursing care competitor represents a significant operational expansion, immediately growing their talent pool by 73% from 11,000 to a combined 19,000+ registered personnel. This strategic approach secures key benefits while limiting financial commitment and integration complexity compared to a full acquisition.

The nursing HR sector in Hong Kong offers attractive recurring revenue characteristics, particularly valuable in the seniors care segment where demand typically remains stable regardless of economic conditions. The expanded talent database creates an immediate competitive advantage in fulfilling healthcare staffing needs.

While financial terms remain undisclosed, the synergy potential is substantial through database integration, operational efficiencies, and enhanced market coverage. This partial ownership structure suggests measured expansion, potentially allowing CLIK to evaluate performance before considering additional investment.

This acquisition accelerates CLIK's stated strategy of developing Smart Home Nursing Solutions while strengthening its position in the growing seniors care market. For a company with a market cap of just $15.6M, this represents a meaningful expansion that could significantly impact future revenue generation capabilities, though the immediate financial effect remains difficult to quantify without transaction details.

This strategic acquisition directly addresses workforce challenges in Hong Kong's healthcare sector by creating an expanded pool of qualified nursing professionals. The combined database of 19,000+ registered personnel significantly enhances CLIK's ability to match specialized nursing skills with specific client requirements - a critical differentiator in healthcare HR services.

The senior nursing care segment requires specialized expertise, and this acquisition immediately provides CLIK with access to professionals with over 10 years of experience serving this demographic. This expertise aligns perfectly with CLIK's vision of developing Smart Home Nursing Solutions for Seniors, potentially accelerating their technology-enabled care delivery models.

The healthcare staffing market benefits from consolidation, as larger talent pools increase placement efficiency and service reliability for institutional clients. By expanding their nursing care offerings, CLIK strengthens its competitive position against both traditional staffing agencies and emerging healthcare HR platforms.

Healthcare providers will benefit from access to this enlarged talent pool, potentially reducing staffing shortages that directly impact patient care quality. For CLIK, the ability to fulfill staffing requests more consistently creates opportunities for deeper institutional relationships and potential service expansion beyond basic staffing into more comprehensive workforce solutions.

With the rising costs of healthcare in developed nations and the availability of high-quality, affordable medical services in developing countries, patients are increasingly crossing borders for treatments ranging from cosmetic surgery to complex cardiac procedures. Iran, a country with a rich cultural heritage and a rapidly advancing healthcare system, has emerged as a key player in the medical tourism industry, particularly in the Middle East.

Role of medical tourism in the global economy

Medical tourism is a multi-billion-dollar industry that contributes significantly to the global economy. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global medical tourism market was valued at $44.8 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.1% from 2020 to 2027. The industry's growth is driven by factors such as the high cost of healthcare in developed countries, long waiting times for certain procedures, and the availability of affordable, high-quality medical care in developing nations.

Countries like Thailand, India, Turkey, and Mexico have long been popular destinations for medical tourists. These countries offer a combination of advanced medical facilities, skilled healthcare professionals, and lower costs compared to Western countries. For instance, a heart bypass surgery that costs $130,000 in the United States can be performed in India for just $10,000, including travel and accommodation expenses.

Medical tourism in the Middle East

The Middle East has also seen a surge in medical tourism, with countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan, and Iran leading the way. The UAE, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has invested heavily in state-of-the-art medical facilities and has positioned itself as a hub for medical tourism in the region. Jordan, on the other hand, has leveraged its reputation for high-quality healthcare and its proximity to conflict-ridden countries like Iraq and Syria to attract medical tourists.

Iran, however, stands out in the Middle East for its unique combination of affordable healthcare, highly skilled medical professionals, and a rich cultural heritage that attracts tourists. Despite facing economic sanctions and political challenges, Iran has managed to develop a robust healthcare system that rivals those of its neighbors. The country's medical tourism industry has grown significantly in recent years, driven by government support, private sector investment, and the increasing reputation of Iranian hospitals and clinics.

Medical tourism in Iran: a success story post-Islamic Revolution

Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has made significant strides in various sectors, including healthcare. The government has prioritized the development of the healthcare system, resulting in a network of hospitals, clinics, and medical research centers that offer a wide range of services. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Iran's healthcare system ranks among the top in the Middle East, with a life expectancy of 76 years and a maternal mortality rate of 16 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is lower than the global average.

The success of Iran's healthcare system has laid the foundation for the growth of medical tourism. The country offers a wide range of medical services, including cosmetic surgery, dental care, fertility treatments, and orthopedic procedures, at a fraction of the cost compared to Western countries. For example, a rhinoplasty (nose job) that costs $8,000 in the United States can be performed in Iran for just $2,000. Similarly, dental implants that cost $4,000 in Europe are available in Iran for $1,000.

Iran's medical tourism industry has also benefited from the government's efforts to promote the sector. In 2004, the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education established the "Health Tourism Council" to coordinate efforts between various stakeholders, including hospitals, travel agencies, and government agencies. The council has implemented policies to streamline visa procedures for medical tourists, improve the quality of healthcare services, and promote Iran as a medical tourism destination.

When compared to its neighboring countries, Iran's medical tourism industry stands out for its affordability, quality, and accessibility. Turkey, for instance, is a major competitor in the region, attracting millions of medical tourists each year. However, while Turkey offers high-quality healthcare services, the cost of treatment is generally higher than in Iran. For example, a hair transplant in Turkey costs around $3,000, while the same procedure in Iran costs $1,500.

Similarly, the UAE has positioned itself as a luxury medical tourism destination, offering world-class facilities and services. However, the cost of treatment in the UAE is significantly higher than in Iran, making it less accessible to patients from lower-income countries. Jordan, another key player in the region, has a well-established healthcare system but lacks the scale and diversity of medical services offered by Iran.

Iran's strategic location also gives it an advantage over its neighbors. The country shares borders with several countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, which have limited healthcare infrastructure. As a result, many patients from these countries travel to Iran for medical treatment. Additionally, Iran's visa policies are more lenient compared to some of its neighbors, making it easier for medical tourists to enter the country.

Main destinations of medical tourism in Iran

Several cities in Iran have emerged as hubs for medical tourism, offering a combination of advanced medical facilities, skilled healthcare professionals, and tourist attractions. The following are the main cities active in medical tourism:

- Tehran: As the capital city of Iran, Tehran is home to some of the country's most advanced hospitals and medical centers. The city offers a wide range of medical services, including cancer treatment, cardiac surgery, and fertility treatments. Tehran is also a cultural and historical hub, attracting tourists who combine medical treatment with sightseeing.

- Mashhad: Known as the religious capital of Iran, Mashhad attracts millions of pilgrims each year who visit the Imam Reza Shrine. The city has also developed a reputation for medical tourism, particularly in the fields of fertility treatments and cosmetic surgery. Mashhad's proximity to Central Asian countries makes it a popular destination for medical tourists from the region.

- Shiraz: Shiraz is renowned for its historical sites, including the ancient ruins of Persepolis and the beautiful gardens of Eram. The city is also a center for medical tourism, offering services in dermatology, ophthalmology, and orthopedics. Shiraz's combination of cultural heritage and medical expertise makes it a unique destination for medical tourists.

- Isfahan: Isfahan, known as "Half of the World" for its stunning architecture and historical landmarks, is also a growing hub for medical tourism. The city offers a range of medical services, including dental care, cosmetic surgery, and cardiovascular treatments. Isfahan's reputation for hospitality and its well-preserved historical sites make it an attractive destination for medical tourists.

- Tabriz: Located in northwestern Iran, Tabriz is a major center for medical tourism, particularly for patients from neighboring countries like Azerbaijan and Turkey. The city offers a range of medical services, including orthopedic surgery, neurology, and urology. Tabriz's strategic location and well-developed healthcare infrastructure make it a key player in Iran's medical tourism industry.

Iran's medical tourism industry has grown significantly in recent years, driven by the country's affordable healthcare services, skilled medical professionals, and government support. Despite facing economic sanctions and political challenges, Iran has managed to develop a robust healthcare system that rivals those of its neighbors. The country's strategic location, combined with its rich cultural heritage, makes it an attractive destination for medical tourists from the Middle East, Central Asia, and beyond.

As the global medical tourism industry continues to grow, Iran is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and further establish itself as a leading destination for medical tourism in the region. With continued investment in healthcare infrastructure and efforts to promote the sector, Iran has the potential to become a major player in the global medical tourism market.

A recent executive order from the Trump administration on healthcare price transparency signals this issue remains a priority 

The order requires federal agencies to issue guidance on standardizing pricing information and enforcement policies by May 26, 2025

All healthcare providers should be aware of the implications of the order and begin preparing for compliance by identifying exact prices of healthcare services and a presentable format for the information

On Feb. 25, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to “empower patients with clear, accurate, and actionable healthcare pricing information.” The order signals a return to a priority from President Trump's first term. 

A 2019 executive order from the first Trump administration required hospitals and health plans to publish “meaningful price and quality information” for public use. Hospitals were required to display pricing information for up to 300 services, and health plans were to post their negotiated rates. Both types of healthcare entities were required to make the information consumer-friendly.

The 2025 executive order picks up where the 2019 executive order left off. It directs the federal government to prioritize steps to “promote universal access to clear and accurate healthcare prices.” To realize these goals, it states federal agencies must: 1) require hospitals and health plans to disclose the actual price of items and services, 2) issue updated guidance or proposed actions to ensure pricing information is standardized and easily comparable across healthcare providers, and 3) issue guidance updating enforcement policies to ensure compliance. Federal agencies have until May 26, 2025, to take these actions.

The language of the executive order sheds some light on what healthcare providers can expect. First, while the 2019 order was directed at hospitals and health plans, the 2025 order includes no such limitation. This signals an expansion of price transparency across all provider classes. While hospitals and health plans should be prepared for new agency guidance and enforcement around price transparency, providers of all types should pay attention to this new guidance when it issues.  

Second, healthcare providers should begin analyzing pricing data to identify actual costs and present the information in a useful, consumer-friendly manner. Of note, the order explicitly prohibits healthcare providers from using price estimates. They must disclose the actual prices. 

Finally, healthcare providers should be prepared for increased scrutiny, additional enforcement, and faster compliance timelines. In 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) enforced violations by sending noncompliant hospitals or health plans a warning notice with instructions to correct the deficiencies within 90 days. If the hospital or health plan remained noncompliant, CMS issued a correct active plan (CAP) request with a 45-day deadline. Hospitals and health plans that still did not complete the necessary steps to come into compliance received a civil monetary penalty (CMP). 

Typically, providers took 195-220 days to come into compliance. As of April 2023, CMS issued 730 warning notices and 269 CAPS and imposed CMPs on four hospitals. The CMPs range from $300 to $5,500 per day of noncompliance times the number of beds at the hospital. However, the executive order signals a push for federal agencies, including CMS, to enforce price transparency faster and more rigorously. This may include use of automation to check providers' compliance.

All healthcare providers should be aware of the implications of this executive order and the May 26 deadline, particularly those who may be at increased risk for enforcement. Since there is some question of how healthcare providers will calculate exact prices, providers should consider using this time to sort through billing data, bundled pricing, and drug prices to identify prices. Further, providers should begin considering how the information can be presented in a useful, consumer-friendly manner. Using this time can ensure providers are prepared once federal agencies begin publishing guidance on standardization and enforcement.

The president's deregulatory bent means more responsibility rests on the shoulders of healthcare stakeholders to get artificial intelligence right.

First published on

Healthcare companies struggling to adopt artificial intelligence amid a lack of federal standards are unlikely to get any help from the Trump administration, placing the burden of responsible implementation squarely on the industry's shoulders.

That mandate is becoming increasingly difficult as the technology grows more complex, experts said during the HIMSS healthcare conference in Las Vegas.

“One thing that's clear is that this administration is not going to regulate AI. Good or bad, take that for what it is,” Tanay Tandon, the CEO of provider automation company Commure, said during a panel.

President Donald Trump's hands-off approach to AI governance means hospitals turning to the tools to save money and give overworked clinicians some relief will likely be operating in a regulatory gray area for at least the next four years.

The president says his goal is to free up U.S. developers to innovate. But that comes with downsides for tech developers and healthcare companies desperate for guardrails given AI's proclivity to make mistakes, degrade over time and exacerbate existing bias.

Not to mention, a lack of national standards might actually hamper AI development and adoption, according to some experts.

“When there isn't a federal framework, it can just absolutely cause all kinds of problems,” said Leigh Burchell, the chair of the Electronic Health Records Association. “We all just want to know what our rules are. And then we can comply.”

To date, a handful of federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services' technology office, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration, have published targeted rules around the use and quality of AI in healthcare. But neither Congress nor the executive branch have zeroed in on a comprehensive framework to regulate the models — despite some progress during the Biden administration, when an HHS task force was working to build a unified regulatory structure.

That task force unveiled a strategic plan in January — just 10 days before Trump's inauguration. However, Trump nixed the blueprint in one of his first executive orders.

Meanwhile, federal employees working on AI oversight, including at the FDA, have been caught up in the Trump administration's purge of the government's workforce. Amid the turmoil, the future of the HHS office that oversees AI policy remains unclear.

As a result, what little momentum there was in Washington to create a concrete strategy for overseeing health AI appears to have stalled out, at least for now. In its place, Trump has announced the Stargate Project, a $500 billion investment deal with private companies to prioritize AI development and maintain U.S. supremacy in the space — a high-stakes bet that was immediately complicated by the release of DeepSeek, a high-performing and inexpensive open source model from China.

"The current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down."

Brian Spisak

Program director of AI and leadership, Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative

The Trump administration did issue a request for information in early February to get public input on a potential national AI action plan. However, the plan's wording makes clear the administration's priorities: to “sustain and enhance America's AI dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper private sector AI innovation.”

The revocation of the Biden-era AI plan was largely symbolic, as agencies hadn't yet gotten around to imposing any requirements on developers or users.

But in “the current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down,” said Brian Spisak, program director of AI and leadership at Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, at HIMSS. “There's a lot of responsibility to leadership of health systems to find the optimal balance between innovation and speed and safety and tradition.”

That responsibility — which also rests on AI developers creating the models, software vendors weaving them into health records and the clinicians using them — is not negligible.

Currently, even the most futuristic AI at healthcare institutions is being used to automate administration, and only peripherally touches patient care. But that appears to be changing: There's growing interest among medical organizations in more clinical use cases for AI, like tailoring treatment plans or helping clinicians arrive at a diagnosis, according to a survey from HIMSS conducted in the fall.

Many of those use cases involve generative AI, which can create original text and images. But such models are known to hallucinate, or provide answers that are factually incorrect or irrelevant. AI can leave important information out, an error known as omission. Models can also drift, a term for when an AI's performance changes or degrades over time.

Given the increasing prevalence of AI in pulling data from EHR systems, transcribing doctor-patient visits and more, errors like these could interfere with clinicians' ability to care for patients, experts say.

Meanwhile, the technology is advancing at a stunning rate. Last year, the healthcare industry was just beginning to come to terms with governance for generative AI. But now, the conversation has already moved onto AI agents, which can complete complex tasks largely unsupervised by humans.

Commure's Tanay equated the current moment to when America moved from kerosene to electricity at the end of the 19th century.

“The way that we did things six months ago is completely irrelevant,” he said.

Because of the breakneck speed of development, federal standards from any administration would likely need to be flexible, experts say. 

The Biden administration's HHS task force suggested the government could create guidelines around testing and piloting tools, along with some support for adoption. However, it shied away from a prescriptive approach.

That's in line with the wish list from many stakeholders. Numerous executives at tech companies and hospital systems said any federal standards should be stratified by the level of risk an AI model imposes — for example, stricter oversight for algorithms that help doctors diagnose diseases, and looser restrictions for algorithms that help hospital staff allocate patients to beds.

“We have to weigh the balance between underregulation, which can potentially increase risk, and overregulation, which will stunt innovation,” said Anthony Chang, the chief intelligence and innovation officer at the Children's Hospital of Orange County in California, during a panel.

“The current administration is more likely to be on the underregulation side. So we have to be careful as a profession that we don't allow that to happen,” Chang said.

The lack of a playbook from Washington has left hospitals and medical groups scrambling to build their own internal controls amid a patchwork of state laws and voluntary standards released by industry groups.

States including Colorado, Utah and California have already enacted legislation establishing disclaimer requirements for AI systems. More states are considering similar laws: The Electronic Health Records Association is tracking 150 different state bills related to health AI, according to Burchell.

“There is a massive explosion of bills,” Burchell said.

But differing standards could stop health AI developers and software companies from rolling out products in specific states, potentially disadvantaging patients depending on where they live. More risk-averse software companies may avoid AI, or certain states, altogether, she added.

“Legislation of a lot of sizes and shapes at the state level is a risk to us, because it means we have to do all kinds of different development. We would rather develop one system that can be used broadly and accepted across the country,” Burchell said.

Health AI standards groups are also stepping into the gap left by the federal government. The groups — often made up of leading hospitals, digital health companies and tech giants — include the Health AI Partnership, an AI learning network for the industry, and the Coalition for Health AI, which recently launched an AI registry for hospitals.

”I think we'll probably see more of these non-government organizations like Health AI Partnership and some of those emerge as maybe our north stars today, as here's some leadership in the space,” said Rachel Wilkes, the corporate lead for generative AI initiatives at EHR vendor Meditech.

But standards from industry consortia hold little weight without the heft of the federal government behind them, experts say. Historically, voluntary standards aren't particularly effective.

“There's room for people to act in their own best interest, whatever that may be, without any sort of federal framework,” Wilkes said.

EHR vendors and hospital operators say they're building up rigorous internal standards for AI tools, including validation and frequent auditing.

“Government oversight has its place, but I do think the way that clinical practice evolves tends to be more driven by what's happening at a health system,” said Seth Howard, the executive vice president of research and development for Epic, the largest EHR company in the U.S.

In interviews, executives with Epic, Oracle, Meditech and eClinicalWorks said they're making AI available to doctors with rigorous oversight, including back-end accuracy checks and ongoing monitoring.

However, tech leaders stressed that it's also the hospital and the clinicians' responsibility to make sure everything is working as planned.

“We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen,” said Girish Navani, the CEO of eClinicalWorks.

Technology behemoths betting heavily on AI feel similarly. Google, for example, has worked with for-profit hospital giant HCA on an evaluation framework to catch any errors generated by its AI models and ensure their reliability, according to Aashima Gupta, the head of healthcare for Google Cloud.

“We provide those tools for an evaluation framework, and for all of this there's a human in the loop capturing the feedback, and that feedback loop then makes the model more effective,” Gupta said. “That's what gives me comfort.”

"We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen."

Though some in the private sector say they've got governance handled, modern AI is incredibly hard to oversee, according to AI engineers. The main advantage of generative AI — its creativity — also introduces subjectivity, making grading its outputs complicated.

For example, if two clinicians are tasked to summarize a patient's medical history based on clinical notes, their results could be incredibly different, albeit still accurate. It's the same with generative AI, experts say: How do you measure quality in a standardized way when there's that degree of variability?

“AI governance is still very much a maturing process,” said Harvard's Spisak.

Hospital executives say they're tackling oversight carefully. But some research suggests governance systems for simpler predictive AI models already aren't rigorous enough. Hospitals with explicit procedures for the use and assessment of AI tools are still struggling to identify and mitigate problems, according to a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Even some of the most well-resourced and tech-savvy systems are struggling.

The Cleveland Clinic has an AI governing body that includes stakeholders from across the academic medical center, according to Rohit Chandra, the Cleveland Clinic's chief digital officer. The task force oversees AI's impact on the organization's patients and workers while ensuring clinical safety and discussing thorny questions of privacy, legality and bias.

But “I don't think we've figured it all out,” Chandra said during a panel. “The term hallucination, for one, has just shown up in the last two, three years. And we still don't quite know how to deal with it.”

Hospitals should try to make specific people accountable for the performance of the tools, as part of a larger governing body that includes executives, lawyers, doctors and nurses, according to Brenton Hill, the head of operations at standards group CHAI.

Hospitals need to decide how to monitor AI effectively and report that information, which can depend on the products they have in place. They also need to consider what resources the AI will use and develop appropriate data use agreements with AI vendors, Hill said during a panel.

But “there's not one silver bullet governance structure that you can put out there that will solve all your problems,” Hill said.

Though a road map from federal regulators would be helpful, stakeholders working to integrate AI tools into healthcare said they're not holding their breath.

“While self-regulation is good, we don't believe that's sufficient. We believe AI is too important not to be regulated,” said Google's Gupta.

But when asked what she expects from the Trump administration, Gupta was noncommittal. “It's hard to say at this point. We are trying to figure out how we best work with them, share our best practices with them ... Too early to say. I think the entire healthcare community is waiting for that,” Gupta said.

Other experts said the Trump administration is a wake-up call for hospital executives who believed Washington could assume responsibility for overseeing AI.

Instead, the mandate should be on everyone touching the technology to ensure AI algorithms — given their shifting nature and innate opacity — perform as they're designed, especially in an industry where any mistakes could impact patient health.

“The easy answer is, if this regulatory body says it's safe, then I can trust it. I think people were hoping that might happen for AI,” said Aaron Neinstein, the chief medical officer of agentic AI company Notable. “I think that was a pipe dream.”

In summary

California is spending more than it expected on Medi-Cal and Republican lawmakers are pointing to coverage expansions that benefited immigrant households.

Welcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for WhatMatters to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.

The California health care program that covers almost 15 million people is costing more money than Gov. Gavin Newsom projected, creating a new budget problem in a lean year. 

Now his administration is borrowing $3.4 billion from the state's general fund to cover the unexpected cost increase. It's unclear when the administration plans to restore the money.

The administration acknowledged that more people are enrolled in the program than the state anticipated, and that the state is spending $2.7 billion more than it planned on coverage expansions for immigrants without legal status.  

Roughly 1.6 million immigrants without legal status are enrolled in Medi-Cal, according to state data. The program is a lifeline to people who traditionally have not had access to health insurance, and California is one of six states that offer coverage to immigrant adults regardless of whether they are in the country legally. 

Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones said Newsom has overpromised and under-delivered on health care at a time when all Californians are struggling to afford the cost of living in the state.

“Democrats and the governor are picking priorities, and they're prioritizing people that have come into our country illegally over people who immigrated here legally, people that are citizens,” Jones said.

The state's Medi-Cal expansion for undocumented immigrants costs about $8.5 billion from the state general fund annually, according to a recent budget hearing. 

“If we weren't spending eight-and-a-half billion dollars on illegal immigrants, we wouldn't need to borrow $3.4 billion to cover the difference,” Jones said.

Δ

H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the state's finance department, acknowledged that the rise in spending is partially attributable to higher-than-projected costs associated with larger enrollment numbers for California's undocumented population. In January, the Department of Health Care Services, which oversees Medi-Cal, estimated California is spending $2.7 billion beyond what it budgeted due to the cost of covering care and prescriptions for newly enrolled immigrants.

But immigrants aren't the only population that is using Medi-Cal more than the state expected.

California's Medi-Cal population in general ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic when the federal government temporarily suspended income eligibility checks to keep people insured during the national emergency. Before the pandemic about 13 million people used Medi-Cal. That number peaked at 15.6 million in 2023 when eligibility checks resumed. Today 14.9 million people are enrolled, according to state data.

The Legislative Analyst's Office has also noted a 40% growth over the last four years in the number of seniors enrolled in Medi-Cal. While seniors make up only about 10% of the program's enrollees, they account for a large part of the program's spending because benefits such as long-term care are among the most expensive. 

Medi-Cal spends about $15,000 a year per senior. That compares to the $8,000 a year the program spends on average on other enrollees. 

Newsom's office said these issues are neither new nor unique to California. Medi-Cal is California's version of Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health coverage nationwide to low-income households.

“Rising Medicaid costs are a national challenge, affecting both red and blue states alike,” Elana Ross, a spokesperson for the governor's office, said in an email.

Sen. Roger Niello, a long-time critic of the state's closed-door budgeting process, which is typically hashed out between Democratic leaders and the governor, acknowledged that other factors like senior enrollment and high drug costs could be contributing to the high expenses. He said Republicans are worried about increasing spending on immigrant health care.

The Republican from Roseville criticized the lack of transparency from Newsom's finance department.

“The completely opaque nature of the request, which says nothing about any of that, is entirely inappropriate,” Niello said.

Democratic lawmakers said they need more information about what exactly is behind the unexpected spending increases, but pushed back on the idea that the state would need to roll back coverage for its undocumented population.  

“Immigrant workers and families, who pay billions in taxes, deserve access to care, and I am proud to protect California's progress expanding Medi-Cal,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said in a statement. “There are tough choices ahead, and Assembly Democrats will closely examine any proposal from the governor. But let's be clear: We will not roll over and leave our immigrants behind.”

Immigrants lacking permanent status contribute approximately $8.5 billion in state and local taxes a year, according to an analysis by the California Budget and Policy Center, a nonprofit research group. That's about the same amount it's costing the state to give them Medi-Cal.

State lawmakers first allowed undocumented children to enroll in Medi-Cal in 2016 under Gov. Jerry Brown. Since then Newsom has approved adding young adults up to age 25 in 2020 and older adults and seniors in 2022. Adults ages 26-49 were the final group added in 2024. Throughout those years, even some Republican lawmakers supported covering this population. 

“The Republicans need to take a better and keen-eyed look at the timeline associated with those expansions,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta, an Oakland Democrat who leads the Health Committee. “For them to just try to play the blame game and put it all at the feet of California values to ensure that we have universal health coverage for all with this particular age group being included is just specious.”

Assemblymember Dawn Addis, who chairs a budget subcommittee on health, said she will be questioning Newsom officials closely about the spending increase in an upcoming hearing. 

“We really need to understand the details of what the Department of Finance is saying, what the executive is seeing, and how they're calculating this information,” Addis, a Democrat from San Luis Obispo, said.

Addis emphasized that the biggest threat to Medi-Cal right now is coming from the federal government.

House Republicans recently voted to advance a proposal that could result in cuts of $880 billion to a group of programs, largely Medicaid, over the next 10 years. The California Budget and Policy Center has estimated that the proposals currently at play in Congress could translate into annual losses of $10 billion to $20 billion a year for the state.

“The reason why it's so important for us to fight back against cuts at the federal level to Medicaid is because there is no easy or painless solution to fill that budget hole,” said Amanda McAllister-Wallner, interim executive director of Health Access California. 

Health Access California along with the California Immigrant Policy Center spearheaded the campaign nearly a decade ago to insure all immigrants in the state. 

McAllister-Wallner said it was unfair and unreasonable to pin the state budget shortfall on the immigrant expansions. Over the same time period, the state has added benefits, such as doula services and family therapy, and invested heavily in reforming the system through a multibillion-dollar initiative called CalAIM.

“Those changes that we've made in Medi-Cal made the program stronger (and) have made the state healthier,” McAllister-Wallner said.

Students, educators, counselors, and professionals across eastern Kentucky are invited to Shaping Our Appalachian Region, or SOAR's, Healthcare Career Pathway Fair. Officials said the university is a prime spot for the event because of its bolstered healthcare and education systems, though attendees will get to meet and network with professionals and organizations across the region.

Kirsten Wilburn is the Operations Manager with SOAR. She said one goal of the fair is to foster and encourage prospective healthcare workers to dedicate their service to eastern Kentucky, a region that's been hit hard by a lack of practitioners.

“We have an aging population of people who stay here, but our out migration is showing a younger population leaving,” said Wilburn. “So, our big thing is we need our youth to stay here to not only work and be part of this economic ecosystem in eastern Kentucky, but also to care for the generations that built this place for them.”

Wilburn added non-traditional students, including people who do not pursue a four-year degree immediately after high school, are a key population the fair hopes to reach. Sometimes, these students don't always see a clear path forward, and Wilburn said SOAR hopes to show these students that they can pursue healthcare in a multitude of ways.

“That doesn't always include four-year degrees. That includes two-year degrees, or training certifications. So, this whole event is really aimed to solidify that issue. We educate the students about it, but on the other side of that we educate the teachers and counselors who attend the event with the students,” said Wilburn.

The SOAR Healthcare Career Pathway Fair will be held on March 18, 9 a.m. 2 p.m. on MSU's campus. Attendees will participate in multiple hands-on educational workshops and networking sessions. Registration for students and school groups is available online.

L'ample portée de R1, qui dessert 94 des 100 principaux systèmes de santé américains, permet d'accéder à un vaste ensemble de données, y compris :plus de 180 millions de transactions annuelles de payeurs550 millions de rencontres annuelles avec des patients20 000 algorithmes de paiement propriétaires1,2 milliard d'actions de flux de travail annuelles

Le laboratoire, déjà opérationnel, développe des applications alimentées par l'intelligence artificielle pour des tâches telles que le codage, la facturation et la gestion des refus. R1 prévoit de déployer des solutions complètes pour des 'travailleurs RCM agentiques' auprès de clients entreprises dans la seconde moitié de 2025.

R1 und Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR) haben sich zusammengeschlossen, um R37 zu starten, ein fortschrittliches KI-Labor, das sich auf die Transformation der finanziellen Leistung im Gesundheitswesen konzentriert. Die Zusammenarbeit kombiniert R1s umfangreiche Expertise im Revenue Cycle Management mit Palantirs KI-Fähigkeiten, um intelligente Automatisierungslösungen für Herausforderungen im Gesundheitswesen zu entwickeln.

Die Initiative spricht ein kritisches Bedürfnis an, da die Verwaltungskosten über 40 % der Krankenhausausgaben in den USA ausmachen, wobei jährlich mehr als 160 Milliarden Dollar für das Revenue Cycle Management ausgegeben werden. R1s erheblicher Einfluss, der 94 der 100 größten Gesundheitssysteme in den USA bedient, bietet Zugang zu umfangreichen Daten, darunter:über 180 Millionen jährliche Zahlungen550 Millionen jährliche Patientenkontakte20.000 proprietäre Zahlungsalgorithmen1,2 Milliarden jährliche Workflow-Aktionen

Das Labor, das bereits in Betrieb ist, entwickelt KI-gestützte Anwendungen für Aufgaben wie Codierung, Abrechnung und Management von Ablehnungen. R1 plant, in der zweiten Hälfte des Jahres 2025 umfassende 'agentische RCM-Arbeiter'-Lösungen für Unternehmenskunden bereitzustellen.

Palantir's partnership with R1 to launch R37 represents a strategic expansion into healthcare financial operations - a massive market with $160 billion spent annually on revenue cycle management. This collaboration enables Palantir to apply its AI technology to a critical healthcare pain point where administrative costs consume over 40% of U.S. hospital expenses.

The partnership provides Palantir with two immediate strategic advantages: access to R1's extensive client base (94 of the top 100 U.S. health systems) and leverage of R1's massive data repository (180+ million annual payer transactions, 550 million patient encounters). This data-rich environment creates an ideal application scenario for Palantir's AI systems.

What differentiates this deal is Palantir's direct operational integration, with engineers embedded within R1's operations - signaling a deeper partnership than typical technology licensing arrangements. The lab is already operational and showing positive results in testing, though full commercial deployment to enterprise customers won't begin until H2 2025.

While immediate revenue impact will be minimal, this partnership demonstrates Palantir's continued expansion of its commercial AI applications beyond government contracts into specialized enterprise workflows, specifically addressing operational inefficiencies in healthcare administration. The focus on "agentic" AI solutions also aligns with Palantir's strategic emphasis on autonomous AI agents for complex operational tasks.

 MURRAY, Utah & DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
R1, an industry leader in revenue cycle management (“RCM”) with over 20 years of experience, and Palantir Technologies (NASDAQ:PLTR), a leader in artificial intelligence systems, have partnered to launch R37, an advanced AI lab dedicated to revolutionizing healthcare financial performance. By combining R1's deep category expertise in payer-provider dynamics and proprietary technology capabilities with Palantir's cutting-edge AI tools, the lab will develop intelligent automation solutions to address the most pressing challenges in healthcare reimbursement at an impressive speed and scale.



Administrative costs now account for more than 40% of U.S. hospital expenses, with over $160 billion spent annually on RCM. As providers face escalating economic pressures and complex payer relationships, AI-native solutions have become a necessity. R37 will drive comprehensive automation in revenue cycle operations, reengineering labor-intensive processes such as coding, billing, and denials management to significantly improve efficiency, accuracy, and cash flow for healthcare organizations.



R1's extensive reach—serving 94 of the top 100 U.S. health systems—uniquely positions it to transform RCM. R1 has been supporting automated revenue cycle workflows at scale across the largest repository of proprietary RCM structured and unstructured data. The repository includes: 180 million+ annual payer transactions, 550 million annual patient encounters, 20,000 proprietary payment algorithms, and 1.2 billion annual workflow actions. By integrating Palantir's AI tools and capabilities with R1's existing technology and domain expertise, R37 can unlock faster, more precise scalable reimbursement outcomes.



“R1 is thrilled to partner with Palantir to bring the transformational power of agentic AI to the revenue cycle through R37,” said Joe Flanagan, CEO of R1. “With our leading experts in reimbursement and history of automation, this lab will further accelerate investments on behalf of providers and create a new revenue cycle that delivers a faster, frictionless, and more transparent financial experience for both providers and patients.”



"R1 brings unmatched ambition to an area of healthcare that desperately needs it,” said Alex Karp, co-founder and CEO of Palantir Technologies. “By embedding our engineers directly within R1's operations, we can rapidly scale intelligent automation and drive measurable impact at speed—ultimately enabling providers to focus on delivering better patient care.”



The lab has been operational for months and has been producing AI-powered agentic applications that are already driving transformational benefits in initial batch testing. R1 expects to deploy comprehensive ‘agentic RCM worker' solutions to a group of enterprise customers in the second half of 2025.

When patients walked into Planned Parenthood clinics, a consumer data company sold their precise locations to anti-abortion groups for targeted ads.

When patients picked up prescriptions for testosterone replacement therapy, law enforcement retrieved their names and addresses without a warrant.

And when a father was arrested by immigration authorities, agents allegedly accessed his personal information from a medical clinic where he received diabetes treatment.

Progressive California lawmakers have proposed a number of bills aimed at bolstering privacy protections for women, transgender people, and immigrants in response to such intrusions by anti-abortion groups, conservative states, and federal law enforcement agencies as President Donald Trump declares the nation "will be woke no longer" and flexes his executive power to roll back rights.

Democrats have supermajorities in the state legislature, but even if they pass the proposals, they may first need to lobby one of their own: Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has noticeably tempered his once harsh criticism of Trump.

Last month, the Democratic governor issued a rare veto threat against a bill that would expand the state's sanctuary law to limit cooperation between state prisons and federal immigration agents. And Newsom recently called transgender athletes' participation in women's sports "deeply unfair" on his new podcast with guest Charlie Kirk, a founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA. Newsom went on to tell Kirk that he had a "hard time with" the way the right talks about transgender people.

Billions of dollars are also on the line for California. Newsom visited the White House last month seeking unconditional aid for wildfire victims in Los Angeles, and the state relies on Washington for over 60% of its Medicaid budget, which is vulnerable to significant cuts under the GOP's budget blueprint.

"California's leaders have not been as aggressive, out of recognition that there are many things that the state needs federal cooperation on," said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California-San Diego.

A Newsom spokesperson declined to comment on pending legislation. He has a track record of supporting abortion, transgender, and immigrant rights.

Since taking office, Trump has granted the Elon Musk-controlled Department of Government Efficiency — created through a Trump executive order — access to previously restricted data, including medical information, raising concerns that sensitive information could be exposed without proper safeguards. 

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

While most Americans are familiar with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, it offers only narrow protection for patients in health care settings. There's no comprehensive federal law protecting data privacy.

Health care information has increasingly become a tool of surveillance and enforcement, and in states that have banned certain medical treatments or toughened immigration laws, vulnerable populations are at greater risk, said Suzanne Bernstein, a health privacy rights expert with the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

Progressive Democrats are concerned that personal information and people's medical decisions could be used to monitor or criminalize patients, facilitate arrests in or near health care facilities, or jeopardize access to health care services.

They and health privacy advocates say now is the time to shore up protections for the nearly 2 million immigrants living in California without authorization, the more than 200,000 transgender adults in the state, and thousands of people — living in the state or out of state — in need of abortion care in California each year. Some of these laws could take effect immediately if signed.

"This is about making sure that people are able to access critical health care in California and to take the politics out of our hospitals and health clinics," said state Sen. Jesse Arreguín, who hopes the governor would sign his bill to protect immigrants.

The bills are expected to be debated in Sacramento in the coming months.

Since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, anti-abortion groups have purchased location information from consumer data companies to target people seeking abortion care with anti-abortion ads. And authorities in states with abortion bans have used cellphone data to enforce laws beyond their borders.

A bill introduced by state Assembly member Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, AB 45, would make geofencing, the collection of phone location by data brokers, illegal around health care facilities that provide in-person services. It would also prevent reproductive health information collected during research from being disclosed in response to out-of-state requests.

Conservative organizations said the proposal would single them out by restricting their ability to inform women about alternatives to abortion, including services offered by crisis pregnancy centers.

"I think that could very well be a First Amendment violation," said Jonathan Keller, president of the California Family Council, a statewide anti-abortion nonprofit. "It doesn't seem like the bill would be prohibiting or putting any restrictions on a group like Planned Parenthood if they wanted to market or target to a local high school or college."

So far this year, lawmakers in 49 states have introduced more than 700 anti-transgender bills, seeking to ban gender-affirming care, prohibit gender identity education in schools, or restrict transgender students from participating in sports, according to the Trans Legislation Tracker, a national research organization tracking bills affecting transgender people. Transgender adults represent less than 1% of the U.S. population.

And some states with bans or restrictions on gender-affirming care have been targeting health care data. In 2023, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis requested that Florida universities release data on the number of individuals who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria or received treatment at campus clinics. That same year, Missouri's Republican attorney general, Andrew Bailey, submitted 54 requests to one hospital seeking information about gender-affirming care procedures.

Trump has issued a series of executive orders to ban access to gender-affirming care for minors. Federal judges have temporarily blocked some portions of his orders.

To guard against other states that criminalize or ban gender-affirming care, California state Sen. Scott Wiener wants to expand current protections for minors to include adults.

His bill, SB 497, would require law enforcement to obtain a warrant to access state databases on gender-affirming care and make it a misdemeanor to release the data to unauthorized parties. It would also prohibit health care providers, employers, and insurers from releasing information about a person who seeks or obtains gender-affirming physical and mental health care to an agency or individual from another state.

"We want to make sure that we are as comprehensively as possible shielding trans people from hate emanating from the federal government, other states, and private parties," Wiener said.

Keller countered that authorities in states with bans on abortion or gender-affirming care should have access to medical information as they investigate providers who could harm patients or coerce them into procedures against their will. He cited a lawsuit against Kaiser Permanente over a teenager who detransitioned after undergoing gender-affirming care. A 2015 survey found it was uncommon for people undergoing gender-affirming care to decide to permanently detransition.

"The only way that you're able to uncover that level of widespread malpractice and malfeasance is if these health care records are able to be accessed," Keller said.

The California Family Council plans to oppose both bills.

Earlier this year, Trump rescinded a long-standing policy of not making immigration arrests near hospitals, schools, or churches. The decision has providers fearful that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will disrupt their work at health facilities and prompt immigrants to skip medical care — for themselves or, of particular concern, their children.

Anticipating the move, California's Democratic attorney general, Rob Bonta, issued guidance in December advising health care providers how best to respond if ICE comes to their doorstep. But while private entities are encouraged to follow these policies, only state-run facilities are required to adopt them.

"Some health care providers have implemented them, but not everyone has," Arreguín said.

Arreguín's SB 81 would require all health care facilities, including hospitals and community-based clinics, to follow state guidance to limit cooperation with immigration authorities. It would also prohibit providers from granting access to private areas or places where a patient is actively receiving treatment or care, unless there's a warrant.

Another immigration bill, AB 421, would limit the sharing of local law enforcement information if agents plan to make an arrest within a one-mile radius of a hospital or medical office, a child care or day care facility, a religious institution, or a place of worship. California law enforcement has some discretion to share information with immigration agents when an individual has been convicted of a serious crime or felony.

Kousser said immigration is more complicated for California politicians than health privacy. Although a February poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 7 in 10 Californians think immigrants are a benefit to the state, Kousser said that lawmakers, especially those who won by narrow margins in contested districts, still have to make tough political choices.

Senate Republican leader Brian Jones, who represents a predominantly Democratic district in San Diego, is proposing to change California's sanctuary policies to require law enforcement to share information with ICE when a person has been convicted of a serious crime.

"When these violent felons are released from local custody, they go right back into the communities that they came from to re-victimize those same immigrant communities," Jones said.

But Jones acknowledged the need for nuance when it comes to health privacy.

"Look, the bottom line for me on this immigration reform in America is it needs to be humanitarian and it needs to make sense," Jones said. "And so, if there are areas that we need to protect folks, it might make sense."

Oops, something went wrong

Wrapping up Q4 earnings, we look at the numbers and key takeaways for the healthcare technology for providers stocks, including Phreesia (NYSE:PHR) and its peers.

The healthcare technology industry focuses on delivering software, data analytics, and workflow solutions to hospitals, clinics, and other care facilities. These companies enable providers to streamline operations, optimize patient outcomes, and transition to value-based care models. They boast subscription-based revenues or long-term contracts, providing financial stability and growth potential. However, they face challenges such as lengthy sales cycles, significant upfront investment in technology development, and reliance on providers' adoption of new tools, which can be hindered by budget constraints or resistance to change. Over the next few years, the sector is poised for growth as providers increasingly prioritize digital transformation and efficiency in response to rising healthcare costs and patient demand for seamless care. Tailwinds include the growing adoption of AI-driven tools for patient engagement and operational improvements, government incentives for digitization, and the expansion of telehealth and remote patient monitoring. However, headwinds such as tightening hospital budgets, cybersecurity threats, and the fragmented nature of healthcare systems could slow adoption.

Luigi Mangione's defense attorney in Pennsylvania continues to argue that Altoona police unlawfully detained the murder suspect and searched his belongings when they identified him at a McDonald's following a tip.

Mangione, 26, is charged with first-degree murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, stalking and a slew of other state and federal charges in both New York and Pennsylvania, for allegedly gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a married father of two, on a sidewalk in Manhattan in December 2024.

Now his attorney says authorities' use of the word “manifesto” to describe Mangione's writings allegedly found in his backpack during his arrest on Dec. 9 is “incorrect.”

“The use of this characterization of the defendant's alleged personal experiences and writings is incorrect, improper and without justification and has no probative value,” Altoona-based defense attorney Thomas Dickey said in a Tuesday court filing. “Defendant believes that this characterization was done so solely for the purpose to prejudice the defendant and put him in a negative light before the public, all in an effort to prejudice any potential jury pool.”

Mangione allegedly shot Thompson outside the Manhattan hotel where UnitedHealthcare's annual shareholder conference was being held, in an act prosecutors believe was meant to send a message to the healthcare insurance industry based on a manifesto found on the suspect when he was arrested days after Thompson's murder.

In his writings, Mangione apparently expressed his grievances with the healthcare industry — specifically naming UnitedHealthcare and the shareholder conference where Thompson was headed in New York at the time of the assassination.

Dickey is asking the court not to describe Mangione's alleged writings as a “manifesto.”

He is also asking the court to suppress various other evidence, including what Dickey describes as a warrantless search of the suspect's backpack, statements made to police during his arrest and DNA evidence.

Mangione's attorney argued that Mangione had been improperly detained and arrested at the McDonald's, so certain evidence collected during that arrest should not be submitted as evidence against his client.

The 26-year-old suspect has a degree from the Ivy League University of Pennsylvania and attended an elite private high school in Baltimore.

Despite some supporters' characterization of him as an anti-capitalist crusader, he allegedly stopped at a New York City Starbucks for coffee minutes before the murder and was ultimately arrested while eating hashbrowns at McDonald's.

Mangione is accused of “meticulously” planning the murder with the motive of igniting a “public discussion about the healthcare industry,” according to the US Department of Justice.

New York prosecutors said Mangione plotted to travel to New York; find Thompson, a Minnesota resident in town for UnitedHealthcare's annual shareholder conference; and kill him.

Mangione allegedly shot Thompson from behind with a 3D-printed ghost gun and suppressor. 

The NYPD released a still image from surveillance video, showing him pulling his face mask down and smiling while flirting with a clerk at the check-in of the Manhattan hostel where police say he stayed for the murder. It went viral and immediately attracted a wave of support online for the accused killer.

The suspect allegedly fled the scene of Thompson's murder, rode a bike to a bus station and took a bus to Altoona, where he was ultimately identified and arrested.

Mangione is originally from Maryland and recently lived in California and Hawaii.

He graduated as valedictorian from the Gilman School, a private, all-boys high school in Baltimore, in 2016.

Mangione went on to receive his bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2020.

U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy informed members of Congress on Thursday he has signed an agreement with the General Services Administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to right-size the Postal Service budget.

The Postal Service moved in January to cut 10,000 jobs cuts through an early retirement offer to eligible workers.

In a letter to Congress, DeJoy lamented that the Postal Service has a "broken business model that was not financially sustainable without critically necessary and core change."

"Fixing a broken organization that had experienced close to $100 billion in losses and was projected to lose another $200 billion, without a bankruptcy proceeding, is a daunting task," DeJoy wrote. "Fixing a heavily legislated and overly regulated organization as massive, important, cherished, misunderstood and debated as the United States Postal Service, with such a broken business model, is even more difficult."

DOGE will assist USPS with addressing "big problems" at the $78 billion-a-year agency, which has sometimes struggled in recent years to stay afloat. The agreement aims to help the Postal Service identify and achieve "further efficiencies."

USPS listed such issues as mismanagement of the agency's retirement assets and Workers' Compensation Program, as well as an array of regulatory requirements that the letter described as "restricting normal business practice."

"This is an effort aligned with our efforts, as while we have accomplished a great deal, there is much more to be done," DeJoy wrote.

Critics of the agreement fear negative effects of the cuts will be felt across America. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerald Connolly, of Virginia, who was sent the letter, said turning over the Postal Service to DOGE would result in it being undermined and privatized.

"The only thing worse for the Postal Service than DeJoy's ‘Delivering for America' plan is turning the service over to Elon Musk and DOGE so they can undermine it, privatize it, and then profit off Americans' loss," Connolly said in a statement.

He added: "This capitulation will have catastrophic consequences for all Americans – especially those in rural and hard to reach areas – who rely on the Postal Service every day to deliver mail, medications, ballots, and more. Reliable mail delivery can't just be reserved for MAGA supporters and Tesla owners."

The National Association of Letter Carriers President Brian L. Renfroe said in a statement in response to Thursday's letter that they welcome anyone's help with addressing some of the agency's biggest problems but stood firmly against any move to privatize the Postal Service.

"Common-sense solutions are what the Postal Service needs, not privatization efforts that will threaten 640,000 postal employees' jobs, 7.9 million jobs tied to our work, and the universal service every American relies on daily," he said.

USPS currently employs about 640,000 workers tasked with making deliveries, from inner cities to rural areas and even far-flung islands.

The service plans to cut 10,000 employees in the next 30 days through a voluntary early-retirement program announced in January, according to the letter.

The agency previously announced plans to cut its operating costs by more than $3.5 billion annually. And this isn't the first time thousands of employees have been cut. In 2021, the agency cut 30,000 workers.

As the service, which has operated as an independent entity since 1970, has struggled to balance the books with the decline of first-class mail, it has fought calls from President Donald Trump and others that it be privatized.

Last month, Trump said he may put USPS under the control of the Department of Commerce in what would be an executive branch takeover.

LEXINGTON, Ky. (March 14, 2025) — For children battling cancer, keeping up with school can be a challenge due to frequent medical appointments, hospital stays and treatment side effects. The Providing Assistance With School (PAWS) Program at the DanceBlue Kentucky Children's Hospital Hematology/Oncology Clinic bridges the gap between education and medical care, ensuring young patients stay on track academically.

Led by school intervention specialists, PAWS works directly with families, schools, and medical teams to provide essential support. Whether a child is unable to attend school due to intensive treatment or is struggling with cognitive side effects from medication, PAWS helps by coordinating with teachers, securing accommodations and offering academic assistance wherever the student is — be it in the clinic, hospital or at home.

Since the PAWS Program was established in 2014, more than 800 patients, from preschoolers to college students, have benefited from the services of the school intervention specialists.

SACRAMENTO – California Gov. Gavin Newsom is seeking a $3.4 billion loan from the general fund to help a shortfall in the state Medi-Cal healthcare program. 

It comes a year after the governor expanded Medi-Cal to undocumented immigrants.

A spokesperson for the governor's office said the money was needed for several reasons, including rising costs of health care in general.

It's the state medical coverage of undocumented immigrants now creating political pushback. 

"More mismanagement by this governor," Republican Assembly Minority Leader James Gallagher said. 

Gallager was quick to pounce on the problem of the state health insurance program for low-income people. 

"What has been the biggest driver of cost to the medical system," Gallagher said. "It's been adding illegal immigrants to those rolls."

The estimated cost for Medi-Cal for undocumented immigrants ballooned from a projected $6.4 billion in July, to $9.5 billion now.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas issued a statement reading in part:

"There are tough choices ahead, and Assembly Democrats will closely examine any proposal from the governor. But let's be clear: We will not roll over and leave our immigrants behind."

Jose Rodriguez is the president of El Concilio California, an immigrant rights organization that receives California funding to help sign people up for Medi-Cal.

"It just seems unfortunate that we're short on funding as a government we always want to scapegoat the immigrant community," Rodriguez said. "These are some of the hardest working people in our country and doing the job that no one else wants to do."

"I'm sure there will be an effort to roll back some of the access because the federal government is threatening to cut Medicaid," Rodriguez said.

Newsom rolled out the state's full-scope Medi-Cal expansion to undocumented immigrants in 2019 and expanded the program to all ages in 2024. 

Now there is new scrutiny over California healthcare costs that could lead to cuts. 

So far the governor's finance department has not released a detailed breakdown what caused the increase in healthcare costs or if there will be more money needed from the general fund on top of this loan.

California's Medicaid program has borrowed $3.4 billion from the state's general fund — and will likely need even more — to cover ballooning health expenses for 15 million residents with low incomes and disabilities.

The state Department of Finance disclosed the loan to lawmakers in a letter late Wednesday, noting funds were needed to make critical payments to health care providers in Medi-Cal, the state's version of Medicaid. In recent months, Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration has warned of skyrocketing health care costs, including higher prescription drug prices and increased enrollment by newly eligible seniors and immigrants without legal status.

Finance spokesperson H.D. Palmer said the loan will cover Medi-Cal obligations through the end of the month. He declined to specify the total of the program's potential shortfall. However, a document circulated by state Senate leaders warns that additional funding may be needed to cover expenses through June 30, the end of the fiscal year.

The cost overrun adds a new layer of difficulty for Democrats who control the legislature and are already grappling with congressional budget plans that could slash Medicaid funding, which accounts for 60% of Medi-Cal's $174.6 billion budget. President Donald Trump and Republican lawmakers have also criticized California Democrats for covering residents regardless of their immigration status.

Newsom spokesperson Izzy Gardon downplayed the loan. "Rising Medicaid costs are a national challenge, affecting both red and blue states alike," Gardon said. "This is not unique to California."

Health officials last year said the state would spend roughly $6.4 billion in the 2024-25 fiscal year to cover immigrants without legal status, which the Democratic governor has hailed as a key step toward his goal of providing "universal coverage" for Californians. In recent testimony, however, finance staff told legislators that benefits to all income-eligible Californians are projected to cost roughly $9.5 billion, of which $8.4 billion will come from the general fund.

Republicans called for fresh scrutiny of the state's decision to cover residents without legal status. "This program is out of control," Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones posted on the social platform X. "We are demanding a full hearing and a full cost analysis so the public knows exactly where their tax dollars are going."

Patient advocates objected to Republicans singling out the expansion for immigrants.

"Health care costs are influenced by many factors including prescription drugs, hospital costs, and more," said Rachel Linn Gish, a spokesperson for Health Access California, a consumer health advocacy group.

According to a fall update from the Department of Health Care Services, Medi-Cal spending grew due to higher-than-expected enrollment of seniors, fewer Californians losing Medi-Cal coverage than anticipated, and increased pharmaceutical spending, as well as expanding coverage of immigrants. For instance, the state is spending $1.1 billion more on residents who were expected to lose coverage after the covid-19 pandemic, and an additional $2.7 billion more than anticipated to cover unauthorized residents.

Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said he's committed to maintaining the state's expansions of Medi-Cal services.

"There are tough choices ahead, and Assembly Democrats will closely examine any proposal from the Governor," he said in a statement. "But let's be clear: We will not roll over and leave our immigrants behind."

Senate leaders said they were looking closely at the state's estimated costs and caseloads and would recommend cost containment measures as part of their budget proposal in the coming weeks.

Scott Graves, budget director at the California Budget & Policy Center, said it's not unusual for the state government to make adjustments when spending doesn't line up with projections.

Last year, for instance, the state borrowed $1.75 billion against its general fund when revenues from a state provider tax were delayed. Prior to that, Department of Finance officials said, California took out a similar loan in 2018 for $830 million.

"The reality is all of these are just estimates, especially with a very complicated program like Medi-Cal," Graves said, noting that $3.4 billion is roughly 2% of the state's overall Medi-Cal budget. "It seems like we're on the verge of making a mountain out of a molehill."

Mike Genest, who served as finance director under Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, agreed that adjustments can be routine. But he said the magnitude of Medi-Cal's current overrun was not.

"For this to happen in the middle of the year — we're only in March — I mean, that's pretty astounding," Genest said.

California Democrats continue to characterize Trump and congressional Republicans as the biggest threat, pointing to the House budget plan to shrink Medicaid spending by as much as $880 billion. They say cuts of that magnitude would leave millions of residents uninsured, reducing access to preventive care and driving up costlier emergency room services.

They cautioned that some short-term cost increases could be driven by newly eligible residents seeking long-delayed care, which could level off in coming years. However, some acknowledge difficult decisions ahead.

"We definitely have to ensure that those who are our most vulnerable — our kids, those with chronic conditions — continue to have some sort of coverage," said Democratic Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson, a San Diego County physician. "The question is, what will that look like? To be quite honest with you, at this point, I don't know."

Fox News host Jessica Tarlov on Thursday summed up Americans' displeasure with President Donald Trump's second term as she argued that Democrats' messaging is “going pretty well” despite some “painful moments.”

“If you look at the latest Quinnipiac poll, there's over 50% disapproval of Trump himself, how he's handling the economy, how he's handling the federal workforce, how he's handling Ukraine-Russia, how he's handling trade with Mexico, how he's handling trade with Canada,” she said on “The Five.”

“So basically, he's underwater on everything.”

The White House has seen brutal polling data in recent days as most Americans disapprove of the president's handling of the economy, per a new CNN poll, while a separate Reuters/Ipsos poll found about 57% of Americans believe Trump's economic moves have been “too erratic.”

Tarlov's remarks arrived as part of a panel discussion on messaging from the left as Democrats are hiring influencers, including some who have advised them to keep things real and “be meaner,” according to a new report by independent journalist Tara Palmeri.

Her comments come just a day after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told MSNBC that he owns the “mess” that Americans are in following Trump's victory over him and Kamala Harris in November.

Tarlov, who gave the former vice presidential candidate props for the remarks, added that “a lot” of the reason for Trump's disapproval in the polls is due to Democrats holding town halls, like Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.), who reportedly spoke to the “highest turnout” of his constituents since taking office in 2019.

“And we know about the Republicans havingtown halls and then having to run away or asking questions like, ‘What do you think of DOGE?' and expecting people to say something positive and then they are screaming,'” she continued.

Tarlov went on to blast conservatives who have claimed that there are “fake” constituents at the town hall events.

“If you don't think that cutting tens of thousands of workers, if you have a plan to take away hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicaid isn't going to animate people, 2026 is going to be pretty bleak,” she said.

Springtime on Hilton Head attracts all kinds of visitors, from raucous spring breakers to migratory shorebirds. One particular variety populates not the island's beaches, but its other attractive feature: its tennis courts. 

For years, college tennis teams have flocked to Hilton Head Island each March to play against each other on the island's public and private courts, for a tournament called Spring Tennis Fest.

The island has ten public tennis courts: four at Cordillo Courts and six at Chaplin Community Park. But for the first two weeks of March, those courts have filled with visiting college tennis players rather than island residents.

That led Justin Wilson, a resident of Indigo Run since 2022, to complain on Nextdoor about the tournament's complete use of the facilities, which he says has rendered them inaccessible to the public. Wilson said he frequents the public courts, but was surprised to find them completely full last week.

“Public facilities should first serve the residents that fund them,” Wilson wrote in the post, which attracted 109 commenters.

Some sided with Wilson, calling the situation “outrageous” and “unfair” for the taxpayers that fund the courts. 

Others didn't see the problem. “Been an event for years. Chill,” wrote one Andreas Kmiecik.

The island's annual college tennis tournament was first hosted 40 years ago, originally under the name “Spring Break Tennis.” Over 40 teams came out to the first tournament back in 1986, the Island Packet reported. 

For the past 15 years, the event has been run by the Professional Tennis Registry, a nonprofit organization that trains and certifies professional tennis instructors. As the island has grown, so has the event, which attracted 159 teams last year, according to PTR Vice President of Marketing and Special Events, Julie Jilly.

PTR reserves a combination of public and private courts for the three-week-long tournament. But this is the first year they've had to rely so heavily on the public courts, Jilly said. 

In past years, PTR booked two private facilities run by the Van Der Meer Tennis Academy, which has about 15 hard courts at the two sites. However, Jilly said the company did not let PTR use their facilities this year.

“So more than ever we've relied this year on our public park facilities, which is unusual for us,” she said.

All public parks and recreation facilities on the island are managed by the Hilton Head Island Recreation Association, an independent nonprofit organization. The town grants the association the right to rent out the facilities at their own discretion. 

It's unclear as of yet how much PTR will pay in full for use of the island's public courts. The fee is based on actual use of the courts, which are totaled up and billed at the end of the month. For the Cordillo courts, PTR will pay about $9 per hour, while use of the Chaplin courts is charged $150 per match. 

Frank Soule, the association's Executive Director, contends that the event boosts the local economy, bringing in revenue for hotels and restaurants.

Soule said he was “shocked” by Wilson's comments, and that it was “first complaint we've had in years.” Soule added that the tennis community knows about the event far in advance, and that many private courts are available on the island. 

Next week, island residents itching to swing their rackets might find some openings at the courts. According to Jilly, the third — and last — week of the tournament is less busy than the first two.

The event's schedule, which includes the time and location of each match, is posted online. The last matches will take place on March 24, according to the schedule.

“It's a shame that one person can get so upset about two weeks,” Jilly said.

LGBTQ+ tennis players were brought together from across Britain for a weekend of competition and celebration at the second annual Pride in Tennis Cup in Newport.

The event, run by Pride in Tennis, the LGBTQ+ network for tennis in Britain, and hosted by Tennis Wales, took place across the weekend of 8/9th March and saw more than 50 players from eight clubs come together at Newport Tennis Centre to take part in two competitions.

Ollie Neale of Southsea Topspinners triumphed in the Rally Allies Trophy, beating runner-up Mahender Pal of London's F.A.S.T. to the title.

That competition is a rotational doubles event for more advanced players where individuals, representing their clubs, compete in a series of doubles matches.

While in the Pride in Tennis Cup, local favourites the Cardiff Baseliners claimed victory, consigning defending champions F.A.S.T. to the runner-up spot.

The team event saw eight teams of beginners and improvers compete across two groups of four, with group winners and runners-up progressing to semi finals and lower placed teams entering a consolation draw.

Also taking part were the North London Lobsters from London, Manchester's Northern Aces, the Bristol Breakers, the Geordie Grandslammers from Newcastle, and the Weegie Whackers from Glasgow.

These clubs are part of the Pride in Tennis network, the LGBTQ+ network for tennis in Britain.

Simon Johnson, CEO of Tennis Wales, highlighted the importance of events like the Pride in Tennis Cup, saying: “It was a pleasure to be able to work with Pride in Tennis to host the Pride in Tennis Cup here in Wales.

“Events such as this are vital in helping to show people from LGBTQ+ communities, as well as other underrepresented communities such as those from different ethnic or underserved communities, that tennis is a sport for all.

“We're proud to have worked with Pride in Tennis on this event, and look forward to further collaboration to open up the sport in future.”

The network seeks to promote LGBTQ+ inclusion in tennis and, through its Rally Allies programme, funded by the LTA Tennis Foundation.

It works with the LTA, LEAP Sport Scotland, and tennis venues across the country to provide education to support and celebrate tennis players from LGBTQ+ communities.

Alfred Wong, Vice-Chair of Pride in Tennis said after the event: “Events like the Pride in Tennis Cup create further opportunities for safe and welcoming spaces for LGBTQ+ communities to feel more included and foster a greater sense of belonging.

“With over 50 players from across the country coming to Newport to take part, it's been a great success, and I want to thank Tennis Wales and the staff at Newport Tennis Centre for helping us to put on such a great event.”

Tempe, AZ – Just in the past few weeks, two universities have announced the reinstatement of college tennis on their campuses as Wittenberg University has reinstated men's and women's tennis and Northeastern State University has reinstated men's tennis.

As two universities with a rich history at both the NCAA Division II (Northeastern State) and the NCAA Division III (Wittenberg) levels, the two programs had very different paths to reinstatement but each relied on the support and excitement of their alumni bases to showcase the need for the return of these programs to each campus.

“The decision to continue the tennis program is great for the University, current and future players, and, most importantly, the alumni,” John DeVito, head coach, said in a statement released by the Wittenberg athletics department. “Without their assistance and continuous support, the decision to continue Men's and Women's Tennis at Wittenberg would have never happened.”

“Over the last few years, I've had the privilege of meeting several men's tennis alumni, and I'm sure they're just as excited as we are to see this program return,” Tim McLane, head coach, added in a statement from the Northeastern State athletics department. “We welcome their involvement and support as we move forward.”

These two programs join a host of other colleges and universities who have brought back tennis to their campuses over the past few years. They join the University of Mount Saint Vincent (M&W), West Liberty University (M&W), Louisiana Christian University (W), and Centenary College (M&W) to name a few.

Wittenberg is currently competing this spring semester, while Northeastern State will return to competition in the fall of 2025 when their men's program returns. To read more about the reinstatement of both programs please explore the official releases from Wittenberg University and Northeastern State University.

Michigan State University

No. 68 Wisconsin

3/13/2025 10:04:00 PM  | Men's Tennis

Michigan State looks to build on momentum from upset win over No. 10 Arizona, as they face tough Big Ten opponents on the road.

EAST LANSING, Mich. – Michigan State men's tennis hits the road for more Big Ten Conference road action, as they take on B1G conference opponents Nebraska and Wisconsin. 

Spartans Last Outing
Before heading back on the road, Michigan State men's tennis delivered a thrilling 4-3 victory over No. 10 Arizona on Wednesday at the MSU Indoor Tennis Center. After dropping the doubles point and falling behind 0-1, the Spartans battled back to secure the upset win.

The victory marked MSU's third consecutive home win, snapping a five-match road losing streak and improving its record to 7-5 on the season. Meanwhile, Arizona fell to 14-2, seeing its nine-match winning streak come to an end in just its third road contest of the dual-match season.

The Spartans maintained consistency in their doubles lineup, sticking with the same pairings from the weekend. Junior Ozan Baris and redshirt sophomore Aristotelis Thanos took the No. 1 doubles spot, while the Sheldon brothers—senior Max and freshman Mitchell—competed at No. 2. Sophomore Taym Alazmeh and freshman Vuk Radjenovic completed the lineup at No. 3, solidifying the Spartans' doubles rotation.

The Spartans' first win of the day came from the Sheldon brothers, who battled back from an early 0-2 deficit to defeat Arizona's Cabrera and Christensen, 6-4.

Meanwhile, on the neighboring court, Taym Alazmeh and Vuk Radjenovic took on Gustafsson and Sekachov (UA) but fell short in a hard-fought 2-6 match.

With the doubles point on the line, Ozan Baris and Aristotelis Thanos faced off against Arizona's Friend and Padgham in a tightly contested showdown. The duo fought until the very end but ultimately fell in a tiebreak, 6-7 (0-7), giving the Wildcats the doubles point.

With Arizona securing the early lead, the Spartans were left needing a strong singles performance to pull off the upset.

Senior Max Sheldon quickly evened the score for the Spartans, dominating his match against Arizona's Filip Gustafsson with a commanding 6-2, 6-1 victory.

Arizona responded with a point of its own in a highly anticipated rematch between Ozan Baris and Jay Friend. The two had previously met in the NCAA Individual Championships, where Baris emerged victorious in the semifinals. This time, however, Friend got his revenge, defeating Baris 6-2, 6-2.

Freshman Matthew Forbes added another tally to the Spartans' score, securing a solid 6-3, 6-3 win over Arizona's Alexander Rozin and picking up another victory in his spring season.

The match-clinching moment came courtesy of freshman Vuk Radjenovic. After taking the first set 6-3, Arizona's Christensen responded with a dominant 6-0 second set. In a back-and-forth battle, Radjenovic dug deep and pulled ahead in the final set, sealing the victory for Michigan State.

With the team result decided, the final match between Mitchell Sheldon and Kask played out for the fans. The two put on an exciting display, but Mi. Sheldon ultimately fell in a hard-fought battle, 6-3, 4-6, 6-7 (8-10).

Andre Agassi will forever be known as a legend when it comes to tennis and he left a sizeable stamp on the game during his playing days. 

Before Roger Federer started his rivalry with Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, Agassi and Pete Sampras used to battle it out for supremacy in the world of professional tennis. 

Agassi retired after a shocking realisation in 2006 but the American delivered years of devoted service to the sport and claimed eight Grand Slam singles titles. 

Sampras had immense respect for Agassi and over the years the pair had a brilliant rivalry, featuring some stunning matches at the world's top tournaments. 

As with most top players these days, Agassi knew when the time was right to retire and he's had to watch on as the Big Three blow the records set by him and Sampras out of the water. 

Back in 2014, Agassi was quizzed on who would make a theoretical Mount Rushmore compilation if it came to tennis players. 

In an interview with the Reno Gazette Journal, he was anything but hesitant when it came to picking three of the players he'd include. 

However, in 2014, there was one of the Big Three that wouldn't have been a definite pick when it came to making the grade in the eyes of Agassi. 

He said: “The top four would be, not in any particular order, Nadal, (Rod) Laver, Federer and the four is absolutely an open case. 

“I would leave the face uncarved for a few more years. You could debate (Bjorn) Borg if he had played longer. 

“You could debate a lot of things. I'll leave the fourth on Mount Rushmore pure stone to be carved, maybe even carve if next year if Djokovic does what he's still capable of doing.”

Well, given he made these comments in 2014, we had better take a lot at how many there would be on there if he included Borg or Djokovic. 

Clearly Federer and Nadal were a given. They amassed a number of Grand Slam victories over their career and anyone would be hard pushed not to include those two. 

If Agassi was asked the same question now, surely Djokovic would be carved on the space that he suggested he'd leave back when he gave the interview. 

Djokovic might be coming towards the end of his career but to still be in the top 10 of the ATP World Rankings and getting to the business end of majors at 37 is no mean feat. 

This type of discussion offers everyone an opinion. Surely, however, most people associated with having a passion for tennis would agree on three of the names.

Editor's note: During Saturday's match against Santa Clara at noon, Cal Poly women's tennis will be holding a Nephrotic Syndrome Awareness Day to honor their Team IMPACT member, Brooke, and all those that fight the rare kidney disease.

SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. — If you've attended a Cal Poly women's tennis match over the last two seasons, you may have noticed an important, inspirational member of the team join the Mustangs pre-match huddles. Her name is Brooke Fritz. 

Every home match, the 9-year-old from Atascadero dresses in full uniform to match what the Mustangs are wearing that day and cheers them on from the sidelines. Brooke is the team's biggest cheerleader, supporter and inspiration.

“Brooke has become an integral part of our team,” said Sarah MacCallum, a junior on the Cal Poly women's tennis team. “Seeing her show up to our practice and matches with a big smile on her face to cheer us on has been so special. Besides the joy she brings us, she serves as an excellent reminder of why we started to play tennis and why we continue to play every day. We are so happy to be a part of this special experience with her.”

Brooke joined the Mustangs last season thanks to an organization called Team IMPACT, which matches children battling a serious illness or disease with a local college sports team to help create a life-changing experience for everyone involved. When Brooke was just 3 years old, she was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, a rare kidney disorder.

Brooke's parents, Kristina and Mark, first discovered signs of something wrong during a flight home from Texas in 2018 when they noticed Brooke had swollen eyes and was continuously vomiting. The next day, the family took Brooke to the pediatrician, who immediately suspected that she might have nephrotic syndrome. Lab tests soon confirmed the diagnosis with countless hospital and ICU visits to follow in the coming days and months. During one 22-day hospital stay early on in the process, Brooke suffered congestive heart and kidney failure. But Brooke kept fighting and has battled the disease off and on for the last seven years, going in remission several times. 

Brooke is in a more stable condition now thanks to the incredible care from doctors and physicians, but still suffers relapses and flare ups. Kristina said the opportunity for Brooke to be a member of the Cal Poly women's tennis team for the 2024 and 2025 seasons has meant so much to their family and given her daughter so much more confidence.

“This opportunity has helped Brooke experience being a part of a team where they mutually support each other,” Kristina said. “Brooke gets to cheer the girls on for their matches, and the team gets to cheer her on in her fight.”

From the moment Brooke officially joined the team last year thanks to Team IMPACT, Cal Poly women's tennis head coach Ellie Edles Williams knew the 9-year-old would have an immediate impact on the team's culture and spirit, and it showed in the results. Last season, Cal Poly captured its second Big West Championship in program history and first since 2003 thanks to an incredible run in the conference tournament as the No. 5 seed. Brooke was there all season long to support the team and the Mustangs felt her presence, fighting for every point just like she would.

“From the first time I met her, I just instantly knew she was just going to be a great fit for our team and for our program,” Williams said. “She always comes to our practices with such a big smile on her face, and it's just such a great reminder of why we play sports and what it truly means to be part of a team and a family.”

While serving as a member of the leadership team that works closely with Team IMPACT, redshirt sophomore Amy Leather has had the chance to get to know Brooke extremely well and even given her tennis lessons. From forehands to backhands to serving, Brooke has learned it all, becoming more comfortable and familiar with the sport every time she steps on the court.

Leather said Brooke has been a true inspiration to the entire team and shown them they can overcome any challenge life presents them.

“In those long, hard practices, it's been a great, uplifting feeling to have Brooke there,” Leather said. “I'm so grateful that I've been able to spend so much time with her.”

As Brooke enters the last few months as an official member of the Cal Poly women's tennis team, Kristina said she can't thank Team IMPACT enough for providing her daughter with such a unique experience that has truly changed her life.

“Brooke suffers with anxiety and depression as a result of her chronic illness, “Kristina said, “and Team Impact has been a great way for her to be a part of something bigger than her disease and to build connections with individuals who encourage her to push through the challenges she faces while cheering on an amazing group of young women.”

Brooke's time as a Team IMPACT member on the team may be coming to a close soon, but Brooke and the Fritz family plan to continue attending Cal Poly women's tennis matches in the future as the whole family is now lifelong Mustang fans. 

During Saturday's home match against Santa Clara at noon at the Ronca Tennis Center, the Mustangs are partnering with the Nephrotic Syndrome Foundation to raise awareness for the disease and celebrate Brooke and her fight. Cal Poly will be donning special uniforms as part of their special Nephrotic Syndrome Awareness Day and Mustang fans are encouraged to come out and honor Brooke in her final season with the team.

Jenna Ortega and Taylor Russell are in talks to star in a remake of the classic film Single White Female.

The movie is in the "early stages of development," according to Deadline and Taylor is the one who brought the project to Sony. She will produce the film alongside Jenna. 

The original movie starred Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bridget Fonda.

Fonda played "Allison 'Allie' Jones, a software designer living in New York City, who advertises for a roommate after she discovers her live-in fiance has been cheating on her. She soon finds something very strange is going on with the tenant (Leigh) who decides to move in."

Back in 2022, Lifetime released the movie Single Black Female, inspired by the original movie, plus a sequel in 2024. 

Jenna has an exciting new movie hitting theaters this month and Taylor just landed an exciting new role in another high-profile film.

Yellowjackets has had its fair share of death by cannibalism — but which character exit was the most brutal and gruesome?

The Showtime series, which premiered in 2021, follows a high school girls soccer team that ends up stranded in the Canadian wilderness after a plane crash. The survivors don't return home for 19 months during which time they are driven to eating each other in order to survive. Yellowjackets also features a present day timeline that reintroduces the survivors more than two decades later.

Despite the story line being heavily teased in the first season, Yellowjackets wasn't in a rush to deliver. In fact, the show didn't give the teenagers their first meal until season 2 when Jackie's (Ella Purnell) body was literally cooked for them by the elements in the wilderness.



“For us, it's never been about if [there will be] cannibalism,” creator Ashley Lyle told IndieWire in 2023. “It has always been why and how, and then what happens after that. It sounds like a weird thing to say, but you've got to earn cannibalism.”

Fellow showrunner Jonathan Lisco called the reveal a “muscular, bold move” that was meant to shock and surprise the audience.

“Once flesh has been tasted, it's a slippery slope,” he noted at the time. “When they wake up with the Jackie hangover, the next episode, are they so filled with guilt and shame that they actually would do anything not to do it again?”

Lisco continued: “We're going to make the choices that they make much more ambiguous and much more morally fraught than just the eating of a person to survive.”

Keep scrolling for a breakdown of each death by most gruesome to least:


As the younger group got more hungry, they also got more motivated for their next meal. The second season put cannibalism on the table with Jackie's death but Javi's (Luciano Leroux) was much more emotionally gruesome after he accidentally drowned when trying to save Natalie (Sophie Thatcher).

The aftermath resulted in the group preparing to have him as their next meal. Javi's brother Travis (Kevin Alves) ultimately gave his permission for the others to eat his sibling by biting off a piece of Javi's heart.

Between the plot twist, the decision to play Radiohead's “Climbing Up the Walls,” and Travis' heartbreak, Javi's death was the most emotionally brutal by far.

After the wilderness group discovered that Shauna was dressing up Jackie's corpse, they decided that they would cremate her to help Shauna move on. Shauna initially parted ways with Jackie until a mysterious gust of wind blew a ton of snow on top of Jackie's body — just as it was perfectly cooked by the fire.

The girls — and Travis — realized that the smell was calling to them to feast on their friend. Yellowjackets subsequently introduced a sequence that shifted back and forth between the group's brutal meal and a hallucination of the girls decked out in Renaissance attire enjoying fruit and wine.

All thing considered, Coach Ben Scott (Steven Krueger) had a more tame death after being tortured by the girls. He ultimately didn't want to keep fighting to survive and got Natalie to help him. She was then punished for Ben's death by being forced to prepare him as their next meal, which the audience didn't see.

Fans did, however, watch how the meal created a shocking twist when random people stumbled onto the girls eating Ben while his head was on a spike by the fire.

The series premiere introduced Us to the horror yet to come when a girl with black hair was chased out in the wilderness. She got caught in a trap and from there she became the group's next meal. The lack of context kept the scene from feeling too grotesque but something tells Us there's plenty more death by cannibalism to come.

Lisa Rinna finds it “so fascinating” that people are continuously speculating about her husband Harry Hamlin's sexuality.

“Number one, we're the only Housewife couple to still be married. But you're gay and you have mistresses? … And I'm your beard,” Rinna, 61, quipped during the Friday, March 14, episode of her “Let's Not Talk About the Husband” podcast. “You're f—ing busy. How do you do it all, Harry?”

Hamlin, 73, replied that he's having “the time of my life” currently. “I've got no boundaries,” he added.

“How do you have mistresses in Canada and that are women, but then you're gay and I'm your beard,” Rinna said through laughter. “And we just say, you f—ed the dog to throw everybody off.”



The dog comment was in reference to a recent comment made by Kathy Griffin during a podcast appearance last month. The comedian claimed at the time that she had dinner with Rinna and Hamlin and asked about the infamous Amsterdam fight from Real Housewives of Beverly Hills season 5. Griffin, 64, stated that she asked Hamlin what Kim Richards' “let's talk about the husband” quote was referring to. Hamlin apparently told Griffin that the rumor was that he had “f—ed a dog.”

Rinna and Hamlin responded to Griffin in a statement to Us Weekly at the time.

“Thank you to Kathy for clearing this up,” their rep shared. “It's been really RUFF on the family.”

During Friday's podcast episode, Rinna said that she thinks the rumors are “so funny.”

“I'll never forget. When I was doing the show, when people would get mad at me, you all of a sudden were gay, or you have mistresses in Canada. People have seen you,” Rinna added. “If they liked me, oh, we were such a sweet couple, and they love our relationship, and they love our family. But anytime they got mad at me, you were f—ing gay.”

Hamlin added, “I came out of the closet every time they got mad.”

Rinna then asked her husband for his feelings on the rumors about his sexuality.

“I don't give a s—,” he said. Rinna continued, “I think it's so interesting, though. Like how can you be gay and have mistresses, but they don't call you bi. They don't call you bi. You're not bi. You're gay, and you f— women in Canada all the time.”

Hamlin joked, again, that he “must be very busy” if this is what people are saying about him.

“But not true,” he added. “It sounds kind of exotic, right? But not true.”

Wendy Williams is sharing an update on her health in a very rare interview.

On Friday morning (March 14), the 60-year-old former talk show host called into The View where she provided an update on how she's doing after she was taken from her assisted living facility to a New York hospital for an evaluation during a welfare check earlier this week.

Keep reading to find out more...“It was my choice to get an independent evaluation on my incapacitation, which I don't have it,” Wendy shared. “How dare they say I have incapacitation. I do not.”

Following the hospital stay, Wendy went out to dinner with her niece Alex Finnie for which she had to get permission by her guardian, Sabrina E. Morrissey. 

“It was great at first,” Wendy recalled, before noting that her guardians were waiting for her when she got back to the facility where she has been living.

“I'm not permitted to do anything, but stay on this floor, memory unit,” Wendy said, before questioning, “Why am I here?”

Wendy went on to say that her guardians and the case judge need to "get off my neck," adding, “These two people don't look like me, they don't talk like me, they don't act like me, and venture to say, they will never be me...I need a new guardian.”

After noting that she is currently "alcohol-free," Wendy said that her end goal is get out of her guardianship.

“I don't want Sabrina, period,” Wendy declared. “But I also don't want a guardian. I want to get out of guardian[ship]. It's been over three years. It's time for my money and my life to get back to status quo.”

Wendy's diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia & aphasia was revealed in February 2024, and she has been in an ongoing legal battle with Sabrina, her court-appointed guardian for years.

Sabrina has claimed Wendy is “cognitively impaired, permanently disabled and legally incapacitated," a statement which Wendy has repeatedly denied.

Jonathan Majors is opening up for the first time about childhood trauma.

The 35-year-old actor says that he was sexually abused as a child, by both men and women, starting when he was nine years old.

“I dealt with sexual abuse from both men and women from the time I was 9,” Jonathan told THR. “From people who are supposed to look after you, in the absence of a father. I was f--ked up.”

Jonathan says he recently told his mother about the abuse and opened up about their conversation. He says she apologized for not protecting him.

"I'm like, ‘It's not even an issue, mom. I just want you to know. And now we can all get busy and continue to connect and grow and learn from it, because it's something that was in our family,'" Jonathan said.

Jonathan says that he's been able to understand his behavior in relationships better after processing the abuse. He said, “There are no excuses, but by getting help, you begin to understand things about yourself.” 

Jonathan will be back on the big screen very soon in an acclaimed movie.

Southern Charm star Venita Aspen offered further insight on her relationship — or lack thereof — with Jarret “JT” Thomas.

“I'm on a walk and I call JT and I say, ‘Hey, listen, I want you to come with me to this event as my date.' He goes, ‘You know, I don't think my girlfriend's gonna like that.' I literally throw my phone on my porch and slam my door,” Venita, 31, shared during the Southern Charm after show on Thursday, March 14, noting that she didn't want to look like “a f—ing homewrecker.”

The phone call Ventia was referring to took place during the episode of Southern Charm which premiered on Thursday. The event in question was a summer party hosted by costar Madison LeCroy and Ryan Albert.

“Imagine having a girlfriend and then having your best friend spend $5,000 on you at Dumas,” Venita continued, referencing a scene from earlier in the season when she and JT, 39, went shopping together. “And you get it tailored, same day turnaround. They don't do that for anybody else.”



Costar Leva Bonaparte was confused about Venita spending the money on JT.

“That was my best friend first,” Venita continued, noting that her mother — who had met JT — was “very upset” about what went down.

The most recent season of Southern Charm teased what appeared to be romantic tension between JT and Venita. One episode, which aired last month, showed JT revealing to Venita that he was dating someone else. Several episodes later, the cast headed on a trip to the Bahamas where Venita went to JT's room in the middle of the night.

According to an Instagram Story posted by Venita earlier this month, these two episodes were not shown in chronological order of when the events actually went down.

“Let me make something VERY CLEAR. That dinner JT and I had after I made a Branzino was AFTER the Bahamas yall as an audience saw it BEFORE,” she wrote. “So this weeks episode is now making me look like I'm a home wrecker when I'm not. I know what I signed up for but I also will not allow the world to think I'm that woman when I'm not.”

Thursday's Southern Charm after show also featured fellow cast member Salley Carson weighing in on the Venita and JT situation.

“He pretended to want Venita and he had a girlfriend the whole f—ing time,” she said. “I will f— you up if you f— with one of my girls, and he f—ed with Venita. He's dead to me.”

The Southern Charm season 10 finale airs on Bravo Thursday, March 20, at 8 p.m. ET.

Jennifer Garner and Jennifer Lopez have both married and divorced Ben Affleck. 

According to People, despite being exes of the same actor, the silver screen queens remain friends, even after photos of Affleck and Garner getting "cozy" at a family outing surfaced online earlier this month. 

A source recently told the outlet that the "On The Floor" songstress and 13 Going on 30 actress have stayed in touch as friends through Lopez and Affleck's marriage and divorce and have bonded over their children. 

Garner, who shares children Violet, 19, Seraphina, 16, and Samuel, 13, with the Argo actor, married Affleck in 2005. The pair went their separate ways in 2015, and their divorce was finalized in 2018. Lopez rekindled a romance with Affleck in 2021, 19 years after breaking off their first engagement. The former couple married in 2022 and the Maid In Manhattan actress filed for divorce two years to the date of their wedding ceremony in August 2024. Their divorce was finalized in February 2025. 

Just last week, Affleck and Garner attended a paintball event with their son, and the Justice League star was spotted holding his ex-wife's waist, and she didn't pull away. 

Shortly after, a source revealed that Affleck would "love to" get back together with Garner but knows it's not the right time. Another insider told Page Six that the Family Switch actress has no interest in reigniting a spark with Affleck and that she is enjoying her current relationship with CaliGroup CEO John Miller. Miller and Lopez also commented on the photos, and neither were fans.

Tom Holland has started filming his highly-anticipated new movie!

The 28-year-old Spider-Man actor was seen aboard a large wooden ship alongside director Christopher Nolan as they filmed scenes for The Odyssey on Thursday (March 13) in the sea outside of Methoni, Greece.

While aboard the boat, Tom wore brown cloak over a wine-red tunic while Christopher, 54, was seen standing behind him and wearing a life vest.

The boat appeared to heading towards a castle on the edge of the sea with extras dressed up as Greek warriors.

Late last year, it was announced that the Oppenheimer filmmaker will be making an adaptation of Homer's epic poem.

"The film brings Homer's foundational saga to IMAX film screens for the first time and opens in theaters everywhere on July 17, 2026," Universal Pictures previosuly announced.

The Odyssey chronicles "the ten-year journey of Odysseus, king of Ithaca, back to his home after the fall of Troy," according to GoodReads. Homer wrote it around the 8th or 7th century BC.

When Michael Fassbender auditioned to play James Bond, he ended up promoting a different actor for the role.

In a recent appearance on the Happy Sad Confused podcast, Fassbender said he suggested Daniel Craig might make a good James Bond during his own audition for the film Casino Royale.

“I met with Barbara Broccoli just, you know, through passing, and I actually went in to an audition phase before Daniel [Craig] was cast, but I don't think I was ever in the mix,” Fassbender said. “But I remember going into that room and meeting with her and [Michael G.] Wilson, and I think I was like, ‘Daniel Craig is ...' — I don't know why I was promoting him, I should have been promoting myself.”

Fassbender said the flub is par for the course, admitting he was an hour late to his Mad Max: Fury Road audition. “This is what I was saying, I was terrible at auditions,” Fassbender said.

Even though he ended up not getting the role, Fassbender still gave Craig his flowers.

“Obviously Daniel did a fantastic job and went on to be I think the most successful Bond in history, but that was it really, there was never a conversation after that,” Fassbender said.

AUSTELL, Ga. (AP) — A memorial service was underway Friday near Atlanta for Grammy-nominated R&B singer Angie Stone, who was killed in a car crash south of Montgomery, Alabama.

The cargo van she was riding in flipped over and was then hit by a truck on March 1, music producer and Stone's longtime manager Walter Millsap III has said. Everyone else in the van survived except Stone, who was 63. Online tributes from fans and fellow artists poured in after her death.

Friday's service began at 11 a.m. at Word of Faith Cathedral in Austell, Georgia, just west of Atlanta.

On Saturday, a service is planned at First Nazareth Baptist Church in Columbia, South Carolina.

Mourners filed into the massive Word of Faith Cathedral Friday, taking their seats around a gold casket surrounded by red roses.

“God is good even when life is not, and so we celebrate the life of our sister that has been well lived,” Bishop Dale Bronner, the church's senior pastor, said in opening the service.

Filmmaker and entertainment executive Tyler Perry was among those who were scheduled to speak. Many acclaimed musical artists were scheduled to perform, including Kirk Franklin, Anthony Hamilton, Keke Wyatt, Tamela Mann, and the Walls Group.

The church-grown singer was born in Columbia, where music was always in her life since she was a child, Stone told the AP in 1999 interview. Her mother would sing around the house, and her father sang gospel and blues at establishments around Columbia.

Stone was a member of the all-female hip-hop trio The Sequence and known for the hit song “Wish I Didn't Miss You.” She helped form The Sequence, the first all-female group on the hip-hop trailblazing imprint Sugar Hill Records, becoming one of the first female groups to record a rap song.

The group recorded “Funk You Up,” which has been sampled by numerous artists, including Dr. Dre.

After finding success in the early 1980s, Stone later joined the trio Vertical Hold before launching her solo career.

Stone created hits like “No More Rain (In This Cloud),” which reached No. 1 for 10 weeks on Billboard's Adult R&B airplay chart; “Baby” with legendary soul singer Betty Wright, another No. 1 hit; and “Wish I Didn't Miss You” and “Brotha.”

She found a sweet spot in the early 2000s as neo-soul begin to dominate the R&B landscape with the emergence of singers like Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Maxwell and D'Angelo.

Her 2001 album “Mahagony Soul” reached No. 22 on the Billboard 200, while 2007's “The Art Of Love & War” peaked at No. 11.

A Soul Train Lady of Soul winner, Stone went on to showcase her acting chops with film roles in “The Hot Chick” starring Rob Schneider, “The Fighting Temptations,” which starred Cuba Gooding Jr. and Beyoncé, and “Ride Along” led by Ice Cube and Kevin Hart.

She also hit the Broadway stage as Big Mama Morton in “Chicago,” and she showcased her vulnerability on the reality TV shows “Celebrity Fit Club” and “R&B Divas: Atlanta.”

Justin Bieber is speaking out about how he feels "unworthy."

On Thursday, the Grammy-winning pop star took to his Instagram story and penned a message to his 294 million followers about his internal battle with not feeling worthy of the constant praise he receives.

"People told me my whole life, ‘Wow Justin u deserve that' and I personally have always felt unworthy. Like I was a fraud. Like when people told me I deserve something, it made me feel sneaky," he wrote.

"Like, damn, if they only knew my thoughts. How judgmental I am, how selfish I really am, they wouldn't be saying this."

"If you feel sneaky, welcome to the club. I definitely feel unequipped and unqualified most days."

The message comes after Bieber sparked health concerns among his large fan base.

Fans began weighing in on his well-being after he attended wife Hailey Bieber's Rhode event in Los Angeles last month.

In a video that went viral on TikTok, Bieber was seen with a huge grin on his face and rocking side-to-side while talking to attendees at the event.

"Are you sure that's Justin Bieber?" one user asked.

Another added, "I refuse to believe this is Justin Bieber," with a crying emoji.

"Is he okay?!" a user asked. Another chimed in, "This is so hard to watch. Someone help him."

After the speculation, Bieber's team told TMZ concerns about Bieber's mental and physical health are "exhausting and pitiful and shows that despite the obvious truth, people are committed to keeping negative, salacious, harmful narratives alive."

His team added that he is focused on being a father to his son Jack and producing new music. Hailey and Justin welcomed their first child in August.

Bieber's rep did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Bieber, who previously revealed he had been diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, explained that he had tried to continue the tour, which kicked off in January 2022 and was scheduled to run through 2023.

After postponing a string of concerts, the two-time Grammy Award winner shared a video on Instagram in which he explained he was suffering from partial facial paralysis after being diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

The syndrome "occurs when a shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near one of your ears," according to the Mayo Clinic. The virus can cause facial paralysis and hearing loss.

Bieber shared a hopeful update on his recovery in March 2023. The singer uploaded a video in which he demonstrated improved facial mobility as he winked, rolled his eyes, raised his eyebrows and smiled using both sides of his face.

Jarrett “JT” Thomas hit his breaking point during the recent episode of Southern Charm after seemingly being accused of racism toward longtime friend Venita Aspen.

During the Thursday, March 13, episode of the Bravo series, Venita, 31, revealed she was in “shellshock” after hearing something JT, 39, allegedly said about her to his barber.

Venita heard the accusations from newbie Ryan Albert, who claimed the barber said, “JT told him that there is some Black girl that's been coming on to him and his girlfriend is going to be so pissed off.”

While retelling the rumored interaction between JT and his barber to pal Leva Bonaparte, Venita confessed she wasn't sure what to believe. Leva, 45, was taken aback as well, telling Venita, “[That] doesn't seem like JT.”



Leva decided to go straight to JT to clear the air. During their chat, JT admitted that he had been a little “flirtatious” with Venita amid his new romance with girlfriend Ally but was completely surprised by what came next. (Venita and JT were very lovey-dovey all season before Venita learned of JT's new flame.)

“Ryan, I guess, uses the same barber as you. … He said that that barber told him that you verbatim said, ‘There's some Black girl trying to get me to break up with my girlfriend,'” Leva recalled to JT, noting, “Venita is distraught.”

JT was visibly stunned by the accusation, replying, “That sounds racist. I'm not a racist.”

Leva explained that Venita felt “used” by JT after hearing the rumor, which hurt him deeply. “I'm so sorry that she thinks this, but no. This is yet another time that words are being put in my mouth,” JT responded. “I have nothing but respect for Venita.”

JT alleged, “This is absolutely bulls—. That is not how I roll.” He was frustrated as he said, “I have had enough of my name getting shattered and destroyed. I am tired of this friend group.”

JT then decided to call the barber in front of Leva to get to the bottom of the story. The barber confirmed that JT did not say “some Black girl … is trying to ruin my relationship.”

The barber recalled, “You had said that there is an interest with a cute Black girl on the show, Venita. That was really the gist of it. There wasn't really much context [other than] that.”

The stylist was apologetic for being involved in any way, telling JT, “You know, I may have said it because I was not articulate, you know? If it was off, something that I relayed, like, I'm so sorry.”

“That's a big allegation. That's a really big accusation by Ryan,” JT told Leva before getting up to leave. “What did I do to this guy? That's a motherf—!”

Ten minutes later, JT called Venita outraged that anyone would think he would purposely hurt her and speak in such a manner about any woman. “I'm still, like, shaking. … I'm really upset right now. I know you are too. I'm f—ing pissed right now. This is horrible,” JT said on the phone. “I'm upset with him, and I'm upset that he hurt you. I'm upset that he hurt you by insinuating that.”

JT explained that Leva was “hurt” by the accusations as well because her husband, Lamar Bonaparte, is Black. “Now I'm hurt but had no idea you guys were hurting,” JT told Venita. “I'm going, ‘What the f— is going on right now?'”

He then told her that he called the barber and “cleared it” up. JT revealed that he had to call Venita right after to say, “I f—ing love you.” As he spoke, his emotions continued to bubble up and he went off on the rest of the cast.

“I'm done. So done with these people they're f—ing snakes. It's Craig [Conover], it's Austen [Kroll], it's Ryan, it's Salley [Carson],” JT claimed.

Earlier this season, Craig, 36, accused JT of calling Patricia Altschul a “bitch.” Austen, for his part, had been feuding with JT since season 9 when they got into a physical altercation over castmate Taylor Ann Green. Salley, meanwhile, got into a fight with JT after he alleged she had an affair with ex-boyfriend Gaston Rojas.

JT continued to go off on the group, especially Ryan, saying, “This is sick, man. This motherf— just called me [racist] and his husband is also Black. This has all the looks of a f—ing target job by a psychopath.”

He argued that Ryan, who is married to Eddie Irions, “Made me out to be a racist.” JT concluded by calling Ryan a “motherf—” while still on the phone with Venita.

The Southern Charm season 10 finale airs on Bravo Thursday, March 20, at 8 p.m. ET.
