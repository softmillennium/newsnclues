Oops, something went wrong

The new year started off with considerable fanfare for the cryptocurrency market. Under President Donald Trump's crypto plan, America was going to become "the crypto capital of the world." That meant deregulating the crypto market, promoting innovative uses for blockchain technology within the financial markets, and becoming a Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) superpower.

Those promises mostly have been kept. The White House even hosted a Crypto Summit on March 7. But broader macroeconomic weakness -- in the form of tariffs and recession fears -- have sent crypto markets tumbling. Cryptocurrencies are down across the board, so it's hard to tell what's hot, and what's not. So let's take a closer look at key Trump priorities for crypto.

The three hottest crypto sectors right now are decentralized finance (DeFi), real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and stablecoins. The easiest way to see this is by examining the crypto portfolio of World Liberty Financial, the Trump-affiliated crypto company that uses the tag line, "Shape a New Era of Finance." It went on a highly publicized crypto buying spree ahead of the inauguration as a show of support for Trump's crypto plan.

Currently, some of the biggest holdings of World Liberty Financial include Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH), Chainlink (CRYPTO: LINK), Ondo, Aave, and Ethena. The company also holds two stablecoins: Tether and USDC. All of these holdings, in one way or another, reflect a core idea of Trump's crypto plan: creating new linkages between the world of traditional finance and the world of decentralized finance.

Decentralized finance really just refers to putting the traditional financial system on blockchain rails. Once you have a Layer-1 blockchain like Ethereum, it's possible to build on top of it. You can create new decentralized exchanges for trading digital assets. You can create new ways to borrow and earn money. And you can create enormous value by reducing the inefficiencies of the modern financial system.

Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is one of the hottest trends on Wall Street right now, and it's supported by top asset managers such as BlackRock. Tokenization refers to the transformation of traditional assets (such as stocks and bonds) into digital assets that can be traded on the blockchain. Once you do that, you can create new efficiencies and open up markets to new participants. For example, it's now possible to tokenize very illiquid assets (such as private equity and real estate) and put it all on the blockchain in the form of tradable crypto tokens.

It might be hard to believe that stablecoins are hot right now. After all, they are pegged 1-to-1 to the U.S. dollar, so they are supposed to trade for $1 at all times. You really can't speculate in stablecoins (unless you're betting that they will lose their peg), and many investors might not want to hold an asset like USDC or Tether that trades for $1 day in and day out.

But as Coinbase Global recently pointed out, stablecoins might just end up being the biggest story of the year for crypto. The Trump crypto plan calls for using stablecoins as the way to guarantee that the U.S. dollar remains the top reserve currency in the world.

To buy stablecoins, you need dollars. And right now, dollars are pouring into stablecoins at an unprecedented rate. The top five stablecoins now have a total market cap of more than $200 billion.

Three not-so-hot cryptocurrency sectors include meme coins, artificial intelligence (AI), and anything related to consumer-facing applications of blockchain technology (such as gaming, Web3, and the metaverse).

Remember the last crypto bull market rally? Prices of meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu were skyrocketing in value. Celebrities were spending millions of dollars to buy non-fungible tokens (NFTs) from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection. And people were buying digital real estate in the metaverse as a way of getting rich quick.

Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of view), that type of speculative froth is unlikely to return anytime soon. The new Official Trump meme coin is down about 85% from its highs, nobody is buying expensive NFTs when the threat of recession is looming, and early attempts to combine AI and crypto -- such as by creating the brand-new position of White House AI & crypto czar -- have thus far been very low-key.

Still not convinced that consumer-facing crypto sectors are out of favor? Just search for images of the White House Crypto Summit that took place on March 7. The event looks unlike any crypto event you've ever seen. One iconic image from The New York Times looks like a formal Wall Street board meeting: The participants are dressed in dark business suits and ties, clapping politely, and sitting at a long, drab table under a gold chandelier and the watchful eye of Abraham Lincoln.

At this point, you're probably wondering: Why haven't you mentioned Bitcoin? For one, Bitcoin is not a sector, it's a single asset. And second, the Trump crypto plan is primarily focused on economic competitiveness and financial innovation. The stated goal is to "Make America Great Again."

To the extent that Bitcoin can help to accomplish that goal, it's important. For example, if it can help to strengthen the U.S. dollar, boost investor confidence in the American economy, help to pay down the nation's $36 trillion debt load, or bring new jobs to America, then it's important.

For now, though, it's perhaps more important to understand how the worlds of traditional finance and blockchain finance fit together, and what that means for America's financial future. I'm convinced that this is the key to figuring out which under-the-radar cryptocurrencies are the best investment opportunities right now.

Sellers of risk assets are taking a breather on Friday, with crypto markets posting sizable gains along with U.S. stocks after a week of lame price action.

Bitcoin topped $85,000 at one point during U.S. hours and is now trading at $84,400, up 4.7% over the past 24 hours. All cryptos in the CoinDesk 20 Index were higher during the same period, with Chainlink's LINK, Solana's SOL and SUI leading gains.

The price action happened as risk appetite returned to traditional markets as well. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq indexes were 1.7% and 2.3 up, respectively. Meanwhile, gold, whose price action trounced that of bitcoin during the selling of the past few weeks, backed down below $3,000 after crossing the level yesterday for the first time in its history.



"To see the market bouncing off these recent lows is most likely a combination of the macro news around risk assets (inflation/tariffs) and a sign that a more stable base for cryptocurrencies is coming into place given the drawdowns from the top just months ago,” Paul Howard, senior director of crypto trading firm Wincent, said in a Telegram note.

Some $2.6 billion in leveraged crypto derivatives positions have been liquidated over the past 7 days, predominantly longs, Howard pointed out, leaving the market on a healthier footing with flushing excessive leverage.



Today's bounce also propelled BTC back above its 200-day moving average after dipping below that trendline for the first time since last August's crypto correction. The 200-day moving average is a widely-used benchmark for traders and investors to gauge long-term trends for asset prices, often serving as support for prices to bounce in a bull market, while losing the level providing a risk-off or bear market signal.

Closing the day above the moving average, currently at $83,767, would be a win for bulls, fueling hopes that the worst of the correction might be over for now. Otherwise, confirming the moving average as resistance could foreshadow a deeper pullback.





Well-followed cross-asset trader Bob Loukas noted that bitcoin and stocks have more room to run "at least for a while," bouncing from oversold levels. "Feels like should be close to end of panic, for now at least, and spend at least a few weeks back recovering," he said earlier this week. "Then the market reassess."

Bitcoin price remained constrained within a tight 8% channel between $76,000 and $84,472 this week. With conflicting market catalysts preventing prolonged directional swings, here are key factors that moved BTC prices this week, as well as key indicators to watch in the weeks ahead. 

Bitcoin (BTC) faces considerable volatility this week. With conflicting market signals counteracting short-term, traders were unable to establish any dominant directional trend across the crypto markets this week.

The current price chart shows BTC  trading above the $83,300 mark on Friday. In relative terms: Bitcoin is posting 3% gains for the week, rising from the opening price of around $80,700 on Sunday. 

This represents a significant recovery compared to last week when United States President Donald Trump's confirmation of trade tariffs on Canada and Mexico had triggered an 8% sell-off with over $900 million in liquidations. 

In other notable price movements this week, Bitcoin prices briefly plunged below the $80,000 support for three consecutive days between Tuesday and Thursday. 

Bitcoin price may face weaker support if prices plunge that low in the coming week, as recent retests may have prompted traders to adjust their stop losses or close out long positions to avoid losses from the next retest. 

The Trump trade war narrative intensified this week, with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promising retaliatory measures.

Heading into the week, global markets were on edge due to inflation risks in the initial US Nonarm Payrolls data released last Friday.

However, those fears eased momentarily after the US CPI and PPI data showed easing inflation metrics this week.

Historically, Bitcoin demand surges when markets anticipate less hawkish Fed decisions, but current macro pressures surrounding the trade war are suppressing risk appetite, especially among retail traders. 

Bitcoin ETFs saw $143 million in outflows on Thursday, following $13 million in inflows on Wednesday—the first positive flows since the start of March.

In total, investors withdrew another $830 million this week, bringing total outflows in March to $1.7 billion.

Persistent ETF sell-offs continue to fuel short-term volatility in Bitcoin prices as uncertainty around the US trade war and Trump's crypto strategic reserve proposal unsettles investors. 

Florida governor candidate Byron Donalds is preparing to introduce legislation to codify Donald Trump's executive order establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve, Bloomberg reported on Friday.

The bill aims to prevent future administrations from overturning Trump's policy, which allows the US Treasury to hold 200,000 Bitcoin and prohibits the sale of reserve Bitcoin. Donalds positioned the move as a defense against what he calls the Democrats' “war on crypto.”

The bill faces significant hurdles, requiring 60 votes in the Senate and a majority in the House of Representatives to advance. 

Texas lawmakers have introduced HB 4258, a legislative proposal to allocate $250 million from the state's economic stabilization fund to Bitcoin and other digital assets.

The bill follows SB 778, which recently gained bipartisan support in the Texas Senate. If enacted, HB 4258 would take effect in 2025 and allow municipalities and counties to invest up to $10 million in digital assets.

The overhang of multiple bearish macro pressures means that Bitcoin price remains at major downside risks despite 3% gains this week. 

On the positive side, crypto bettors on prediction market platforms Polymarkets anticipate a Fed rate pause next week, while others are counting on easing geopolitical pressure between Russia and Ukraine.

Polymarket bettors price in 99% chance of a Fed rate cut pause in March, with odds on Russia-Ukraine ceasefire nearing 80%.

If these expectations materialize, improved risk appetite could drive renewed inflows into Bitcoin and crypto assets, supporting further upside momentum next week.

Bitcoin price is trading at $84,833.67 after posting 5% gains the week.

However, with BTC yet to recoup last week's 8% losses, technical indicators show that bulls are not in complete dominance of the markets. 

First, the Parabolic SAR dots remain above the current BTC price, indicating bearish momentum.

Likewise, the Bollinger Bands show tightening volatility, with resistance at $110,676 and support near $76,505.



Bitcoin Price Forecast | BTCUSD Weekly Chart

If delayed Fed rate hike and easing geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia ease up, Bitcoin price must break above the mid-Bollinger Band at $93,591, it could signal a return to bullish momentum. 

Conversely, a bearish breakdown could see Bitcoin testing the lower Bollinger Band at $76,505.

Increased sell volume, as seen in recent weeks, suggests a risk of deeper downside. In this scenario, a close below $75,000 could accelerate selling pressure, leading to a potential retest of $68K or lower.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have remained in a strong downtrend this year, shedding over $1 trillion in value. 

Bitcoin (BTC) has crashed from the year-to-date high of $109,300 to $82,000, while popular altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Cardano (ADA) have had deeper dives. 

Crypto prices have fallen due to rising fear in the financial markets. The crypto fear and greed index has dropped to the extreme fear zone of 19. Similarly, the fear gauge tracked by CNN Money has dropped to 20.

The main catalyst for this sell-off is growing concern that the United States is heading toward a self-inflicted recession due to Donald Trump's tariffs. 

These fears have outweighed positive news in the crypto industry. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission has ended numerous lawsuits affecting companies like Uniswap, Kraken, and Coinbase. 

Further, Donald Trump has signed an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve and digital coins stockpile. Also, more institutional investors like Citadel, Blackrock, Rumble, and Trump Media have started to acquire Bitcoin.

Bitcoin and altcoins could face further declines if the S&P 500 index forms a death cross pattern — a technical formation that occurs when the 50-day and 200-day moving averages cross each other. This pattern often signals the start of a prolonged bear market.

The spread between the 50-day and 200-day weighted moving averages (WMA) of the S&P 500 index has continued to narrow. The 50-day WMA is at $5,900, while the 200-day WMA is at $5,857. A crossover would likely lead to further downside, as the index dropped 23% the last time it formed this pattern in 2022.

The S&P 500 index is often seen as a reliable indicator for the crypto market since both are considered risky assets and tend to move in correlation.

Meanwhile, Bitcoin's price has already formed a death cross, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossing each other. This cross happened after Bitcoin dropped below key support at $89,000 — the neckline of the double-top pattern at $108,500. A double top is one of the most bearish patterns in technical analysis.

Therefore, the most likely scenario is that Bitcoin drops to either $73,722 or $68,960 before bouncing back. The initial target is the highest swing in March last year, while the second is the highest point in November 2021.

A potential catalyst that may prevent further S&P 500 and crypto market crash is the upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate decision next week. A more dovish tone as the US dollar index and the bond market suggests would likely lead to a rebound.

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

Russia has begun using cryptocurrencies in oil transactions with China and India to circumvent Western sanctions, Reuters reported on March 14, citing four sources familiar with the matter.

The cryptocurrency scheme currently represents a small fraction of Russia's $192 billion annual oil trade, according to the International Energy Agency, but its usage is reportedly increasing. 

According to the report, Chinese and Indian buyers of Russian oil pay intermediary trading firms in yuan or rupees. 

The funds are then deposited into offshore accounts, converted into Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Tether stablecoins, and withdrawn to another account before being exchanged for rubles in Russia.

Reuters' sources suggested that Russia will likely continue using digital currencies in energy trade even if Western sanctions are lifted, citing the speed and flexibility of cryptocurrency transactions. 

Meanwhile, China's state-owned oil companies are reportedly reducing purchases of Russian crude due to concerns over U.S. sanctions, Reuters reported, citing industry sources. 

The move comes as the Trump administration on March 13 declined to renew an exemption that previously allowed Russian banks to access U.S. payment systems for energy transactions.

The decision is expected to complicate Russian oil purchases and could contribute to higher global energy prices.</p>

Ethereum is preparing for its Pectra upgrade, which aims to boost the network's scalability and offer better staking flexibility, by launching a testnet on Monday codenamed Hoodi. This comes after two previous testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, encountered technical issues.

If all goes to plan, it could hit mainnet as early as April 25.

The second largest cryptocurrency's price appears unmoved by this news. Over the past 24 hours, the Ethereum price has gained only 0.5% and is currently trading at just over $1,900, according to CoinGecko data. Zooming out, ETH has lost 13.3% in the past week amid macro pressures from President Trump's trade war.

The Pectra uprade will be the third upgrade to the network since The Merge in 2022, which saw Ethereum move from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake. Pectra looks to boost Ethereum's scalability, efficiency, and staking flexibility as it expands storage capacity for layer-2 networks. It'll reduce fees, too.

Previous tests of the upgrade faced challenges, most notably Holesky saw an uptick in invalid blocks. As a result, devs are launching Hoodi on Monday, March 17 in hopes it'll address the issues seen with the last testnet.

Ethereum has become the butt of many jokes across the broader crypto community, with fans of other networks mocking the network for its slow development rate and ETH's poor price action. Over the past year, according to TradingView, Ethereum has lost 52% of its share of market cap dominance. That's left room for coins like XRP to gain 258.98%.

But slow and steady wins the race—or so Ethereum maxis would have other investors believe.

Pectra aims to allow users to pay gas fees with multiple tokens, including stablecoins like USDC. It'll also allow for third-party fee sponsorship, which allows an entity to pay gas fees on behalf of the user—something that has become hugely important on layer-2 scaling networks.

On top of this, Ethereum validators will have a significantly increased capacity for how many tokens they can stake—from 32 ETH to 2,048 ETH. The uptick will be coupled with more flexibility for when and how the staked Ethereum can be withdrawn.

Pectra will also lay the groundwork for social recovery, which allows users to rely on trusted contacts to help them regain access to a wallet that they've forgotten or lost the key to.

With this, many believe that Pectra will be the biggest upgrade to Ethereum since The Merge and one of its largest in its history.

Once Ethereum's core developers “feel confident” in the state of testing, a mainnet update will be scheduled at least 30 days after the Hoodi fork. This means that the earliest the network could see the Pectra upgrade go live is April 25.

March 14, 2025 - Washington, D.C. - On Thursday, Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sent a letter to United States Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urging the Department to cease all attempts to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, citing President Trump's glaring conflicts of interest. 

“I write regarding President Trump's recent executive order on the creation of a strategic reserve for cryptocurrency—an asset class that Mr. Trump initially wrote off as a ‘scam.'  Such a reserve provides no discernible benefit to the American people but would significantly enrich the President and his donors.  It would also constitute unsound fiscal policy by picking winners among currencies via social media and wasting taxpayer dollars on a plan that one federal reserve official described as ‘the dumbest idea' ever.  I urge you to cease all attempts to create the strategic cryptocurrency reserve,” wrote Ranking Member Connolly. 

The letter follows President Trump's announcement on Truth Social of plans to create a cryptocurrency reserve including Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Cardano as part of the Administration's January 23, 2025, Executive Order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” as well as President Trump's March 6, 2025 Executive Order on the “Establishment of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and United States Digital Asset Stockpile.”

In his letter, the Ranking Member notes that at no point during the process of instituting such a cryptocurrency reserve has the President consulted with Congress, nor has the President indicated his intention to seek congressional authorization to create the strategic reserve. 

Ranking Member Connolly highlighted President Trump's conflicts of interest in this endeavor, including: 

“The creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve is poised to enrich the President and his closest allies at the expense of American taxpayers.  I urge you to cease all plans to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, and request that you provide a briefing to the staff of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,”  concluded Ranking Member Connolly. 

The Ranking Member also requested answers to his questions no later than March 27, 2025.

While oil firms embrace digital currencies, Russia's digital ruble initiative faces delays and technical hurdles.

Russia has started using crypto for oil trades with China and India as it seeks to bypass Western sanctions, Reuters reported on March 14, citing sources familiar with the matter.

According to the report, some Russian oil companies have settled trades in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and stablecoins like Tether's USDT. This strategy simplifies the conversion of Chinese Yuan and Indian Rupees into Russian Rubles, enabling smoother transactions despite financial restrictions.

Typically, a Chinese buyer deposits Yuan into an offshore account controlled by an intermediary. The funds are then converted into crypto and transferred through multiple accounts before reaching a final destination in Russia, where they are exchanged for Rubles.

These transactions reportedly reach tens of millions of dollars per month.

Although crypto adoption in Russia's oil trade remains limited, it is part of a broader trend. Over the past year, the country has introduced new regulations governing crypto mining, taxation, and international trade.

Western sanctions imposed over Russia's military actions in Ukraine have accelerated this shift toward digital assets. However, industry sources suggest oil firms may continue using cryptocurrencies even if sanctions are lifted due to their efficiency and transaction speed.

While Russia increases its reliance on crypto for trade, its Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) project is facing significant hurdles.

Last month, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina announced an indefinite delay in the launch of the digital ruble. She attributed the setback to the need for further refinements to ensure that the currency benefits all stakeholders.

However, a recent survey indicates that the digital ruble launch was postponed due to the inadequate IT infrastructure of banks that were expected to handle the project.

The survey of Russian banking experts revealed that 30% of financial institutions are not yet prepared to support the digital ruble. Experts explained that implementing the CBDC requires banks to upgrade their IT systems to handle increased transaction volumes.

Meanwhile, 20% of banking IT specialists stated that their systems are fully equipped for the digital ruble. Another 50% said they are partially prepared but need further upgrades.

At the same time, around 14% of the respondents expressed concerns over potential information security risks associated with the currency.

Given these challenges, Russia's national digital asset initiative could face further obstacles unless major financial institutions fully prepare for its adoption.

Russia is turning to bitcoin and crypto to facilitate oil trades with China and India, circumventing sanctions imposed on Ukraine. 

Amid ongoing sanctions over the war in Ukraine, Russia has turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate some of its oil trade with major buyers China and India.

According to a Reuters report, Russian oil companies and traders increasingly conduct transactions in bitcoin and crypto, allowing them to circumvent restrictions from Western nations. Sources say monthly trade volumes are already in the tens of millions of dollars.

The mechanism involves Chinese or Indian buyers purchasing oil and depositing yuan or rupees into an offshore account owned by a middleman company. The middleman then converts the fiat currency into crypto and transfers it to an account in Russia, where it is exchanged into rubles.

While crypto-based oil payments are still a fraction of Russia's $192 billion total oil trade, the practice is growing as sanctions bite. The trend highlights the utility of bitcoin and crypto in enabling transaction settlement for sanctioned nations. Iran and Venezuela have adopted similar crypto strategies. Bitcoin and crypto's censorship resistance allows value transfer beyond the reach of sanctions.

In late 2024, Russia's finance minister publicly endorsed using crypto in foreign trade. The Kremlin sees bitcoin and crypto as one of several effective strategies to overcome financial penalties imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. The Bank of Russia also recently proposed legalizing crypto investments for wealthy citizens.

However, Russia's oil trade still relies primarily on fiat currencies. President Donald Trump's administration is debating whether to ease some restrictions to improve relations with Moscow.

With the Ukraine conflict still unresolved, Russia's pivot toward leveraging bitcoin and decentralized technologies appears to aim to reduce its reliance on traditional finance and dollar settlements. Other countries under U.S. sanctions are likely to be monitored closely.

Users searching for pirated software are the target of a new malware campaign that delivers a previously undocumented clipper malware called MassJacker, according to findings from CyberArk.

Clipper malware is a type of cryware (as coined by Microsoft) that's designed to monitor a victim's clipboard content and facilitate cryptocurrency theft by substituting copied cryptocurrency wallet addresses with an attacker-controlled one so as to reroute them to the adversary instead of the intended target.

"The infection chain begins at a site called pesktop[.]com," security researcher Ari Novick said in an analysis published earlier this week. "This site, which presents itself as a site to get pirated software, also tries to get people to download all sorts of malware."

The initial executable acts as a conduit to run a PowerShell script that delivers a botnet malware named Amadey, as well as two other .NET binaries, each compiled for 32- and 64-bit architecture.

The binary, codenamed PackerE, is responsible for downloading an encrypted DLL, which, in turn, loads a second DLL file that launches the MassJacker payload by injecting it into a legitimate Windows process called "InstalUtil.exe."

The encrypted DLL incorporates features that enhance its evasion and anti-analysis ability, including Just-In-Time (JIT) hooking, metadata token mapping to conceal function calls, and a custom virtual machine to interpret commands as opposed to running regular .NET code.

MassJacker, for its part, comes with its own anti-debugging checks and a configuration to retrieve all the regular expression patterns for flagging cryptocurrency wallet addresses in the clipboard. It also contacts a remote server to download files containing the list of wallets under the threat actor's control.

"MassJacker creates an event handler to run whenever the victim copies anything," Novick said. "The handler checks the regexes, and if it finds a match, it replaces the copied content with a wallet belonging to the threat actor from the downloaded list."

CyberArk said it identified over 778,531 unique addresses belonging to the attackers, with only 423 of them containing funds totaling approximately $95,300. But the total amount of digital assets held in all these wallets prior to them being transferred out stands at around $336,700.

What's more, cryptocurrency worth about $87,000 (600 SOL) has been found parked in a single wallet, with over 350 transactions funneling money into the wallet from different addresses. 

Exactly who is behind MassJacker is unknown, although a deeper examination of the source code has identified overlaps with another malware known as MassLogger, which has also leveraged JIT hooking in an attempt to resist analysis efforts.
