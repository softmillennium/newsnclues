Freedom House program graduates.

A group of Harrisburg area residents are ready to kickstart their health careers, thanks to a local program.

UPMC Health Plan on Friday celebrated the graduation of its first cohort of students from the Dauphin County Freedom House Foundation training program.

The workforce development initiative, which also has cohorts in Erie and Allegheny counties, provides a free, five-week course to lower-income students interested in the healthcare field.

“They have put in a tremendous amount of hard work and shown immense dedication to learn not only valuable clinical skills, but professional development skills and interpersonal skills that will serve them really well as they embark on this new chapter of their journey,” said Leah Franklin, workforce development manager at UPMC.

In the course, 13 students learned the foundations of healthcare, setting them up for entry-level positions or for further education in the future.

“We are giving our students a very foundational knowledge that gives them a lot of opportunities,” said Trevor Mathey, project manager for Freedom House. “So whether they want to go and immediately become a medical assistant or a patient care technician or community health worker, they have that option. But they also have the option to continue their education and go on and become an EMT or a nurse or pursue many of the other health care professions.”

Not only was the course free, but students were paid while they took the classes and assisted with things like childcare, transportation and finances, which can often serve as barriers to education.

During the program, students attended training at Tech Centro Workforce Development in Harrisburg.

“My mom's a nurse, and I see how many people she helps,” said Tiana Higgins, a Harrisburg native and one of Friday's graduates. “I want to be able to have that impact on people also and change people's lives.”

Higgins said that the courses were hands-on, giving them chances to shadow healthcare professionals, take a CPR training course and learn to take a blood pressure reading, among other things. She plans to now begin working and eventually pursue her LPN and RN certifications.

According to Mathey, there is already a waiting list for the next cohort of the Freedom House program, which will likely begin in a few months.

March 14 (UPI) -- Dr. Mehmet Oz, speaking during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing Friday, said fixing the American healthcare system would be a top priority.

If confirmed, the former TV show host will lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
President Donald Trump last November announced the 64-year-old Ohio native as his pick to head up the agency.
"We have a generational opportunity to fix our healthcare system and help people stay healthy for longer," Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon and author, told the committee Friday.

Oz hosted "The Dr. Oz Show" from 2009 until 2022 before deciding to run for a Pennsylvania Senate seat. He ultimately lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.
The university professor and author has no experience running a large agency.
Critics have accused Oz of wanting to cut Medicare and Medicaid services, and pointed to his close ties with drug and pharmaceutical companies.
Oz has also previously made comments about privatizing Medicare.
On Friday, Oz told committee members at the hearing he would not rule out making cuts.
"Dr. Oz will be calling the shots of what gets cuts, or what stays," committee chair Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said during Friday's hearing.

Wyden also took aim at Oz's previous promotion of unproven health remedies on his show.
"Dr. Oz is another rich guy who doesn't care if your health care costs go up or an insurance company denies you coverage," Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D- Mass., said on X Friday morning.
"He's about to testify in front of the Senate Finance Committee, and I've got questions."
Some of those questions also related to Oz's record on abortion. While campaigning in 2022, Oz said "local political leaders" should play a role in a woman's decision to terminate her pregnancy.

According to the state's Health Policy Commission, healthcare costs are growing faster than inflation, labor and wages.

As healthcare costs continue to skyrocket in Massachusetts, employer groups and taxpayer advocates once again told state officials that the affordability crisis is hurting business competitiveness and sustainability.

The Health Policy Commission held its annual health care cost benchmark hearing to review healthcare cost data with the Legislature's Joint Committee on Health Care Financing. The commission and other healthcare stakeholders assessed the most recent report from the Center for Health Information and Analysis, which confirmed that healthcare spending in the state is far exceeding targets. 

According to the HPC, healthcare costs are growing faster than inflation, labor and wages. 

Business leaders, speaking at the hearing and in written testimony, said it's not just individuals feeling the rising costs. The increasing healthcare spending is impacting all businesses, said Eileen McAnneny, president of the Employer Coalition on Health, a business group which launched last year to represent business interests in health policy.

McAnneny said the cost growth benchmark — a cap on growth to which healthcare organizations are intended to adhere — should be lower than the 3.6% it was in the past year. Statewide, spending growth was more than double that rate in 2023, the most recent year tracked in CHIA's reporting.

“If we want to reduce costs, we have to reduce the benchmark and impose stricter penalties,” McAnneny said. Doing so, she said, would “signal we are finally serious about getting healthcare costs under control.”

McAnneny pointed to Mass General Brigham's recent cost-cutting measures, which involve significant layoffs, as an example of ways providers can reduce unnecessary spending, along with adopting artificial intelligence tools to improve efficiency.

"Something's got to give," she said. 

Jon Hurst, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Retailers Association, said in a written statement that his members —  employers with less than 100 employees — are seeing big hikes in the cost of health insurance for employees. 

“Small business premium increases of two to three times the inflation rate and the benchmark are unacceptable, unaffordable, and extremely damaging to the competitiveness of the commonwealth,” Hurst said. 

Hurst said the benchmark needs “some level of teeth for real enforcement” — a critique of the agency that's been made repeatedly.

According to the HPC, “the healthcare cost growth benchmark is the centerpiece of the state's cost containment efforts.” As it stands, however, there is no specific enforcement action that the HPC can take against entities that exceed it. 

The HPC can put individual organizations on performance improvement plans if their costs increases are deemed excessive. It has so far done this only one time to compel Mass General Brigham, the state's largest healthcare organization, to control its spending. 

Lora Pellegrini, president and CEO of the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, said that despite the fact that the benchmark has been exceeded frequently in recent years, it's still an important tool. Health insurers are struggling, she said, pointing to significant losses at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Point23Health, the parent company of Harvard Pilgrim and Tufts. Pellegrini said that the HPC should take steps to prevent providers from charging what she said are “excessive” prices and  double down on pharmaceutical oversight. 

“Pharmaceutical spending continues to rise unabated with limited accountability to the benchmark,” she said. She urged the commission and the joint committee to take steps to expand that oversight authority and establish a drug affordability board. 

The commission will meet in April to vote on the 2026 benchmark.

On March 13, 11 leading civil rights and health equity organizations held a joint press briefing to release a report analyzing the Medicaid cuts passed recently by the U.S. House of Representatives. In a news release, UnidosUS stated that the House-passed Budget Resolution framework would make the largest Medicaid cuts in American history, placing at risk the health and financial security of more than 70 million children, seniors, people with disabilities, and working families.

“While people of all backgrounds would be in danger, the report finds that communities of color would suffer especially widespread harm: nearly 42 million people, or approximately a third of all people of color in the U.S., rely on Medicaid for healthcare and would be placed in harm's way if the House's cuts become law.” 

The House Budget Resolution would cut at least $880 billion from Medicaid over the next 10 years to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax breaks. The report illustrates how communities of color are especially at risk, with Medicaid covering half of all children of color and more than a fourth of adults of color aged 65 and older.

Shavon Arline-Bradley, president and CEO, National Council of Negro Women (NCNW) said in a statement, “It is deeply concerning that the U.S. would consider cutting Medicaid. There is no humanity behind these budget cuts. Not having a safety net for healthcare for the least of us says that you do not understand the needs of the American people and are clearly out of touch.”

“Slashing Medicaid isn't just a policy choice—it's a direct attack on the health and well-being of millions of Americans, especially people of color who already face systemic barriers to care. These cuts would rip away essential coverage, forcing families to forgo doctor visits, life-saving medications, and critical treatments,” said Rep. Darren Soto (D-FL-9), Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), in a statement. “Gutting Medicaid would only deepen inequality and push the most vulnerable further to the margins. No one should have to choose between putting food on the table and getting the care they need to survive.”

The report concluded that many people's commitment to Medicaid comes from personal experience. “For almost two in five Americans, including 38 percent of people who voted for then-candidate Trump, Medicaid covers them or someone in their immediate family.”</p>

Hoover Healthcare Policy Working Group Convenes Experts to Explore State of America's Health System

The Hoover Institution's Healthcare Policy Working Group convened a two-day conference March 3–4, 2025, examining major challenges facing the healthcare system, from Medicare and Medicaid to private insurance markets and pharmaceutical policies.

Hoover Institution (Stanford, CA) – The Hoover Institution's Healthcare Policy Working Group convened a two-day conference March 3–4, 2025, examining major challenges facing the healthcare system, from Medicare and Medicaid to private insurance markets and pharmaceutical policies. Throughout the discussions, participants highlighted the unsustainable fiscal trajectory of federal healthcare programs, regulatory barriers to competition and innovation, and potential market-based reforms that could enhance consumer choice while addressing cost challenges. While participants generally favored increasing the role of markets and consumer decision making in healthcare, they acknowledged the political and structural obstacles to comprehensive reform, resulting in a focus on identifying incremental changes that could improve system efficiency without disrupting access to care.

Medicare Reform

The Medicare session highlighted the program's central role in federal fiscal challenges, with projections showing its costs rising to almost a quarter of the non-interest federal budget by 2050. Participants discussed structural problems, including the complexity of beneficiary enrollment options, outdated administrative pricing structures, and shortcomings in Medicare Advantage payment systems. Reforms ranged from bold measures, like means testing or premium support models, to more targeted approaches, such as delivery system reforms and value-based purchasing. In Medicare Advantage, reform ideas centered on standardizing benefits across traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage programs to improve comparability, implementing competitive bidding instead of benchmark-based payments, and reforming risk adjustment to address favorable selection and upcoding issues.

Health and Technology

The health technology discussion focused on how artificial intelligence and automation could address healthcare's productivity challenges while improving quality and reducing costs. Panelists highlighted that the United States spends more on healthcare administrative costs than France, Germany, and Italy combined spend on their entire healthcare systems, with a complex system of 318,000 different health plans, 600,000 billing codes, and 57 billion negotiated prices. Technology applications discussed included AI-generated clinical notes, automated prior authorization processes, augmented radiology and pathology readings, and remote monitoring systems for high-risk patients. Participants debated whether technology would ultimately lower healthcare costs or simply redirect spending, with some suggesting AI could reduce administrative costs by 5 to 8 percent in the near term. Barriers to technology adoption included state regulatory variations, product liability concerns, and misaligned incentives that fail to reward efficiency gains. Participants agreed that administrative simplification represents a substantial opportunity across healthcare sectors.

Drug Pricing and Approvals

The pharmaceutical policy session examined tensions between drug innovation, affordability, and access, with participants noting that while drug spending may increase healthcare costs in the short term, it often reduces overall healthcare spending in the long run as generics become available. Critics of the Inflation Reduction Act's drug price negotiation provisions argued it targets high-volume, low-price drugs rather than truly overpriced medications, creates a “pill penalty” by treating small and large molecules differently in terms of exclusivity, and establishes an unofficial cost-effectiveness threshold through the Medicare drug price negotiation program. Participants also discussed international pricing disparities—with the United States funding approximately 70 percent of global pharmaceutical earnings despite that sector representing 23 percent of global GDP—and debated potential reforms to Food and Drug Administration approval processes to reduce the “valley of death” between product approval and insurance coverage, which can delay patient access by up to six years.

Medicaid Reform

The Medicaid session examined structural problems with the federal-state partnership, where states have incentives to expand eligibility and services because the federal government covers most costs. Speakers highlighted how the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, with its 90 percent federal match for the expansion population, exacerbated these incentives and led to enormous improper payments. Reform ideas included phasing down the enhanced federal match rate, moving people above 100 percent of poverty to the marketplace exchanges with premium tax credits, limiting state financing gimmicks like provider taxes, capping state-directed payments, and improving coordination for dual Medicare-Medicaid beneficiaries. Georgia was highlighted as a case study for expanding coverage only to 100 percent of the poverty line while directing those above that threshold to the exchanges, demonstrating how this approach led to increased private market competition and potentially better care access for beneficiaries.

Private Health Insurance

In the private insurance session, participants contrasted the lack of innovation in health insurance with dramatic improvements in other technologies over similar time frames, noting that insurance products remain largely unchanged despite decades of rising costs. Participants advocated for deregulating healthcare markets, expanding individual coverage health reimbursement arrangements (ICHRAs) to give employees more choice, enhancing healthcare savings accounts (HSAs), creating functional cash markets for healthcare services, and addressing price transparency and cross-subsidization issues. Several speakers highlighted Georgia's approach to health insurance exchanges, which uses private-sector entities for enrollment while achieving cost savings and increased carrier competition. The session featured debates about the nature of health insurance and healthcare as services, with some arguing that unique characteristics of healthcare necessitate different approaches than pure market solutions, while others contended that most healthcare could function effectively in a properly structured market environment.

Affordable Care Act and Health Policy Beyond 2025

The final session addressed the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and health policy directions, with panelists suggesting the ACA will likely remain in place with only incremental reforms rather than be repealed. Participants noted that Republicans are focusing primarily on tax reform rather than healthcare reform for 2025, with healthcare provisions potentially included in reconciliation only if they generate savings for tax cuts. Participants discussed a vision of a robust free-market healthcare system with true price discovery and competition, while acknowledging the challenges of transitioning from the current system with its entrenched cross-subsidies and regulatory structures. Others offered a pragmatic view of the 2025 political landscape, suggesting potential policy changes like making HSAs an alternative to cost-sharing reduction subsidies.

General Themes Across Both Days

Several consistent themes emerged across the two-day conference. First, participants generally agreed on the unsustainable fiscal trajectory of federal healthcare programs, but they often differed on the appropriate balance between market-based and regulatory solutions. Second, there was broad recognition that excessive administrative complexity drives significant costs in the system, with potential for technology and standardization to address these inefficiencies. Third, discussions revealed a tension between ideal policy solutions and politically feasible reforms, with acknowledgment that healthcare reform faces substantial obstacles from institutions and interest groups. Fourth, many participants advocated for approaches that provide more consumer choice and control while recognizing the limitations of consumer decision making in healthcare contexts. Finally, there was agreement that any reforms must consider implementation realities at the state level, with successful state models potentially offering pathways for broader system improvements.

Attendees of the Healthcare Policy Working Group's roundtable on pressing healthcare system challenges are seen in Annenberg Conference Room on March 3, 2025.

Oops, something went wrong

We recently published a list of 10 Best Healthcare Stocks For Long-Term Investment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) stands against other best healthcare stocks for long-term investment.

In the US, healthcare expenditures and costs have been increasing. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, US healthcare spending increased 7.5% from 2022 to $4.9 trillion in 2023. In 2023, the healthcare industry made up around 17.6% of the US economy, up 17.4% from 2022. The expansion of Medicare and commercial health insurance are the two main forces behind this growth.

The impact of tariffs on this continuing trend has become a major topic of contention in the healthcare sector, as more and more US corporations are turning to China for deals on the next promising molecule, whether in the obesity or cancer arena. Versant Ventures managing director Carlo Rizzuto spoke on the effects of tariffs on healthcare on CNBC's “Fast Money” on February 7. Tariffs might affect the sector in two ways, according to Rizzuto. Products developed in China and introduced to the US or other markets would be the first. The sector would need to see how the tariffs are set up in the market to comprehend how they would impact such trade operations.

Second, and more concretely, the US healthcare industry uses China as a huge hub for contract production and research. As a result, anything that raises that expense is probably going to make the market more difficult. An increase in costs will not improve the running of the healthcare sector, which is already facing pressure from investors.

Speaking about China's enormous influence in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, Rizzuto stated that the vast majority of healthcare organizations use a Chinese CRO or manufacturing partner in some capacity during the research and development phase. As a result, it plays a crucial role in the way biotech and pharmaceutical companies function in the nation. From the tiniest businesses to the biggest, this pattern is very common.

Simply said, the United States lacks the infrastructure to handle the transfer, thus healthcare corporations cannot reshore all of their externalized R&D and production to the country. Therefore, it is quite hard to understand how such a large-scale reshoring might occur. With the quantity of tariffs applied, the costs to accomplish this achievement can be computed linearly.

According to McKinsey, healthcare EBITDA is projected to rise from a baseline of $676 billion in 2023 to $987 billion in 2028 at a 7% CAGR. Recovery from post-pandemic lows is anticipated to support the improvement in several segments, while growth is anticipated to be faster in other areas (such as specialist pharmacy and HST). Software platforms are essential to the healthcare ecosystem because they make it possible for payers and providers to operate more effectively in a complicated setting.

By automating processes, fostering data connectivity, and producing actionable insights, technological innovation (such as generative AI and machine learning) keeps opening doors for stakeholders across all segments. McKinsey went on to say that increased utilization and pipeline expansion (as in cancer) are projected to drive substantial growth in specialty pharmacy revenue. Specialty pharmacy profit pools are still growing as a result of the rise in the use of specialty medications.

For our methodology, we used a Finviz screener and picked stocks with a market cap of over 2 billion, a 5-year annual return of over 10%, and a low PE ratio under 20. We then ranked these stocks based on their total number of hedge fund holders as of Q4 2024.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) is a leading U.S. healthcare provider, operating hospitals, outpatient centers, and specialty care facilities. It generates revenue through patient services, insurance reimbursements, physician services, outpatient care, and ancillary services like pharmacy operations and medical equipment rentals.

Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) delivered strong financial results for Q4 and the full year 2024, highlighting its operational efficiency and strategic growth. Net operating revenue reached $20.7 billion, supported by same-facility revenue growth despite hospital divestitures. Net income surged to $3.2 billion, significantly up from $611 million in 2023, driven by a $2.916 billion pre-tax gain from hospital sales. Adjusted EBITDA grew 13% year-over-year to $4 billion, with a margin improvement of over 200 basis points to 19.3%.

In its key segments, USPI (Ambulatory Care) saw a 17% rise in adjusted EBITDA to $1.81 billion, with a Q4 margin of 42.1% and strong growth in high-acuity cases. The hospital segment's adjusted EBITDA increased by 9% to $2.185 billion, supported by a 4.7% rise in same-store admissions. Free cash flow for the year was $1.1 billion, excluding divestiture-related taxes. Additionally, the corporation repurchased 5.6 million shares worth $672 million, signaling confidence in its valuation.

Strategically, Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) has reshaped its portfolio by selling 14 hospitals, generating $5 billion in proceeds to strengthen its balance sheet. As one of the best healthcare stocks, it expanded its Ambulatory Surgery Center (ASC) network by adding over 70 new centers, capitalizing on the industry's shift toward outpatient care. Investments in AI-driven technologies further enhance clinical efficiency and patient experiences. With a strong payer mix and pricing power, the business is well-positioned for continued growth.

Overall, THC ranks 3rd on our list of best healthcare stocks for long-term investment. While we acknowledge the potential of healthcare companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than THC but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

LAS VEGAS - As AI is transforming all aspects of healthcare, it's affecting the care model for payers.

Health insurers have end-to-end visibility into individual care needs and utilization patterns across providers and settings.

Virtual care, technology and AI have helped payers define a more active role in care delivery.

Barriers include resistance to change and lack of better payer and provider alignment, panelists said during the first Emerge Innovation Experience at HIMSS25.

Edward Marx, CEO of Marx Advisory and a former global chief information officer at Cleveland Clinic, moderated the panel of experts from Clover Health, SCAN Health Plan and Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey and Humana.  

The session "Voices of Innovation: Transforming Healthcare in a Payer-Driven World," mirrors the title of the book "Voices of Innovation - Payers," co-edited by Marx and Sakshika Dhingra, medical strategy director for Humana.

Clover Health has developed AI powered technology which enables it to harness big data and run algorithms to help with early diagnoses and better outcomes, said Aric Sharp, CEO of Value-Based Care at Clover Health.

"Culturally we encourage everyone to use AI," Sharp said. "The core of our focus is at the point of care."

Point-of-care solutions for most payers now include AI assistants and Chatbox, which can streamline member interactions.

Members want information quickly, said Heather Lavoie, chief information officer and executive vice president of Enterprise Operations for Blue Cross Blue Shield New Jersey. One of the pain points for patients is calling their insurer, she said. 

"People don't want to call us," Lavoie said. What they want is answers, she said. 

A more automated approach is helping with staff turnover, said Khin-Kyemon Aung, senior director of Healthcare Services, medical director and primary care physician for SCAN. 

It's difficult to find people to work in a call center, Lavoie said. AI can be used to do a summary of information for what's covered. This makes it easier for people to work at a higher level. 

"We're asking people to do the same job, but do it more effectively," Lavoie said.

AI is also helping with the bigger aims such as allowing outbound calls to be labeled correctly so case managers can implement stratification and nurses can rout cases appropriately by disease state, according to Lavoie.

It's being used for voice interpretation for patients with Parkinson's disease, she said. 

SCAN has started working with Cresta, Aung said. The AI-powered contact center platform provides real-time automation and guidance to chat agents as they navigate complex care conversations.

"It's listening in the background," she said.

Direct to consumer AI is making it easier for members, though there's real root causes that AI can't Band-aid over, Aung said.

"AI is an accelerator to all of these other technologies," Lavoie said. "We're excited about technology." . 

Plans focused on claims, but there's so much more, including member preference information, she said. 

"We're bringing in sensor data, health risk assessments to create better profiles of members," Lavoie said. 

Right now, AI is being used to make the way healthcare runs more efficiently, according to Sharp.

"We have to think about breaking the way the system works in its entirety," Sharp said, even suggesting that "revenue cycle could go by the wayside if we look at entirely different models."

Sharp said one of the biggest barriers to innovation is culture and people wanting to stay entrenched.

Aung mentioned the challenge of payer and provider alignment.

Sharp said payers and providers are solving problems in different ways. What's needed, he said, is to get on the same page and have one path.

LAS VEGAS – This past week at HIMSS25, a panel of healthcare interoperability leaders convened for an ad hoc discussion about the ongoing evolution of FHIR API-based data exchange: How it can be advanced, how it can be expanded across the payers-provider-pharmacy-patient ecosystem, how certification should evolve and what the role of policymakers, agencies such as CMS and ASTP and technology developers should be over the next decade or so.

The session, "Ditch the Clipboard: Policy Ideas for DOGE and the Trump Administration," shares a name with a recent Leavitt Partners whitepaper that served as the basis of the discussion.

Despite its title, session moderator, Leavitt Partners Principal Ryan Howells, emphasized that the panel talk was not a political discussion.

"The election is over," said Howells. "We are now in a phase, for the next four years, of what the administration's priorities are. This will not be a political discussion in terms of what's right or what's wrong or what's happening with the administration. It's more a discussion about what the priorities of this administration are and how do we align with those priorities to advance interoperability policy.

"It's clear they want to do big, bold things. It's clear that they're actually doing generational change in the federal government," he explained. It's clear that they actually want to eliminate waste. Those things are clear. The question now becomes, how do we understand what those priorities are and how actively provide recommendations that could meaningfully move the ball in terms of interoperability and policy over the next decade plus."

Howells was joined by Michael Westover, vice president of population health at Providence; Anna Taylor, associate VP for population health & value-based care at MultiCare Connected Care; and Jason Teeple, interoperability strategy leader and senior director of enterprise architecture at Cigna Healthcare.

Among the questions they sought to answer: What federal technology policies are needed – or are no longer needed – to create a truly patient-centered health care system? How does CEHRT need to evolve to support a modern, API-based, interoperable ecosystem? And what can we expect on this front from the new administration in the years ahead?

"What do we need to do over the next decade?" Howells asked. "Not the next administration, not the next couple of years. What do we need to do over the next decade to meaningfully advance data interoperability and data exchange? Because that's how long it takes. Remember HITECHtook about 10 years, right? FHIR has taken more than 10 years.

"And so when we think about: What does this look like over the next decade? We need to really expand our thinking in terms of what's needed. You see all those awesome vendors that are on the show floor there. They talk about things like AI, cloud-based computing, all the solutions that they have, which is really cool. But what do we need to do in order to enable that innovation ecosystem to thrive?"

Howells made the case that some current interoperability policies are "antiquated," and, also, that there's simply too many of them.

"We have too much regulation," he argued. And we have a lot because we started to grow off of a certain program and started to add a bunch of things to start to certify individual functionality inside the EHR, to build the EHR.

"Well, now we've built them. We are now going to have to figure out a way to get the data to move between the systems. We don't have a problem in building the functionality of the EHR anymore. We have a problem in exchanging the data between not only the EHR, but the payers, the pharmacies, the patients, everyone else in the ecosystem. How do we actually do that?

Howells also advocated for ironing out some discrepancies with policies between different agencies, and better alignment on timing of rule compliance.

"We're a little out of sync based on policies in terms of the timing," he said, for example, "for when USCDI is being in place and when the CMS rules need to take advantage. And that's just the nature of the federal government. Sometimes we get a little bit out of sync."

We also need to move towards a "more modern computing architecture," he said.

"We believe that we need to redefine CEHRT," said Howells. "We go back to the original definition of the HITECH Act, where it talks about hardware, software or packaged solutions sold as services that are designed for or support the use by healthcare entities or patients for the electronic creation, maintenance, access, or electronic health information.

"It does not say EHRs. This could be EHRs. It could be payers. It could be cloud-based solutions. It could be others as well. So if we think out, if we would redefine CEHRT and start to certify the APIs, which is the outbound call to the other systems – rather than certify the functionality inside the APIs – that becomes a different paradigm."

For once, most representatives from both parties agreed that action is necessary.

“I was encouraged by the engagement from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle,” Empath Health CEO Jonathan Fleece told me in an email after the March 11 hearing, at which he testified. “There was real recognition that home-based care is not only what patients and families want – it's a cost-effective, patient-centered solution that benefits the entire health care system.” 

At the hearing, Fleece offered compelling arguments regarding the paramount importance of home-based care. 

“Home-based care isn't just for those actively dying,” Fleece testified. “It supports people managing chronic illnesses, recovering from surgery and navigating terminal diagnosis. Patients want it. Families need it, and taxpayers benefit. Keeping patients at home prevents costly hospitalizations and reduces strain on the health care system. Today, in a time of financial and workforce challenges, we should be expanding access to care at home, not cutting it.” 

The hearing was not the only action in the nation's capital this week, as the House also passed a continuing resolution that includes extensions of the hospital-at-home and telehealth waivers that at-home care providers have been pushing for. 

While that is welcome news, the ongoing wrangling over the budget also underscores just how unlikely it will be that the bipartisan tenor of the hearing will translate into actual policy changes. And the hearing also surfaced some of the tensions about policies that could benefit some post-acute providers but might not be the best moves for at-home care.

In this week's exclusive HHCN+ Update for members only, I provide an analysis and key takeaways, including: 

In his testimony, Fleece laid out policy priorities and also emphasized the high stakes involved.

He called on lawmakers to pursue three goals: expanding government investment in home-based care, expanding pay-for-performance models to reward high-quality providers and enhancing value-based care models. 

“These are not just policy decisions,” Fleece said. “They represent urgent threats to access, quality and patient choice. The decisions made here will shape the future of home care. Let's protect and expand access before it's too late.” 

As of 2024, 58.9 million Americans age 65 or older were enrolled in Medicare. Nearly 40% of Medicare beneficiaries are discharged to post-acute care, with home health being the most commonly used setting, according to the National Institutes of Health. 

Most seniors want to receive care in this setting — in the comfort of their surroundings with family and friends — often achieving better patient outcomes than facility-based services. However, further reimbursement cuts threaten these positive outcomes, and in some cases, patient lives are at stake. 

My 78-year-old mother had a knee replacement a couple of years ago. She was told she would need physical therapy after her surgery. She resisted because she thought that meant remaining in the hospital. 

While in the hospital, she experienced heightened anxiety and depression due to being away from her home and animals. After she was assured a therapist would come to her house to deliver care, she agreed immediately and was discharged within a day. 

Without home health care, my mother would have declined a much-needed service. She has since had a second knee replacement surgery and lives a healthy, active life.  

With the policy and regulation changes currently on the table, this type of care could become obsolete, and seniors like my mother will walk away from acute-care settings with only a fraction of the care they need being provided. Our aging population deserves better than that. 

Fleece acknowledged that the hearing was a step forward, but work is still left to do. 

“I hope that Congress takes meaningful action to support home-based care – expanding access, reducing barriers and investing in the people who make this care possible,” he said. “I look forward to continuing this conversation in the weeks and months ahead.” 

As Fleece made clear in his comments, the need for more comprehensive support for post-acute care is urgent, but different types of providers do not necessarily agree on the specific actions to be taken. One case in point, which was a topic of the hearing, is a unified post-acute care payment system.

In 2014, the Improving Medicare Post Acute Care Transformation (IMPACT) Act was signed into law. The main goal of this Act was to establish a unified post-acute care prospective payment system (PAC PPS). Congress mandated CMS to deliver operational specifications of a payment system that is ready for implementation.

The Trump administration's 2021 budget proposal included reforms to implement the PAC PPS. If implemented, the reform would have saved $80 billion in the 10-year budget window, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). 

“To further advance efforts toward a unified PAC PPS, CMS submitted the technical prototype to Congress in 2022,” Lisa Grabert, Marquette University research professor, testified during the hearing. “The main finding was the prototype is capable of Congress's intent toward a unified payment approach for post-acute services. Simply put, the unified PAC PPS is ready. I strongly recommend that Congress give CMS the authority to implement the unified PAC PPS.” 

Grabert went on to say that a unified PAC PPS may eliminate the need for several existing policies, including the home-bound requirement for home health services, the three-day inpatient hospital stay requirement for nursing homes, the 60% rule for rehab hospitals and the site-neutral payment criteria for long-term care hospitals. 

“There may also be rules that are appropriate to waive in the interim while the transition to a unified PAC PPS is underway,” she noted. “Congress should only consider regulatory relief in tandem with a unified PAC PPS. These regulatory policies are of high value to the industry-specific providers who receive FFS payments and are likely to add to the deficit. Revenue generated from implementing a non-budget-neutral unified PAC PPS is necessary to offset spending related to regulatory relief.” 

Not all industry insiders believe Grabert's proposal is good for home-based care. 

“The panel of witnesses brought many of the concerns we see in post-acute care,” Kornetti & Krafft Health Care Solutions CFO Sherry Teague told me. “However, the unified payor bill that Ms. Grabert lauded does not consider the uniqueness of home health. All other settings have a consistent brick-and-mortar aspect. We in home health never know what we are walking into. I feel she disregarded Medicare Advantage's impact on everything in post-acute care. This impact is almost always negative and more costly than traditional fee-for-service Medicare.” 

In a small win for home-based care, the House passed a continuing resolution on March 11, including a provision to extend the CMS Hospital-at-Home (HaH) waiver program and telehealth flexibilities through Sept. 30, pending Senate approval. 

The HaH program was initially scheduled to end on March 31. In February, the in-home care advocacy group Moving Health Home and nearly 100 backers sent a letter to Congress urging a five-year extension for the waiver. 

As of November 2024, 378 hospitals across 140 systems in 39 states have received approval to provide HaH services to patients, according to the American Hospital Association (AHA).

And Fleece spoke about the importance of telehealth to home-based care organizations.

“Telemedicine is a critical part of ensuring access to care, whether its recertification of hospice eligibility or ensuring that in crisis we can get access from a communications perspective to all of our patients,” Fleece said. “It is also mission critical to our home-based care organizations that those that are suffering chronic disease or are post-acute to ensure that home-based care is there for the rural communities through telemedicine to reduce hospitalizations, readmissions that home-based care has been proven to demonstrate.”

 Telehealth flexibilities are important to a variety of providers, with the AHA also weighing in on their potential extension.

“The American Hospital Association appreciates the House of Representatives extending these vital health policies that enable hospitals and health systems to serve their patients and communities without disruption,” an AHA spokesperson told me. “We remain committed to advocating for long-term solutions that advance health within Congress this year.”  

Now, it is all in the hands of the Senate. Hopefully, we will see an acceptable resolution soon that will extend the telehealth and HaH programs. But even more than that, here's hoping that the hearing this week is a step toward Congress considering not just money matters but what really matters – quality patient care at home.

Click Holdings (NASDAQ: CLIK) hat eine 25%ige Übernahme eines führenden Wettbewerbers im Bereich der Pflege in Hongkong angekündigt. Das übernommene Unternehmen bringt über 9.000 Pflegekräfte in die bestehende Datenbank von Click, die 11.000 registrierte Fachkräfte umfasst, und schafft so einen kombinierten Talentpool von mehr als 19.000 Gesundheitsarbeitern.

Die strategische Übernahme stärkt die Position von Click im Bereich der Gesundheits-Personalvermittlung, insbesondere im Pflegebereich für Senioren.

CLIK's 25% acquisition of a nursing care competitor represents a significant operational expansion, immediately growing their talent pool by 73% from 11,000 to a combined 19,000+ registered personnel. This strategic approach secures key benefits while limiting financial commitment and integration complexity compared to a full acquisition.

The nursing HR sector in Hong Kong offers attractive recurring revenue characteristics, particularly valuable in the seniors care segment where demand typically remains stable regardless of economic conditions. The expanded talent database creates an immediate competitive advantage in fulfilling healthcare staffing needs.

While financial terms remain undisclosed, the synergy potential is substantial through database integration, operational efficiencies, and enhanced market coverage. This partial ownership structure suggests measured expansion, potentially allowing CLIK to evaluate performance before considering additional investment.

This acquisition accelerates CLIK's stated strategy of developing Smart Home Nursing Solutions while strengthening its position in the growing seniors care market. For a company with a market cap of just $15.6M, this represents a meaningful expansion that could significantly impact future revenue generation capabilities, though the immediate financial effect remains difficult to quantify without transaction details.

This strategic acquisition directly addresses workforce challenges in Hong Kong's healthcare sector by creating an expanded pool of qualified nursing professionals. The combined database of 19,000+ registered personnel significantly enhances CLIK's ability to match specialized nursing skills with specific client requirements - a critical differentiator in healthcare HR services.

The senior nursing care segment requires specialized expertise, and this acquisition immediately provides CLIK with access to professionals with over 10 years of experience serving this demographic. This expertise aligns perfectly with CLIK's vision of developing Smart Home Nursing Solutions for Seniors, potentially accelerating their technology-enabled care delivery models.

The healthcare staffing market benefits from consolidation, as larger talent pools increase placement efficiency and service reliability for institutional clients. By expanding their nursing care offerings, CLIK strengthens its competitive position against both traditional staffing agencies and emerging healthcare HR platforms.

Healthcare providers will benefit from access to this enlarged talent pool, potentially reducing staffing shortages that directly impact patient care quality. For CLIK, the ability to fulfill staffing requests more consistently creates opportunities for deeper institutional relationships and potential service expansion beyond basic staffing into more comprehensive workforce solutions.

With the rising costs of healthcare in developed nations and the availability of high-quality, affordable medical services in developing countries, patients are increasingly crossing borders for treatments ranging from cosmetic surgery to complex cardiac procedures. Iran, a country with a rich cultural heritage and a rapidly advancing healthcare system, has emerged as a key player in the medical tourism industry, particularly in the Middle East.

Role of medical tourism in the global economy

Medical tourism is a multi-billion-dollar industry that contributes significantly to the global economy. According to a report by Grand View Research, the global medical tourism market was valued at $44.8 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.1% from 2020 to 2027. The industry's growth is driven by factors such as the high cost of healthcare in developed countries, long waiting times for certain procedures, and the availability of affordable, high-quality medical care in developing nations.

Countries like Thailand, India, Turkey, and Mexico have long been popular destinations for medical tourists. These countries offer a combination of advanced medical facilities, skilled healthcare professionals, and lower costs compared to Western countries. For instance, a heart bypass surgery that costs $130,000 in the United States can be performed in India for just $10,000, including travel and accommodation expenses.

Medical tourism in the Middle East

The Middle East has also seen a surge in medical tourism, with countries like the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan, and Iran leading the way. The UAE, particularly Dubai and Abu Dhabi, has invested heavily in state-of-the-art medical facilities and has positioned itself as a hub for medical tourism in the region. Jordan, on the other hand, has leveraged its reputation for high-quality healthcare and its proximity to conflict-ridden countries like Iraq and Syria to attract medical tourists.

Iran, however, stands out in the Middle East for its unique combination of affordable healthcare, highly skilled medical professionals, and a rich cultural heritage that attracts tourists. Despite facing economic sanctions and political challenges, Iran has managed to develop a robust healthcare system that rivals those of its neighbors. The country's medical tourism industry has grown significantly in recent years, driven by government support, private sector investment, and the increasing reputation of Iranian hospitals and clinics.

Medical tourism in Iran: a success story post-Islamic Revolution

Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran has made significant strides in various sectors, including healthcare. The government has prioritized the development of the healthcare system, resulting in a network of hospitals, clinics, and medical research centers that offer a wide range of services. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Iran's healthcare system ranks among the top in the Middle East, with a life expectancy of 76 years and a maternal mortality rate of 16 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is lower than the global average.

The success of Iran's healthcare system has laid the foundation for the growth of medical tourism. The country offers a wide range of medical services, including cosmetic surgery, dental care, fertility treatments, and orthopedic procedures, at a fraction of the cost compared to Western countries. For example, a rhinoplasty (nose job) that costs $8,000 in the United States can be performed in Iran for just $2,000. Similarly, dental implants that cost $4,000 in Europe are available in Iran for $1,000.

Iran's medical tourism industry has also benefited from the government's efforts to promote the sector. In 2004, the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education established the "Health Tourism Council" to coordinate efforts between various stakeholders, including hospitals, travel agencies, and government agencies. The council has implemented policies to streamline visa procedures for medical tourists, improve the quality of healthcare services, and promote Iran as a medical tourism destination.

When compared to its neighboring countries, Iran's medical tourism industry stands out for its affordability, quality, and accessibility. Turkey, for instance, is a major competitor in the region, attracting millions of medical tourists each year. However, while Turkey offers high-quality healthcare services, the cost of treatment is generally higher than in Iran. For example, a hair transplant in Turkey costs around $3,000, while the same procedure in Iran costs $1,500.

Similarly, the UAE has positioned itself as a luxury medical tourism destination, offering world-class facilities and services. However, the cost of treatment in the UAE is significantly higher than in Iran, making it less accessible to patients from lower-income countries. Jordan, another key player in the region, has a well-established healthcare system but lacks the scale and diversity of medical services offered by Iran.

Iran's strategic location also gives it an advantage over its neighbors. The country shares borders with several countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, which have limited healthcare infrastructure. As a result, many patients from these countries travel to Iran for medical treatment. Additionally, Iran's visa policies are more lenient compared to some of its neighbors, making it easier for medical tourists to enter the country.

Main destinations of medical tourism in Iran

Several cities in Iran have emerged as hubs for medical tourism, offering a combination of advanced medical facilities, skilled healthcare professionals, and tourist attractions. The following are the main cities active in medical tourism:

- Tehran: As the capital city of Iran, Tehran is home to some of the country's most advanced hospitals and medical centers. The city offers a wide range of medical services, including cancer treatment, cardiac surgery, and fertility treatments. Tehran is also a cultural and historical hub, attracting tourists who combine medical treatment with sightseeing.

- Mashhad: Known as the religious capital of Iran, Mashhad attracts millions of pilgrims each year who visit the Imam Reza Shrine. The city has also developed a reputation for medical tourism, particularly in the fields of fertility treatments and cosmetic surgery. Mashhad's proximity to Central Asian countries makes it a popular destination for medical tourists from the region.

- Shiraz: Shiraz is renowned for its historical sites, including the ancient ruins of Persepolis and the beautiful gardens of Eram. The city is also a center for medical tourism, offering services in dermatology, ophthalmology, and orthopedics. Shiraz's combination of cultural heritage and medical expertise makes it a unique destination for medical tourists.

- Isfahan: Isfahan, known as "Half of the World" for its stunning architecture and historical landmarks, is also a growing hub for medical tourism. The city offers a range of medical services, including dental care, cosmetic surgery, and cardiovascular treatments. Isfahan's reputation for hospitality and its well-preserved historical sites make it an attractive destination for medical tourists.

- Tabriz: Located in northwestern Iran, Tabriz is a major center for medical tourism, particularly for patients from neighboring countries like Azerbaijan and Turkey. The city offers a range of medical services, including orthopedic surgery, neurology, and urology. Tabriz's strategic location and well-developed healthcare infrastructure make it a key player in Iran's medical tourism industry.

Iran's medical tourism industry has grown significantly in recent years, driven by the country's affordable healthcare services, skilled medical professionals, and government support. Despite facing economic sanctions and political challenges, Iran has managed to develop a robust healthcare system that rivals those of its neighbors. The country's strategic location, combined with its rich cultural heritage, makes it an attractive destination for medical tourists from the Middle East, Central Asia, and beyond.

As the global medical tourism industry continues to grow, Iran is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and further establish itself as a leading destination for medical tourism in the region. With continued investment in healthcare infrastructure and efforts to promote the sector, Iran has the potential to become a major player in the global medical tourism market.

A recent executive order from the Trump administration on healthcare price transparency signals this issue remains a priority 

The order requires federal agencies to issue guidance on standardizing pricing information and enforcement policies by May 26, 2025

All healthcare providers should be aware of the implications of the order and begin preparing for compliance by identifying exact prices of healthcare services and a presentable format for the information

On Feb. 25, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to “empower patients with clear, accurate, and actionable healthcare pricing information.” The order signals a return to a priority from President Trump's first term. 

A 2019 executive order from the first Trump administration required hospitals and health plans to publish “meaningful price and quality information” for public use. Hospitals were required to display pricing information for up to 300 services, and health plans were to post their negotiated rates. Both types of healthcare entities were required to make the information consumer-friendly.

The 2025 executive order picks up where the 2019 executive order left off. It directs the federal government to prioritize steps to “promote universal access to clear and accurate healthcare prices.” To realize these goals, it states federal agencies must: 1) require hospitals and health plans to disclose the actual price of items and services, 2) issue updated guidance or proposed actions to ensure pricing information is standardized and easily comparable across healthcare providers, and 3) issue guidance updating enforcement policies to ensure compliance. Federal agencies have until May 26, 2025, to take these actions.

The language of the executive order sheds some light on what healthcare providers can expect. First, while the 2019 order was directed at hospitals and health plans, the 2025 order includes no such limitation. This signals an expansion of price transparency across all provider classes. While hospitals and health plans should be prepared for new agency guidance and enforcement around price transparency, providers of all types should pay attention to this new guidance when it issues.  

Second, healthcare providers should begin analyzing pricing data to identify actual costs and present the information in a useful, consumer-friendly manner. Of note, the order explicitly prohibits healthcare providers from using price estimates. They must disclose the actual prices. 

Finally, healthcare providers should be prepared for increased scrutiny, additional enforcement, and faster compliance timelines. In 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) enforced violations by sending noncompliant hospitals or health plans a warning notice with instructions to correct the deficiencies within 90 days. If the hospital or health plan remained noncompliant, CMS issued a correct active plan (CAP) request with a 45-day deadline. Hospitals and health plans that still did not complete the necessary steps to come into compliance received a civil monetary penalty (CMP). 

Typically, providers took 195-220 days to come into compliance. As of April 2023, CMS issued 730 warning notices and 269 CAPS and imposed CMPs on four hospitals. The CMPs range from $300 to $5,500 per day of noncompliance times the number of beds at the hospital. However, the executive order signals a push for federal agencies, including CMS, to enforce price transparency faster and more rigorously. This may include use of automation to check providers' compliance.

All healthcare providers should be aware of the implications of this executive order and the May 26 deadline, particularly those who may be at increased risk for enforcement. Since there is some question of how healthcare providers will calculate exact prices, providers should consider using this time to sort through billing data, bundled pricing, and drug prices to identify prices. Further, providers should begin considering how the information can be presented in a useful, consumer-friendly manner. Using this time can ensure providers are prepared once federal agencies begin publishing guidance on standardization and enforcement.

The president's deregulatory bent means more responsibility rests on the shoulders of healthcare stakeholders to get artificial intelligence right.

First published on

Healthcare companies struggling to adopt artificial intelligence amid a lack of federal standards are unlikely to get any help from the Trump administration, placing the burden of responsible implementation squarely on the industry's shoulders.

That mandate is becoming increasingly difficult as the technology grows more complex, experts said during the HIMSS healthcare conference in Las Vegas.

“One thing that's clear is that this administration is not going to regulate AI. Good or bad, take that for what it is,” Tanay Tandon, the CEO of provider automation company Commure, said during a panel.

President Donald Trump's hands-off approach to AI governance means hospitals turning to the tools to save money and give overworked clinicians some relief will likely be operating in a regulatory gray area for at least the next four years.

The president says his goal is to free up U.S. developers to innovate. But that comes with downsides for tech developers and healthcare companies desperate for guardrails given AI's proclivity to make mistakes, degrade over time and exacerbate existing bias.

Not to mention, a lack of national standards might actually hamper AI development and adoption, according to some experts.

“When there isn't a federal framework, it can just absolutely cause all kinds of problems,” said Leigh Burchell, the chair of the Electronic Health Records Association. “We all just want to know what our rules are. And then we can comply.”

To date, a handful of federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services' technology office, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration, have published targeted rules around the use and quality of AI in healthcare. But neither Congress nor the executive branch have zeroed in on a comprehensive framework to regulate the models — despite some progress during the Biden administration, when an HHS task force was working to build a unified regulatory structure.

That task force unveiled a strategic plan in January — just 10 days before Trump's inauguration. However, Trump nixed the blueprint in one of his first executive orders.

Meanwhile, federal employees working on AI oversight, including at the FDA, have been caught up in the Trump administration's purge of the government's workforce. Amid the turmoil, the future of the HHS office that oversees AI policy remains unclear.

As a result, what little momentum there was in Washington to create a concrete strategy for overseeing health AI appears to have stalled out, at least for now. In its place, Trump has announced the Stargate Project, a $500 billion investment deal with private companies to prioritize AI development and maintain U.S. supremacy in the space — a high-stakes bet that was immediately complicated by the release of DeepSeek, a high-performing and inexpensive open source model from China.

"The current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down."

Brian Spisak

Program director of AI and leadership, Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative

The Trump administration did issue a request for information in early February to get public input on a potential national AI action plan. However, the plan's wording makes clear the administration's priorities: to “sustain and enhance America's AI dominance, and to ensure that unnecessarily burdensome requirements do not hamper private sector AI innovation.”

The revocation of the Biden-era AI plan was largely symbolic, as agencies hadn't yet gotten around to imposing any requirements on developers or users.

But in “the current administration — the brakes have come off and the accelerator has come down,” said Brian Spisak, program director of AI and leadership at Harvard University's National Preparedness Leadership Initiative, at HIMSS. “There's a lot of responsibility to leadership of health systems to find the optimal balance between innovation and speed and safety and tradition.”

That responsibility — which also rests on AI developers creating the models, software vendors weaving them into health records and the clinicians using them — is not negligible.

Currently, even the most futuristic AI at healthcare institutions is being used to automate administration, and only peripherally touches patient care. But that appears to be changing: There's growing interest among medical organizations in more clinical use cases for AI, like tailoring treatment plans or helping clinicians arrive at a diagnosis, according to a survey from HIMSS conducted in the fall.

Many of those use cases involve generative AI, which can create original text and images. But such models are known to hallucinate, or provide answers that are factually incorrect or irrelevant. AI can leave important information out, an error known as omission. Models can also drift, a term for when an AI's performance changes or degrades over time.

Given the increasing prevalence of AI in pulling data from EHR systems, transcribing doctor-patient visits and more, errors like these could interfere with clinicians' ability to care for patients, experts say.

Meanwhile, the technology is advancing at a stunning rate. Last year, the healthcare industry was just beginning to come to terms with governance for generative AI. But now, the conversation has already moved onto AI agents, which can complete complex tasks largely unsupervised by humans.

Commure's Tanay equated the current moment to when America moved from kerosene to electricity at the end of the 19th century.

“The way that we did things six months ago is completely irrelevant,” he said.

Because of the breakneck speed of development, federal standards from any administration would likely need to be flexible, experts say. 

The Biden administration's HHS task force suggested the government could create guidelines around testing and piloting tools, along with some support for adoption. However, it shied away from a prescriptive approach.

That's in line with the wish list from many stakeholders. Numerous executives at tech companies and hospital systems said any federal standards should be stratified by the level of risk an AI model imposes — for example, stricter oversight for algorithms that help doctors diagnose diseases, and looser restrictions for algorithms that help hospital staff allocate patients to beds.

“We have to weigh the balance between underregulation, which can potentially increase risk, and overregulation, which will stunt innovation,” said Anthony Chang, the chief intelligence and innovation officer at the Children's Hospital of Orange County in California, during a panel.

“The current administration is more likely to be on the underregulation side. So we have to be careful as a profession that we don't allow that to happen,” Chang said.

The lack of a playbook from Washington has left hospitals and medical groups scrambling to build their own internal controls amid a patchwork of state laws and voluntary standards released by industry groups.

States including Colorado, Utah and California have already enacted legislation establishing disclaimer requirements for AI systems. More states are considering similar laws: The Electronic Health Records Association is tracking 150 different state bills related to health AI, according to Burchell.

“There is a massive explosion of bills,” Burchell said.

But differing standards could stop health AI developers and software companies from rolling out products in specific states, potentially disadvantaging patients depending on where they live. More risk-averse software companies may avoid AI, or certain states, altogether, she added.

“Legislation of a lot of sizes and shapes at the state level is a risk to us, because it means we have to do all kinds of different development. We would rather develop one system that can be used broadly and accepted across the country,” Burchell said.

Health AI standards groups are also stepping into the gap left by the federal government. The groups — often made up of leading hospitals, digital health companies and tech giants — include the Health AI Partnership, an AI learning network for the industry, and the Coalition for Health AI, which recently launched an AI registry for hospitals.

”I think we'll probably see more of these non-government organizations like Health AI Partnership and some of those emerge as maybe our north stars today, as here's some leadership in the space,” said Rachel Wilkes, the corporate lead for generative AI initiatives at EHR vendor Meditech.

But standards from industry consortia hold little weight without the heft of the federal government behind them, experts say. Historically, voluntary standards aren't particularly effective.

“There's room for people to act in their own best interest, whatever that may be, without any sort of federal framework,” Wilkes said.

EHR vendors and hospital operators say they're building up rigorous internal standards for AI tools, including validation and frequent auditing.

“Government oversight has its place, but I do think the way that clinical practice evolves tends to be more driven by what's happening at a health system,” said Seth Howard, the executive vice president of research and development for Epic, the largest EHR company in the U.S.

In interviews, executives with Epic, Oracle, Meditech and eClinicalWorks said they're making AI available to doctors with rigorous oversight, including back-end accuracy checks and ongoing monitoring.

However, tech leaders stressed that it's also the hospital and the clinicians' responsibility to make sure everything is working as planned.

“We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen,” said Girish Navani, the CEO of eClinicalWorks.

Technology behemoths betting heavily on AI feel similarly. Google, for example, has worked with for-profit hospital giant HCA on an evaluation framework to catch any errors generated by its AI models and ensure their reliability, according to Aashima Gupta, the head of healthcare for Google Cloud.

“We provide those tools for an evaluation framework, and for all of this there's a human in the loop capturing the feedback, and that feedback loop then makes the model more effective,” Gupta said. “That's what gives me comfort.”

"We are working in an industry that deals with human life. It cannot be trivial. It cannot be under-exaggerated on what guardrails and checks and balances and what discussions need to happen."

Though some in the private sector say they've got governance handled, modern AI is incredibly hard to oversee, according to AI engineers. The main advantage of generative AI — its creativity — also introduces subjectivity, making grading its outputs complicated.

For example, if two clinicians are tasked to summarize a patient's medical history based on clinical notes, their results could be incredibly different, albeit still accurate. It's the same with generative AI, experts say: How do you measure quality in a standardized way when there's that degree of variability?

“AI governance is still very much a maturing process,” said Harvard's Spisak.

Hospital executives say they're tackling oversight carefully. But some research suggests governance systems for simpler predictive AI models already aren't rigorous enough. Hospitals with explicit procedures for the use and assessment of AI tools are still struggling to identify and mitigate problems, according to a study published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Even some of the most well-resourced and tech-savvy systems are struggling.

The Cleveland Clinic has an AI governing body that includes stakeholders from across the academic medical center, according to Rohit Chandra, the Cleveland Clinic's chief digital officer. The task force oversees AI's impact on the organization's patients and workers while ensuring clinical safety and discussing thorny questions of privacy, legality and bias.

But “I don't think we've figured it all out,” Chandra said during a panel. “The term hallucination, for one, has just shown up in the last two, three years. And we still don't quite know how to deal with it.”

Hospitals should try to make specific people accountable for the performance of the tools, as part of a larger governing body that includes executives, lawyers, doctors and nurses, according to Brenton Hill, the head of operations at standards group CHAI.

Hospitals need to decide how to monitor AI effectively and report that information, which can depend on the products they have in place. They also need to consider what resources the AI will use and develop appropriate data use agreements with AI vendors, Hill said during a panel.

But “there's not one silver bullet governance structure that you can put out there that will solve all your problems,” Hill said.

Though a road map from federal regulators would be helpful, stakeholders working to integrate AI tools into healthcare said they're not holding their breath.

“While self-regulation is good, we don't believe that's sufficient. We believe AI is too important not to be regulated,” said Google's Gupta.

But when asked what she expects from the Trump administration, Gupta was noncommittal. “It's hard to say at this point. We are trying to figure out how we best work with them, share our best practices with them ... Too early to say. I think the entire healthcare community is waiting for that,” Gupta said.

Other experts said the Trump administration is a wake-up call for hospital executives who believed Washington could assume responsibility for overseeing AI.

Instead, the mandate should be on everyone touching the technology to ensure AI algorithms — given their shifting nature and innate opacity — perform as they're designed, especially in an industry where any mistakes could impact patient health.

“The easy answer is, if this regulatory body says it's safe, then I can trust it. I think people were hoping that might happen for AI,” said Aaron Neinstein, the chief medical officer of agentic AI company Notable. “I think that was a pipe dream.”

In summary

California is spending more than it expected on Medi-Cal and Republican lawmakers are pointing to coverage expansions that benefited immigrant households.

Welcome to CalMatters, the only nonprofit newsroom devoted solely to covering issues that affect all Californians. Sign up for WhatMatters to receive the latest news and commentary on the most important issues in the Golden State.

The California health care program that covers almost 15 million people is costing more money than Gov. Gavin Newsom projected, creating a new budget problem in a lean year. 

Now his administration is borrowing $3.4 billion from the state's general fund to cover the unexpected cost increase. It's unclear when the administration plans to restore the money.

The administration acknowledged that more people are enrolled in the program than the state anticipated, and that the state is spending $2.7 billion more than it planned on coverage expansions for immigrants without legal status.  

Roughly 1.6 million immigrants without legal status are enrolled in Medi-Cal, according to state data. The program is a lifeline to people who traditionally have not had access to health insurance, and California is one of six states that offer coverage to immigrant adults regardless of whether they are in the country legally. 

Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones said Newsom has overpromised and under-delivered on health care at a time when all Californians are struggling to afford the cost of living in the state.

“Democrats and the governor are picking priorities, and they're prioritizing people that have come into our country illegally over people who immigrated here legally, people that are citizens,” Jones said.

The state's Medi-Cal expansion for undocumented immigrants costs about $8.5 billion from the state general fund annually, according to a recent budget hearing. 

“If we weren't spending eight-and-a-half billion dollars on illegal immigrants, we wouldn't need to borrow $3.4 billion to cover the difference,” Jones said.

Δ

H.D. Palmer, a spokesperson for the state's finance department, acknowledged that the rise in spending is partially attributable to higher-than-projected costs associated with larger enrollment numbers for California's undocumented population. In January, the Department of Health Care Services, which oversees Medi-Cal, estimated California is spending $2.7 billion beyond what it budgeted due to the cost of covering care and prescriptions for newly enrolled immigrants.

But immigrants aren't the only population that is using Medi-Cal more than the state expected.

California's Medi-Cal population in general ballooned during the COVID-19 pandemic when the federal government temporarily suspended income eligibility checks to keep people insured during the national emergency. Before the pandemic about 13 million people used Medi-Cal. That number peaked at 15.6 million in 2023 when eligibility checks resumed. Today 14.9 million people are enrolled, according to state data.

The Legislative Analyst's Office has also noted a 40% growth over the last four years in the number of seniors enrolled in Medi-Cal. While seniors make up only about 10% of the program's enrollees, they account for a large part of the program's spending because benefits such as long-term care are among the most expensive. 

Medi-Cal spends about $15,000 a year per senior. That compares to the $8,000 a year the program spends on average on other enrollees. 

Newsom's office said these issues are neither new nor unique to California. Medi-Cal is California's version of Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health coverage nationwide to low-income households.

“Rising Medicaid costs are a national challenge, affecting both red and blue states alike,” Elana Ross, a spokesperson for the governor's office, said in an email.

Sen. Roger Niello, a long-time critic of the state's closed-door budgeting process, which is typically hashed out between Democratic leaders and the governor, acknowledged that other factors like senior enrollment and high drug costs could be contributing to the high expenses. He said Republicans are worried about increasing spending on immigrant health care.

The Republican from Roseville criticized the lack of transparency from Newsom's finance department.

“The completely opaque nature of the request, which says nothing about any of that, is entirely inappropriate,” Niello said.

Democratic lawmakers said they need more information about what exactly is behind the unexpected spending increases, but pushed back on the idea that the state would need to roll back coverage for its undocumented population.  

“Immigrant workers and families, who pay billions in taxes, deserve access to care, and I am proud to protect California's progress expanding Medi-Cal,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said in a statement. “There are tough choices ahead, and Assembly Democrats will closely examine any proposal from the governor. But let's be clear: We will not roll over and leave our immigrants behind.”

Immigrants lacking permanent status contribute approximately $8.5 billion in state and local taxes a year, according to an analysis by the California Budget and Policy Center, a nonprofit research group. That's about the same amount it's costing the state to give them Medi-Cal.

State lawmakers first allowed undocumented children to enroll in Medi-Cal in 2016 under Gov. Jerry Brown. Since then Newsom has approved adding young adults up to age 25 in 2020 and older adults and seniors in 2022. Adults ages 26-49 were the final group added in 2024. Throughout those years, even some Republican lawmakers supported covering this population. 

“The Republicans need to take a better and keen-eyed look at the timeline associated with those expansions,” said Assemblymember Mia Bonta, an Oakland Democrat who leads the Health Committee. “For them to just try to play the blame game and put it all at the feet of California values to ensure that we have universal health coverage for all with this particular age group being included is just specious.”

Assemblymember Dawn Addis, who chairs a budget subcommittee on health, said she will be questioning Newsom officials closely about the spending increase in an upcoming hearing. 

“We really need to understand the details of what the Department of Finance is saying, what the executive is seeing, and how they're calculating this information,” Addis, a Democrat from San Luis Obispo, said.

Addis emphasized that the biggest threat to Medi-Cal right now is coming from the federal government.

House Republicans recently voted to advance a proposal that could result in cuts of $880 billion to a group of programs, largely Medicaid, over the next 10 years. The California Budget and Policy Center has estimated that the proposals currently at play in Congress could translate into annual losses of $10 billion to $20 billion a year for the state.

“The reason why it's so important for us to fight back against cuts at the federal level to Medicaid is because there is no easy or painless solution to fill that budget hole,” said Amanda McAllister-Wallner, interim executive director of Health Access California. 

Health Access California along with the California Immigrant Policy Center spearheaded the campaign nearly a decade ago to insure all immigrants in the state. 

McAllister-Wallner said it was unfair and unreasonable to pin the state budget shortfall on the immigrant expansions. Over the same time period, the state has added benefits, such as doula services and family therapy, and invested heavily in reforming the system through a multibillion-dollar initiative called CalAIM.

“Those changes that we've made in Medi-Cal made the program stronger (and) have made the state healthier,” McAllister-Wallner said.

Students, educators, counselors, and professionals across eastern Kentucky are invited to Shaping Our Appalachian Region, or SOAR's, Healthcare Career Pathway Fair. Officials said the university is a prime spot for the event because of its bolstered healthcare and education systems, though attendees will get to meet and network with professionals and organizations across the region.

Kirsten Wilburn is the Operations Manager with SOAR. She said one goal of the fair is to foster and encourage prospective healthcare workers to dedicate their service to eastern Kentucky, a region that's been hit hard by a lack of practitioners.

“We have an aging population of people who stay here, but our out migration is showing a younger population leaving,” said Wilburn. “So, our big thing is we need our youth to stay here to not only work and be part of this economic ecosystem in eastern Kentucky, but also to care for the generations that built this place for them.”

Wilburn added non-traditional students, including people who do not pursue a four-year degree immediately after high school, are a key population the fair hopes to reach. Sometimes, these students don't always see a clear path forward, and Wilburn said SOAR hopes to show these students that they can pursue healthcare in a multitude of ways.

“That doesn't always include four-year degrees. That includes two-year degrees, or training certifications. So, this whole event is really aimed to solidify that issue. We educate the students about it, but on the other side of that we educate the teachers and counselors who attend the event with the students,” said Wilburn.

The SOAR Healthcare Career Pathway Fair will be held on March 18, 9 a.m. 2 p.m. on MSU's campus. Attendees will participate in multiple hands-on educational workshops and networking sessions. Registration for students and school groups is available online.

When patients walked into Planned Parenthood clinics, a consumer data company sold their precise locations to anti-abortion groups for targeted ads.

When patients picked up prescriptions for testosterone replacement therapy, law enforcement retrieved their names and addresses without a warrant.

And when a father was arrested by immigration authorities, agents allegedly accessed his personal information from a medical clinic where he received diabetes treatment.

Progressive California lawmakers have proposed a number of bills aimed at bolstering privacy protections for women, transgender people, and immigrants in response to such intrusions by anti-abortion groups, conservative states, and federal law enforcement agencies as President Donald Trump declares the nation "will be woke no longer" and flexes his executive power to roll back rights.

Democrats have supermajorities in the state legislature, but even if they pass the proposals, they may first need to lobby one of their own: Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has noticeably tempered his once harsh criticism of Trump.

Last month, the Democratic governor issued a rare veto threat against a bill that would expand the state's sanctuary law to limit cooperation between state prisons and federal immigration agents. And Newsom recently called transgender athletes' participation in women's sports "deeply unfair" on his new podcast with guest Charlie Kirk, a founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA. Newsom went on to tell Kirk that he had a "hard time with" the way the right talks about transgender people.

Billions of dollars are also on the line for California. Newsom visited the White House last month seeking unconditional aid for wildfire victims in Los Angeles, and the state relies on Washington for over 60% of its Medicaid budget, which is vulnerable to significant cuts under the GOP's budget blueprint.

"California's leaders have not been as aggressive, out of recognition that there are many things that the state needs federal cooperation on," said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California-San Diego.

A Newsom spokesperson declined to comment on pending legislation. He has a track record of supporting abortion, transgender, and immigrant rights.

Since taking office, Trump has granted the Elon Musk-controlled Department of Government Efficiency — created through a Trump executive order — access to previously restricted data, including medical information, raising concerns that sensitive information could be exposed without proper safeguards. 

The White House did not respond to requests for comment.

While most Americans are familiar with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, known as HIPAA, it offers only narrow protection for patients in health care settings. There's no comprehensive federal law protecting data privacy.

Health care information has increasingly become a tool of surveillance and enforcement, and in states that have banned certain medical treatments or toughened immigration laws, vulnerable populations are at greater risk, said Suzanne Bernstein, a health privacy rights expert with the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

Progressive Democrats are concerned that personal information and people's medical decisions could be used to monitor or criminalize patients, facilitate arrests in or near health care facilities, or jeopardize access to health care services.

They and health privacy advocates say now is the time to shore up protections for the nearly 2 million immigrants living in California without authorization, the more than 200,000 transgender adults in the state, and thousands of people — living in the state or out of state — in need of abortion care in California each year. Some of these laws could take effect immediately if signed.

"This is about making sure that people are able to access critical health care in California and to take the politics out of our hospitals and health clinics," said state Sen. Jesse Arreguín, who hopes the governor would sign his bill to protect immigrants.

The bills are expected to be debated in Sacramento in the coming months.

Since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion, anti-abortion groups have purchased location information from consumer data companies to target people seeking abortion care with anti-abortion ads. And authorities in states with abortion bans have used cellphone data to enforce laws beyond their borders.

A bill introduced by state Assembly member Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, AB 45, would make geofencing, the collection of phone location by data brokers, illegal around health care facilities that provide in-person services. It would also prevent reproductive health information collected during research from being disclosed in response to out-of-state requests.

Conservative organizations said the proposal would single them out by restricting their ability to inform women about alternatives to abortion, including services offered by crisis pregnancy centers.

"I think that could very well be a First Amendment violation," said Jonathan Keller, president of the California Family Council, a statewide anti-abortion nonprofit. "It doesn't seem like the bill would be prohibiting or putting any restrictions on a group like Planned Parenthood if they wanted to market or target to a local high school or college."

So far this year, lawmakers in 49 states have introduced more than 700 anti-transgender bills, seeking to ban gender-affirming care, prohibit gender identity education in schools, or restrict transgender students from participating in sports, according to the Trans Legislation Tracker, a national research organization tracking bills affecting transgender people. Transgender adults represent less than 1% of the U.S. population.

And some states with bans or restrictions on gender-affirming care have been targeting health care data. In 2023, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis requested that Florida universities release data on the number of individuals who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria or received treatment at campus clinics. That same year, Missouri's Republican attorney general, Andrew Bailey, submitted 54 requests to one hospital seeking information about gender-affirming care procedures.

Trump has issued a series of executive orders to ban access to gender-affirming care for minors. Federal judges have temporarily blocked some portions of his orders.

To guard against other states that criminalize or ban gender-affirming care, California state Sen. Scott Wiener wants to expand current protections for minors to include adults.

His bill, SB 497, would require law enforcement to obtain a warrant to access state databases on gender-affirming care and make it a misdemeanor to release the data to unauthorized parties. It would also prohibit health care providers, employers, and insurers from releasing information about a person who seeks or obtains gender-affirming physical and mental health care to an agency or individual from another state.

"We want to make sure that we are as comprehensively as possible shielding trans people from hate emanating from the federal government, other states, and private parties," Wiener said.

Keller countered that authorities in states with bans on abortion or gender-affirming care should have access to medical information as they investigate providers who could harm patients or coerce them into procedures against their will. He cited a lawsuit against Kaiser Permanente over a teenager who detransitioned after undergoing gender-affirming care. A 2015 survey found it was uncommon for people undergoing gender-affirming care to decide to permanently detransition.

"The only way that you're able to uncover that level of widespread malpractice and malfeasance is if these health care records are able to be accessed," Keller said.

The California Family Council plans to oppose both bills.

Earlier this year, Trump rescinded a long-standing policy of not making immigration arrests near hospitals, schools, or churches. The decision has providers fearful that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents will disrupt their work at health facilities and prompt immigrants to skip medical care — for themselves or, of particular concern, their children.

Anticipating the move, California's Democratic attorney general, Rob Bonta, issued guidance in December advising health care providers how best to respond if ICE comes to their doorstep. But while private entities are encouraged to follow these policies, only state-run facilities are required to adopt them.

"Some health care providers have implemented them, but not everyone has," Arreguín said.

Arreguín's SB 81 would require all health care facilities, including hospitals and community-based clinics, to follow state guidance to limit cooperation with immigration authorities. It would also prohibit providers from granting access to private areas or places where a patient is actively receiving treatment or care, unless there's a warrant.

Another immigration bill, AB 421, would limit the sharing of local law enforcement information if agents plan to make an arrest within a one-mile radius of a hospital or medical office, a child care or day care facility, a religious institution, or a place of worship. California law enforcement has some discretion to share information with immigration agents when an individual has been convicted of a serious crime or felony.

Kousser said immigration is more complicated for California politicians than health privacy. Although a February poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that 7 in 10 Californians think immigrants are a benefit to the state, Kousser said that lawmakers, especially those who won by narrow margins in contested districts, still have to make tough political choices.

Senate Republican leader Brian Jones, who represents a predominantly Democratic district in San Diego, is proposing to change California's sanctuary policies to require law enforcement to share information with ICE when a person has been convicted of a serious crime.

"When these violent felons are released from local custody, they go right back into the communities that they came from to re-victimize those same immigrant communities," Jones said.

But Jones acknowledged the need for nuance when it comes to health privacy.

"Look, the bottom line for me on this immigration reform in America is it needs to be humanitarian and it needs to make sense," Jones said. "And so, if there are areas that we need to protect folks, it might make sense."
