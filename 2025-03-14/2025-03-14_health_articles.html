1. Why am I using BRUFEN PLUS 200/12.8?

BRUFEN PLUS 200/12.8 contains the active ingredients ibuprofen and codeine phosphate hemihydrate. Ibuprofen belongs to a family of medicines called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This group of medicines work by relieving pain, inflammation (e.g. swelling, redness, soreness) and fever. Codeine is an opioid analgesic that works in the brain and spinal cord to relieve pain. BRUFEN PLUS 200/12.8 is used to provide temporary relief of acute to moderate pain and inflammation in patients over the age of 12 years. Once taken, your body processes the codeine into its active form, morphine, in the liver. In about 8% of people, they may experience less pain relief compared to others as their body doesn't convert codeine to morphine very well.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have determined that dermatitis resulting from topical steroid withdrawal (TSW) is distinct from eczema and is caused by an excess of an essential chemical compound in the body. Scientists from NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) identified treatments that could be studied in clinical trials for the condition based on their potential to lower levels of the chemical compound—called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a form of vitamin B3. The findings were published today in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology.

Dermatitis is characterized by inflammation, itching, or burning sensations on the skin, and can result from various conditions including TSW and eczema. Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a common cause of dermatitis and affects 10 to 30% of children and 2 to 10% of adults each year in the United States. Topical steroids—specifically glucocorticoids or topical corticosteroids—have long been used as a first-line treatment for dermatitis caused by eczema because the drugs are safe, effective, easy to apply, and considered well-tolerated.

Some people experience dermatitis after using topical steroids for prolonged periods of time and then stopping—a condition called TSW. Diagnosing and treating this condition is difficult because TSW is not well understood. Symptoms include skin redness, burning sensations, skin heat (thermal dysregulation), itching and peeling, which can even occur on parts of the body where topical steroids were not applied. As TSW and eczema have similar symptoms, it has been difficult to distinguish the two disorders.

To better understand TSW, a team led by scientists in NIAID's Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Microbiology evaluated a previous survey that included 1,889 adults with symptoms similar to eczema. By dividing the participants into those with self-reported TSW and those without, the researchers identified characteristics unique to TSW. The researchers then conducted a pilot study including 16 people with symptoms consistent with TSW, 10 people with eczema but no symptoms of TSW, and 11 people without skin disease. They found that people with TSW symptoms had elevated levels of NAD+ in their blood serum and skin, while NAD+ levels were within a typical range in people without TSW symptoms.

The researchers subsequently used cultured skin cells and a mouse model to mimic TSW conditions. They found that NAD+ was produced in response to topical steroids and caused inflammation. The models suggested that administration of a drug that blocked the formation of NAD+—called a mitochondrial complex I blockade—would improve TSW symptoms. In a pilot study to further assess this treatment strategy, the researchers evaluated subjective responses among study participants who used the mitochondrial complex I-blocking drugs metformin, berberine, or both. After three to five months of use, most participants reported improvement in TSW symptoms.

The scientists provisionally established criteria that can be used by health care providers to identify TSW in people. People who have stopped topical steroid treatment and meet the criteria may be diagnosed by practitioners as having TSW. The researchers suggest that patients identified as having TSW could be treated using the proposed mitochondrial complex I-blocking drugs.

The results of this study may help practitioners identify TSW in patients and work towards developing safe and effective treatments. According to the researchers, more research is needed to determine whether all patients with TSW have an excess of NAD+, or if there are other features that define TSW. Additionally, the diagnostic criteria will help health care providers and researchers to better understand the prevalence of TSW and evaluate the effects of using topical steroids.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A stem cell therapy trial aimed at reducing neuroinflammation in patients with presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease is underway at UTHealth Houston.

In Alzheimer's disease, deposits of beta-amyloid and tau lead to the buildup of plaques and tangles in the brain, which cause dementia. An estimated 6.9 million Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's disease dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association.

The beta-amyloid and tau protein come first in the disease, often for decades, followed by inflammation, which leads to cell death. We have good medications to get rid of the amyloid and slow the progression of the disease, but not stop it. We believe it's not stopped because the downstream damage from inflammation has been set in motion. So, if we can get rid of both the beta-amyloid and decrease the inflammation, we may be able to preclude or significantly reduce the risk of getting Alzheimer's disease." Paul E. Schulz, MD, principal investigator, professor of neurology, and director of the Neurocognitive Disorders Center in McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston

In this Phase Ib/IIa open label study, the stem cells are taken from the patient's own fat, processed by a Sugar Land company, Hope Biosciences, and given back to the patient in four infusions over 13 weeks. The trial, which is sponsored by Weston Brain Institute in Canada, will enroll 12 patients. PET imaging sensitive to inflammation in the brain will be used to determine whether stem cells reduce the main cause of brain cell loss in Alzheimer's disease prior to the development of symptoms. Co-investigators are Javier Ortiz IV, PhD, assistant professor of neurology, and Harshali Patel, clinical research coordinator.

The study builds on previous UTHealth Houston stem cell research for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke, which led to preclinical research in animal models of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

"With TBI and stroke, the blood-brain barrier opens up, so we weren't sure the stem cells could help in a neurodegenerative disease where the blood-brain barrier remains closed. But inflammation seems to be the final item that leads to cell death," said Schulz, who is the Rick McCord Professor in Neurology and the Umphrey Family Professor in Neurodegenerative Diseases. "So UTHealth Houston researchers began to look in mouse models of Parkinson's disease to test whether intravenous stem cells would have an effect. They found that by giving them stem cells, the treated mice continued acting as normal mice."

The Parkinson's animal model study was led by Claudio Soto, PhD, the Huffington Foundation Distinguished Chair in Neurology and professor of neurology at McGovern Medical School.

Another study on stem cells in mice with Alzheimer's disease changes, also led by Soto, revealed that the animals' memories were preserved and there was a reduction of inflammation in the brain. This makes Schulz and his team very hopeful that this study will show that stem cell therapy in humans with presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease can reduce the risk of developing the clinical symptoms of the disease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adding immunotherapy to a new type of inhibitor that targets multiple forms of the cancer-causing gene mutation KRAS kept pancreatic cancer at bay in preclinical models for significantly longer than the same targeted therapy by itself, according to researchers from the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and Penn Medicine's Abramson Cancer Center. The results, published in Cancer Discovery, prime the combination strategy for future clinical trials.

Combatting the "undruggable" RAS genes

Patients with pancreatic cancer have an overall poor prognosis: in most patients, the disease has already spread at the time of diagnosis, resulting in limited treatment options. Nearly 90 percent of pancreatic cancers are driven by KRAS mutations, the most common cancer-causing gene mutation across cancer types, which researchers long considered "undruggable." In 2021, the first KRAS inhibitor was approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer with KRAS G12C mutations, but with longer follow-up, it has become clear that KRAS-mutant cancers can quickly evolve to resist therapies targeted at one specific form of the gene mutation.

We've been excited by the prospect of RAS inhibition for pancreatic cancer, which remains one of the deadliest and most difficult forms of cancer to treat. While the first wave of KRAS inhibitors have had limited impact in cancer care, this research shows that newer RAS inhibition tools may have an immune stimulatory effect, making them ideal to pair with immunotherapy for longer and better treatment response." Ben Stanger, MD, PhD, co-corresponding senior author, the Hanna Wise Professor in Cancer Research and director of the Penn Pancreatic Cancer Research Center

Previous research led by Stanger and Robert Vonderheide, MD, DPhil, director of the Abramson Cancer Center, who is also co-corresponding author on this study, showed that a small molecule inhibitor specifically targeting KRAS G12D, the form of the mutation more commonly found in pancreatic cancer, stimulated the immune system while shrinking tumors or stopping cancer growth in preclinical mouse models of pancreatic cancer.

A new type of RAS inhibitor

In this study, the researchers used RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibitors, the investigational agent daraxonrasib (RMC-6236) and the preclinical tool compound RMC-7977 (both discovered by Revolution Medicines, whose scientists contributed to the study). These inhibitors use a different mechanism of action than most other KRAS inhibitors (including that in the previous study) to target the active or ON-state of multiple forms of RAS mutations.

"The benefit of this 'multi-selective' approach is that the inhibitors are designed to inhibit multiple RAS mutations, so if the cancer mutates, and another type of RAS mutation emerges, the treatment may not necessarily stop working," Vonderheide explained.

The research team found that not only was RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibition effective in preclinical pancreatic cancer models, but it was even more effective when combined with immunotherapy. Using the combination approach, all mouse models had tumor shrinkage and half had a complete response, meaning the tumor was eliminated.

The research team used a Penn-developed immunocompetent model considered the gold standard worldwide for assessing potential therapies for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. This model allows the tumor to spontaneously evolve after implantation, making it possible to discern the drug's impact on the surrounding tumor microenvironment. The research team found that RAS(ON) multi-selective inhibition reshaped the tumor microenvironment by bringing in more T cells and other immune cells, making the tumor particularly receptive to immunotherapy.

Next steps and clinical trial information

Daraxonrasib (RMC-6236) is already being tested in clinical trials across the United States. A clinical trial testing RAS(ON) inhibitors with other anticancer agents in certain patients with gastrointestinal solid tumors is now open at several sites across the country, including at Penn Medicine.

"We're hopeful that we're starting to crack the code on immunotherapy and RAS therapy for pancreatic cancer," Vonderheide said. "After decades of limited progress, it's encouraging to see new treatment approaches making their way into the clinic for patients."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh have identified a novel trigger of a deadly form of ovarian cancer: a subset of progenitor cells that reside in fallopian tube supportive tissue, or stroma.

The discovery of these high-risk cells, described in a new study published today in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, could pave the way for better approaches to prevent and detect high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the most common form of ovarian cancer, which kills more than 12,000 women in the U.S. each year.

Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic cancer in the Western world, but we currently have no way to detect it early and no prevention strategies apart from surgical castration, which is only indicated in high-risk women. Understanding the underlying biology of how ovarian cancer forms is critical to improving outcomes for our patients." Lan Coffman, M.D., Ph.D., co-senior author, associate professor of malignant hematology and medical oncology in the Pitt School of Medicine and member of Magee-Womens Research Institute and UPMC Hillman Cancer Center

HGSOC begins in the fallopian tubes when healthy epithelial cells transform into precursor lesions known as serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC). Similar to how precancerous colon polyps can become colorectal cancer, STIC lesions often develop into HGSOC tumors.

But why do healthy cells become STIC? To find out, Coffman and her team turned to the stroma, the non-cancerous connective tissue that helps cancer grow.

"Most researchers have been focused on the epithelial cells that turn into these STIC lesions and eventually into cancer," said Coffman. "Until now, no one has really looked at the surrounding stromal microenvironment of these lesions."

In the stroma of ovarian cancer, a type of progenitor cell normally involved in growth and repair of healthy tissue - mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) - become reprogrammed by tumor cells to support cancer growth. Coffman started by asking when these cancer-associated MSCs form and how early they play a role in cancer formation.

When she and her team profiled MSCs in the fallopian tubes of patients who did not have cancer, they were surprised to find cells that looked like cancer-associated MSCs in these healthy women. These cells, which the researchers named high-risk MSCs, were more common in women with higher risk of ovarian cancer - those of older age or with mutations in the BRCA gene - suggesting that they play a role in cancer initiation.

When the researchers introduced these high-risk MSCs into organoids, or mini organs, derived from patient fallopian tube tissue, healthy epithelial cells transformed into cancerous cells.

"High-risk MSCs promote DNA damage in epithelial cells and then help those mutated cells survive," explained Coffman. "It's the perfect storm for cancer initiation."

High-risk MSCs also promoted tumor cell growth and increased resistance to a chemotherapy drug.

In search of a mechanism for why high-risk MSCs drive ovarian cancer, the researchers found that these cells have loss of an antioxidant called AMP kinase. Lower levels of AMP kinase led to higher levels of a protein called WT1, which in turn drove formation of compounds that cause DNA damage.

"This is the first report that stromal changes in the fallopian tube actually have a causative role in ovarian cancer initiation," said Coffman. "It also points to a path where we might be able to intervene."

For example, already existing drugs that upregulate AMP kinase could potentially prevent or reverse early changes in the stroma that lead to ovarian cancer.

The findings could also inform approaches for early detection, which are sorely lacking for ovarian cancer. According to Coffman, compounds secreted by high-risk MSCs that are detectable in the bloodstream could act as biomarkers for early-stage ovarian cancer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A newly developed laboratory tool can, within hours, help to identify specific viruses which can be used to destroy variants of the dangerous pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus. Viruses of bacteria, known as bacteriophages, offer an alternative approach to antibiotics in treating multiresistant pathogens. The new tool could make an important contribution to future phage therapies which are not yet used as a standard in Germany. It was developed by a research team led by Professor Andreas Peschel of the Cluster of Excellence "Controlling Microbes to Fight Infections" (CMFI) of the University of Tübingen and published in the journal Cell Reports.

Multiresistant bacteria pose a growing threat to human health worldwide. Among them is a pathogen often found in hospitals - Staphylococcus aureus, which can cause severe inflammation and even sepsis. In its multiresistant form, MRSA can only be treated with great difficulty.

Antibiotics are our most important weapon against infections, but with increasing frequency we are seeing that they either are ineffective or cause too many side-effects." Andreas Peschel, leader of the study

He continues, "Phages, by contrast, are highly specific and can target and eliminate individual pathogens without disrupting the rest of the health-promoting microbiome of patients."

A foe's enemy becomes a friend

Phage therapy exploits the fact that bacteriophages specifically infect certain variants of bacteria, multiply within them, and ultimately destroy them. During this process, new bacteriophages are released which can combat further bacteria. The study's first author, Janes Krusche of the Cluster of Excellence CMFI, explains, "Due to their specificity, however, they can no longer multiply once all the pathogenic bacteria have been killed." One of the challenges of this therapy is choosing the suitable bacteriophages, he adds. Krusche is the primary developer of the new phage identification tool (Phage Aureus RBP Identification System; PhARIS). PhARIS identifies specific receptor-binding proteins in phage genetic material to determine their ability to infect particular Staphylococcus aureus variants.



Peschel and Krusche believe the tool has major potential to improve phage therapies for the treatment of infected wounds and infections associated with implants. The research team is planning to further develop the system for other pathogens. The objective is to make PhARIS a standard laboratory tool to identify phages quickly and effectively as a treatment alternative to antibiotics for many different bacterial infections.



"Around the globe, infections caused by multiresistant germs are difficult to treat and one of the greatest medical challenges of our time. The new research results of the University of Tübingen Cluster of Excellence CMFI show impressively how essential basic research is in this area. In PhARIS, our researchers have developed an innovative tool which accelerates the selection of the suitable phages for future therapies. As a result, it creates a direct benefit for patients. These outstanding research results again underscore the internationally preeminent position of microbiology and infection biology at the University of Tübingen," said Professor Dr. Dr. h.c. (Dōshisha) Karla Pollmann, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Tübingen.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Polycystic kidney disease (PKD), a family of genetic disorders that causes clusters of cysts to form on the kidney, is among the most common genetic disorders, affecting some 500,000 people in the United States. Roughly one in every 1,000 people will develop some form of cystic kidney disease during their lifetime, and nearly 40,000 Oklahomans have a chronic kidney disease, according to the Oklahoma Health Care Authority.

For many patients, dialysis – a time-consuming and costly procedure – is one of few treatment options. A 2021 study by researchers at Tufts University found that the average annual cost of dialysis for patients in the United States is about $40,000.

Now, new research from the University of Oklahoma aims to unravel the genetic mysteries of this disease and, in the process, open the door to novel therapies.

Researchers have long understood that PKD is associated with kidney cysts and fibrosis and a gradual decline in renal function – a measure of the kidney's ability to remove waste and fluid from the body. A key unresolved question is what drives the renal function drop-off.

When people have mutations in certain genes, they can end up with kidney cysts, which alter the tubular architecture of the organ. What we don't know is exactly how you go from a normal kidney to a cystic one." Leonidas Tsiokas, Ph.D., professor of cell biology at the OU College of Medicine and lead investigator for the study

Since late 2024, Tsiokas and colleagues at OU Health Sciences have begun research funded through a four-year, $2 million grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health. A key focus of the study is to identify genes and associated proteins responsible for PKD and their contribution to renal function.

"We know of about 40 genes that play a role in polycystic kidney disease. But these genes have yet to explain the trigger of how you can go from a normal tubule to an elongated tubule to a tubule where the diameter is affected and not functioning," he said.

"In other words, we know the result of mutated genes, but we don't know the cellular process by which this disease develops."

To address these questions, Tsiokas and Maulin Patel, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research fellow in Tsiokas' lab, are zeroing in on Fbxw7, a gene known to play an important role in basic cellular functions that could be linked to cystogenesis, fibrosis, and cellular death and degeneration. Its role in PKD had never been examined before.

Tsiokas speculated that by genetically deleting Fbxw7 in a mouse model used to study kidney function, he could re-create the process of cystogenesis in mice. Preliminary data suggest he's correct.

"When Fbxw7 is deleted, we found that (those) mice develop slowly progressing cystic kidney disease without kidney enlargement, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubular degeneration, and a progressive decline in kidney function," Tsiokas said. Importantly, the changes observed are cardinal features of several types of PKD, including nephronophthisis (NPHP), a genetic kidney disorder that affects children. One in 50,000 children worldwide suffers from nephronophthisis.

Further study of the mice with the Fbxw7 gene deletion revealed that renal function declines were connected to an abnormal accumulation of a protein called SOX9. Normalizing its levels by genetically deleting just one copy of the SOX9 gene restored overall renal function, Tsiokas said.

Tsiokas said these findings offer the first conclusive evidence of the genes that directly modulate fibrocystic diseases of the kidney and are an essential step in efforts to identify "druggable targets" for genetic forms of cystic kidney disorders. Future work will seek to catalog how cystogenesis develops, how it is modulated by fibrosis or tubular degeneration, and how these processes interact to impact renal function.

"Understanding these processes will give us fresh ideas of how to delve further into the mechanisms of the pathogenesis of cystic kidney disease and how we might treat it," he said.</p>

Analyzers and ventilators: In a nutshell

Analyzers are a large group of instruments that measure and profile many different substances, including gases, liquids, and blood samples. They play an important role in diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and quality control.

Blood gas analyzers, gas chromatographs, ECMO devices, and other equipment, such as air quality monitors, are equipped with analyzers to track contaminants and ensure appropriate indoor air quality. Pressure sensors are used to monitor and manage airflow and pressure levels to ensure that these systems work within optimal parameters.4

Mechanical ventilators, on the other hand, are specialized pieces of equipment that help patients breathe. These machines provide positive pressure 'breaths' to the lungs, guaranteeing proper oxygen circulation and CO 2 outflow.

Ventilators accurately control airflow depending on patient-specific parameters such as pressure, volume, and breathing rate to fully support or augment spontaneous breathing. Precise pressure sensors are also essential for maintaining proper air pressure and avoiding issues like barotrauma.5

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When mothers eat a diet high in fat and sugars, their unborn babies can develop liver stress that continues into early life. A new study published in the journal Liver International sheds light on changes to the fetus's bile acid, which affects how liver disease develops and progresses.

Bile acids typically help with digestion and absorb dietary fats in the small intestine, but when they reach excessive levels, they become toxic and can damage the liver. While the mother can detoxify the acids, the fetus lacks that ability. Bile acids may re-circulate to the mother for detoxification, but if they don't, they build up in the fetal liver, setting the stage for future problems.

The findings suggest that early exposure to excess bile acids in the womb may be one important factor underlying the early development of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which affects up to 30% of youth.

"It's a huge public health concern, as we know mothers with obesity or those eating a poor diet can predispose the next generation to a risk for obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases beginning in the womb, thus completing a vicious cycle from mother to infant," said Jed Friedman, Ph.D., associate vice provost for diabetes programs at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences and director of OU Health Harold Hamm Diabetes Center. Friedman was co-senior author of the study with Stephanie Wesolowski, Ph.D., of the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

By the time the offspring studied were juveniles, they had liver damage, including increased amounts of a protein called collagen, which is linked to fibrosis (a build-up of scar tissue), and activated liver cells involved in fibrosis. The high-fat diet also led to changes in how some liver genes worked, particularly those related to bile acid processing. These changes persisted regardless of what the offspring ate after being weaned.

In addition, offspring whose mothers ate a high-fat diet had more bile duct cells (cells that drain bile from the liver), suggesting the liver was trying to compensate for damage.

This study provides evidence that MASLD originates in the womb, influenced at least in part by a mother's high-fat diet. The discovery of elevated bile acid levels in fetuses may provide insights into the early stages of MASLD and its progression before it worsens. A mother's diet during pregnancy plays a powerful role in shaping her baby's future health. By making healthy food choices, moms can help lower their child's risk of developing metabolic diseases like MASLD later in life."
