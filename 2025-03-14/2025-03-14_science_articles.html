Chinese scientists have unveiled an artificial intelligence (AI) "agent" that makes its own decisions without requiring specific instructions from a human operator.

The AI agent, Manus, was developed by Chinese startup Butterfly Effect. Its representatives claim it is the world's first general AI agent — meaning it demonstrates a level of autonomy that current AI models lack. The scientists who created Manus say it shows a potential glimpse of what artificial general intelligence (AGI) may one day be capable of.

This emerging type of AI responds to text prompts, similar to chatbots such as ChatGPT or DeepSeek. However, unlike chatbots, they work on different tasks, without the need for frequent, step-by-step instructions.

Manus isn't available to the general public yet, but a limited distribution of invite codes has given a select few access, sparking a flurry of interest online. Some users appear to have created playable video games from simple prompts, while others have used Manus to design and launch websites.

It's still early days for Manus, however, with some users reporting crashes and other issues such as a tendency to get stuck in an infinite feedback loop. The company is also aware of relatively high failure rates in Manus versus ChatGPT. Chief scientist Peak Ji acknowledged these as part of the teething issues in launching a new tool on the social media platform X.

Reporter Caiwei Chen, who had access to Manus for MIT Technology Review, wrote that the experience was "like collaborating with a highly intelligent and efficient intern." However, Chen also noted that Manus sometimes lacked understanding of what it was supposed to do, made incorrect assumptions and cut corners. "Ultimately, it's promising but not perfect," Chen wrote.

Manus AI is the second Chinese AI tool to send shock waves through the tech industry this year. In January, DeepSeek changed the landscape of AI by achieving similar or better chatbot results than its American competitors for reportedly a fraction of the cost. Manus, on the other hand, could represent the first of an entirely new generation of AI.

Chatbots usually run on a single large language model (LLM), while Manus uses multiple LLMs and other independently operating software to work autonomously on a variety of tasks, MIT Technology Review reported. This is also known as a multi-agent architecture, in which multiple components communicate and collaborate to process tasks.



In a head-to-head between Manus and ChatGPT, the agent will often provide more detailed responses than the chatbot — a claim which the company has reinforced with testing data from the GAIA benchmark. However, Manus also takes a lot longer to provide those responses as it does deeper research, Tom's Guide reported.

In other words, Manus will effectively go its own way and figure out what to do in response to a prompt, rather than relying on step-by-step instructions like a chatbot does. It's designed to start tasks on its own and dynamically adjust its approach along the way, Forbes reported.

—AGI could now arrive as early as 2026 — but not all scientists agree

—'Math Olympics' has a new contender — Google's AI now 'better than human gold medalists' at solving geometry problems

—Older AI models show signs of cognitive decline, study shows — but not everyone is entirely convinced

Give Manus a single prompt, and it will navigate the web, write code and analyze data for its reply, without requiring further intervention as a conventional LLM-powered chatbot would.

Some examples Manus AI has demonstrated on its website include planning a detailed holiday itinerary, analyzing the stock market and screening job resumes. The difference between this and a tool like ChatGPT is that Manus can break down and complete complex tasks without continuous input. The system works from the cloud, too, so users can close their computers at any time, and Manus will keep working in the background.

The arrival of a general AI agent brings a new wave of ethical questions and considerations surrounding the use of AI. Agents behave more like humans, but unlike humans, they can work fast and continuously — provided they don't crash — and never get tired.

Dark energy, the mysterious phenomenon that powers the expansion of the universe, may undergo periodic 'violent transitions' that reverse the growth of the cosmos, a new pre-print study hints.

Dark energy may have switched directions sometime in the distant past — and this violent transition may explain why cosmological observations aren't adding up, researchers propose in a new paper.

The modern picture of the evolution of the universe is known as ΛCDM (or lambda-CDM), for dark energy (represented by the Greek letter Λ) and cold dark matter. Dark energy is the mysterious force driving the accelerating expansion of the universe, and cold dark matter refers to the mysterious, invisible substance that provides most of the mass of almost every single galaxy.

This model has explained a wide variety of observations, such as the behavior of galaxies and clusters, the growth of large-scale structures, and the appearance of the cosmic microwave background. But in recent years, two troubling tensions have popped up.

One such problem, known as the Hubble tension, is a difference in measuring the present-day expansion rate of the universe, a number known as the Hubble constant. Probes of the distant, early universe seem to be giving estimates significantly lower than probes of the nearby, late universe do.

Related: After 2 years in space, the James Webb telescope has broken cosmology. Can it be fixed?

Related to this issue is the second problem, known as the sigma-8 tension. This is a measure of how clumpy matter is in the universe, and once again, different probes are yielding different results.

Something in the ΛCDM model has to be wrong, but we're not sure what. One hypothesis is that dark energy might be more dynamic than we originally thought. In the usual ΛCDM picture, dark energy is a cosmological constant. It stays the same through cosmic history.

But in a recent model that's been gaining interest, dark energy changes. And not by a little; it undergoes a complete phase transition, from decelerating the universe to accelerating the universe.

Now, adding a twist to that theory, a research team has explored the possibility that the phase change is even more dramatic. In a paper posted to the preprint server arXiv in February but not yet peer-reviewed, dark energy doesn't just switch signs; it also changes strength, so that it powers an acceleration differently than it powers a deceleration.

Then, the researchers tested their model against a wide variety of observations and datasets. These included the Planck space observatory's measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the oldest light we can see in the universe; a measurement of a phenomenon called the baryon acoustic oscillation, a pattern in the arrangement of galaxies at very large scales; the Pantheon dataset of supernova distance measures; and a weak lensing map that provides details accounting for the effects of dark matter.

—Cosmic voids may explain the universe's acceleration without dark energy

—'Heavy' dark matter would rip our understanding of the universe apart, new research suggests

—Something invisible and 'fuzzy' may lurk at the Milky Way's center, new research suggests

They found that the new model alleviated some of the Hubble and sigma-8 tensions, and thus they contend that this approach might be a promising way forward.

That said, the researchers noted that this model isn't exactly grounded in known physics. It's just a toy, a way to explore the physical consequences of a model without knowing the underlying physics. But because it seems like a promising direction, this approach could motivate theorists to come up with mechanisms to explain how dark energy might switch like this.

No matter what, it appears that the universe — especially dark energy — is more complicated than we assumed.

Skywatchers snapped photos of the "blood moon" hovering above North and South America last night. Here's a gallery of images to celebrate the total lunar eclipse.

A "blood moon" was visible from Earth last night, marking the first total lunar eclipse since 2022.

A total lunar eclipse occurs when a full moon passes directly through Earth's shadow, casting our planet's natural satellite in a reddish, blood-like hue — often called a blood moon.

Skywatchers across the Americas snapped photographs of this unusual phenomenon as the moon completed its lunar phase on Thursday night and into Friday morning (March 13 to 14).



In North America, one photographer captured the "blood moon" rising over the Statue of Liberty in New York, while another caught it peaking out of the clouds above the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.

Further south, photos revealed the moon passing by the Little Prince monument in El Salvador and the Young Woman of Amajac statue in Mexico City.



A lunar eclipse is the opposite of a solar eclipse, when the moon slides between Earth and the sun. During a lunar eclipse, the moon travels behind Earth relative to the position of the sun, meaning the satellite is cast in shadow.

The moon is still visible during this lunar phase because some light from the sun refracts through Earth's atmosphere and hits the satellite before reflecting back to the surface of our planet facing the moon. The sun projects a spectrum of different colors in its light — the seven colors of the rainbow, plus infrared and ultraviolet light. However, particles in Earth's atmosphere scatter blues and other short-wavelength light, while allowing the longer-wavelength oranges and reds to pass through — similar to a sunset or sunrise — and then splash onto the moon.

—Earth's moon could've had Saturn-like rings, new study hints

—Is the moon still geologically active? Evidence says it's possible

Not every full moon results in a lunar eclipse. The event only happens when the moon is perfectly aligned behind our planet. If that alignment is slightly off, then the sun's light can still directly reach some of the moon — meaning it's a partial eclipse.

The next total lunar eclipse will occur on the night of Sept. 7 to 8, but it will only be visible in western North America. Around this time next year, there will be another blood moon that will be visible in all of North America.

About 10 minutes with a therapy dog soothed kids who felt anxious about being emergency room patients.

A clinical trial found that after spending time with a dog, young patients reported a significantly larger decrease in their anxiety than kids who didn't have dog time. The patients' parents also perceived significantly reduced anxiety in their kids, researchers report March 14 in JAMA Network Open.

Managing kids' anxiety and pain while receiving emergency medical care is a key part of the treatment plan, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Many pediatric emergency departments have child life specialists, who explain procedures in developmentally appropriate ways and help young patients cope with stress through play therapy and other methods.

The new clinical trial, which took place at Riley Children's Hospital in Indianapolis from early 2023 to mid-2024, investigated whether adding a dog therapy visit would calm young patients even further. Riley Children's Hospital has a dog therapy program in place. The dogs are vaccinated, have yearly vet checks and are certified as therapy animals.

All 80 participants in the trial, admitted patients 5 to 17 years old, worked with child life specialists. Forty of the patients also spent around 10 minutes with a therapy dog and the dog's handler. Kids who were fearful of dogs or had allergies to the animals were excluded from the trial.

The research team evaluated the kids' anxiety, and parents' perception of their kids' anxiety, with the FACES scale, which shows a series of faces in different amounts of distress. The scale ranges from zero, or no anxiety, to 10, or very severe anxiety.

The baseline, self-reported score for all 80 patients was 5.4 on average. Forty-five minutes after time with the child life specialists and, for those receiving it, the dog therapy visit, the research team assessed anxiety again. The kids getting the usual care saw an average drop in their score of 1.5, while the kids who hung out with therapy dogs had an average drop of 2.7 points. The pattern held true when the parents of the kids assessed their kids' anxiety over time.

The End-Permian mass extinction killed an estimated 80% of life on Earth, but new research suggests that plants might have done okay.

The mass extinction that killed 80% of life on Earth 250 million years ago may not have been quite so disastrous for plants, new fossils hint. Scientists have identified a refuge in China where it seems that plants weathered the planet's worst die-off.

The end-Permian mass extinction, also known as the "Great Dying," took place 251.9 million years ago. At that time, the supercontinent Pangea was in the process of breaking up, but all land on Earth was still largely clustered together, with the newly formed continents separated by shallow seas. An enormous eruption from a volcanic system called the Siberian Traps seem to have pushed carbon dioxide levels to extremes: A 2021 study estimated that atmospheric CO2 got as high as 2,500 parts per million (ppm) in this period, compared with current levels of 425 ppm. This caused global warming and ocean acidification, leading to a massive collapse of the ocean ecosystem.

The situation on land is far hazier. Only a handful of places around the world have rock layers containing fossils from land ecosystems at the end of the Permian and beginning of the Triassic.

A new study of one of these spots — located in what is now northeastern China —revealed a refuge where the ecosystem remained relatively healthy despite the Great Dying. In this place, seed-producing gymnosperm forests continued to grow, complemented by spore-producing ferns.

"At least in this place, we don't see mass extinction of plants," study co-author Wan Yang, a professor of geology and geophysics at the Missouri University of Science and Technology, told Live Science.

The finding, published Wednesday (March 12) in the journal Science Advances, adds weight to the idea that the Great Dying was more complicated on land than in the seas, Yang said.



Yang and his colleagues looked at rock layers in Xinjiang that span the mass extinction event.

A major advantage of this now-desert site is that the rocks include layers of ash that hold tiny crystals called zircons. The zircons include radioactive elements — lead and uranium — that gradually decay, which enables researchers to determine how long it has been since the crystals formed. This means the researchers can more accurately date the rock layers here than they can at other sites.

Some of these layers also hold fossil spores and pollen. These fossils reveal that there wasn't a massive die-off and repopulation but a slow changeover of species, Yang said.

This is consistent with other evidence from Africa and Argentina, where plant populations seemed to have shifted gradually rather than dying off dramatically and then repopulating, said Josefina Bodnar, a paleobotanist at the National University of La Plata in Argentina who was not involved in the research.

Land plants "have a lot of adaptations that allow them to survive this extinction," Bodnar told Live Science. "For example, [they have] subterranean structures, roots or stems, that can survive perhaps hundreds of years." Seeds can also persist a long time, she added.



This survival may have been particularly possible at humid, high-latitude regions. The site in Xinjiang was once dotted with lakes and rivers, a few hundred miles from the coast. Other places where plant refuges have been found, such as Argentina, were also high-latitude in the Permian, far from the equator where temperatures were the hottest.

Yang and his colleagues found that during the late Permian and early Triassic, the climate became a bit drier in what is now Xinjiang — but not enough to cause deforestation.

This may have been a consequence of location, said Devin Hoffman, a researcher in paleontology at University College London who was not involved in the new study. Marine animals had no escape from global ocean acidification. But climate change on land wasn't uniform. The impact would have been most pronounced in the center of Pangea, which was a vast desert.

This means that in more temperate regions on land, survival could have been possible, Hoffman told Live Science. "You essentially have everything being pushed toward the poles and towards the coast, but on land you're able to escape some of the effects," he said.



These findings have led to some debate over whether the greatest mass extinction ever deserves the moniker on land. "I will call it a crisis on land. I will not call it an extinction," said Robert Gastaldo, an emeritus professor of Geology at Colby College who was not involved in the new study, but who has collaborated with Yang in the past.

The end-Permian extinction is particularly interesting to scientists because it was driven by greenhouse gases, much like climate change today. The situation was far more extreme then: The polar ice caps melted completely — a situation that would cause sea levels to rise a staggering 230 feet (70 meters) today.

But humans may be nearly as deadly as giant volcanoes. A 2020 study, for example, found that a smaller extinction event at the end of the Triassic (201 million years ago) was driven by greenhouse gas pulses from volcanoes that were on a similar scale to what humans are expected to emit by the end of this century. Studying these ancient catastrophes can give us a sense of what to expect under atmospheric carbon dioxide levels people have never experienced, Gastaldo said.

"The planet has experienced it," he said. "The planet's memory is in the rock record. And we can learn from the rock record what happens to our planet under these extreme conditions."

	This wasn't the first time a spacecraft watched an eclipse from the moon

From the surface of the moon, the Firefly lander captured this photo of a lunar eclipse — or from its perspective, a solar eclipse — on March 14 at 4:30 am EDT, capturing the "diamond ring" effect of the sun about to emerge from totality from behind Earth.

The privately-owned Blue Ghost moon lander, built by Texas-based company Firefly Aerospace, has captured rare views of a lunar eclipse from the moon's surface.

The lander, which touched down March 2 in a volcanic plain on the moon's nearside, has spent its time deploying instruments and collecting data. On the night of March 13, as Earth's shadow covered the moon in a total lunar eclipse, Blue Ghost turned its cameras back toward Earth. 

Around 4:30 a.m. EDT, the lander captured the “diamond ring effect,” as a single point of sunlight emerged from behind our planet at the end of totality. Earth itself, appearing as a dark disk in the black lunar sky, is encircled by glowing ring of light.

The first image from the eclipse, captured about three hours earlier, was deceptive — the sun appeared to still be shining brightly. But a reflection in the lander's solar panels revealed an otherwise hidden detail: an arc of light wreathing Earth with just a spot of sunlight sneaking through. 

Since landing, the spacecraft has put eight of its 10 science instruments to work. These include a device that uses a blast of pressurized nitrogen gas to collect and sort lunar soil; a dust shield demonstration, using electrical forces to lift lunar dirt from glass surfaces, which could help keep future spacecraft clean of famously sticky moondust; another experiment to measure the stickiness of that dust; a drill to measure heat flow from the moon's interior; and an experiment to test a form of lunar GPS.

Cameras on the lander's underside also took a video of the lander's engine plumes interacting with the lunar surface, which could provide insights for making future landings smoother and cleaner.

This is not the first time a spacecraft has observed an eclipse from the lunar vicinity. In 2009, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency's Kaguya orbiter saw a penumbral eclipse, in which the Earth mostly blocked the sun. And NASA's Surveyor 3 moon lander saw an eclipse way back in 1967.

Mount Washington is a prominent mountain in New Hampshire, known for its dramatic weather and conditions that are extremely dangerous for hikers and climbers.

Name: Mount Washington

Location: New Hampshire

Coordinates: 44.270631129317565, -71.30324713195401

Why it's incredible: The mountain has some of the wildest weather on Earth.

Mount Washington is the tallest peak in the Northeast. The mountain is famous for attracting extreme weather, with winds that exceed the force of a hurricane more than 100 days per year.

The mountain is home to "the world's worst weather" for three main reasons. Firstly, at 6,288 feet (1,917 meters) tall, it is the highest mountain in New England. Winds pick up speed when they can blow unobstructed, and the mountain is directly exposed to winds from the west that travel for hundreds of miles without obstruction. The closest mountains of a similar height to Mount Washington along this westerly windpath are the Black Hills of South Dakota about 1,600 miles (2,500 kilometers) away, according to the Mount Washington Observatory.

Not only do these winds hit Mount Washington at full speed but they are also siphoned toward the peak by the surrounding landscape. The mountains to the west of Mount Washington form a 75-mile-wide (120 km) funnel that channels westerly winds toward the mountain, accelerating already-fast winds until they reach breakneck speeds, according to the observatory.

Finally, Mount Washington sits on the confluence of three major storm tracks. Storms hit the summit every three days on average in the winter, bringing high winds and huge amounts of precipitation, according to the observatory. Record levels of precipitation for Mount Washington were measured in 1969, when 4.1 feet (1.3 m) of snow fell within 24 hours.

As a result of its unique position, Mount Washington is a contender for the world's fastest recorded wind speed. On "calm" summer days, instruments on Mount Washington's summit record wind speeds of 40 mph (65 km/h). But when storms roll in, these winds can whip up gusts exceeding 100 mph (160 km/h).

In the midst of making sure instruments were working well, the summit crew took some time to show us (safely) what 100mph winds looked like... and had some fun doing it. Tune in tonight at 5pm for the weekend's Higher Summits Forecast on Facebook Live. pic.twitter.com/6TSShijLgkMarch 7, 2025

On April 12, 1934, instruments at the summit measured a record wind speed of 231 mph (372 km/h), which is equivalent to wind speeds inside a level-5 tornado on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. Such winds have the power to level well-constructed buildings, blow away structures with weak foundations and throw cars over large distances. The record still stands today as the second-fastest natural wind gust ever recorded, with the fastest occurring on Barrow Island in Australia on April 10, 1996 and reaching speeds of 253 mph (407 km/h).

Even wind speeds of 100 mph can rip huge chunks of ice off the mountain and the Mount Washington Observatory building at the summit, which poses a severe risk for hikers and climbers in the winter. The observatory has bulletproof windows to mitigate the risk of one of these chunks smashing into the building, according to its website.

As well as flying ice, people climbing Mount Washington in the winter are faced with the risk of avalanches, hypothermia and frostbite. Temperatures on the mountain average 27.1 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 2.7 degrees Celsius), which can create extreme wind chill conditions, according to New Hampshire State Parks.

Several rescue teams monitor Mount Washington, and volunteers regularly save the lives of hikers who get lost or caught out by changing weather conditions.

People find responses from artificial intelligence (AI) to be more compassionate and understanding than those from human mental health experts, a new study shows. The finding again demonstrates that AI can outperform humans in fields in which we've long assumed only people with shared experience are good at.

In the study, published Jan. 10 in the journal Communications Psychology, scientists conducted a series of four experiments to find out how 550 participants rated empathetic responses for compassion and responsiveness generated by AI versus those from professionals. Specifically, the participants gave information about personal experiences and then assessed the answers for compassion, responsiveness and overall preference.

The tests revealed that AI responses were considered more compassionate than those from professional crisis responders, even when the author of the responses was revealed to the participants.

The results suggest AI has uses in "contexts requiring empathetic interaction, with the potential to address the increasing need for empathy in supportive communication contexts," the researchers wrote in the study.

On average, AI-generated responses were rated 16% more compassionate than human responses and were preferred 68% of the time, even when compared to trained crisis responders.

Study lead author Dariya Ovsyannikova, a lab manager at the University of Toronto's psychology department, attributed the AI's success to its ability to identify fine details and stay objective as crisis experiences were described. This made the AI better able to generate attentive communication that gave the user the illusion of empathy. At the same time, the humans may have performed worse because human responders are susceptible to fatigue and burnout, she added.

Live Science asked Eleanor Watson, IEEE member, AI ethics engineer and AI faculty at Singularity University, what the finding means, not just for the future of AI-human interactions but the ongoing debate about which jobs AI can't or shouldn't do when human understanding and input seems critical.

Watson called the finding "fascinating" but wasn't altogether surprised. "[AI] can certainly model supportive responses with a remarkable consistency and apparent empathy, something that humans struggle to maintain due to fatigue and cognitive biases," she told Live Science.

"Human practitioners are constrained by their direct clinical experience and cognitive limitations. The scale of data AI can process fundamentally changes the equation of therapeutic support. It can also potentially enable patients to gain perspectives or approaches their therapist has not been trained in," she said.

Globally, mental health care is in crisis, and the study raises the possibility of AI filling the gaps. According to the World Health Organization, more than two-thirds of people with mental health conditions don't get the care they need. In low and middle income countries that figure rises to 85%.

Watson said the ease in accessing AI versus human therapists could make it a useful tool to help with mental health provision. "The availability of machines is a welcome factor, especially compared with expensive practitioners whose time is limited," Watson said.

"Also, people often find dealing with a machine less daunting, particularly with more sensitive topics. There's less fear of judgment or gossip."

But finding AI-generated responses more empathetic doesn't come without risks. Watson warned of the specter of supernormal stimulus, which is the tendency to respond more strongly to an exaggerated version of a stimulus.

—People are falling in love with AI. Should we worry?

—Many kids are unsure if Alexa and Siri have feelings or think like people, study finds

"AI is so enticing we become entranced by it," Watson said. "AI can be flirty, insightful, enlightening, fun, provocative, forbearing and accessible to the point where it's impossible for any human being to measure up."

Content about mental health also exacerbates the privacy issues associated with AI. "The privacy implications are stark," Watson noted. "Having access to people's deepest vulnerabilities and struggles makes them vulnerable to various forms of attack and demoralization. Scrupulous governance of systems and the organizations behind them must be upheld to defend against exploitation by bad actors."

Measles cases are rising in the U.S. as outbreaks grow in Texas and New Mexico.

Measles is continuing to spread across the United States, as outbreaks grow in western Texas and New Mexico.

Between the two states, 256 cases have been confirmed as of Thursday, mostly in those who are unvaccinated or with unknown vaccination status, according to state health officials. At least one unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas has died and another suspected death is being investigated in New Mexico in an unvaccinated adult. At least 10 other states have also confirmed cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

As health care professionals work to care for patients, they are also attempting to combat the proliferation of misinformation about how to prevent and treat the disease, some tell ABC News.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been one of the prominent voices on measles, making comments that public health experts say are not accurate.

In multiple interviews, Kennedy has claimed that vitamin A and cod liver oil are effective treatments for measles. He also said that poor diet contributes to severe cases of measles and that -- while vaccines prevent illness -- they also cause severe illnesses and even death.

Some public health experts told ABC News these statements are not rooted in scientific evidence and could be quite dangerous for the public.

"I think it's really important to try to stay away from these ideas of fringe theories or ideas that have not been scientifically proven," Kirsten Hokeness, director of the school of health and behavioral sciences at Bryant University, in Rhode Island, told ABC News.

During an interview on Fox News with Sean Hannity on Tuesday, Kennedy said that HHS was currently providing vitamin A to measles patients for treatment. He claimed vitamin A can "dramatically" reduce measles deaths.

The World Health Organization recommends two doses of vitamin A in children and adults with measles to restore low vitamin A levels, which can help prevent eye damage and blindness.

However, experts who spoke with ABC News said it is not an antiviral treatment against measles (meaning it does not prevent infections), nor is there one available.

"Because it has been described that patients with vitamin A deficiency can have a more severe course, the WHO recommends low doses of vitamin A for children diagnosed with measles," Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children's Medical Center Plano in Texas, told ABC News. "This is a supplementation in case of deficiency, and it is not intended to treat the virus. High doses of vitamin A can have serious consequences."

"Neither vitamin A nor cod liver oil will treat measles," she concluded.

Kennedy has claimed that poor nutrition plays a role in causing severe measles disease and that a healthy diet can lessen severity.

While malnutrition can be a factor in severe disease, malnutrition and nutritional deficits in measles patients have historically been seen in underdeveloped countries, according to experts.

Additionally, studies have found that mass nutritional supplementation "followed by an increase in vaccination coverage" can reduce measles infection and mortality.

"Certainly, good nutrition can promote a healthy immune system, and it's a good idea for everyone to try to maintain good nutrition, but it's certainly not a substitute for vaccination," Dr. Scott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity at the University of Texas Medical Branch, told ABC News. "There's no evidence that it can prevent infection, no evidence that it can prevent an infected person from spreading the virus and contributing to one of these outbreaks."

"So, I want to be very clear, good nutrition is absolutely no substitute for vaccination to prevent someone's own risk for developing severe, maybe fatal, measles," he added.

The CDC currently recommends that people receive two doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old.

One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective, the CDC says. Most vaccinated adults don't need a booster.

Kennedy has said vaccines do "stop the spread of the disease" but also said they cause "adverse events."

"It does cause deaths every year. It causes all the illnesses that measles itself [causes], encephalitis and blindness, et cetera," he told Hannity, without providing evidence.

Weaver said there is no vaccine that is without risks but that the MMR vaccine is incredibly safe and effective.

"There's no evidence that it has severe outcomes … similar to what the measles virus infection causes," he told ABC News. "It certainly can cause very minor reactions at the site of injection, like just about every vaccine, but it's one of the safest vaccines that's ever been developed."

Weaver added that the risks of complications from a measles infection far outweigh any risks from the MMR vaccine.

As for Kennedy's unfounded claim that the MMR vaccine causes death, a 2015 CDC review published in the journal Vaccine found such claims are deaths reported to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System – a voluntary reporting system "that accepts any submitted report of an adverse event without judging its clinical significance or whether it was caused by a vaccination."

The review found that many of the deaths reported to VAERS claiming to be linked to the MMR included children who has serious underlying medical conditions or had deaths that were unrelated to the vaccine, including accidental deaths.

"These complete VAERS reports and any accompanying medical records, autopsy reports and death certificates have been reviewed in depth by FDA and CDC physicians and no concerning patterns have emerged that would suggest a causal relationship with the MMR vaccine and death," the review stated.

Kennedy claimed in an interview with Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Seigel over the weekend that is "almost impossible" for measles to kill a healthy individual.

Some people who contract measles may suffer severe complications as a result of infection. While those most at risk include children younger than age 5, pregnant people and those with weakened immune systems, anybody can experience complications.

About in 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who contract measles are hospitalized and about 1 in 20 children with measles develop pneumonia, which is the most common cause of death in young children who get infected.

About one in 10 children infected with measles develop ear infections as well, which can lead to hearing loss, data shows.

Additionally, about 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop encephalitis -- which is the swelling of the brain and can lead to brain damage -- and up to 3 out of every 1,000 children with measles will die from respiratory and neurologic complications, the CDC says.

Recently, Texas health officials reported the death of an unvaccinated school-aged child, the first death from measles recorded in the U.S. in a decade. The child was healthy and had no preexisting conditions, officials said.

"The CDC estimates that 1 in 5 people [who] get infected with measles ends up in the hospital," Hokeness said. "So, this approach to relying on sort of this natural immunity doesn't make sense when we have a vaccine which prevents it in the first place."

"But, in short, there's really no benefit to this idea of natural immunity and naturally acquiring the virus. That's why we've developed the vaccines that work so well," she added.

Kennedy also claimed in his interview that natural immunity from measles may protect against cancer and heart disease. There is no evidence to suggest either of those are true, experts said.

"If you want to take your chances with getting natural infection, hoping that there might be some very small benefit to that, it's a very big risk to take, because you may very well get severe measles infection," Weaver said.

Overall, experts advised relying on scientifically proven medical information.

"We should leverage the knowledge that we've gained over the years and not spend our time focusing on alternative possibilities," Hokeness added.
