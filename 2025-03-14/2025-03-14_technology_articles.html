OpenAI and Google are pushing the US government to allow their AI models to train on copyrighted material. Both companies outlined their stances in proposals published this week, with OpenAI arguing that applying fair use protections to AI “is a matter of national security.”

The proposals come in response to a request from the White House, which asked governments, industry groups, private sector organizations, and others for input on President Donald Trump’s “AI Action Plan.” The initiative is supposed to “enhance America’s position as an AI powerhouse,” while preventing “burdensome requirements” from impacting innovation.

In its comment, Open claims that allowing AI companies to access copyrighted content would help the US “avoid forfeiting” its lead in AI to China, while calling out the rise of DeepSeek.

“There’s little doubt that the PRC’s [People’s Republic of China] AI developers will enjoy unfettered access to data — including copyrighted data — that will improve their models,” OpenAI writes. “If the PRC’s developers have unfettered access to data and American companies are left without fair use access, the race for AI is effectively over.”

Google, unsurprisingly, agrees. The company’s response similarly states that copyright, privacy, and patents policies “can impede appropriate access to data necessary for training leading models.” It adds that fair use policies, along with text and data mining exceptions, have been “critical” to training AI on publicly available data.

“These exceptions allow for the use of copyrighted, publicly available material for AI training without significantly impacting rightsholders and avoid often highly unpredictable, imbalanced, and lengthy negotiations with data holders during model development or scientific experimentation,” Google says.

Anthropic, the AI company behind the AI chatbot Claude, also submitted a proposal – but it doesn’t mention anything about copyrights. Instead, it asks the US government to develop a system to assess an AI model’s national security risks and to strengthen export controls on AI chips. Like Google and OpenAI, Anthropic also suggests that the US bolster its energy infrastructure to support the growth of AI.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>is a deputy editor and author of thenewsletter. He has been reporting on the tech industry for more than a decade.

Anthropic is one of the world’s leading AI model providers, especially in areas like coding. But its AI assistant, Claude, is nowhere near as popular as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

According to chief product officer Mike Krieger, Anthropic doesn’t plan to win the AI race by building a mainstream AI assistant. “I hope Claude reaches as many people as possible,” Krieger told me onstage at the HumanX AI conference earlier this week. “But I think, [for] our ambitions, the critical path isn’t through mass-market consumer adoption right now.”

Instead, Krieger says Anthropic is focused on two things: building the best models; and what he calls “vertical experiences that unlock agents.” The first of these is Claude Code, Anthropic’s AI coding tool that Krieger says amassed 100,000 users within its first week of availability. He says there are more of these so-called agents for specific use cases coming this year and that Anthropic is working on “smaller, cheaper models” for developers. (And, yes, there are future versions of its biggest and most capable model, Opus, coming at some point, too.)

Krieger made his name as the cofounder of Instagram and then the news aggregation app Artifact before joining Anthropic nearly a year ago. “One of the reasons I joined Anthropic is that I think we have a unique role that we can play in shaping what the future of human-AI interaction looks like,” he says. “I think we have a differentiated take on that. How can we empower rather than just be a pure replacement for people? How do we make people aware of both the potentials and the limitations of AI?”

Given its history, Anthropic is considered to be one of the more cautious labs. But now it seems set on making its models less sanitized. The company’s latest release, Sonnet 3.7, will refuse to answer a prompt 45 percent less often than before, according to Krieger. “There are going to be some models that are going to be super YOLO and then other models that may be even more cautious. I’ll be really happy if people feel like our models are striking that balance.”

Krieger and I covered a lot of ground during our chat at HumanX — a condensed version of which you can read below. I asked him about how Anthropic decides to compete with its API customers, such as the AI coding tool Cursor, how product development works inside a frontier AI lab, and even what he thinks sets Anthropic apart from OpenAI…

The following interview has been edited for length and clarity:

When you’re building and thinking about the next couple of years of Anthropic, is it an enterprise company? Is it a consumer company? Is it both?

We want to help people get work done – whether it’s coding, whether it’s knowledge work, etc. The parts we’re less focused on are what I would think of as more the entertainment, consumer use case. I actually think there’s a dramatic underbuilding still in consumer and AI. But it’s less of what we’re focused on right now.

Having run a billion-user service, it’s really fun. It’s very cool to get to build at that scale. I hope Claude reaches as many people as possible, but I think, [for] our ambitions, the critical path isn’t through mass-market consumer adoption right now.

What is the path?

One is to continue to build and train the best models in the world. We have a fantastic research team. We’ll continue to invest in that and build on the things that we’re already good at and make those available via an API.

The other one is building vertical experiences that unlock agents. The way I think about it is AI doing more than just single-turn work for you, either for your personal life or in the workplace. Claude Code is our first take on a vertical agent with coding, and we’ll do others that play to our model’s advantages and help solve problems for people, including data integration. You’ll see us go beyond just Claude AI and Claude Code with some other agents over the coming year.

People really love Cursor, which is powered by your models. How do you decide where to compete with your customers? Because that’s ultimately what you’re doing with Claude Code.

I think this is a really delicate question for all of the labs and one that I’m trying to approach really thoughtfully. For example, I called Cursor’s CEO and basically all of our leading coding customers to give them a heads-up that we’re launching Claude Code because I see it as complementary. We’re hearing from people using both.

The same model that’s available in Claude Code is the same one that’s powering Cursor. It’s the same one that’s powering Windsurf, and it’s powering GitHub Copilot now. A year ago, none of those products even existed except for Copilot. Hopefully, we’ll all be able to navigate the occasionally closer adjacencies.

You’re helping power the new Alexa. Amazon is a big investor in Anthropic. How did that [product partnership] come about, and what does it mean for Anthropic?

It was my third week at Anthropic. They had a lot of energy to do something new. I was very excited about the opportunity because, when you think about what we can bring to the table, it’s frontier models and the know-how about how to make those models work really well for really complex use cases. What they have is an incredible number of devices and reach and integrations.

It’s actually one of the two things I’ve gotten to code at Anthropic. More recently, I got to build some stuff with Claude Code, which is great for managers because you can delegate work before a meeting and then catch up with it after a meeting and see what it did. Then, with Alexa, I coded a simple prototype of what it would mean to talk to an Alexa-type system with a Claude model.

I know you’re not going to explain the details of the Alexa deal, but what does it mean for your models?

We can’t go into the exact economics of it. It’s something that was really exciting for both of the companies. It really pushed us because, to do Alexa-type workflows really well, latency matters a ton. Part of the partnership was that we pulled forward probably a year’s worth of optimization work into three to six months. I love those customers that push us and set super ambitious deadlines. It benefits everybody because some of those improvements make it into the models that everybody gets to use now.

Would you like more distribution channels like Alexa? It seems like Apple needs some help with Siri. Is that something you guys would like to do?

I would love to power as many of those things as possible. When I think about what we can do, it’s really in that consultation and partnership place. Hardware is not an area that I’m looking at internally right now because, when we think about our current advantages, you have to pick and choose.

How do you, as a CPO, work at such a research-driven company like Anthropic? How can you even foresee what’s going to happen when there’s maybe a new research breakthrough just around the corner?

We think a lot about the vertical agents that we want to deliver by the end of this year. We want to help you do research and analysis. There are a bunch of interesting knowledge worker use cases we want to enable.

If it’s important for some of that data to be in the pretraining phase, that decision needs to happen now if we want to manifest that by midyear or even later. You both need to operate very, very quickly in delivering the product but also operate flexibly and have the vision of where you want to be in six months so that you can inform that research direction.

We had the idea for more agentic coding products when I started, but the models weren’t quite where we wanted to be to deliver the product. As we started approaching the 3.7 Sonnet launch, we were like, “This is feeling good.” So it’s a dance. If you wait until the model’s perfect, you’re too late because you should have been building that product ahead of time. But you have to be okay with sometimes the model not being where you needed it and be flexible around shipping a different manifestation of that product.

You guys are leading the model work on coding. Have you started reforecasting how you are going to hire engineers and headcount allocation?

I sat with one of our engineers who’s using Claude Code. He was like, “You know what the hard part is? It’s still aligning with design and PM and legal and security on actually shipping products.” Like any complex system, you solve one bottleneck, and you’re going to hit some other area where it is more constrained.

This year, we’re still hiring a bunch of software engineers. In the long run, though, hopefully your designers can get further along the stack by being able to take their Figmas and then have the first version running or three versions running. When product managers have an idea — it’s already happening inside Anthropic — they can prototype that first version using Claude Code.

In terms of the absolute number of engineers, it’s hard to predict, but hopefully it means we’re delivering more products and you expand your scope rather than just trying to ship the same thing a little bit faster. Shipping things faster is still bound by more human factors than just coding.

What would you say to someone who is evaluating a job between OpenAI and Anthropic?

Spend time with both teams. I think that the products are different. The internal cultures are quite different. I think there’s definitely a heavier emphasis on alignment and AI safety [at Anthropic], even if on the product side that manifests itself a little bit less than on the pure research side.

A thing that we have done well, and I really hope we preserve, is that it’s a very integrated culture without a lot of fiefdoms and silos. A thing I think we’ve done uniquely well is that there are research folks talking to product [teams] all the time. They welcome our product feedback to the research models. It still feels like one team, one company, and the challenge as we scale is keeping that.

Elsewhere

An AI industry vibe check: After meeting with a ton of folks in the AI industry at HumanX, it’s clear that everyone is becoming far less focused on the models themselves versus the actual products they power. On the consumer side, it’s true these products have been fairly underwhelming to date. At the same time, I was struck by how many companies are already having AI help them cut costs. In one case, an Amazon exec told me how an internal AI tool saved the company $250 million a year in costs. Other takeaways: everyone is wondering what will happen to Mistral, there’s a growing consensus that DeepSeek is de facto controlled by China, and the way a lot of AI data center buildouts are being financed sounds straight out of The Big Short.

Meta and the Streisand effect: If you hadn’t heard of the new Facebook insider book by Sarah Wynn-Williams before Meta started trying to kill it, you certainly have now. While the company may have successfully gotten an arbitrator to bar Wynn-Williams from promoting the book for now, its unusually aggressive pushback has ensured that a lot more people (including many Metamates) are now very eager to read it. I’m only a few chapters in, but I’d describe the text as Frances Haugen-esque with a heavy dose of Michael Wolff . It would certainly make the basis of an entertaining movie — a fact that I’m sure Meta’s leaders are quite worried about right now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>San Francisco has found a nice new revenue stream: Hitting self-driving Waymos with traffic citations. The city cited Waymo vehicles 589 times in 2024 for a grand total of $65,065 in penalties. The violations ranged from blocking street traffic to parking in prohibited areas. Google-owned Waymo operates 300 vehicles in San Francisco that are available to the public, meaning that they have received less than two tickets a day on average.

Waymo told TechCrunch that they are working on the citations, which can occur for various reasons, such as when the vehicles are waiting for their next customer and briefly park in an illegal zone. They also may sometimes stop in commercial loading zones to drop off customers.

Self-driving operators, including Waymo and the now-defunct Cruise, have been subject to criticism—and vandalism— over the years for causing minor incidents as their vehicles sometimes behave in perplexing ways, such as inexplicably driving a man in endless circles or speeding off from a traffic stop. Self-driving cars need to be trained on how to respond to every possible situation they might encounter, and sometimes they do not know how to react or succumb to edge cases. It puts into perspective just how much processing humans perform when driving and how humans are able to intuit the way fellow humans will behave in a way that a computer cannot.

Waymo said last year that its vehicles have been certified to respond correctly to emergency vehicles and law enforcement.

At the very least, disruptions by Waymo have generated some revenue for the city of San Francisco. The company has been on an aggressive expansion campaign in the past year, after opening access in Los Angeles last year and in Austin, Texas, this past week, with plans to enter other cities, including Miami, shortly. Waymo is also testing its cars in regions with inclement weather including Buffalo, New York.

Self-driving services like Waymo offer the promise to make everyone safer by taking drunk drivers off the road and correcting other human errors. Women have reported loving to use Waymo over Uber, as they do not have to ride with a stranger late at night. Some say self-driving vehicles will lead to more traffic on roads and highways, however, as people could work while they ride and live further from work, for instance. And people have reportedly been having sex in them, highlighting the challenge operators will face in keeping vehicles clean when there is not a driver. City dwellers are often against private passenger vehicles as they take up a lot of real estate that could be used for housing.

Elon Musk has gone all in on autonomy and robotics as vehicle sales collapse at Tesla. The company claims it will launch a robotaxi service in Austin by the end of 2025 and has been applying for testing permits in California. Tesla employs a different form of self-driving that relies solely on cameras and neural networks, while Waymo uses more expensive LiDAR sensors that it claims can respond to hazards faster and see through fog or rain. Waymo has proven the viability of its technology much sooner than Tesla, which proclaimed in 2016 that all of its vehicles would drive themselves within three to six months, or by sometime in 2017.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon is discontinuing a feature that allowed users of some of its Echo smart speakers to choose not to send their voice recordings to the cloud. According to an email the company sent to users that was posted on Reddit, it will disable the feature that allowed select Echos to process Alexa requests locally on the device on March 28th, 2025.

The move appears to be connected to the launch of its generative AI-powered Alexa Plus, slated for later this month (March 28th, perhaps?). The email states, “As we continue to expand Alexa’s capabilities with generative AI features that rely on the processing power of Amazon’s secure cloud, we have decided to no longer support this feature.”

Amazon confirmed the change in an email to The Verge. Spokesperson Lauren Raemhild provided the following statement: “The Alexa experience is designed to protect our customers’ privacy and keep their data secure, and that’s not changing. We’re focusing on the privacy tools and controls that our customers use most and work well with generative AI experiences that rely on the processing power of Amazon’s secure cloud. Customers can continue to choose from a robust set of tools and controls, including the option to not save their voice recordings at all. We’ll continue learning from customer feedback and building privacy features on their behalf.”



As she states, you’ll still be able to have Amazon delete voice recordings after they’ve been sent to the cloud. If you have “Do Not Send Voice Recordings” option turned on, it will default to the “Don’t save recordings” setting on March 28th. This means your recordings will be sent to and processed in the cloud and then deleted after Alexa deals with the request.

If you haven’t heard of this option, it’s not a surprise. Local processing of voice recordings was only available on three Echo devices – Echo Dot (4th Gen), Echo Show 10, and Echo Show 15 – and only for customers in the U.S. with devices set to English.

Still, it’s a shame the option is going away, as it was a feature many would have liked to see expanded to more devices, not taken away, especially for smart home users who may only use the voice assistant to turn their lights on or adjust their thermostat. But it seems Alexa’s future, and to be fair, most of its past, is all about the cloud.</p>

We still don’t know when those Apple Intelligence capabilities will arrive, and if a recent all-hands meeting is anything to go by, neither does Apple itself.

Bloomberg has the full scoop on what happened at a Siri team meeting led by senior director Robby Walker, who oversees the division. He called the delay an “ugly” situation and sympathized with employees who might be feeling burned out or frustrated by Apple’s decisions. He also reportedly said it’s not a given that the missing Siri features will make it into iOS 19 this year; that’s the company’s current target, but “doesn’t mean that we’re shipping then,” he told employees.

“We have other commitments across Apple to other projects,” Walker said, according to Bloomberg’s report. “We want to keep our commitments to those, and we understand those are now potentially more timeline-urgent than the features that have been deferred.”

The meeting also hinted at tension between Apple’s Siri unit and the marketing division. Walker said the communications team wanted to highlight features like Siri understanding personal context and being able to take action based on what’s currently on a user’s screen — even though they were nowhere near ready. Those WWDC teases and the resulting customer expectations only made matters worse, Walker acknowledged. Apple has since pulled an iPhone 16 ad that showcased the features and has added disclaimers to several areas of its website noting they’ve all been punted to a TBD date.

Apple has not publicly commented on the situation beyond last week’s statement, when it said the advanced Siri capabilities were “taking longer than expected.” But Walker told his staff that senior executives like software chief Craig Federighi and AI boss John Giannandrea are taking “intense personal accountability” for a predicament that’s drawing fierce criticism as the months pass by with little to show for it beyond a prettier Siri animation.

“Customers are not expecting only these new features but they also want a more fully rounded-out Siri,” Walker said. “We’re going to ship these features and more as soon as they are ready.”</p>

So soon after Specter Divide, a multiplayer shooter developed by Mountaintop Studios, announced its pending shut down which will take its studio with it, is yet another live-service game going offline. Today, Star Wars: Hunters developer Zynga announced the game will be sunset on October 1st.

Hunters is a class-based arena shooter featuring original characters (or at least they seem original, who knows with folks named Babu Frik running around) from throughout the Star Wars universe. It had a soft launch in select countries in 2021, but didn’t get a global launch on mobile and the Nintendo Switch until June 2024. This means that the game officially lived a scant 16 months before it inevitably goes offline. That short time though is downright luxurious considering Specter Divide lasted roughly six months before it will shut down sometime in the next 30 days.

The developers do have some parting gifts for players before the galaxy winks out on Star Wars: Hunters, though. The current season will be extended an additional three weeks and the game will still release a new hero April 15th. Then the developers will keep the ranked leaderboards running until the game shuts down in October.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It’s not exactly news that Luigi Mangione, the accused killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is a viral sensation. He’s been debated, lusted after, and idolized. There are even calls for Dave Franco to play him in a movie. However, in an age of populist rage, it appears that web platforms are increasingly cracking down on content associated with him, for fear that the widespread idolization may turn violent.

Slate recently noted that some forums on Reddit had been getting censored for their discussion of the accused killer. One long-running subreddit, /r/popculture, was reportedly “closed” by the platform after its mods failed to quell the ongoing discussion of Mangione. The action followed an unusual warning from the site’s safety team, RedditSafety, that stated that subreddits that violated content policies and upvoted “violent content” would receive a warning.

“Today we are rolling out a new (sort of) enforcement action across the site,” the alert read, noting that “starting today, users who, within a certain timeframe, upvote several pieces of content banned for violating our policies will begin to receive a warning.” It continued: “while this is currently ‘warn only,’ we will consider adding additional actions down the road.”

Not long afterward, /r/popculture, which apparently featured ongoing discussions of Mangione, posted a note claiming that one of its moderators had been suspended. “This sub has been placed in restricted mode and the main mod was suspended for approving comments that mentioned ‘luigi.’ Apparently saying ‘luigi’ is now against the rules too even though they never told us. All comments with the word ‘luigi’ get flagged as possible inciting violence,” the note read.

Yet, while users reported being blocked or censored for merely having mentioned Mangione’s name, Reddit claimed that the user who was suspended had allowed comments that advocated for violence:

“After publication, a Reddit spokesperson wrote to Slate that “one of the mods of r/popculture was suspended for approving a large number (at least 20) of comments containing direct calls for violence, including images celebrating Thomas Matthew Crooks and content calling to assassinate the president.” They added that “because r/popculture only had one remaining mod, we added Automod filters” to help filter reported posts and to flag “certain keywords.”

It’s worth noting that /r/popculture is still available and even includes a profile picture of Mangione as Jesus, so it’s not totally clear what the user meant when they said it had been “closed.” However, other subreddits that were devoted exclusively to Luigi content have been banned in recent days. A moderator for /r/FreeLuigi, another popular Mangione site, told Slate: “I remember r/LuigiMangione got banned, then r/LuigiMangione2, then r/LuigiMangione3, and I think it went up to r/LuigiMangione6 before people were like, ‘We’re not going to keep doing this’” …“I’d made one called r/LuigiFever, which was just photos of him, and that got banned too.”

A cursory perusal of Reddit shows that there are still a large number of Luigi-associated subreddits in operation. /r/FreeLuigi, which describes itself as a “community to discuss healthcare reform and related topics and keep up to date on the case involving Luigi Mangione,” is still up and has some 37,000 followers. Another subreddit, /r/SaintLuigiMangione, has a mere 2.3 thousand followers but describes itself as being dedicated to “the Rise of Class Consciousness” and “The Cause,” whatever that means. Subreddits hating on Mangione are also available, though they have substantially fewer members.

The moderator of /r/FreeLuigi told Slate: “No one in r/FreeLuigi wants anyone to get murdered, and no one is celebrating that a man died. There are obviously some crazy people on the internet who are. But an entire community of 30,000 people shouldn’t be punished for one person’s actions.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The team behind the delightfully chaotic recent run of Max’s Looney Tunes Cartoons led by director Pete Browngardt have pulled off a masterful bombastic feat—right under the nose of a real-life Judge Doom behind an exec desk—with the triumphant The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie.

Believe it or not the film is actually the legendary cartoon’s first fully animated theatrical feature, and it gives us its all in a sci-fi adventure comedy starring Daffy Duck and Porky Pig. Eric Bauza pulls double duty in a fantastic turn as the odd-couple duo; Candi Milo co-stars as Petunia Pig, a young flavor scientist who gets roped into finding out why aliens have suddenly decided to invade Earth. You’ll leave the film wanting more Petunia power and presence in the franchise.

The plot harkens back to those retro ’50s style invasion films like The Blob or Invasion of the Body Snatchers but with that slapstick Looney Tunes vibe. Here Daffy and Porky find themselves trying to keep their home while going through job after job that they’re just no good at. Right when they’re hired at a chewing gum factory, an extraterrestrial goo accidentally gets into the mass produced gum’s recipe—and soon threatens the world’s very existence. Suddenly, everyone who has chewed it becomes part of an alien hive mind except for Daffy, Porky, and Petunia. Together they team up to take on the threat to the planet in only the very silly ways you could imagine the Looney Tunes would pull.

As Looney Tunes fans will immediately notice, there’s no Bugs Bunny or Tweety here to carry the movie, and it’s all the better for it. Porky, Daffy, and Petunia are the heart of the film and offer proof that you can take any of the Looney Tunes from their concentric circle portal 2D world and they can star in their own vehicles. While other efforts within the franchise place the focus on the characters as CG versions of themselves alongside the distraction of celebrity or sports stars and product placements, that’s not the case here thankfully.

While the film follows a standard cinematic arc over the sketches the Tunes are known for, there’s plenty of gags that homage their style of classic comedy. That’s particularly seen in the absurdity of Farmer Jim, a fatherly character who apes the warm, deep-voiced kindly dads from that other studio’s animated fare; he exists in a flashback where he takes in Porky and Daffy. I don’t want to say more because it’s specifically a set up that works best visually. Seriously, that along with a few other gags really hit the spot in the film making The Day the Earth Blew Up a non-stop ride of delightful nonsense.

The Day the Earth Blew Up made me so nostalgic for those cartoon films we’ve been missing and you can see the love put in every frame by the Looney Tunes team. This version of the Tunes truly succeeds where The Looney Tunes Show (a series from the early 2010s that put the characters in suburbia) failed. Even though here we start with Daffy and Porky in a domestic setting, their familiar personalities have not been taken over by sitcom tropes or modern comedy sensibilities. Instead, they are true to their iconic archetypes—but they’re given the Bob Clampett treatment of being pushed from normal situational circumstances, like a lack of employment due to Daffy’s daftness and Porky’s shyness, and discovering their job is in fact to save the world by being who they are. And that’s what needed from these gold standard characters as they move into their next era of stories.

We hope Warner Bros. doesn’t forget that and it considers releasing Coyote vs. Acme. The live-action and animation hybrid film still sits on a shelf in a sort of purgatory where it hasn’t been deleted—but with no apparent plans to share it with audiences. And it’s such as shame as it was praised by filmmakers (including Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse‘s Lord and Miller) and insiders who got to see it during the period it was seemingly being shopped around. Fans were left feeling like there was no good reason for the studio to write off a perfectly good movie starring the WB’s global cartoon icons.

Perhaps the release of The Day the Earth Blew Up, a uniquely authentic, fully 2D animated Looney Tunes classic in the making, will remind audiences of the magic of the art style within the medium and make more room for it once more.

The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie is in theaters now.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple finally brought RCS messaging to iPhones with the release of iOS 18 in September of 2024. However, it wasn't perfect as end-to-end encryption wasn't available between iPhones and Android devices.

In December, the FBI warned Apple and Android users to avoid RCS messaging because of the missing encryption.

But that lack is finally going away thanks to a new RCS standard created by the GSM Association (GSMA). The industry group announced today that the new standard would include end-to-end encryption (E2EE) based on the Messaging Layer Security protocol.

"That means that RCS will be the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers," GSMA's technical director, Tom Van Pelt, wrote in the association's announcement.

EE2EE is a security feature that prevents third parties from viewing the content of your messages. Third parties can include network carriers or messaging providers.

Van Pelt noted that Apple and the GSMA had been working for years to get RCS on iPhones. The new standard was developed in collaboration with "mobile operators, device manufacturers, and technology providers," which includes Apple.

That note is important since some carriers around the globe don't support RCS messaging on their networks. Google has put in workarounds on Android devices.

While RCS messaging on iPhones has not supported E2EE until now, iMessage did support it between iPhones. When RCS landed on iPhones, there was no encryption, and only texts between Google Message users were getting encrypted.

Apparently, Apple will be adding E2EE RCS messaging to iOS, iPadOS, macOS and watchOS in future updates, though it's unclear what the timeline is for those updates.

Is this the end of the green bubble? Tom's Guide reached out to Apple for comment on the new standard and when we can expect to see it on iPhones.

"We’re excited to have this updated specification from GSMA and work as quickly as possible with the mobile ecosystem to implement and extend this important user protection to cross-platform RCS messaging," a spokesperson told The Verge.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pour one out for Google Assistant, the sometimes helpful but often frustrating digital assistant Google launched in 2016. In its place, users will encounter Gemini, the generative AI Google has been integrating into every product in its portfolio. Later this year, Google will make Gemini its only supported assistant, forcing most of its users to abandon Assistant once and for all.

The Gemini brand is barely a year old, but Google has moved aggressively to increase usage. When it released the Gemini app on Android, Google forced anyone who installed it to disable Assistant and switch to Gemini. It did this despite a plethora of missing features and the omnipresent issues of AI hallucinations. The company has forged ahead with Gemini's expansion in the intervening months, making Assistant's demise rather unsurprising.

Since Gemini's debut, users have had the option of sticking with the legacy assistant, but that's not going to be an option soon. On mobile devices, the upgrade path (if you want to call it that) is clear. Most newly released phones already ship with Gemini as the default, and Google will prompt any remaining Assistant users to get the Gemini app. When Assistant is put out to pasture later in 2025, Google will remove the app from app stores and direct users to Gemini instead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We’re an audiobook family at House Hutchinson, and at any given moment my wife or I are probably listening to one while puttering around. We've collected a bit over 300 of the things—mostly titles from web sources (including Amazon's Audible) and from older physical "books on tape" (most of which are actually on CDs). I don't mind doing the extra legwork of getting everything into files and then dragging-n-dropping those files into the Books app on my Mac, but my wife prefers to simply use Audible's app to play things directly—it's (sometimes) quick, it's (generally) easy, and it (occasionally) works.

But a while back, the Audible app stopped working for her. Tapping the app's "Library" button would just show a spinning loading icon, forever. All the usual troubleshooting (logging in and out in various ways, removing and reinstalling the app, other familiar rituals) yielded no results; some searching around on Google and DuckDuckGo led me to nothing except a lot of other people having the same problem and a whole lot of silence from Audible and Amazon.

So, having put in the effort to do things the "right" way and having that way fail, I changed tacks and fixed the problem, permanently, with Audiobookshelf.

Audiobookshelf

Audiobookshelf is a self-hosted audiobook and podcast server, and after two weeks of use, so far it works vastly better than trying to stream within Audible's app. My wife can now actually listen to audiobooks instead of staring at a spinning loading icon forever.

To get Audiobookshelf running, you need something to run it on—a spare desktop or other computer you're not using should fit the bill, as Audiobookshelf's requirements are relatively meager. You can either install it via a Docker image, or on bare metal on Windows or several different Linux distros. (The Linux distro installations include a repository for handling updates via your system's update method, so you won't have to be manually installing releases willy-nilly.)</p>

Jim Jordan, the Republican Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, upped his investigations into Big Tech by sending subpoenas to 16 major tech companies, asking whether the federal government had pressured them into using artificial intelligence to “censor lawful speech” – a new front in his long-running quest to prove the tech industry is out to silence conservatives.

Citing a report filed last December, in which the committee found several alleged examples of Biden officials “pressuring private companies to ‘advance equity,’ stop ‘algorithmic discrimination,’ and ‘mitigate the production of harmful and biased outputs,’” Jordan demanded they produce any and all emails with a third party, government or otherwise, between January 2020 and January 2025, “referring or relating to the moderation, deletion, suppression, restriction, or reduced circulation of the content, input, or output of an AI model, training dataset, algorithm, system, or product.”

The subpoenas are the latest move in the GOP’s long-running and innumerable investigations into whether tech companies were suppressing right-wing ideology on their platforms, and narrowed in on potential interference from the Biden administration over the past several years. But this inquiry is particularly vast: its broad request for any document that ever discussed AI content restrictions over the past five years, as well as its targeting of software companies that are not media platforms, such as Adobe, Nvidia and Palantir, represents the party’s escalation against the industry.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As if there was any doubt, we can go ahead and officially add climate change to the list of things that we can’t count on billionaires to figure out for us. According to the New York Times, Breakthrough Energy, a joint venture between Bill Gates and a handful of other billionaires who at least nominally care about the environment, is laying off a significant portion of its staff, which will likely neuter its capability to lobby and influence policy.

Now, on one hand, there’s some logic behind the shift in strategy for Breakthrough Energy, which was founded in 2015 and had its coffers filled with $1 billion worth of ammunition to pour into high-risk, high-reward climate solutions and innovations. The organization is slashing its policy staff—particularly in the United States—per the Times, reasoning that it’s unlikely they’ll be able to make much headway in shaping laws during the Trump administration.

That’s probably not a bad call, as Trump famously does not believe climate change is a real thing. He’s already reversed course on several major climate policies, is removing references to climate change from government documents and websites, and is trying to freeze climate-related spending from the Inflation Reduction Act. He’s also appointed Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and his whole thing seems to be trying to accelerate the conditions that would exacerbate climate change, so probably not a lot of opportunity for collaboration there.

But also…what are you gonna do with the money, Bill? You can’t take it with you when you’re gone. So, policy is a bit of a money pit right now. Start lobbying at the state level instead. Make inroads in municipalities where the political landscape is favorable, but fossil fuel interests are able to overwhelm them with dark money. Take Rhode Island, for example. Democrats have held all three branches of government for over a decade, but efforts to pass a carbon pricing law kept getting thwarted by massive lobbying efforts.

Plus, it’s not totally clear that there isn’t at least a narrow path to work with the Trump administration on something that could be a net positive when it comes to reducing carbon emissions. As Heatmap News points out, Breakthrough Energy was one of the few climate-conscious lobbying groups that did not discriminate against more controversial low-carbon energy production like nuclear power. Trump is reportedly interested in expanding nuclear power across the country.

On top of that, while Trump has made it clear that he intends to kill every bit of the Inflation Reduction Act as he possibly can—a bill that Gates and Breakthrough Energy lobbied hard for during the Biden administration—there’s actually some signs that Republicans may not want to give up the money the bill made available to their communities. Per Politico, at least 21 House Republicans signed a letter urging Trump not to kill off clean energy tax credits that have benefited their constituents. These are people who can potentially be tapped to solidify at least some pro-climate policies. You don’t get to dictate the playing field, but you can still find ways to play ball.

Instead, it appears Gates and company are just going to pull up stakes for the time being, giving up on policy and shifting spending efforts to funding startups and clean energy companies, according to the New York Times. That’s fine, obviously, there is plenty of room for the discovery of new and novel approaches to alternative energy production. But adoption still requires lobbying and policy efforts.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the best mostly invisible updates in iOS 18 was Apple's decision to finally implement the Rich Communications Services (RCS) communication protocol, something that is slowly helping to fix the generally miserable experience of texting non-iPhone users with an iPhone. The initial iOS 18 update brought RCS support to most major carriers in the US, and the upcoming iOS 18.4 update is turning it on for a bunch of smaller prepaid carriers like Google Fi and Mint Mobile.

Now that Apple is on board, iPhones and their users can also benefit from continued improvements to the RCS standard. And one major update was announced today: RCS will now support end-to-end encryption using the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol, a standard finalized by the Internet Engineering Task Force in 2023.

"RCS will be the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers," writes GSMA Technical Director Tom Van Pelt in the post announcing the updates. "Together with other unique security features such as SIM-based authentication, E2EE will provide RCS users with the highest level of privacy and security for stronger protection from scams, fraud and other security and privacy threats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A week after Apple admitted that its revamped Siri with onscreen awareness and context understanding would be delayed with a release in the “coming year,” Bloomberg‘s Mark Gurman reports that Apple’s senior director at Siri’s division, Robby Walker, had an all-hands meeting with his team, and said that delaying these key features has been “ugly” and “embarrassing.”

More interestingly, the report reveals that the company had nothing more than a video mock-up of these features, as it had “a barely working prototype” during the WWDC 2024 keynote. With that, the top Apple executive said in the meeting that it’s “unclear when the enhancement will actually launch.”

Gurman reports: “During the all-hands gathering, Walker suggested that employees on his team may be feeling angry, disappointed, burned out, and embarrassed after the features were postponed. The company had been racing to get the technology ready for this spring, but now the features aren’t expected until next year at the earliest, people familiar with the matter have said.”

What makes this crisis worse is that Apple heavily promoted features that were nowhere near launching, including an iPhone 16 ad highlighting the onscreen awareness of Siri, which has now been made private on YouTube.

Even though Gurman says Apple’s executives took “intense personal accountability” for this PR crisis, Apple doesn’t plan to “immediately fire any top executives,” although this could change at any time.

Still, the journalist reveals the situation isn’t as bad as it could be. The onscreen awareness of Siri would work two-thirds to 80% of the time. Still, the executives understood the percentage needed to be higher to actually be helpful to customers, so Apple decided to delay these features.

During the meeting, Walker showed staff a few ways the new Siri already works, such as locating his driver’s license number, finding specific photos of a child, and even manipulating apps precisely via voice control.

Still, this isn’t the only feature Apple is developing to overcome this AI crisis. The company wants to make Siri more conversational by 2027, even though it will require new infrastructure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Krafcik, the former CEO of the robotaxi company Waymo from 2015-2021, knows a thing or two about the driverless vehicle industry. And when he says that Tesla CEO Elon Musk might use some extremely shady tactics to fake the launch of his own robotaxi service this summer in Austin, Texas, people stand up and listen.

That’s exactly what’s happening in a new interview with Krafcik, which was published in the German magazine Manager and has trickled down through English-language blogs today. The interview has gotten attention in places like Electrek and Autopian, which explain how Musk’s stated goals for the Cybercab robotaxi don’t really match with the reality of making a safe business.

From Autopian’s English-language translation of Krafcik’s thoughts:

If a company were serious about building a safe robotaxi business, the robotaxi wouldn’t look anything like this prototype. A serious robotaxi would demonstrate the primacy of safety; the manufacturer would place sensors in optimal positions—on the roof, as well as on the sides and corners of the vehicle. These sensors would also have cleaning and drying functions—windshield wipers, compressed air nozzles, and so on. A serious robotaxi also wouldn’t have a low-slung coupe body design. This design makes it difficult for people to easily get in and out; not everyone will be able to use these robotaxi vehicles comfortably.

Some of these things were pointed out the time, when Musk held a glitzy unveiling at Warner Bros. movie studios in Burbank, California, back in October. If you’re going to release a robotaxi service, why make the vehicles so small, with just two seats? And how is this design safe in any way?

But the line from Krafcik that’s getting all the attention right now calls into question what kind of tricks Musk might try to pull. “There are many ways to fake a robotaxi service,” Krafcik is quoted as saying.

How could someone question Musk’s integrity when it comes to what he may unleash in Texas this summer? Well, the billionaire oligarch has stretched the truth before, including at the big event where Tesla’s Cybercab was previewed. You may recall that Musk’s event included many of his Optimus robots, something that he keeps suggesting are acting autonomously. The problem is that the robots at the event were actually being remotely controlled for the most part.

Musk has a long history of blurring the line between putting on a show and actually delivering a real product. Remember back in January 2024 when Musk posted a video of Optimus that pretended like his robots could fold a shirt? It was quite a development in a really short period of time. Except that it was fake. As you can see in the GIF below, there was someone just off-screen actually teleoperating the robot.

And it seems many people have even memory-holed Musk’s first “robot” demonstration in 2021 when he just brought up a person dancing in a skin-tight suit. The billionaire’s promises are often way ahead of what he can actually deliver.

Who knows what Musk will produce in June? As other sites like Autopian point out, Musk might just miss the promised deadline entirely. That wouldn’t be a huge surprise, especially since he’s incredibly busy right now dismantling the federal government. But we’ll have to wait and see what the wealthiest man in the world delivers.

As Electrek explains:

I do share Krafcik’s concerns about Tesla “faking” its robotaxi launch – although “faking” might not be exactly the correct term. It simply nowhere near what Musk has been promising Tesla customers for years, which is that their vehicles bought since 2016 would be self-driving without driver supervision.

There are robotaxi companies like Waymo that are currently operating, so it’s not like this is an impossible problem to solve. The question is whether Musk, specifically, can deliver on what he’s promised. And guys like Krafcik seem to be skeptical. So we’ll have to see.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We know Earth formed roughly 4.54 billion years ago and that the first single cell lifeforms were present roughly 1 billion years after that. What we don’t know is what triggered the process that turned our planet from a barren ball of rock into a world hosting amazing abundance of lifeforms. “We’re trying to understand how do you go from non-life to life. Now I think we have made a real contribution to solving this mystery,” says Richard Zare, a Stanford University chemistry professor. Zare is the senior author of the recent study into a previously unknown electrochemical process that might have helped supply the raw materials needed for life.

Zare’s team demonstrated the existence of micro-lightning, very small electricity discharges that occur between tiny droplets of water spray. When triggered in a mixture of gases made to replicate the atmosphere on early Earth, these micro-lightnings produced chemical compounds used by present-day life, like glycine, uracil, and urea, along with chemical precursors like cyanoacetylene, and hydrogen cyanide. “I’m not saying it’s the only way this could happen—I wasn’t there,” Zare acknowledged. “But it’s a new plausible mechanism that gives us building blocks of life.”

Lightning in the bulb

Scientific research into the beginnings of life on Earth started in the 1920s with Aleksander Oparin and J.B.S. Haldane, scientists who independently proposed that life on Earth could have arisen through a process of gradual chemical evolution. In their view, inorganic molecules might have reacted due to energy from the Sun or lightning strikes to form life’s building blocks, like amino acids. Those building blocks, Oparin and Haldane argued, could have accumulated in the oceans, making a “primordial soup.”

This Oparin-Haldane concept was tested by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey in a groundbreaking experiment conducted at the University of Chicago in 1953. “They took a glass bulb, and a spark plug like in a car,” Zare said. “They loaded the bulb with gases like methane, ammonia, water vapor, and they made a spark go through the bulb.” Miller and Urey found that this triggered the formation of glycine, hydrogen cyanide, alanine, and other building blocks of life. But there have been important objections to the Miller-Urey hypothesis, Zare acknowledges.</p>

Listen to me read this post here (not an AI-generated voice!), subscribe to the feed in your podcast app, or download the recording for later.

The visions of the open access movement have inspired countless people to contribute their work to the commons: a world where “every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge” (Wikimedia), and where “education, culture, and science are equitably shared as a means to benefit humanity” (Creative Commons ).

But there are scenarios that can introduce doubt for those who contribute to free and open projects like the Wikimedia projects, or who independently release their own works under free licenses. I call these “wait, no, not like that” moments.

When a passionate Wikipedian discovers their carefully researched article has been packaged into an e-book and sold on Amazon for someone else’s profit? Wait, no, not like that.

When a developer of an open source software project sees a multi-billion dollar tech company rely on their work without contributing anything back? Wait, no, not like that.

When a nature photographer discovers their freely licensed wildlife photo was used in an NFT collection minted on an environmentally destructive blockchain? Wait, no, not like that.

And perhaps most recently, when a person who publishes their work under a free license discovers that work has been used by tech mega-giants to train extractive, exploitative large language models? Wait, no, not like that.

These reactions are understandable. When we freely license our work, we do so in service of those goals: free and open access to knowledge and education. But when trillion dollar companies exploit that openness while giving nothing back, or when our work enables harmful or exploitative uses, it can feel like we've been naïve. The natural response is to try to regain control.

This is where many creators find themselves today, particularly in response to AI training. But the solutions they're reaching for — more restrictive licenses, paywalls, or not publishing at all — risk destroying the very commons they originally set out to build.

Citation Needed is an independent publication, entirely supported by readers like you. Consider is an independent publication, entirely supported by readers like you. Consider signing up for a free or pay-what-you-want subscription — it really helps me to keep doing this work.

The first impulse is often to try to tighten the licensing, maybe by switching away to something like the Creative Commons’ non-commercial (and thus, non-free) license. When NFTs enjoyed a moment of popularity in the early 2020s, some artists looked to Creative Commons in hopes that they might declare NFTs fundamentally incompatible with their free licenses (they didn’t1). The same thing happened again with the explosion of generative AI companies training models on CC-licensed works, and some were disappointed to see the group take the stance that, not only do CC licenses not prohibit AI training wholesale, AI training should be considered non-infringing by default from a copyright perspective.2

But the trouble with trying to continually narrow the definitions of “free” is that it is impossible to write a license that will perfectly prohibit each possibility that makes a person go “wait, no, not like that” while retaining the benefits of free and open access. If that is truly what a creator wants, then they are likely better served by a traditional, all rights reserved model in which any prospective reuser must individually negotiate terms with them; but this undermines the purpose of free, and restricts permitted reuse only to those with the time, means, and bargaining power to negotiate on a case by case basis.

Particularly with AI, there’s also no indication that tightening the license even works. We already know that major AI companies have been training their models on all rights reserved works in their ongoing efforts to ingest as much data as possible. Such training may prove to have been permissible in US courts under fair use, and it’s probably best that it does.3456

There’s also been an impulse by creators concerned about AI to dramatically limit how people can access their work. Some artists have decided it’s simply not worthwhile to maintain an online gallery of their work when that makes it easily accessible for AI training. Many have implemented restrictive content gates — paywalls, registration-walls, “are you a human”-walls, and similar — to try to fend off scrapers. This too closes off the commons, making it more challenging or expensive for those “every single human beings” described in open access manifestos to access the material that was originally intended to be common goods.

Often by trying to wall off those considered to be bad actors, people wall off the very people they intended to give access to. People who gate their work behind paywalls likely didn’t set out to create works that only the wealthy could access. People who implement registration walls probably didn’t intend for their work to only be available to those willing to put up with the risk of incessant email spam after they relinquish their personal information. People who try to stave off bots with CAPTCHAs asking “are you a human?” probably didn’t mean to limit their material only to abled people7 who are willing to abide ever more protracted and irritating riddles.8 And people using any of these strategies likely didn’t want people to struggle to even find their work in the first place after the paywalls and regwalls and anti-bot mechanisms thwarted search engine indexers or social media previews.

And frankly, if we want to create a world in which every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge, and where education, culture, and science are equitably shared as a means to benefit humanity, we should stop attempting to erect these walls. If a kid learns that carbon dioxide traps heat in Earth's atmosphere or how to calculate compound interest thanks to an editor’s work on a Wikipedia article, does it really matter if they learned it via ChatGPT or by asking Siri or from opening a browser and visiting Wikipedia.org?

Instead of worrying about “wait, not like that”, I think we need to reframe the conversation to “wait, not only like that” or “wait, not in ways that threaten open access itself”. The true threat from AI models training on open access material is not that more people may access knowledge thanks to new modalities. It’s that those models may stifle Wikipedia and other free knowledge repositories, benefiting from the labor, money, and care that goes into supporting them while also bleeding them dry. It’s that trillion dollar companies become the sole arbiters of access to knowledge after subsuming the painstaking work of those who made knowledge free to all, killing those projects in the process.

Irresponsible AI companies are already imposing huge loads on Wikimedia infrastructure, which is costly both from a pure bandwidth perspective, but also because it requires dedicated engineers to maintain and improve systems to handle the massive automated traffic. And AI companies that do not attribute their responses or otherwise provide any pointers back to Wikipedia prevent users from knowing where that material came from, and do not encourage those users to go visit Wikipedia, where they might then sign up as an editor, or donate after seeing a request for support. (This is most AI companies, by the way. Many AI “visionaries” seem perfectly content to promise that artificial superintelligence is just around the corner, but claim that attribution is somehow a permanently unsolvable problem.)

And while I rely on Wikipedia as an example here, the same goes for any website containing freely licensed material, where scraping benefits AI companies at often extreme cost to the content hosts. This isn't just about strain on one individual project, it's about the systematic dismantling of the infrastructure that makes open knowledge possible.

Anyone at an AI company who stops to think for half a second should be able to recognize they have a vampiric relationship with the commons. While they rely on these repositories for their sustenance, their adversarial and disrespectful relationships with creators reduce the incentives for anyone to make their work publicly available going forward (freely licensed or otherwise). They drain resources from maintainers of those common repositories often without any compensation. They reduce the visibility of the original sources, leaving people unaware that they can or should contribute towards maintaining such valuable projects. AI companies should want a thriving open access ecosystem, ensuring that the models they trained on Wikipedia in 2020 can be continually expanded and updated. Even if AI companies don’t care about the benefit to the common good, it shouldn’t be hard for them to understand that by bleeding these projects dry, they are destroying their own food supply.

And yet many AI companies seem to give very little thought to this, seemingly looking only at the months in front of them rather than operating on years-long timescales. (Though perhaps anyone who has observed AI companies’ activities more generally will be unsurprised to see that they do not act as though they believe their businesses will be sustainable on the order of years.)

It would be very wise for these companies to immediately begin prioritizing the ongoing health of the commons, so that they do not wind up strangling their golden goose. It would also be very wise for the rest of us to not rely on AI companies to suddenly, miraculously come to their senses or develop a conscience en masse.

Instead, we must ensure that mechanisms are in place to force AI companies to engage with these repositories on their creators' terms.

There are ways to do it: models like Wikimedia Enterprise, which welcomes AI companies to use Wikimedia-hosted data, but requires them to do so using paid, high-volume pipes to ensure that they do not clog up the system for everyone else and to make them financially support the extra load they’re placing on the project’s infrastructure. Creative Commons is experimenting with the idea of “preference signals” — a non-copyright-based model by which to communicate to AI companies and other entities the terms on which they may or may not reuse CC licensed work. Everyday people need to be given the tools — both legal and technical — to enforce their own preferences around how their works are used.

Some might argue that if AI companies are already ignoring copyright and training on all-rights-reserved works, they'll simply ignore these mechanisms too. But there's a crucial difference: rather than relying on murky copyright claims or threatening to expand copyright in ways that would ultimately harm creators, we can establish clear legal frameworks around consent and compensation that build on existing labor and contract law. Just as unions have successfully negotiated terms of use, ethical engagement, and fair compensation in the past, collective bargaining can help establish enforceable agreements between AI companies, those freely licensing their works, and communities maintaining open knowledge repositories. These agreements would cover not just financial compensation for infrastructure costs, but also requirements around attribution, ethical use, and reinvestment in the commons.

The future of free and open access isn't about saying “wait, not like that” — it’s about saying "yes, like that, but under fair terms”. With fair compensation for infrastructure costs. With attribution and avenues by which new people can discover and give back to the underlying commons. With deep respect for the communities that make the commons — and the tools that build off them — possible. Only then can we truly build that world where every single human being can freely share in the sum of all knowledge.

As I was writing this piece, I discovered that a SXSW panel featuring delegates from the Wikimedia Foundation and Creative Commons, titled “Openness Under Pressure: Navigating the Future of Open Access”, discussed some of the same topics. (I was, sadly, scheduled to speak at the same time and so was unable to attend in person). The audio recording is available online, and I would highly recommend giving it a listen if this is a topic that interests you!</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It’s been less than a year since iPhones were granted the ability to send messages to Green Bubbles unfettered, and only now is proper end-to-end encryption making an appearance. Better late than never. The GSM Association announced new specifications for RCS, requiring it to be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) based on a protocol called the Messaging Layer Security (MLS). The organization laid out the plan in a press release, citing the need to provide users with “the highest level of privacy and security.”

The new specifications will use RCS Universal Profile 3.0, a cross-platform encryption protocol that will make it easier for iPhones and Android devices to identify each other. The profile allows for richer deep linking, better audio codec for voice messaging between parties, and ease of unsubscribing from a subscription text thread. The protocol will continue to support the rest of the high-resolution messaging capabilities introduced in the initial rollout of the RCS protocol, including tap-backs, read receipts, typing indicators, group messaging, and the ability to send photos without dialing down the quality.

On Apple’s end, the company confirmed that it would support end-to-end encrypted RCS messaging and extend it to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates. “End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross-industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA,” Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer told The Verge. As for Google’s side of things, Android users already have E2EE between them by default for RCS texts.

What does all this mean? Messages you send to your Android brothers and sisters won’t hit Apple’s servers before they’re delivered. They’ll float on to where they’re supposed to go, encrypted in the tube. But remember to turn on Advanced Data Protection for your iCloud backups if you don’t want Apple peeking in on your conversations. Not that it would—maybe if you were subpoenaed for some reason—but we’re mainly speaking theoretically here. This option ensures all data that’s backed up to iCloud is encrypted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's Tesla is waving a red flag, warning that Donald Trump's trade war risks dooming US electric vehicle makers, triggering job losses, and hurting the economy.

In an unsigned letter to the US Trade Representative (USTR), Tesla cautioned that Trump's tariffs could increase costs of manufacturing EVs in the US and forecast that any retaliatory tariffs from other nations could spike costs of exports.

"Tesla supports a robust and thorough process" to "address unfair trade practices," but only those "which, in the process, do not inadvertently harm US companies," the letter said.

The carmaker recommended that the USTR—in its ongoing review of unfair trade practices and investigation into harms of non-reciprocal trade agreements—"consider the downstream impacts of certain proposed actions taken to address unfair trade practices."

According to Tesla, the current process to address unfair trade threatens to harm its more than 70,000 employees, and more broadly could trigger job losses and revenue dips in the US auto industry. It could also disrupt supply chains, as Tesla claims that even its best efforts prove it would be "impossible" to source all parts from the US currently.

"Even with aggressive localization of the supply chain, certain parts and components are difficult or impossible to source within the United States," the letter said, asking the USTR to "evaluate domestic supply chain limitations."

If left unchanged, the process could make the US less competitive in global auto markets, Tesla warned, recommending that the "USTR should investigate ways to avoid these pitfalls in future actions."

Moving forward, Tesla recommends that the USTR "take into account" how the trade war could hurt US exporters, as "US exporters are inherently exposed to disproportionate impacts when other countries respond to US trade actions."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you watched “The After Hours,” the latest episode of Severance, and you’re a fan of The Twilight Zone, you might have caught some parallels to an episode of that series with the exact same title. Even before this week’s Severance aired, an eagle-eyed viewer on X (props to you, seriously) took note of the similarity and advised watching “The After Hours,” the Twilight Zone episode, as a preamble.

And that vintage slice of existential dread is indeed a very cool companion piece. You can tell the creators of Severance, who have no doubt looked to The Twilight Zone as inspiration all along, took some specific cues from Rod Serling and company on this one. With the recent reveal that a different Twilight Zone episode helped shaped Ryan Coogler’s upcoming horror film Sinners—and really, just the exceedingly strange era we’re living in—it’s a good reminder that it’s never a bad time to keep The Twilight Zone (streaming on Paramount+) in regular rotation.

Spoilers for 2025’s “The After Hours” and 1960’s “The After Hours” follow.

In the Severance episode “The After Hours,” Ms. Cobel must speak to a skeptical security guard to get Devon (and Mark, who’s hiding in the back) access to a compound containing a cabin that’ll allow Mark’s innie consciousness to awaken outside of Lumon. It’s a very odd exchange:

Cobel: “We’re going to cottage five.”

Guard: “I don’t have anyone scheduled.”

Cobel: “She’s one of Jame’s. No one’s to know… Miss Marsha White, ninth floor.”

Guard: “Specialties Department.”

Cobel: “I’m looking for a gold thimble.”

That does the trick and Cobel, Devon, and the hidden Mark drive through. While many Severance viewers likely first seized upon what “she’s one of Jame’s” could mean (lots of theories, all of them icky), it’s the latter part of the exchange we’ll be focusing on here. Anyone who stopped by another dimension on the way to Kier will recognize the lines almost verbatim from The Twilight Zone‘s “After Hours.”

First airing late in the show’s freshman season, on June 10, 1960, “The After Hours” stars Anne Francis (familiar to sci-fi fans for her memorable turn in 1956’s Forbidden Planet) as a woman who strides into a bustling department store looking to buy a gold thimble as a present for her mother. The narration eases us in as she heads to one of the store’s elevators: “Express elevator to the ninth floor of a department store, carrying Miss Marsha White on a most prosaic, ordinary, run-of-the-mill errand.”

The elevator dial indicates that the car only goes up to the eighth floor, and then the roof, but sure enough, the operator takes Marsha—the only passenger, despite the otherwise crowded store—to the ninth floor, which is strangely deserted aside from one odd saleswoman who is selling… gold thimbles.

The narration continues, as do the Severance parallels: “Miss Marsha White on the ninth floor, specialties department, looking for a gold thimble. The odds are that she’ll find it—but there are even better odds that she’ll find something else, because this isn’t just a department store. This happens to be The Twilight Zone.”

After making her purchase, Marsha’s back on the elevator before she realizes the thimble is damaged; it’s scratched and dented and no way is she going to give it to her mom as a gift in that condition. The store managers are perplexed when she describes shopping on the ninth floor. The store has no ninth floor! That would be alarming enough already, but then she spots the peculiar sales clerk who sold her the thimble… and realizes the woman is actually a mannequin.

The shock is enough for her to pass out, and when she wakes up, it’s “The After Hours” in the store. Nobody is there, except the mannequins, who start moving around and calling out to Marsha. It’s probably one of the scariest Twilight Zone sequences of all time, and is certainly up there with horror movies like House of Wax and Tourist Trap and possibly even the rom-com Mannequin as nightmare fodder for anyone with an unnatural fear of you-know-whats.

The twist, as there must be a twist, is that Marsha herself is a mannequin, and—during a brief period of freedom in which she’s allowed to come alive—she’s forgotten who she really is. She’s back in her frozen state by the end, complete with a mannequin eerily crafted to look just like Francis.

“Marsha White, in her normal and natural state, a wooden lady with a painted face who, one month out of the year, takes on the characteristics of someone as normal and as flesh and blood as you and I,” Serling explains in his episode-ending narration. “But it makes you wonder, doesn’t it, just how normal are we? Just who are the people we nod our hellos to as we pass on the street? A rather good question to ask—particularly in The Twilight Zone.”

Fastidious detectives might look deeper into “The After Hours” to find more Severance clues (we do have some nagging suspicions that Lumon PR flack Natalie might be a wooden lady come to life), but it seems more likely that Severance‘s “The After Hours” is echoing themes more than actual plot details here.

The Severance dialogue feels deliberately nonsensical in Cobel’s exchange with the security guard—almost like they’re speaking in code. Rather than it being an in-universe Twilight Zone reference (do Lumon employees watch The Twilight Zone in their free time?), it’s more like a wink at the audience acknowledging this clever echo. After Marsha realizes who she is, a fellow mannequin scolds her for forgetting who she really is during her time with “the outsiders.” They are “the real people.” The outies, if you will.

And Lumon’s severed employees are indeed similar to these store mannequins: they’re allowed to come alive under certain controlled circumstances, and they must also endure being reminded that they’re not really human. Though these two episodes titled “The After Hours” are couched in separate contexts, they nevertheless feel very in concert with each other.

Or maybe, who knows, there are also mannequins that come to life roaming Lumon’s halls. We’ve certainly seen some freaky stuff happen in that office.

If you’re like us, diving down this particular Severance rabbit hole now makes you wonder what other Easter eggs and references you’ve been overlooking this entire time. If you’ve found any particularly exciting ones, please share them in the comments!

You can stream The Twilight Zone on Paramount+; Severance streams on Apple TV+.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new M4-powered MacBook Air only hit stores on March 12, but it’s already on sale. You can pick up the 13-inch entry-level configuration with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage for $949 ($50 off) at Amazon (at checkout) and Best Buy if you’re a My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total member. The 15-inch base model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is also on sale for $1,049 ($50 off) at Amazon and Best Buy for My Best Buy Plus or Total members.

Even at full price, Apple’s new entry-level laptop offers a lot of value. It’s cheaper yet more capable than its predecessor, offering faster performance courtesy of Apple’s latest M4 chip. It also boasts double the base RAM at 16GB along with the MacBook Pro’s 12MP Center Stage webcam, which is sharper and offers a wider field of view. The M4 chip also allows you to connect two external monitors with the lid still open.

There’s a new skylight blue option, but otherwise the new Air shares the same thin and sleek design as its predecessor, along with all-day battery life and Wi-Fi 6E support. There are some tiny differences if you move up to the larger display, but not much. The 15-inch model continues to offer a six-speaker system over the 13-inch model’s four speakers, for example.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>La manifestazione del 15 marzo “Una Piazza per l’Europa" è un momento cruciale per abbattere i tabù sulla difesa europea. Bisogna esserci. Costruire capacità di difesa comuni non è bellicismo, è un passo necessario per la stabilità internazionale e verso un’Europa più unita e forte dentro e fuori i suoi confini. L’opinione pubblica deve partecipare a questa fase, dobbiamo assicurarci che questa forza si sviluppi nel rispetto dei nostri valori fondamentali e dei diritti umani. Per questo è cruciale che si parli di difesa senza fomentare paure e populismo.

Il conflitto in Ucraina e le tensioni geopolitiche globali hanno accelerato la necessità di una difesa europea più autonoma e tecnologicamente avanzata. L’Unione europea ha avviato i primi passi importanti in questa direzione, con la nomina di un Commissario per la Difesa e lo Spazio e la predisposizione di un white paper sul futuro della difesa europea, e con i fondi Rearm Europe. C’è ancora molto da fare. Manca ancora un dibattito pubblico costruttivo su questi temi che contribuisca a definire i prossimi passaggi.

Io credo che l’orrore della guerra in Ucraina c’imponga di costruire una difesa europea, proprio per evitare altri orrori. Davanti alla necessità della difesa non possiamo girarci dall’altra parte o cercare la sabbia per nascondere la testa. Ma dobbiamo anche essere consapevoli che la difesa è la cartina di tornasole dei valori delle nostre società: una democrazia che si difende senza rispettare i diritti umani e i principi delle leggi umanitarie internazionali non è davvero tale. L’Europa deve costruire la sua difesa, ma deve farlo nel pieno rispetto dei suoi valori fondamentali. Questo richiede una governance attenta.

Oggi la difesa si sta trasformando digitalizzandosi. L’accelerazione dell’innovazione nel settore della difesa passa sempre più attraverso l’intelligenza artificiale, la cybersecurity e l’uso strategico dei big data. Senza un adeguato controllo e senza regolamentazioni rigorose, queste tecnologie rischiano di violare più che difendere i diritti umani e valori democratici. Per evitare questo rischio serve un dibattito e uno sforzo serio sulla governance del digitale e della difesa in Europa, un dibattito che deve vedere i cittadini protagonisti.

L’Unione Europea si trova oggi ad affrontare due sfide cruciali e connesse: colmare il divario con altre potenze globali nel settore della difesa e del digitale. Deve vincere entrambe le sfide senza cedere alla deregolamentazione indiscriminata che potrebbe compromettere la sicurezza e i valori democratici. L’innovazione non fiorisce nel vuoto normativo. Una governance agile dal punto di vista burocratico e attenta ai rischi etici e sociali rafforza l’affidabilità della tecnologia favorendone l’adozione e quindi il mercato. Allo stesso tempo, una difesa sviluppata nel rispetto di principi e diritti fondamentali europei sarà una garanzia più forte di stabilità.

Non dobbiamo scegliere tra difesa e democrazia; tra Europa e guerra; tra innovazione e diritti; tra crescita e responsabilità. Dobbiamo cercare degli equilibri, perseguire insieme un approccio che coniughi sviluppo tecnologico e responsabilità etica, che rafforzi la postura internazionale dell’Europa per salvaguardare la stabilità internazionale e continuare a far crescere i valori di cui questo continente e l’Unione Europea si fanno portatori. Per questo bisogna esserci domani di persona o con queste parole nel mio caso.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Space can be an unforgiving place. Last week, a lunar lander skidded across the surface of the Moon and ended up in a cold, dark crater, ending its mission before it began. Now, details newly revealed by Houston-based aerospace company Intuitive Machines relay its Athena lander’s final moments and how the spacecraft briefly sputtered to life after powering down.

Athena touched down on the lunar surface on Thursday, March 6, following a week-long journey to the Moon. The lander ended up on its side in a shallow crater in the Moon’s Mons Mouton region, 820 feet (250 meters) from its targeted landing site. Less than a day after its touchdown, Athena was declared dead. But now, Intuitive Machines CEO Steve Altemus has revealed that the company’s lunar lander wasn’t dead on arrival, and that the “mission pressed forward” before its untimely end.

Intuitive Machines also released a 360-degree image of Athena’s descent that was stitched together using the lander’s four on-board cameras.

On its way down to the Moon, Athena’s altimeter failed, meaning that the lander couldn’t measure how far it was from the lunar surface. As a result, the lander hit a lunar plateau, toppled over, and skidded its way across the surface before ending up in a small crater, according to Ars Technica. While sliding across the jagged terrain of the Moon’s south pole, the lander kicked up dust from the surface, some of which ended up on its solar panels. In addition to the lander being on its side, the dust meant there would be little chance Athena could use its solar panels for power.

The lander was packed with NASA science tools and instruments as part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) program. Immediately after touchdown, the team accelerated payload operations, transmitting precious data before Athena’s batteries completely depleted, according to Altemus. “In just 12 hours of surface operations, we gathered extraordinarily valuable data for our customers,” he wrote in his statement.

This is Intuitive Machines’ second trip to the Moon, and the second time its lander ended up in an unfortunate position.The company launched its first lunar lander, Odysseus, in February 2024. Odysseus managed to reach the lunar surface, but its landing wasn’t so smooth either. One of the lander’s legs may have gotten caught during its descent, causing it to tip over on its side and end up lying sideways on a rock. The mission did operate for seven days on the lunar surface, and the Intuitive Machines thus became the first company to land a private lander on the Moon.

Athena wasn’t as lucky, but it did have some parting words for its team. “In the mission’s final moments, Athena powered down. But unexpectedly, the lander woke up one last time, sending a transmission that resonated beyond technology—it was personal,” Altemus wrote. “Athena’s last data transmission contained the names of every Intuitive Machines team member who made her mission possible.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The RCS messaging standard that enables richer communications between iPhone and Android users, will soon benefit from a critical security feature.

Conversations using the Rich Communications Services (RCS) texting option Apple finally moved to allow last year after literal years of pressure will soon benefit from end-to-end encryption.

Previously, Apple’s own iMessages platform had benefitted from end-to-end encryption and so did Google’s RCS-based Messaging app. However right now conversations between Android and iPhone users via RCS are not protected by the industry standard feature that keeps out prying eyes.

That’ll soon change with the publication of the GSMA RCS Universal Profile 3.0 specifications, which Apple and Google have both signed off on, earlier this week.

“The major step forward covered by this latest version is that it includes the requirements and experience for the end-to-end encryption of RCS Messages, Files and other user provided content have been defined,” the description reads.

“This includes not only the encryption itself and the controls that users would have over that, but also side-effects such as the need for improved client-side spam detection and handling.”

Apple confirmed it is on board in a statement provided to 9to5Mac. It read: “End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA. We will add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates.”

Google itself added, in a statement to The Verge: “We’re excited to have this updated specification from GSMA and work as quickly as possible with the mobile ecosystem to implement and extend this important user protection to cross-platform RCS messaging.”

After Apple adopted RCS to replace the traditional and ancient SMS platform for iPhone-to-Android messaging in iOS 18, users have been able to benefit from more modern features in their chats across platforms. There are high resolution images and videos, read receipts, delivery confirmations, live typing indicators, tap back reactions and more.

Soon, all of that can be achieved with the extra layer of security, that even Apple or Google can’t decrypt. It’s great news for users of the best iPhones and best Android phones.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As he consolidates control over Relativity Space, new owner and chief executive Eric Schmidt is planning significant changes at the launch company, including a likely move to the Lone Star State.

Schmidt's recent acquisition of the California-based company, which has largely evolved away from its 3D-printing origins to becoming a more conventional rocket developer, has solved Relativity's primary need. The company has been in a cash crunch for months, and being acquired by one of the 50 wealthiest people on the planet provides financial stability.

One source said Schmidt has made a "mega" investment in Relativity, but the company has not publicly stated the size. It is likely to be at least $1 billion, if not more. Schmidt is also taking an active hand in operations.

Undertaking his first CEO role in more than a decade since leaving Google, Schmidt is said to be going all in on setting Relativity on a sustainable path. The company faces several major challenges as it seeks to bring the Terran R rocket to market, particularly in logistics.

This is because Terran R is a large launch vehicle, essentially the bigger cousin to the Falcon 9 rocket. The Terran R vehicle has a diameter—17 feet, 9 inches compared to the Falcon 9's 12-foot diameter—which makes it too large to move across the country by highway.

Big rocket, big logistics

As Ars reported last September, the company's initial plan was to manufacture first stages at its massive factory in Long Beach, California, and ship them through the Panama Canal to a test site at the Stennis Space Center in southern Mississippi. From there, they would be moved by barge again to the launch site in Florida. The total shipping cost to get a first stage to Florida and a barge back to Long Beach was at one point estimated to be as high as $3.45 million.

However, two sources have indicated that Relativity Space will likely move a significant portion of its Terran R manufacturing to Baytown, Texas. This is a small city just east of Houston that, as its name suggests, is located on a bay. In the Houston metro area, Baytown is known for its ample petrochemical facilities, located on the Houston Ship Channel, which offers easy access to Galveston Bay and ultimately the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

Google is finally moving on from Google Assistant.

The company will be upgrading “more” users from Google Assistant to Gemini “over the coming months,” according to a blog post. The classic Google Assistant “will no longer be accessible on most mobile devices or available for new downloads on mobile app stores” at some point “later this year.” (9to5Google reports that phones running Android 9 or earlier and without at least 2GB of RAM will still be able to use the classic Assistant.)

“Additionally, we’ll be upgrading tablets, cars and devices that connect to your phone, such as headphones and watches, to Gemini,” Google says. “We’re also bringing a new experience, powered by Gemini, to home devices like speakers, displays and TVs.”

The company says it will share more details “in the next few months.” (I would guess that Google will announce information around that new experience at Google I/O in May.) In the meantime, “Google Assistant will continue to operate on these devices,” according to Google.

Google initially launched Google Assistant in 2016. Now, though, Gemini has become the catch-all branding for many of Google’s AI and assistant-like efforts, so it’s not too surprising that the company is officially retiring Google Assistant.

Update, March 14th: Added details from 9to5Google.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the internet hangs onto every casting announcement for the Marvel Cinematic Universe for narrative speculation, it turns out the truth behind who gets to be in the next big tentpole might be a little less exciting.

In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, the Russo Brothers (Electric State) discussed going back to the drawing board with Marvel to work on the next two Avengers films, Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, which will feature former Iron Man Robert Downey Jr. turning heel to play Doctor Doom.

This isn’t the first time they’ve done something this risky with the franchise’s leading star. Joe Russo recalled approaching Downey, at the time still leading the MCU as Iron Man, to be the bad guy in Captain America: Civil War —”a movie that wasn’t even titled after his character. And it was the pitch of our lives. And he said, ‘Yes, let’s do it.’ He liked the risk, to Robert’s credit, and that choice led the explosive upside to Infinity War and Endgame.”

In the past, the Russos famously kept a set of baseball-style cards featuring their superhero cast, to help keep track of the number of films they’re contracted to be in. THR asked the duo if they still use them. “Yes, we continue to use the baseball cards,” Anthony Russo shared. The method helps shape whichever Marvel film they’re working on.

Joe added, “Now they have magnets on them so we can put ‘em on a board and look at ‘em. It’s the only way to keep track of the amount of characters that we’re working with.”

It’s beginning to sound more like a budget spreadsheet rather than anything related to crafting a story, but Anthony downplayed that aspect. “And as far as how do we look at who’s in the movies, it’s just a long creative process of exploring where we want to take the story. What is the most surprising and exciting area for us to push into, and which characters help us in that effort?”

But the stars’ contracts and financial stats obviously still play a role; if they didn’t, why use the baseball cards? As the next behemoth of a Marvel movie cross-over looms, more cards have been aded to the deck, with The Fantastic Four: First Steps coming out this summer. So, will the Russos have more star players on deck? Or have people moved on from stuffed line-ups of characters overpowering the movie’s story? Pulling the same card trick on a bigger scale is a gamble but we’ll see if it pays off come 2026 with the release of Avengers: Doomsday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tesla has a real image problem. Once, it was the beloved brand for the environmentally aware car buyer; more than that, it was the hottest thing in town. Hundreds of thousands of fans paid thousand-dollar deposits and then waited for up to two years for a chance to buy a Model 3, with others paying hefty markups to people at the front of the queue. Back then, of course, Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed to care about climate change—now he seems more likely to be found helping to undo work on climate change.

That has hurt Tesla's new car sales, which have cratered in Europe and declined to a lesser degree in China (where Musk's political activities have less bearing, and decline is more stiff competition from local brands and the lack of a real model range). It has dented the reality-distortion field that surrounds the company's share price, if perhaps only to where it was six months ago. And it has also affected the prices of used Teslas here in the US.

Being a Tesla driver is starting to carry some stigma, and owners are unused to the opprobrium they are now facing for their choice of electric vehicle. "Two weeks ago, I was called a Nazi in the parking lot at Kroger," one owner told The New York Times. The YouTuber Vegas Tesla Family just posted a video explaining that he was selling his Tesla "because of Elon Musk." And more than one Ars commenter has sold their Tesla in recent weeks as a direct result of Musk.

But a car is usually the second-most expensive purchase a person will make, and many Tesla owners are in no position to suddenly sell their cars just because they find the man who makes them politically unpalatable—even if the cars continue to depreciate faster and faster. Hopefully no one actually took Musk at his word when he claimed that his cars would become appreciating assets.</p>

Reddit is going rolling out a feature that lets you hide an ad from your feed for “at least a year,” the company says in a post spotted by Ars Technica.

When the update is available to you, you’ll be able to see the “Hide” option for “any ads that appear in feeds, such as your home or subreddit feed,” Reddit says.

The option looks like an eye with a line through it, as shown in a screenshot. When an ad becomes visible again after you hide it, you can re-hide it if you’d like, according to the company.

Reddit says it’s rolling out the update this week that ads the feature and that it will “gradually become available across iOS, Android, and www.reddit.com over the next several weeks.”

Last year, Reddit added filters that let users limit ads from “sensitive” categories like alcohol, dating, gambling, and politics and activism.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With measles declared eliminated from the US in 2000 and national herd immunity strong, health experts have recommended that American children get two doses of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine—the first between the ages of 12 and 15 months and the second between the ages of 4 and 6 years, before they start school.

Before 12 months, vulnerable infants in the US have been protected in part by maternal antibodies early in infancy as well as the immunity of the people surrounding them. But if they travel to a place where population immunity is unreliable, experts recommend that infants ages 6 to 11 months get an early dose—then follow it up with the standard two doses at the standard times, bringing the total to three doses.

The reason they would need three—and the reason experts typically recommend waiting until 12 months—is because the maternal antibodies infants carry can interfere with the vaccine response, preventing the immune system from mounting long-lasting protection. Still, the early dose provides boosted protection in that 6-to-11-month interval.

In the past, this early, extra dose was recommended for infants traveling internationally—to countries that hadn't achieved America's enviable level of herd immunity and were vulnerable to outbreaks. But now, with US vaccination rates slipping, herd immunity becoming spotty, cases rising by the day, and outbreaks simmering in multiple states, the US is no longer different from far-off places that struggle with the extremely infectious virus.

In an article published today in JAMA, prominent health experts—including former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky—call for the US to update its MMR recommendations to include the early, extra dose for infants who are not only traveling abroad, but domestically, to any areas where measles is a concern.

"With some local immunization levels inadequate to avert outbreaks and ongoing disease spread in various regions of the country, a dichotomy between domestic and international travel is not appropriate," the experts write. "For many travel itineraries, there may even be a higher risk of measles exposure at the US point of departure than at the international destinations."

Vaccinating at-risk infants early is critical to their own health—as well as the people around them, the experts note. "[I]nfants younger than one year face a heightened risk of severe measles-related complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. Younger infants are also at increased risk of developing subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare measles complication that has a high fatality rate and may surface years after initial infection," according to the experts.</p>

A federal judge has once again blocked California’s landmark online child safety law from taking effect. In a ruling on Thursday, US District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman granted a preliminary injunction in favor of NetChoice, saying the technology trade group’s claims that the law violates the First Amendment would likely succeed.

The law, called the California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act (CAADCA), was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom in 2022 and covered online platforms “likely” to be accessed by children. Along with restricting the use of dark patterns, the law would require these platforms to estimate the age of users and apply specific privacy settings for children. NetChoice argued that its requirements are too vague, as it asked platforms to make “subjective” decisions about content and could have a chilling effect on free speech.

Judge Labson Freeman previously blocked CAADCA in 2023, a ruling the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals partially upheld last year. As noted by Courthouse News, the ruling later returned to Judge Labson Freeman to make a decision on the remaining parts of the law. NetChoice said this decision will block the “entirety” of CAADCA.

“Even if the Court were to accept that the Act advances a compelling State interest in protecting the privacy and well-being of children, the State has not shown that the CAADCA is narrowly tailored to serve that interest,” Judge Labson Freeman writes. “The Act applies to all online content likely to be accessed by consumers under the age of 18, and imposes significant burdens on the providers of that content.”

NetChoice, which represents companies like Meta, Netflix, X, and Amazon, has won several requests to block child safety laws in states across the US. It recently sued to block Maryland’s Kids Code law, which would prevent kids from accessing inappropriate content online.

“While protecting children online is a goal we all share, California’s Speech Code is a trojan horse for censoring constitutionally protected but politically disfavored speech,” Chris Marchese, NetChoice’s director of litigation, said in a press release. “This decision puts other states on notice that censorship regimes masquerading as ‘privacy protections’ will not survive judicial review.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>RCS 3.0 was officially unveiled by the GSMA, an association representing mobile network operators. On the face of it, it’s fairly boring news. However, this one is special because it’ll finally fix RCS messaging between Android and iOS users.

When Apple added RCS support to iOS 18, the company used an older version of the protocol. This caused chat messages between iPhone and Android users to be unencrypted. Fortunately, Apple has already agreed to update to the latest RCS protocol, thereby permanently fixing the issue.

“End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA,” an Apple spokesperson told The Verge . “We will add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates.”

Google also confirmed to The Verge that it would support the new standard, making it the first time both Apple and Google did so at the same time. Google said it would work as quickly as possible to include it with Android.

The good news doesn’t stop there. RCS 3.0 also includes a handful of other useful privacy features. It’ll include end-to-end encryption (E2EE) based on the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol. All these big, fancy words mean that text messages, images, and other file types will be encrypted before sending it over the network and can only be encrypted by the device receiving the message. In short, no one will get to see what you sent except the person receiving the message.

Of course, you’ll need to use the proper messaging apps. In this case, it would be Apple iMessage and Google Messages . Third party texting apps typically don’t support RCS at all right now, although that may change someday.

RCS 3.0 also includes improvements that make it easier for people to engage with businesses and chatbots, a boon in an era where businesses and scammers alike are using AI chatbots .

As a word of warning, the RCS protocol hasn’t left store shelves yet, metaphorically speaking. Currently, messages between Android and iOS users remain unencrypted until both companies can get it rolled out. There isn’t yet a firm date for that rollout.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Je suis devenu un adepte de la recharge sans fil. Pourquoi ? Parce qu'il est plus rapide, facile et pratique de placer mon iPhone sur un socle de chargement que de chercher un câble. Surtout dans l'obscurité. Cependant, la recharge sans fil présente des inconvénients, notamment la chaleur du processus. Et cette chaleur peut entraîner une dégradation de la durée de vie de la batterie.

Certains fabricants tentent d'atténuer ce problème en ajoutant un ventilateur au socle de charge sans fil. Bien que cette approche contribue à dissiper la chaleur, son efficacité peut diminuer par temps chaud. En outre, l'utilisation d'un étui peut poser problème, car il réduit l'efficacité de la charge et emprisonne la chaleur.

Torras a donc mis au point un chargeur sans fil qui résout ces problèmes de chaleur.

Les trois points essentiels à retenir du chargeur sans fil Torras PolarCircle Qi2

Le système de refroidissement du chargeur sans fil Torras PolarCircle Qi2 est plus efficace qu'un simple ventilateur.

Ce ventilateur est presque silencieux.

L'appareil consomme plus d'énergie qu'un chargeur sans fil standard.

Le chargeur se fixe magnétiquement à l'arrière de l'iPhone avec une force de serrage de 11 newtons. Et dès qu'il est branché, il fonctionne, que ce soit pour un iPhone ou un smartphone Android, ou des AirPod.

L'expérience est très rafraîchissante. Au sens figuré comme au sens propre. Si vous retirez le chargeur d'un smartphone pendant qu'il fonctionne, vous pouvez sentir le froid sur la face du pad. J'ai mesuré la mienne à environ 6°C, ce qui est étonnamment froid au toucher. Le ventilateur, essentiel à la technologie thermoélectrique de refroidissement utilisée, est presque imperceptible. Je peux l'entendre si je mets le chargeur près de mon oreille. Mais je n'entends rien lorsqu'il fonctionne à côté de mon lit la nuit.

Le chargeur sert également de support

Un bouton situé sur le côté du Torras PolarCircle Qi2 permet de désactiver le refroidissement lorsqu'il n'est pas nécessaire. Le chargeur fonctionne sur port USB-C qui nécessite une alimentation d'au moins 30 W.

L'appareil est fourni avec un câble USB-C vers USB-C d'environ 1,5 m de long et de qualité satisfaisante.

Le chargeur sert également de support, avec un anneau articulé qui permet de maintenir le téléphone à un angle de vision pratique, une autre bonne idée de Torras.

Il lui faut plus d'énergie qu'un chargeur sans fil classique de 15 W

Mais il faut prendre en compte que ce chargeur nécessite plus d'énergie qu'un chargeur sans fil classique de 15 W. Attention à l'utilisation du chargeur à partir d'une batterie externe par exemple

Cependant, je pense que cet appareil est un excellent chargeur sans fil polyvalent qui élimine les problèmes de surchauffe, et qu'il plaira également aux gamers.

Par expérience, je sais à quel point un smartphone peut chauffer lorsqu'on joue.

Les conseils d'achat pour le chargeur sans fil Torras PolarCircle Qi2

Au prix de 47 €, le Torras PolarCircle Qi2 est devenu l'un de mes accessoires préférés. Même sans la fonction de refroidissement, c'est un excellent chargeur portable.

Mais sa capacité de refroidissement l'élève à un autre niveau. J'ai testé plusieurs chargeurs sans fil dotés de ventilateurs de refroidissement intégrés et, bien qu'ils soient meilleurs que ceux qui en sont dépourvus, l'effet de refroidissement était minime.

Le refroidissement thermoélectrique ajoute un refroidissement actif, ce qui fait une énorme différence.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A lawyer in Argentina has asked Interpol to issue a “Red Notice” for the arrest of Hayden Mark Davis, a U.S. citizen who designed $LIBRA memecoin. Argentina wants Davis really bad. Argentine president Javier Milei promoted the coin alongside Davis. It crashed and people lost a lot of money. Now Milei is facing possible impeachment, and Davis is facing possible extradition.

Gregorio Dalbón filed the request with Interpol this week and argued that Davis posed a unique flight risk. According to Dalbón, the 28-year-old crypto entrepreneur has the money and the inclination to flee justice. “The possibility that Davis will abandon his country of residence or hide to avoid answering for his alleged acts appears to be aggravated by the economic resources he possesses, which he can use to move or remain in hiding, hindering our investigation,” Dalbón said in court documents reviewed by Fortune.

A Red Notice is like an international arrest warrant. If granted, it would mean that authorities in the U.S. could arrest Davis and ship him to Argentina.

Davis created the $LIBRA memecoin and got Milei to promote it on Valentine’s Day. Its value skyrocketed to a market cap of $4.5 billion before crashing hard to $18 million. More than 10,000 people lost around $250 million. Davis, of course, sold just before the crash and said he pocketed $100 million.

$LIBRA wasn’t Davis’s first pump and dump meme coin scheme. In January, following the launch of President Donald Trump’s $TRUMP memecoin, Davis launched $MELANIA. Confusion abounded. Investors thought that First Lady Melania Trump had launched her own memecoin similar to her husband’s. But it was just Davis doing his thing. Like $LIBRA, $MELANIA soared and then crashed.

Davis and Milei weren’t secret about their relationship. The President of Argentina posted photos of himself posing with Davis on X, and the crypto-pumper talked about their relationship on podcasts. A report from CoinDesk claimed that Davis bragged about dog-walking Milei.

“I control that n—,” Davis allegedly said in a text viewed by CoinDesk. “I send $$ to his sister and he signs whatever I say and does what I want.”

Davis’ bad behavior is legendary in the crypto community. On February 17, days after Milie promoted the coin, entrepreneur Steven Enamakel shared a story on X about Davis sticking him with a $2,000 sushi bill.

According to Enamakel, Davis invited him to Nobu in Los Angeles to discuss the pending launch of an NFT collection. “Hayden ordered almost everything that was super expensive in the menu,” Enamakel said on X. “When the food came, I never saw a person eat so much sushi so quickly. I wondered if it was humanly possible to consume that much sushi but there it happened right there in front of me.”

When the bill came, David hid in the bathroom. Enamakel waited for 20 minutes for him to return but ended up paying the bill himself because it was getting late and he needed to leave. The moment he paid, Davis returned and said the next meal was on him. “After that he then went ahead [and] screwed up my NTF launch,” Enamakel said. “I should have known better.”

The Argentine investigation into $LIBRA started a few days after Milei promoted it online. The probe is investigating whether Milei and Davis conspired to commit fraud. Possible charges for Davis could include bribery and influence peddling.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In spite of sky-high costs and little in the way of profits, generative AI systems continue to proliferate. The Trump administration has called for a national AI Action Plan to guide America's burgeoning AI industry, and OpenAI was happy to use that as an opportunity to decry the negative effect of copyright enforcement on AI development. Google has also released its policy proposal, which agrees with OpenAI on copyright while also prompting the government to back the AI industry with funding and policy changes.

Like OpenAI, Google has been accused of piping copyrighted data into its models, but content owners are wising up. Google is fighting several lawsuits, and the New York Times' lawsuit against OpenAI could set the precedent that AI developers are liable for using that training data without permission. Google wants to avoid that. It calls for "balanced copyright rules," but its preference doesn't seem all that balanced.

The dearth of available training data is a well-known problem in AI development. Google claims that access to public, often copyrighted, data is critical to improving generative AI systems. Google wants to be able to use publicly available data (free or copyrighted) for AI development without going through "unpredictable, imbalanced, and lengthy negotiations." The document claims any use of copyrighted material in AI will not significantly impact rightsholders.

According to Google's position, the federal government's investment in AI should also extend to modernizing the nation's energy infrastructure. Google says AI firms need more reliable power to keep training and running inference to advance AI. The company projects global data center power demand will rise by 40 gigawatts from 2024 to 2026. It claims the current US infrastructure and permitting processes are not up to the task of supplying the AI industry.

If the government truly supports AI, according to Google, it will also begin implementing these tools at the federal level. Google wants the feds to "lead by example" by adopting AI systems with a multi-vendor approach that focuses on interoperability. It hopes to see the government release data sets for commercial AI training and help fund early-stage AI development and research. It also calls for an increase in public-private partnerships and greater cooperation with federally funded research institutions with initiatives like government-funded competitions and prizes for AI innovation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What’s the most famous moment in the history of The Walking Dead? Everyone has their opinion but the overwhelming majority would likely say the season six finale/season seven premiere moment of Negan beating Glenn to death with his baseball bat. And while Glenn’s friends and family eventually forgave Negan, Glenn never got his revenge. Because he was dead. In a meta twist though, he got his shot on this week’s Invincible.

The third season finale of Invincible is now on Prime Video and in it, we get a rematch between Glenn and Negan… sort of. Glenn was played by Steven Yeun, who voices Invincible on the show, and Negan was played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, recently introduced as the deadly Conquest on the show. The finale features an epic, bloody battle between the two and to discuss the rest of it, including Walking Dead and Invincible co-creator Robert Kirkman’s thoughts, we have to put up the…

(I tried to do that like they do with the Invincible title cards, did it work? Let’s continue.)

In the season three finale, Invincible and Conquest have the biggest, most violent battle on the show since Invincible fought his father, Omni-Man. This time though, Invincible wins, with a little help from Atom Eve. It’s Glenn finally getting his revenge on Negan but, according to Kirkman, that was never a part of the equation.

“I don’t think it ruins the episode or anything, but I think it enhances things and puts an extra level of stakes on it,” Kirkman told Variety. “For anybody who’s a longtime Walking Dead fan, it’s a nice bit of justice.

That there would be justice for Glenn didn’t factor into casting Morgan either. “I’m always trying to find roles for the actors that I know and love and want to work with again,” Kirkman said. “I’m always trying to find something for Jeffrey. When he started showing up on The Boys, I couldn’t let Eric Kripke have all the fun. At some point, it became, ‘When we get to Conquest, Jeffrey Dean Morgan would be perfect for that.’ I didn’t hesitate just because there is the meta of it all like, ‘Oh, it’s the rematch between Glenn and Negan, and now Glenn gets to win.’ Something about it seemed fun and interesting. You worry about those kind of things taking people out of the show, but once you’re in it and you’re paying attention, it’s not necessarily something that occurs to you.”

What occurs to us is that, even with Conquest “defeated” a new villain may have arisen. Kirkman reveals that the mid-credits scene of the finale, featuring Damien Darkblood (voiced by Clancy Brown) and an evil being voiced by Bruce Campbell, is teasing a dark storyline he was never able to get to in the Invincible comics.

“There’s a storyline from the comic that I never got around to doing,” Kirkman said. “Every superhero story has some chapter where they go to hell and they fight the devil. It happens in DC and Marvel comics. It’s a big deal. I never got around to doing anything like that in Invincible. I kept getting sidetracked and there was never a good time. So it’s entirely possible that we may be doing something like that in the show, and that scene at the end of that episode is setting that up. Oh my God, and we got to work with Bruce Campbell. It’s the best.”

Though there is no specific timetable for the fourth season of Invincible, Kirkman assumes it’ll be sometime in 2026. Read more from the co-creator over at Variety and watch the first three seasons of Invincible on Prime Video.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sembra una connessione 5G, ma non lo è. Questa la rivelazione di una ricerca condotta dalla nuova app SignalTracker che mostra che moltissimi smartphone hanno una connessione 4G, nonostante riportino sul display l'indicazione di una 5G - nel Regno Unito, per esempio, ben il 38% dei dispositivi opera in questo modo. Il motivo? A quanto pare gli smartphone mostrano la dicitura del 5G quando si collegano a una base di ricezione che supporta il 5G, anche se non è detto che questa sia poi la connessione effettiva. Soltanto alcuni dei modelli interessati dalla ricerca, per esempio, hanno mostrato un'icona della connessione di rete più chiara ed evidente quando si trattava di una 5G vera e propria.

La restante maggioranza, invece, mostrava questa dicitura sia nel caso in cui la connessione più veloce fosse disponibile, sia nel caso in cui il dispositivo vi fosse effettivamente connesso. Insomma, la ricerca di SignalTracker parla chiaro: gli utenti potrebbero non sapere davvero quale connessione mobile stanno utilizzando, dato che gli smartphone non sempre riportano la realtà. “Questo fenomeno non viene spiegato chiaramente ai consumatori - ha spiegato Martin Sims, amministratore delegato della società proprietaria di SignalTracker, un'applicazione che permette agli utenti di verificare con precisione la qualità della connessione del proprio dispositivo mobile -. Raggiungere una connessione 5G ovunque potrebbe non essere possibile e la maggior parte delle persone potrebbe anche accettare che sia così. Ma il pubblico merita informazioni chiare su ciò che sta utilizzando”.

“Le reti mobili sono un risultato ingegneristico straordinario - ha aggiunto Sims -. Il modo migliore per ottenere il sostegno del pubblico nell'ottimizzazione di questa incredibile tecnologia è tenerlo pienamente informato”. Proprio per questo, Sims ha suggerito agli utenti di utilizzare un'applicazione come SignalTracker, al fine di verificare con esattezza non solo la qualità della connessione, ma anche la potenza del segnale, le bande utilizzate e la velocità di download. Insomma, tutto quello di cui si ha bisogno per navigare in rete nel miglior modo possibile.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Building a Raspberry Pi project from scratch is always a satisfying experience and one of the best ways to scratch that itch is to invest in an all-in-one kit. Today we've got a really cool one to share with you from ClockworkPi known as the PicoCalc kit . It uses our favorite microcontroller, the Raspberry Pi Pico to drive a gorgeous calculator.

This calculator offers much more than the ability to handle advanced mathematical calculations (but it does that really well). It supports the ability for you to code programs from the ground up using and range of languages such as Python, Lua, Rust, GoLang, C and even BASIC. I think we all used to tinker with graphing calculators back in the day but this is taking the idea to a new extreme. You can play games and even listen to MP3 files with the PicoCalc. This level of depth isn't too surprising given ClockworkPis track record of products. In the past, we've covered its uConsole which made waves in the maker community when it was released.

ClockworkPi refers to the PicoCalc as not just a calculator but a "cost-effective MCU platform". It aims to provide a capable mobile device that can aid in the development of other projects, function as an IoT device and even serve as a teaching platform thanks to its GPIO expansion ports which let you add additional hardware.

The kit includes everything you need to create the project. You get a beautiful PCB referred to as the ClockworkPi v2.0 along with a Raspberry Pi Pico H which comes with headers attached. You can replace the Pico H with a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 or 2W, giving you a little more CPU power. Because you can't upgrade the RAM on the Pico, ClockworkPi has elected to add 8MB of PSRAM to the custom PCB. PSRAM isn't as fast as the onboard RAM, but it is plenty fast for this project.

Picocalc features a 4-inch IPS display that has a resolution of 320 x 320px and connects via SPI. You also get a full, rubber QWERTY keyboard to use for input. It has two speakers for audio output, as well. For a professional finish, you get a nice ABS shell along with a tempered glass cover.

The kit costs a total of $75 and includes all of the components we mentioned above. We also explained that the device is intended to be mobile but you may notice we didn't mention how it's powered. The unit requires one 18650 battery, but there is space for two cells which are not included. You will need to purchase those separately to power the PicoCalc.

The project files, schematics and design materials are released under a GPL v3 license via GitHub.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you live in the Midwest and and see a bunch of emergency personnel who look like they’re responding to a nuclear power plant explosion over the next week, don’t be alarmed. The U.S. and Canadian governments are running an exercise across multiple states to prepare for any potential nuclear disaster. And as long as you don’t see a mushroom cloud in the distance, you’re probably fine.

The Department of Energy put out a press release on Thursday announcing that 70 local, state, provincial, and federal agencies from the U.S. and Canada will be running an exercise called Cobalt Magnet 25 from March 14-21. At least 3,000 people will be participating in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, and Ontario, which simulates a nuclear power plant accident.

Cobalt Magnet 25 has been in the works for 18 months and will enable response teams to practice scanning for radiological materials and providing emergency services to the population. Getting essential services back online are also part of the drill. The National Nuclear Safety Administration, a part of the Department of Energy, put out the word so that people aren’t panicked if they see emergency responders running around.

“During the exercise, members of the public may see response personnel in protective clothing using radiological monitoring and detection equipment, low-flying aircraft conducting data-gathering overflights, and groups of first responders and others staged at various locations. There will be no need for alarm,” the press release reads. “Cobalt Magnet 25 is part of a regular program of training, exercises, and planning for the partners to prepare in case of public health and safety emergency.”

These kinds of drills emerged in the 1970s as a way to train for the unthinkable. The U.S. was experiencing a rash of nuclear extortion attempts, which led to the creation of the Nuclear Emergency Search Team, now known as the Nuclear Emergency Support Team (NEST).

“The Nuclear Emergency Support Team—or NEST—is trained to provide decision-makers with timely, actionable scientific advice during radiological incidents,” said Dr. Wendin Smith, the the deputy under secretary for counterterrorism and counterproliferation at the Department of Energy.

The NEST team is often training for a worst-case scenario, whether it’s an intentional terrorist act involving nuclear material or an accidental incident like those at Chernobyl or Three Mile Island in the 1970s and 80s.

“We exercise to validate our ability to quickly determine the extent and severity of radiological hazards, whether and how the public is affected, and enable the optimal response,” said Smith. “If such a scenario did take place, this would save lives and reduce public impacts. NEST’s core mission is providing this critical information to local, state, and federal leaders as soon as possible.”

Unfortunately, President Donald Trump and his billionaire stooge Elon Musk don’t seem to understand how vital NEST’s work is. They fired hundreds of staff at NNSA, only to hire them back after these idiots learned that the Department of Energy is the agency in charge of keeping our nuclear weapons safe and responding to any nuclear accidents.

Again, you probably don’t need to worry if you see a bunch of nuclear specialists in the Midwest this weekend. But it does seem notable these drills still involve America’s friends from Canada. Trump has repeatedly suggested he’s going to invade the country, historically one of America’s greatest allies. And Canadians are understandably upset with the completely unnecessary provocation as Trump says he wants to make it the “51st state.”

Here’s hoping Cobalt Magnet 26 still has plenty of Canadians participating. Because if they aren’t, it means the U.S. is going to be a lot less safe for a host of reasons.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When I saw iRobot’s latest robot vacuums announced this week, my first thought was, “These don’t look like Roombas; they look like midrange models from Roborock, Ecovacs, and Dreame.” Of course, as the original robot vacuum manufacturer, iRobot’s products likely inspired the design of most of its competitors. But Roombas have always had a uniqueness that sets them apart from the crowd.

With these new models, the company is capitulating to the homogeneity of the current crop of vacuums, sacrificing many of its signature features and moving from high-end to middle-of-the-road in a quest to recapture a bigger slice of the market.

Long known for its innovation in home robotics, iRobot is marketing its new line as “breakthrough new products.” But the only notable innovation I’ve seen so far is an onboard dust compacting bin. The rest is largely a reheat of every midrange robot vacuum on the market today.

Then, a day after launching eight new robot vacuums — the biggest product launch in its history — iRobot warned that it was in such dire financial straits that it could shut down in 12 months. Suddenly, it all became clear.

iRobot CEO Gary Cohen says the new products will boost profits compared to its legacy products. But, in the process, they risk sacrificing the uniqueness that sets Roombas apart.

Once a market leader, iRobot has struggled amid fierce competition and a failed $1.7 billion Amazon acquisition. Last year, regulators decided that an iRobot with Amazon’s power behind it could become the 800-pound gorilla in the room and scuppered the deal. This left the company without its visionary CEO and cofounder Colin Angle, forced to lay off more than half its staff, and with a mountain of debt.

This shift isn’t about innovation — it’s about cost cutting and survival.

In response, and essentially to survive, the company is producing products that look like every other bot on the block and has adopted several new features found on those models. These include lidar navigation, spinning mop pads, and white robots. (I can understand the first two, but don’t buy a white robot vacuum unless you really enjoy cleaning your robot vacuum.)

Consumers have been asking for these features for years, and a lack of them may have driven many to opt for one of its competitors over a Roomba — the company saw a 44 percent decline in revenue last quarter compared to the same time the previous year. But in the process, and based on these newest bots, it looks like it’s abandoned much of what makes it unique — its excellent dual rubber roller brushes, well-developed and reliable vSLAM navigation, impressive retractable mop system, and stylish auto-empty docks.

I asked iRobot for a comment on why the new Roombas so closely resemble the Chinese competition. It pointed out that iRobot set the design standard for consumer robots, so, in fact, it’s the competition that’s been copying it.

“Other robot vacuums and mopping solutions across the industry have similar design features to Roomba because the other manufacturers have yet to develop a new, transformative form factor,” Insun Hong, industrial design director at iRobot since 2021, said in an email. While that may have been true five years ago, most of Roomba’s new features existed on the competition before they came to Roombas.

Adding lidar and spinning mopping pads to Roombas may well make them more popular, cost iRobot less, and make for excellent robotic vacuums (something we won’t know until we can test them). But I’m skeptical.

How often has a company completely retooled its products to be significantly cheaper to develop and ended up with something much better? But that appears to be what iRobot is trying to do here.

The company’s annual report says its operational restructuring plan is “designed to more closely align our cost structure with near-term revenue expectations with the goal of improved profitability. Leveraging a new asset-light model, we began to streamline our supply chain to set us up for speed and scale while relying on our partners and contract manufacturers to provide non-core engineering functions.”

The company says it plans to “continue to invest in software intelligence, higher-value robotics, computer vision, [and] machine learning.” But that’s going to be tough to do with a vastly reduced workforce, a slashed R&D budget, and the offshoring of some engineering to “lower-cost regions.”

iRobot didn’t fail to innovate, but it moved too slowly and was overtaken

Software is one area in which iRobot has remained dominant. Its app has traditionally been clear, easy to use, and more reliable than its competitors. Its AI-powered obstacle detection is a leader in the industry, and it has developed several other machine learning technologies that make its robots better cleaners, such as Dirt Detect, which recognizes dirty areas and focuses more time on them.

Hopefully, software will remain iRobot’s strong suit and be a way to differentiate. It’s already added AI detection to one of its new models, which helps the robot avoid pet waste catastrophes and prevent it from aborting its mission because you left a sock in the living room.

Along with the new products, the company announced a new app. However, the new Roomba Home app will only work with its latest models; everyone else will continue to use the iRobot app. It’s a worrying sign the company is leaving its legacy products behind. (In terms of development, iRobot told me it has no plans to stop supporting any of its existing products.)

While this all may well be the right move for the company considering its current financial state, I’m sad to see this shift away from what has made Roomba “Roomba.” This is the company that essentially invented the robot vacuum more than 20 years ago — and invented the modern self-emptying bin, the floor mopping robot, and the idea of a robot vacuum having a “brain.”

There’s no doubt iRobot made missteps over the years. It should have jumped on the two-in-one trend sooner. It took too long to develop a multifunction dock, and while an engineering marvel, its retractable mop solution doesn’t actually mop your floors very efficiently. (But spinning mopping pads are also last year’s thing; the new innovation is retractable roller mops.)

I’m positive there are prototypes in iRobot’s HQ with arms and legs to climb all over your house.

I don’t agree that iRobot should have switched to lidar sooner — its vSLAM navigation may be slower, but it’s more reliable. And I don’t think it failed to innovate. I’m positive there are prototypes in iRobot’s HQ in Bedford, Massachusetts, with retractable roller mops, more advanced camera-based navigation, and arms and legs to climb all over your house.

But the company did move too slowly. It was overtaken on one side by Chinese companies like Roborock, Dreame, and Ecovacs and their nonstop innovations and on the other side by commodity no-name bots you can buy on Amazon for under $200.

There was a moment a year or so ago when iRobot could have positioned itself as the high-end leader in smart home robotics house cleaners. It’s exciting to think where its innovation could have gone, with the power of Amazon behind it. But losing that deal and its visionary leadership left it adrift, and now it’s bouncing between its past and its future, trying to find where it fits today.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An attention-grabbing Kickstarter campaign attempting to reinvent the measuring spoon has turned into a mad, mad, mad, mad world for backers after years of broken promises and thousands of missing spoons.

The mind-boggling design for the measuring spoon first wowed the Internet in 2016 after a video promoting the Kickstarter campaign went viral and spawned widespread media coverage fawning over the unique design.

Known as Polygons, the three-in-one origami measuring spoons have a flat design that can be easily folded into common teaspoon and tablespoon measurements. "Regular spoons are so 3000 BC," a tagline on the project's website joked.

For gadget geeks, it's a neat example of thinking outside of the box, and fans found it appealing to potentially replace a drawer full of spoons with a more futuristic-looking compact tool. Most backers signed up for a single set, paying $8–$12 each, while hundreds wanted up to 25 sets, a handful ordered 50, and just one backer signed up for 100. Delivery was initially promised by 2017, supposedly shipping to anywhere in the world.

But it's been about nine years since more than 30,000 backers flocked to the Kickstarter campaign—raising more than $1 million and eclipsing Polygons' $10,000 goal. And not only have more than a third of the backers not received their spoons, but now, after years of updates falsely claiming that the spoons had been shipped, some backers began to wonder if the entire campaign might be a fraud. They could see that Polygons are currently being sold on social media and suspected that the maker might be abusing backers' funds to chase profits, seemingly without ever seriously intending to fulfill their orders.

One Kickstarter backer, Caskey Hunsader, told Ars that he started doubting if the spoon's designer—an inventor from India, Rahul Agarwal—was even a real person.

Ars reached out to verify Agarwal's design background. We confirmed that, yes, Agarwal is a real designer, and, yes, he believes there is a method to the madness when it comes to his Kickstarter campaign, which he said was never intended to be a scam or fraud and is currently shipping spoons to backers. He forecasted that 2025 is likely the year that backers' wait will finally end.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple was slow to adopt RCS, to put it politely, but the iPhone maker is onboard for the next generation RCS specification, which the GSMA announced this morning.

“I am pleased to announce the availability of new GSMA specifications for RCS that include end-to-end encryption (E2EE) based on the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol,” GSMA technical director Tom Van Pelt writes in the announcement post. “These procedures ensure that messages and other content such as files remain confidential and secure as they travel between clients. That means that RCS will be the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers.”

RCS, or Rich Communications Services (RCS), is an international open standard for messaging and the presumed successor to the SMS and MMS technologies used by messaging apps on cellular networks today. It was adopted broadly by Google and` Android device makers, but Apple was late to the game because it wanted to differentiate the iPhone with iMessage. The result was an annoying world of green and blue bubbles, with non-iPhone-using friends and family members treated like second-class citizens.

In late 2022, Apple CEO Tim Cook finally responded to the complaints by claiming that iPhone users were not asking for RCS compatibility. But a year later, Apple said it would support RCS on iPhone, and in late 2024, it delivered that support via iOS 18.4. This, the GSMA claims, was “a significant milestone.”

RCS is a big deal, but it’s not perfect, and one of its remaining criticisms is its lack of end-to-end encryption. Google supports this technology in its Google Messages app, but it’s not part of the standard. And so in September 2024, the GSMA called on the industry to adopt E2EE as well. And it’s been working with its carrier and other mobile ecosystem partners, including Apple, to come up with an interoperable specification that works everywhere. And that’s what today’s announcement is about.

Naturally, Apple is taking credit for this achievement.

“End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA,” an Apple spokesperson said. “We will add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates.”

“We’ve always been committed to providing a secure messaging experience, and Google Messages users have had end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messaging for years,” a Google spokesperson countered. “We’re excited to have this updated specification from GSMA and work as quickly as possible with the mobile ecosystem to implement and extend this important user protection to cross-platform RCS messaging.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as Intel's chief executive has generally pleased investors and financial analysts, but employees expressed mixed feelings following Tan's initial address, in which he hinted at tough decisions ahead but offered limited clarity on his strategic vision, reports Oregon Live.

Tan, who reportedly stepped down from Intel's board last August because he expected then-CEO Pat Gelsinger to make Intel leaner, is widely expected to make significant job cuts to reduce costs.

Not enough clarity

During his introductory video call, Tan — Intel's first external CEO in its 57-year history —emphasized satisfying customers and shareholders. However, his appearance sparked some criticism, as he wore a shirt from his former company, Cadence Design Systems, instead of one carrying the Intel logo. He cautioned employees — many still unsettled by the recent job and spending cuts — that more difficult decisions were incoming. There are concerns that Tan, who reportedly stepped down from Intel's board last year due to frustration with internal inefficiencies, may push for more job cuts.

One major topic Tan avoided was whether Intel would separate its manufacturing operations from its chip design division. This issue has been a central debate among analysts and former board members. Instead, Tan reiterated his commitment to maintaining Intel's engineering strength as part of the company’s broader turnaround efforts. However, in a letter to employees preceding the call, he emphasized plans to work hard and build a world-class foundry, which may imply that Tan intends to keep the company unified for now.

"Together, we will work hard to restore Intel’s position as a world-class products company, establish ourselves as a world-class foundry and delight our customers like never before," Tan wrote. "That is what this moment demands of us as we remake Intel for the future."

Some employees felt that Tan's remarks lacked enthusiasm and specificity. They had hoped for a clearer strategic plan and stronger reassurance regarding the company's future direction, especially considering his alleged role on Intel's board of directors, which he left in August 2024.

Left with discontent

Tan joined Intel's board in 2022 as part of the company's effort to reclaim its position as a global leader in CPU design and manufacturing. Over time, his role expanded to include oversight of manufacturing operations.

However, eventually, Tan grew increasingly discontent with the company's 'bloated' workforce, which he felt was inefficient and overly bureaucratic, according to Reuters. One of Tan’s major concerns was Intel's approach to layoffs. While Intel announced cuts affecting over 15% of its workforce, Tan believed the reductions were insufficient and should have targeted middle management, which he viewed as a barrier to innovation. He was particularly frustrated that, despite the layoffs, Intel's workforce remained significantly larger than that of competitors like Nvidia and TSMC combined.

Another point of contention was Intel's foundry business. Tan was disappointed by the lack of progress in this area, particularly after a $5.4 billion deal to acquire Tower Semiconductor fell through due to regulatory hurdles in China. Without Tower, Intel lacks the expertise to succeed in contract manufacturing, where it has historically struggled. As a former CEO of Cadence who led the company for 12 years, Tan knows what fabless chip designers need, so now Intel has more chances in the area.

In addition to workforce and foundry issues, Tan was critical of Intel's lagging efforts in AI. Despite multiple attempts and acquisitions to strengthen its AI capabilities, Intel could not keep pace with Nvidia, which became a trillion-dollar company capitalizing on the AI boom.

Analysts and investors cheer

Despite internal worries, investors reacted positively to Tan's appointment. Intel's stock price surged by 15%, opening at $23.80 the following day. Analysts like Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein noted that Tan's longstanding experience in the semiconductor sector lends him significant credibility and could signal hope for Intel's recovery.

Industry analysts believe that Tan's deep-rooted connections and industry knowledge uniquely position him to make the decisions required for Intel's revival. That said, his leadership is seen as a potential catalyst for positive changes, though the path forward may need significant restructuring.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The GSM Association (GSMA) has announced a major upgrade to the Rich Communication Services (RCS) standard, introducing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) using the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol.

This enhancement marks the first large-scale messaging system to offer interoperable encryption between different client implementations, ensuring a higher level of security for users across platforms, including Android and iOS.

Encrypted RCS everywhere

The updated RCS specifications were developed through collaboration between mobile operators, device manufacturers, and technology providers, including Apple and Google. GSMA's Technical Director, Tom Van Pelt, highlighted that the new standards define how MLS can be applied within RCS to protect messages and media as they travel between devices.

Work on enabling E2EE for cross-platform RCS messaging began in September 2024, with GSMA leading the effort to establish encryption that would prevent third parties — including messaging providers and carriers — from accessing message content. Apple, which introduced RCS support in iOS 18 last year, confirmed its involvement in the process, with spokesperson Shane Bauer stating:

“End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross-industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA.”

Google, which has long supported E2EE in RCS messages exchanged within its Google Messages app, also welcomed the update. Ed Fernandez, a Google spokesperson, emphasized the company’s commitment to secure messaging and its plans to implement the new standard as quickly as possible.

Impact of RCS Universal Profile 3.0

The new encryption feature is part of the RCS Universal Profile 3.0 release, which introduces several improvements beyond E2EE. Key enhancements include:

A richer deep-link format for engaging with businesses over RCS.

Improved audio messaging codecs for better voice quality.

Easier management of business messaging subscriptions.

Continued support for features like group messaging, high-resolution media sharing, read receipts, and typing indicators across iOS and Android.

RCS has long been positioned as the successor to SMS, offering modern messaging features comparable to proprietary services like iMessage and WhatsApp. However, a lack of encryption for cross-platform messages was a significant security gap — one that this update aims to close.

What’s next?

Apple confirmed that support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages will be rolled out to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future updates. Meanwhile, Google and other mobile ecosystem players are expected to work swiftly on integrating the new standard.

For users, this development means that private and secure messaging will no longer be restricted to closed ecosystems like iMessage or WhatsApp. As more providers implement MLS-based encryption in their RCS clients, users across different platforms will benefit from a more secure and privacy-focused messaging experience.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Il vombato non si tocca. Sam Jones, un’influencer statunitense, avrebbe da poco lasciato l’Australia dopo le pesanti critiche che le sono state rivolte dai politici del paese per essersi mostrata in un video nel quale allontanava momentaneamente un cucciolo dalla madre. Secondo alcuni esperti, nel caso specifico si sarebbe trattato di un vombato comune, l’unica delle tre specie australiane a non essere considerata minacciata o a rischio di estinzione. Tuttavia, gli animali australiani autoctoni come il vombato sono comunque protetti dalla legge nel paese. Vediamo di che animale si tratta, quali sono le sue caratteristiche e le sue abitudini di vita.

Le tre specie di vombato

Il vombato è un marsupiale quadrupede appartenente alla famiglia Vombatidae. Come anticipato, è nativo dell’Australia, dove esistono tre specie di questo animale: il vombato comune (Vombatus ursinus), il vombato dal naso peloso meridionale (Lasiorhinus latifrons) e il vombato dal naso peloso settentrionale (Lasiorhinus krefftii). Il secondo è stato classificato come near threatened, ossia prossimo alla minaccia di estinzione, dall’Unione internazionale per la conservazione della natura (Iucn, International Union for Conservation of Nature). L. krefftii, invece, è considerato dalla Iucn come critically endangered, ossia a rischio imminente di estinzione. Come suggeriscono i relativi nomi, il vombato comune si differenzia dalle altre due specie per l’assenza di peli sul naso.

Identikit del vombato

Il nome inglese del vombato, wombat, deriverebbe dal termine che un gruppo di aborigeni originario dell’area di Sidney utilizzava per identificare l’animale. Si tratta di un mammifero erbivoro, caratterizzato da zampe molto corte e lungo complessivamente circa un metro. Ha abitudini prevalentemente crepuscolari e notturne, e tende a scavare tunnel sotterranei utilizzando i lunghi artigli e i denti anteriori, che ricordano quelli di alcuni roditori.

Come i canguri e i koala, anche i vombati sono marsupiali. Fatto curioso, il loro marsupio è rivolto “all’indietro”, ossia l’apertura è rivolta verso la coda e non verso il muso. Il vantaggio di questa caratteristica è che in questo modo quando la madre scava con le zampe anteriori non rischia di lanciare la terra contro il cucciolo ospitato nel marsupio. Come non menzionare poi la caratteristica forse più buffa e peculiare di questo animale: il fatto che fa la cacca a cubetti a causa delle particolari proprietà elastiche del suo intestino.

Per quanto riguarda l'habitat, L. krefftii vive soprattutto nella savana, mentre L. latifrons abita anche praterie e foreste. Il vombato comune, infine, vive sia nelle foreste che nelle aree caratterizzate dalla presenza di arbusti.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Firefly’s Blue Ghost lander captured breathtaking images of the so-called diamond ring effect as it observed a solar eclipse from its perch on the lunar surface early this morning.

Blue Ghost got its first glimpse of the eclipse around 1:30 a.m. Eastern Time Friday, as Earth slowly blocked the lander’s view of the Sun. The solar eclipse on the Moon occurred simultaneously with a total lunar eclipse that made its way across U.S. skies Thursday night, turning the Moon a bloody red color from our terrestrial point of view.

Firefly’s lunar lander touched down on the lunar surface on Sunday, March 2 at 3:34 a.m. ET. Blue Ghost alit in Mare Crisium, a large impact site that was later filled with basaltic lava. The company’s first mission to the Moon, aptly named “Ghost Riders in the Sky,” is packed with 10 NASA instruments designed to probe the lunar surface and gather data to support future human missions to the Moon as part of NASA’s Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.

Today, Firefly released the first two images taken by Blue Ghost during the solar eclipse. In this first image—seen directly above—a glowing ring of light is visible in the reflection of the lander’s solar panel as the Sun begins to hide behind Earth’s shadow. In order to capture images of the eclipse, Blue Ghost had to rely on its batteries for power rather than its solar panels.

The eclipse lasted for roughly five hours at Blue Ghost’s landing site in Mare Crisium, and included around two hours of totality that began at 2:18 a.m. ET, during which the Sun was completely blocked by Earth. When in totality, Blue Ghost captured a glowing ring of sunlight above the Moon’s horizon that appears as a diamond ring shinning against the dark backdrop of space—as seen at the top of this article.

In addition to imaging the solar eclipse, according to a Firefly release, the Blue Ghost team planned to operate NASA instruments to measure changes in the lunar environment as Earth blocks the Sun’s light. The lander is set to operate on the lunar surface through Sunday, March 16, capturing a lunar sunset and operating for several hours into nighttime on the Moon, according to Firefly. In doing so, Blue Ghost will have completed a full lunar day on the surface of the Moon, or the equivalent of roughly 14 days on Earth.

Firefly hopes to downlink more images from the solar eclipse once the lander’s X-band antenna warms up—after being stuck in the chilly darkness during the eclipse.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tregua Russia-Ucraina, Mosca apre parzialmente, ma l'esito delle trattative resta quanto mai incerto. Vladimir Putin ha dichiarato giovedì 13 marzo di sostenere "in linea di principio" la proposta americana di un cessate il fuoco di 30 giorni, avanzando però numerose riserve che sembrano studiate per complicare e prolungare significativamente i negoziati in corso tra Mosca, Washington e Kyiv. Diversi osservatori internazionali sostengono che le condizioni poste dal Cremlino siano talmente onerose da rendere difficile un accordo rapido, il tutto mentre la situazione sul campo vede l'avanzata delle truppe russe in diverse aree del fronte, tra cui la regione di Kursk. Nulla è stato ancora formalizzato e le parti rimangono distanti su questioni fondamentali.

Cosa chiede la Russia

Putin pretende che qualsiasi tregua affronti le cause profonde del conflitto e porti a una pace duratura, alludendo all'attuale governo ucraino come parte del problema sottostante da risolvere. Il Cremlino esige che l'Ucraina interrompa la mobilitazione e l'addestramento delle truppe, e che cessino completamente le forniture di armi occidentali durante il cessate il fuoco, proprio mentre le forze russe stanno avanzando lungo quasi tutta la linea del fronte. Riguardo alla regione di Kursk, Mosca solleva dubbi sulla gestione del territorio occupato dagli ucraini durante una potenziale tregua, chiedendo quali garanzie esisterebbero per il ritiro delle forze di Kyiv e come verrebbe gestita la sicurezza dei civili nell'area. La Russia rifiuta categoricamente l'ipotesi di peacekeeper occidentali in Ucraina come garanzia di sicurezza, con la portavoce del ministero degli Esteri che ha dichiarato che tali forze sarebbero considerate obiettivi legittimi. Secondo indiscrezioni di Reuters e Bloomberg, le richieste russe includerebbero anche la smilitarizzazione dell'Ucraina, l'esclusione permanente dalla Nato e il riconoscimento internazionale delle annessioni territoriali russe in Crimea e nelle quattro regioni orientali ucraine.

Cosa chiede l'Ucraina

L'Ucraina ha accettato la proposta americana per un cessate il fuoco di 30 giorni dopo i colloqui in Arabia Saudita, segnalando disponibilità al dialogo ma senza cedere su punti considerati essenziali. Kyiv insiste che qualsiasi accordo duraturo includa garanzie di sicurezza concrete per prevenire future aggressioni russe, considerando le forze di peacekeeping europee come unica alternativa praticabile all'adesione Nato per la propria sicurezza a lungo termine. Contrariamente alle richieste russe, l'Ucraina intende continuare gli sforzi di mobilitazione durante il cessate il fuoco, ritenendo questa misura essenziale per mantenere la propria capacità difensiva durante i negoziati. Il presidente Zelensky ha accusato Putin di tergiversare per guadagnare tempo mentre proseguono le operazioni militari, sostenendo che le precondizioni di Mosca siano formulate appositamente per rendere impossibile un accordo efficace o per prolungare indefinitamente i negoziati. Intanto, fonti militari ucraine ammettono che la situazione nella regione di Kursk è ormai compromessa, con l'attenzione ora focalizzata sulla gestione di un ritiro ordinato con perdite minime, eliminando così quello che era stato concepito come un potenziale elemento di leva negoziale.

Il ruolo degli USA nella tregua tra Russia e Ucraina

Gli Stati Uniti sotto la presidenza Trump stanno assumendo un ruolo centrale nella mediazione per una tregua tra Russia e Ucraina, posizionandosi come principale facilitatore di una soluzione diplomatica al conflitto. L'inviato speciale americano Witkoff ha incontrato Putin a Mosca in un colloquio durato diverse ore fino a venerdì mattina, un segnale dell'impegno diretto dell'amministrazione Trump nel processo negoziale. Secondo il Cremlino, durante questo incontro Putin avrebbe inviato ulteriori messaggi riservati a Trump tramite Witkoff, mentre il consigliere per la sicurezza nazionale americano ha espresso un cauto ottimismo sui risultati del dialogo. L'approccio americano include discussioni dettagliate con l'Ucraina sui territori che verrebbero mantenuti o ceduti in un eventuale accordo finale, con Trump che ha detto che si stanno affrontando questioni specifiche come la spartizione del Kursk e il controllo della centrale nucleare di Zaporizhzhya. Il presidente americano, inoltre ha definito "promettenti ma incomplete" le aperture del Cremlino e ha fatto riferimento a potenziali leve economiche nei confronti della Russia, per incentivarla ad accettare l'accordo, pur senza specificare quali misure concrete potrebbero essere adottate.

Perché il dialogo si tiene in Arabia Saudita

I colloqui preliminari tra funzionari ucraini e statunitensi si sono svolti in Arabia Saudita poiché il regno rappresenta un terreno neutrale con buone relazioni sia con Mosca che con Washington, configurandosi come intermediario credibile in un contesto diplomatico particolarmente complesso. Dopo questi colloqui in territorio saudita, l'Ucraina ha accettato un cessate il fuoco immediato di 30 giorni e gli Stati Uniti hanno presentato formalmente la proposta a Mosca, avviando così la fase attuale del processo negoziale.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jeffrey Combs is a Star Trek staple, having managed to appear across Voyager, Enterprise, Lower Decks, and, of course, Deep Space Nine. Across dozens upon dozens of appearances in the franchise, Combs is one of the most beloved and prolific guest stars in Trek history. But even among his characters, one stands out. Well, multiple of one.

Weyoun—the cloned Vorta lackey that became the administrative face of the Dominion as it waged war across the Alpha Quadrant in DS9‘s back half—was made specifically for Combs, and it was a role he played so perfectly his initial performance led to the canonization that Vorta were a regularly cloned population, just so we could get more takes on Comb’s overconfident, yet simpering, and deliciously manipulative lickspittle across another four extra appearances. But the five Weyouns we saw on TV weren’t the only ones we’d get, with a few more of the cloned Combses making their way into Star Trek apocrypha. To celebrate Combs’ most iconic Trek role, let’s take a look back through Vorta history to see which Weyouns were worst (in ways both complimentary and derogatory).

8) Weyoun 2

Little is known about Weyoun 2 (was Weyoun Prime Weyoun 1? Was he Weyoun 0? Who can say), outside of a passing mention in the 2000 novel Inferno, which posits that he was involved romantically with the clone of another female Vorta, Kilana (who would go on to appear in the DS9 episode “The Ship”). This raises fascinating questions about Vorta relationships and sexual appetites as a cloned race, but little else.

7) Weyoun 10

Somehow, Weyoun returned! The 10th of a line that ostensibly should’ve ended after eight, Weyoun 10 appears most prominently in Star Trek Online‘s special DS9-themed expansion, Victory Is Life, released in 2018. It was nice to have Combs back in action, but Weyoun 10 doesn’t really stand out that much compared to his predecessors. He’s initially introduced as Odo’s adjutant before almost immediately reverting to type as the lackey of the Female Changeling after betraying Odo to free her from captivity. As with all good villainous Weyouns, however, he eventually gets what’s coming to him.

6) Weyoun 4

He might be Weyoun 4, but he’s Weyoun 1 in terms of being the first appearance of the character—the definitive article, if you will! Weyoun is not immediately introduced as antagonistic—or rather, that he’s pragmatic, working with Captain Sisko to try and quell a brewing rebellion among the Jem’Hadar. It’s a great turn from Combs, and although he dies at the episode’s climax, you can see why DS9‘s writers enjoyed the Vorta so much they wanted to introduce the cloning concept just to have him back.

5) Weyoun 7

If Weyoun 2 raises interesting questions about the Vorta and their attitudes to sexual attraction in a good way, Weyoun 7 raises them by being a real goddamn creep. The direct replacement of a turncoat Weyoun (more on him later), Weyoun 7 is best known for trying to pair a captured Worf and Ezri Dax together, in the hopes of getting to see the two romantically comfort each other. Gross! Thankfully, this particularly grim Weyoun pushes Worf too far during an interrogation and promptly gets his neck snapped.

So why rank him above Weyoun 2? Mostly because his death is extremely satisfying, not just to the audience, but to Damar, who hates Weyoun to pieces at this point in the Dominion-Cardassian alliance—and who takes the opportunity to not only laugh about Weyoun 7 getting offed, but laugh long enough to keep it going when he meets successor. That’s a professional hater, right there.

4) Weyoun 8

Speaking of that successor! The final Weyoun we meet in DS9, Weyoun 8 initially comes into the picture in an interesting circumstance: what does a long-cloned being do to reckon with being the last of his kind? The victim of Damar’s betrayal of the Dominion in the later stages of the war, the Cardassian rebellion is announced by an attack on the cloning facilities that housed Weyoun’s genetic material, leaving him unable to be reborn.

Unfortunately for him, his response to this existential crisis is to just be an absolute bastard of a Weyoun, even more than usual: Weyoun 8 is the one who diligently responds to Damar’s pettiness by having his wife and children executed, and is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions of Cardassians in the final days of the Dominion War as he attempts to crush any potential resistance. Damar never gets to see Weyoun 8’s final fate, but at least it’s Garak who shoots him dead for him.

3) Weyoun 5

The most prominent of the Weyouns, Weyoun 5 is the version of the character who guides us through the early moments of the Dominion War—including being the Weyoun who oversees the occupation of Deep Space Nine itself when Gul Dukat and the Dominion manage to successfully force Starfleet from pulling back from the station.

Weyoun 5 is arguably Weyoun at his most conniving, relishing the politicking and administrative bureaucracy he gets to wield during DS9’s occupation, while also trying to still be kind of diplomatic about his insidiousness. All that changes post-liberation of the station though, when Weyoun 5 manages to be the eventual architect of his own downfall by appointing Damar as Dukat’s replacement to lead Cardassia during its alliance with the Dominion.

2) Weyoun 9

A high placement for a Weyoun we never get to actually see—and one that shouldn’t even exist. Created for the Star Trek novel range, and first appearing in the Mission Gamma series in 2002, Weyoun 9 is cloned out of a genetic template recovered in the Gamma Quadrant, eventually becoming a close confidant of Odo, having been activated so he would have a familiar face to deal with in interacting with the wider Dominion. Seeking to change Weyoun for the better in this post-Dominion War era, Odo helps Weyoun 9 embrace his individuality rather than exist solely in subservience to the Founders.

After the Great Link dissolves, Weyoun 9 helps Odo run the Dominion at large, and through his own individuality and growth as a person, begins to help change wider Vorta society. Eventually, Weyoun 9 even relocates with other Dominion refugees to the Alpha Quadrant, seeking political asylum in Federation space. It serves as a nice coda to Odo’s own relationship with another Weyoun in particular–the best of them all, even…

1) Weyoun 6

Yes, Weyoun is relished and admired for being an annoying, calculating baddie, but Combs’ finest hour with the character comes from the one time he plays Weyoun good in the iconic season seven episode “Treachery, Faith, and the Great River”. Deciding to defect from the Dominion out of a believe that the war against the Federation was unjust, Combs plays Weyoun 6 with a wonderful innocence, as he tries to balance his “defective” belief that the Founders had made a horrifying decision with his broader loyalty to them through his growing relationship with Odo.

Alas, it’s that loyalty that brings heartbreak, when Weyoun 6 kills himself, activating a termination implant to stop the Dominion and his successor Weyoun 7 from firing on Odo’s runabout while trying to escape to Federation sanctuary. It’s a truly great scene between Combs and René Auberjonois, and speaks to Combs’ range with the archetype of Weyoun that he can play him in a moment of emotional sympathy just as brilliantly as he can in his most dastardly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is my bread and butter. I saved up for ages as a kid to buy my first MacBook, I invested all my time as a teenager learning all there was to know about the iPhone, and I started working at the Genius Bar in my local Apple Store as a young adult.

When I got my “big break” in journalism I was thrilled to finally be able to merge my passion for tech and knowledge for Apple with my talent for writing. After working for a few years at iMore, an Apple-enthusiast site, I moved to TechRadar to cover AI, ready to take on a new challenge that I thought would, yet again, be shaped by some kind of Apple-infused impact: Apple Intelligence.

Fast forward to now, I’ve been part of the Apple Intelligence journey since day one, covering all the major AI announcements at WWDC 2024 and using Apple’s take on “AI for the rest of us.” since its very early beta days.

At first, the Apple Intelligence features were confusing, with tools scattered across the UI, but Apple’s take that AI should be there for when users need it rather than forced down their throats felt like a refreshing approach to the tech world’s favorite buzzword that’s hard to avoid.

The thing is, the more we fast forward through the first year of Apple advertising AI as the headline feature in all its hero products, the more the cracks have begun to show, and there’s no more damning visual than Apple’s need to push back (with no timeframe) the key to Apple Intelligence’s success, Siri.

I was off work last week, so I missed the whole announcement of the delay to the upcoming Apple Intelligence-powered Siri where an Apple spokesperson said, “It is going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year.” Off the grid, I had no idea what was waiting for me on Monday morning, and when I saw the news the disappointment hit me like a tonne of bricks.

You see, I’ve championed Apple Intelligence for months. Not so much because of its “intelligence” but because I have full belief in Apple’s ability to do something the right way, and based on the company’s track record it would’ve been a safe bet to place.

I’ve been writing about how I believed consumer AI’s success was reliant on Apple Intelligence’s success and if any company in the world could make AI make sense for my nephew and my parents alike then it would be Apple.

Over the last nine months, I’ve tested everything Apple Intelligence has to offer, from features that I’ve used once and not touched since like Writing Tools to the more endearing options like Genmoji.

When it launched I said “Apple is onto something with Genmoji, and it might just be the best Apple Intelligence feature, ready to expose other AI tools to the average customer” to this day I use the AI tool whenever regular emojis just don’t fit the situation.

But let’s be real, the Genomji, Image Playground features of the world are not needle movers, they are simply nice-to-haves that come in handy whenever you want to cheer up a friend or family member. The Siri showcased at WWDC 2024, on the other hand, is a needle mover, a system seller if you will - that would be if it actually existed.

I’ve been talking with my colleague and TechRadar’s US Managing News Editor, Jacob Krol, about this for months and how I was starting to worry about Apple Intelligence’s prowess considering we hadn’t really seen anything to suggest it was even capable of improving people’s lives in the way Apple would make you believe.

John Gruber’s damning criticism of Apple’s AI situation captured that feeling perfectly, highlighting the lack of even a guided demo or showcase of Siri 2.0 at WWDC in June or at the launch of the iPhone 16 in September, leaving the question: Does it even exist?

In recent times, Apple’s AirPower charging mat springs to mind. I remember working at the Apple Store when it was announced and the excitement from customers who wanted an easy-to-use wireless charging solution that could charge multiple devices at once. Then… nothing. AirPower was never released, and two years after its initial announcement in 2017 the product was canceled and sent into the abyss.

AirPower was a fairly niche product, unlike Apple Intelligence which Apple has been touting as the main selling point of the current best iPhones, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro.

After the unveiling of the iPhone 16 in September, I wrote an article highlighting my dismay with the Apple Intelligence launch. The piece was titled “The Apple Intelligence launch is a mess – don’t buy the iPhone 16 or install iOS 18 based on the promise of what’s to come” emphasizing the fact that Apple was selling consumers a smartphone that wasn’t shipping with any of its headlining features.

I said, “This is where my bigger concern lies: the promises of what’s to come. I’ve used Apple Intelligence as part of the iOS 18.1 developer beta and I like what I’ve tried so far, but Genmoji, Image Playground, and the wonder of an actually useful Siri are all just pipedreams right now. No one outside of Apple has even seen these AI tools in the flesh; they aren’t even in beta testing yet as part of a Developer Beta.”

Since then, we’ve seen Genmoji and Image Playground, in fact, they are now available on compatible devices, but Siri (the feature we’re all waiting for) is still nowhere to be seen. It was meant to launch as part of iOS 18.4 in April or May, and I was waiting patiently, giving Apple the benefit of the doubt, hoping for Siri to bring the keys to unlock AI on the iPhone.

I’ve had countless conversations with colleagues where I’ve explained how it’s tricky to critique Apple Intelligence fairly without having all the pieces to the puzzle, and how Apple’s “beta” moniker makes it unfair to criticize. But honestly, with this Siri delay and delving deeper into the capabilities of Android with Gemini integration, I feel completely let down by Apple and I feel like it’s only right to make that clear.

If I had to describe Apple Intelligence, the umbrella term for all things AI in iPhone, iPad, and Mac, I’d call it underwhelming. There’s not one AI tool on my iPhone 16 Pro right now that fulfills Apple’s ultimate goal of simplifying life. It’s so insignificant, in fact, that I had it switched off after an update for about two weeks without even noticing the AI features were disabled.

If Siri’s Apple Intelligence upgrade was available then we’d be a step closer to the personal assistant in your pocket that everyone is hopeful for, but as it stands iPhone users and loyal Apple customers are living in the AI-less past while even non-flagship smartphones like Google’s Pixel 8a have excellent AI integration.

I’ll admit it, I’m sometimes blinded by the Apple bubble and therefore spend most of my life using Apple products instead of the competition. Because of that, I think sometimes Apple's aura clouds purchasing decisions and consumers miss out on the capabilities of the other side.

I know the grass isn’t always greener, but when it comes to AI it definitely is. Take Gemini in Gmail for example, which allows users to quickly ask AI to help take control of their emails right from the Gmail app, it’s a neat feature and the kind of useful AI tool that serves a purpose, not just a nice-to-have.

Gemini is integrated throughout Android 15 and now that Apple has decided to delay Siri even longer, those of us who trusted the concept of Apple Intelligence are being punished. I don’t have faith that the iPhone 16, a device sold as the best place for Apple Intelligence, will even have a Siri capable of Gemini’s prowess before the iPhone 17 launches – and that’s just not cool Apple.

We’ve become accustomed to Apple doing what’s right for its consumers and ultimately creating hardware and software that’s beautiful to look at and easy to understand. With AI it feels like Apple was blindsided and has taken for granted just how quickly artificial intelligence would become part of our daily lives.

In the past Apple has been able to hide behind limitations by marketing them with its consumers in mind: Siri isn’t as good as Alexa or Google Assistant because Apple doesn’t access your data.

But when it comes to AI, the privacy focus doesn’t bear the same weight. Competitors, while not offering the same world-class privacy and security as Apple, have caught up to a certain extent and consumers want AI that genuinely makes a difference, removing the mundane from their lives. That means that people are more likely to overlook things that might’ve been a sticking point in the past, purely to gain access to tools that significantly enhance the user experience.

I could write about this situation all day, but I’m going to push the brakes. Ultimately, Apple has overpromised and by doing so has significantly disappointed its most loyal customers. Owning a flagship iPhone with a gorgeous OLED display and an incredibly fast Apple-produced chip means nothing if the software is living in the past compared to its competitors.

Whether you like AI or not, the last year has proven that this is one of the most significant software productivity jumps we’ve ever seen, and unless Apple gets its game together it’s going to be completely left in the dust.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Il deep state – letteralmente “stato profondo”, come viene definito negli Stati Uniti quel presunto sistema di potere politico-burocatico che controllerebbe in maniera occulta il governo – è uno dei principali spauracchi della destra americana, insieme alle politiche per l'inclusione e la diversità e a George Soros. La domanda però sorge spontanea: vi viene in mente un modo alternativo per chiamare un gruppo di figure ambigue e non elette da nessuno, molte delle quali con interessi e legami commerciali in comune, che assume di fatto funzioni governative ai massimi livelli, contravvenendo direttamente alla volontà del Congresso? E perché proprio Doge?

Dopo anni di allarmi su fantomatici burocrati che tirano le fila di tutto, ora l'amministrazione di Donald Trump sta dimostrando come la cosa funzionerebbe nel concreto. Il dipartimento per l'Efficienza governativa è esattamente quello che a parole dichiara di temere di più. Ed Elon Musk rappresenta il problema che dice di voler risolvere.

Tutti i punti di contatto tra Doge e deep state

Le descrizioni di deep state e Doge sembrano corrispondere quasi alla lettera. Segretezza? Il Doge non ha mai fornito un organigramma, non aveva un leader pubblico fino a poco tempo fa e si è rifiutato di rivelare l'identità dei suoi giovani collaboratori nelle prime riunioni interne. Non eletto? Non c'è bisogno di elaborare oltre.

Una rete di interessi collegati al di fuori del governo? Il Doge è indiscutibilmente una propaggine di Elon Musk. Gli attuali e gli ex dipendenti delle sue aziende – X, SpaceX, Boring Company e Tesla – controllano o sono ben inseriti all'interno di innumerevoli agenzie governative, comprese quelle da cui sono apparentemente regolamentati (quante sono? Difficile dirlo con esattezza: a proposito di segretezza). A onor del vero alcuni membri del team del Doge sembrano non avere alcuna affiliazione, al di là di un'apparente passione per lo smantellamento del governo degli Stati Uniti. Ma per il resto, ci sono tutti gli elementi.</p>

Jess Weatherbed writing at The Verge, with a statement from Apple’s Shane Bauer:

“End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA,” said Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer. “We will add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates.”

Personally, I never really thought it made sense for Apple, a company whose brand is about security and privacy, to withhold support for encryption on RCS. But the real issue was that the RCS standard did not include support for cross-platform encryption, even though other providers, like Google, enabled encryption on their platforms. So it doesn’t surprise me to see that this move is being made in concert with the GSM Association, which oversees the RCS standard.

As a user, you shouldn’t have to worry which of your messages are secure or not, and Apple certainly doesn’t want to have explain that those blue bubbles are safe and green bubbles are not. It behooves Apple to be a good citizen and realize that there are people who use other platforms. Like with emoji reactions, this is a case where making a feature work cross-platform improves the lives and experience of Apple’s own customers.

There’s no timeline for this, so it could arrive in iOS 18/macOS Sequoia updates in the next few months, but I think it more likely we’ll see it mentioned as part of Apple’s WWDC announcements in June.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Measles isn’t just making a comeback in the United States. In a report out this week, the World Health Organization found that cases of the vaccine-preventable disease surged in Europe and Central Asia last year, reaching the highest levels seen in over two decades.

The WHO released its analysis, jointly conducted with UNICEF, on Thursday. According to the report, there were more than 120,000 documented cases of measles in the European region, which covers 53 countries across Europe and Asia, in 2024. The tally is double the number reported in 2023, and the highest total seen in the area since 1997.

Measles is an incredibly contagious viral disease, though there has been a widely available and highly effective vaccine available against it since the 1970s (the combination measles, mumps, and rubella—or MMR—vaccine). Successful vaccination programs drove measles to the brink of eradication in many places, including the U.S. and Europe.

The U.S. officially eliminated the local transmission of measles in 2000, while cases in the European region reached an all-time reported low of 4,440 cases in 2016. But measles continues to thrive in regions where the vaccination rate is low, and the disease can easily surge back in areas where a community’s collective immunity to it falters (about 95% of a population needs to be immunized to measles to prevent widespread transmission of the disease, a concept known as herd immunity).

Since the low-water mark in 2016, measles has made an unwelcome comeback in parts of Europe. In 2018, the UK lost its measles-free status just two years after it was obtained due to uncontrolled outbreaks (the country did eventually win back this status in 2021).

The early years of the covid-19 pandemic further complicated this situation. While social distancing practices intended to curb covid-19 also greatly reduced cases of other infectious diseases including measles, the pandemic also gravely disrupted existing vaccination programs. Thanks to these disruptions, and with people’s social lives mostly returned to normal, measles has regained a foothold in Europe and other areas of the world.

In 2023, there were more than 60,000 reported measles cases in the European region—an number that WHO officials called “alarming” at the time. This past year, there were 127,352 cases of measles in the region—more than twice the number reported in 2023. Over 40% of those cases involved children under the age of five, who are the most vulnerable to severe illness. Roughly half of the reported cases led to hospitalization, and at least 38 measles-related deaths were reported from the region in 2024.

These cases represent about one-third of all measles cases reported worldwide last year, though the true number is certainly higher. The WHO previously estimated that 10 million people caught measles in 2023, for instance, while around 100,000 died as a result. Though measles typically only causes a distinctive rash and flu-like illness, the infection can occasionally lead to life-threatening complications like encephalitis or debilitating conditions like blindness.

“Measles is back, and it’s a wake-up call,” said Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, in a statement.

Measles has also reestablished its presence in the U.S. lately, with higher-than-usual case numbers since last year. Currently, the virus is surging in parts of Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Over 200 cases and two deaths connected to the same broad outbreak have been reported in these states, though again, the actual tally is likely higher. Mexico has also reported cases connected to this outbreak, which is predominantly spreading among rural Mennonite communities with low vaccination rates. At least 10 other U.S. states have reported travel-related cases this year as well.

While the risk of measles becoming a nationwide problem in the U.S. is low, thanks to an overall high vaccination rate, there are enough vulnerable pockets of the country that measles could ignite more large-scale outbreaks if it shows up there. Stateside and beyond, the key to curbing this ancient disease is making sure that people are able and willing to get their shots.

“Without high vaccination rates, there is no health security. As we shape our new regional health strategy for Europe and central Asia, we cannot afford to lose ground. Every country must step up efforts to reach under-vaccinated communities,” said Kluge. “The measles virus never rests—and neither can we.”</p>

現状でも対応するAndroidスマートフォンに限り、マイナンバーカードの一部機能（電子証明書機能）を搭載できる。

一方、2025年春からは、氏名、住所、生年月日、性別、マイナンバー、顔写真の証明を含む「マイナンバーカードの全機能」のスマートフォン搭載が始まる。これにより、スマートフォン自体が身分証として機能する。iPhoneはiOS 18.4ベータで対応するとみられる。

実証実験では、コンビニのセルフレジにおいて、スマートフォンに搭載したマイナンバーカードを利用して、酒類やたばこ購入時の年齢確認をする仕組みを実証した。マイナンバーカード情報を読取るソフトウェアは、パナソニックコネクトが開発した。

導入効果として、現状セルフレジでの年齢確認対象商品販売時に必要な店舗従業員による有人対応が削減され、省人化や業務負荷軽減に繋がるとしている。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>How can Severance season two almost be over? We waited what felt like forever to see what was next for the team at Lumon and now, with only one episode to go, it all feels too sudden. Especially since this week’s penultimate ninth episode worked as a revealing but slightly stunted place setter, moving all the pieces on the board to exactly where we needed to be. It’s heartbreaking that it’s almost over, several of the stories in the episode were heartbreaking, and when you arrive at this episode’s final line, it’s fascinating to consider the brilliance of the storytelling.

“The After Hours” was, once again, one of those episodes that jumped between all the characters so we’re going to break it down by individual character/storyline. Full spoilers below.

Helena/Helly

The episode started with Helena so we’ll do the same. We see her getting ready for her day in what we can assume is her family’s house, since her father Jame Eagan, CEO of Lumon, is there. It’s a very creepy scene layered with information. We learn it’s going to be a “momentous day,” we learn that Lumon is “seeing to Mr. Bailiff,” and we learn that Jame would prefer his daughter eat her eggs raw. Who is he, Gollum? What the hell, man? We also learn that the Eagan house is, presumably, close to Lumon itself, thanks to its proximity to the water tower we saw in that weird claymation thing.

Helly then arrives at work on a mission. She’s looking for Mark who, for the second day in a row, isn’t there. Helly busts into Mr. Milchick’s office to ask about it and really pushes his buttons, bringing up her outie—his boss—and digging at his interchangeability with Cobel. After her interactions with Dylan (more on that in a second), she takes it upon herself to investigate the directions Irving left to get to the Exports Hall.

As Helly makes her way to the “Hang in There” poster hiding the directions, we notice the poster is of Dylan, or someone who looks like Dylan. Why or how that is, we don’t know, but it makes more sense for why Irving left the directions there. Helly takes them back to her desk to study them like it’s the Contra code when she’s interrupted by Jame. “You tricked me,” he says to Helly, who is very confused to see Jame in this setting.

Basically Helly’s journey this week was kind of the glue to keep all the stories together. She checks in on Mark, Dylan, Milchick, gets Irving’s instructions, even links us to the man himself, Jame. What trick did she pull? Did Helly somehow do a reverse Glasgow block we don’t know about? Did Jame not know about Helena posing as Helly? Is he just finding out about Irving trying to kill her?

Miss Huang

Miss Huang has been an enigma all season. She pops in and out, acts way too nice to work at Lumon, but is also oddly in awe of the whole thing. She’s also a literal kid. Here though, she’s the first tale of woe in the episode as we, presumably, see the end of her journey.

Last week we learned that the Wintertide Fellowship she is doing is the same one Harmony Cobel did to cement her place at Lumon. However, Miss Huang’s is ending. Mr. Milchick tells her that she’s moving from her parents’ house to the “Gunnel Eagan Empathy Center in Svalbard, where you will work to steward global reforms.” Svalbard, by the way, is in the Arctic Circle. Basically closer to the North Pole than anywhere else. Not a great assignment.

Then, if that wasn’t enough, Mr. Milchick reveals that this “betterment” must be marked with a “material sacrifice” and makes her smash her ring toss game to bits. One of the very few things we know about Huang is how much she loves that ring toss game, so to see Milchick make her smash it is needlessly cruel.

After a sad interaction with Dylan, we see her waiting for a Lumon shuttle. Is she really going from here right to the Arctic Circle? Will we ever see this character again? I kind of hope she turns on Lumon and brings the whole place down.

Dylan

We always love Dylan but, in our minds, “The After Hours” was the best Dylan episode yet. Just a tour de force by actor Zack Cherry and Merritt Wever, who plays outie Dylan’s wife, Gretchen. Things start there, with the couple going through their morning routine. Gretchen then drops a bomb on him we thought would’ve remained a secret a little bit longer. She kissed his innie “for about a minute.” (Did she really have to add that last part? That was a bit much, right? Too much detail.)

Dylan is confused and angry about this, both because he feels as if he’s been cheated on using his own body, but also because Gretchen suggests it was meaningful to her. He’s been “adrift,” she says, and Dylan’s innie reminds her “of how you used to be.” Furious, Dylan says he might quit Lumon just to end his innie’s existence, a statement that comes back in a very unexpected way.

Though Dylan told Gretchen not to follow him to work, she does just that, telling his innie what she just did. “Was he glad for us?” he asks, in the most precious manner ever. He wasn’t, Gretchen says, before telling the innie she can’t see him anymore. Innie Dylan is crushed. He thought he was making Gretchen happy, which he was. But she can’t do it at the expense of his outie. All of this makes your mind do backflips because she’s breaking up with her husband, to be with her husband, who she cheated on with her husband.

This declaration leads to Dylan professing his love for Gretchen and proposing. He proposes marriage! Seriously, one of the biggest, best Severance twists ever. “I love you, I made this for you, I can give you a life,” he tells her with a paper ring. So rarely have romance and pain been weaved together so beautifully. Gretchen cries, apologizes, and leaves.

Dylan goes back to the office where only Helly is there to greet him. She suggests he saves the ring for someone else on the severed floor, which is meant to be helpful but clearly is not. “It’s just O&D and the goat people,” Dylan says. He then talks about how innies are stuck with no life, no family, and no real purpose before blaming her for all of it. “If we’re so different from our outies, how come we couldn’t tell when you were gone?” he asks.

It’s a fantastic question that Dylan is about to challenge himself. He decides to quit Lumon which, when you think about it, is a very big decision. He’s not only choosing to end his own existence—basically Severance suicide—he’s choosing to punish his outie and family by denying them a steady paycheck. It’s big, it’s brash, but it’s the only thing he has the ability to do. And so, Dylan fills out a very odd form where he’s asked why he’s resigning and he checks literally every box. We can’t see them all but we can see “freedom, anger, fatigue, loneliness, guilt, shame” and “annoyance.” Sounds about right. Mr. Milchick is displeased about this, saying it “reeks of ingratitude” (a reference to them allowing him to see his wife), and as Dylan leaves, Miss Huang blames herself. Dylan tells her not to.

We last see Dylan at the elevator to the severed floor, presumably about to go back upstairs completely oblivious to the damage his innie just caused. Again though, what a Dylan episode. Just everything great about this show rolled into one.

Irving

Irving’s story this week began before we saw him on screen. Remember the throwaway line where Helena tells Jame that they’re “seeing to Mr. Bailiff?” That’s Irving and that one line reshapes everything that comes after.

Everything starts with Irving, in a very cool leather jacket we must add, returning home to see his trusty dog Radar staring at something. It’s Burt, who has broken into Irving’s apartment and found some notes he wrote about him. Burt reads the notes back to him, which surmises that Burt might be a “low-level Lumon enforcer” or “goon.” Irving swears that was before and now he doesn’t think that anymore, but after Burt asks him to take a drive, we learn that’s exactly what Burt was, and still is.

So what is “seeing to Mr. Bailiff?” Lumon has, we think, hired Burt to drive Irving somewhere where something bad is going to happen. That’s what Burt does for Lumon, he reveals, but we soon see he’s apparently making an exception. The pair go to a train station where Burt buys Irving a ticket that goes all the way to the end of the line, and tells him not to reveal to Burt where he’s planning to get off. Irving realizes this is him defying Lumon, but Burt is okay with that. He loves Irving. Irving says he’s never been loved but is ready, while Burt says it’s impossible. It’s an intense, emotional scene between two acting juggernauts that results in Irving leaving Kier.

Emotionally, Irving’s story with Burt this week was fantastic but it didn’t feel that cohesive. We still don’t really know about Burt’s present situation with Lumon. We don’t know what Lumon was planning for Irving or why. And then just logistically, it’s off. Burt bought Irving’s ticket and said go to the end of the line. He knows where he’s going. He bought the ticket. There are specific stops. If pressed, he’d have an idea. Plus, he thought to tell Irving to bring Radar, but not a bag with a change of clothes or anything? The whole jump from when last saw them at dinner to Burt breaking into Irving’s home and making him leave forever didn’t quite sit right. But, in Severance we trust.

Mr. Milchick

Before we get to the episode’s most significant thread in terms of the overall narrative, we’ve gotta talk about Mr. Milchick, whose story is directly tied into that. From the episode’s first scene, we know that this day is going to be a big one at Lumon because it’s the day they expect Cold Harbor to be completed. After we watch the super creepy Dr. Mauer check in on Gemma, he notices Cold Harbor is still at 96%. It’s 9 a.m. and the numbers aren’t moving. Mauer complains to Mr. Drummond. Drummond calls Milchick to ask why Mark isn’t working but, of course, Mark isn’t there.

After multiple unsuccessful attempts to contact Mark, Mr. Drummond gives him the business. He belittles Milchick by bringing up things he was dinged on in his performance review, such as using words that are too big. Milchick cowers for a while until, finally, he snaps. He tells Drummond to “devour feculence.” “It means, eat shit,” Milchick says. He then goes off on Drummond, telling him Mark’s whereabouts when he’s not in the office aren’t his problem, they’re Drummond’s, so maybe he should back off. And as much as Milchick is clearly a villain on Severance, you couldn’t help but cheer for him in this moment.

But why? Why give Milchick a moment of triumph over an even greater foe? Well, the answer would come when he finally talked to Mark, which brings us to our last section.

Mark/Devon/Cobel

When last we saw Mark, two episodes ago, he was passed out on the couch reliving his life with Gemma in his mind. When last we heard from him, his sister Devon had called Harmony Cobel for help, something Reghabi specifically asked her not to do. And so we pick up with the pair driving to meet Cobel somewhere, with Mark still a little out of it and clearly not on board with Devon’s plan. He still doesn’t trust Cobel because she has yet to give them any information and, frankly, he’s probably right. Even with everything the audience learned about her last week, can we trust Cobel? Meanwhile, Milchick keeps calling Mark and Mark still has that cough. What IS that cough?

Cobel arrives late and despite remaining very cagey, does reveal a few things. The biggest is that she believes when Mark completes Cold Harbor, Gemma will be killed. Second, she will take them to the birthing retreat with the severance-equipped cabin where they can talk to Mark’s innie, but not until evening. (This, by the way, is odd because we know Milchick first calls Mark around 9 a.m. and then we see Mark wait for evening. Do they all just stand in the cold all day? It doesn’t track but, we’ll forgive it.)

Mark continues to be weary of Cobel who refuses to be forthcoming about anything. It’s another scene that is just oh-so Severance because the characters we want together are on screen, asking the questions we want them to ask, but no answers are given. Cobel merely suggests Mark call Mr. Milchick and let him know he won’t be in today so as to not spark suspicion. Mark does so, which happens after Milchick’s confrontation with Drummond, and at first lies that he’s still sick. Eventually, though, Mark tries to be human with Milchick and tells him he needs a day for “life stuff.” Milchick doesn’t seem to buy it at first but, because we just saw him have this human moment in the confrontation with Drummond, he actually decides to trust Mark, as long as Mark promises to come in tomorrow. Mark promises.

As evening falls, Devon and Cobel pull up to the cottage farm compound with Mark hiding in the back of the truck. The exchange that follows is the most mysterious of the whole episode and maybe even the season. Cobel has to convince the security guard that she should be let through without notice. So she tells the security guard that Devon is “one of Jame’s” and that “no one’s to know.” She references “Miss Marsha White, ninth floor” which the guard recognizes as the “specialties department.” Cobel adds that she’s looking for “a gold thimble.” The security guard buys all of this and lets them through.

Though this may all sound like weird, cryptic Lumon stuff, it both is and isn’t. First of all, there’s the implication Jame Eagan has women brought to this place covertly. What does he do with them? Are his odd interactions with Helena/Helly in this episode, talking about raw eggs and tricks, related? We have about as much of an idea of that as we do what a “gold thimble” is which is to say, none at all.

More concretely though, all of Cobel’s verbiage goes back to the episode’s title, “The After Hours.” That’s also the name of a Twilight Zone episode from 1960 which is about a mannequin come to life, though she doesn’t realize it at first. Her name? “Miss Marsha White.” And, you guessed it, she visits “the ninth floor, specialties department,” and is, in fact, “looking for a gold thimble.” How the two things tie together we aren’t quite sure yet but, it’s clearly a very deliberate, literal, homage.

Finally, after all of that—and it was a lot—innie Mark awakens in the cabin. Devon greets him, calms him down, and brings him upstairs where Cobel is standing there waiting, bathed in fire like she’s the devil. “Do you remember the last thing you said to me?” Devon asks. “She’s alive?” Mark says and then—that’s it.

Basically, the entire episode slash the entire first nine episodes of season two have been about getting back here. Back to innie Mark saying the line that left us hanging for three years after season one. That season ended with “She’s alive” but there were no more episodes. This episode ended with “She’s alive,” and there is one more episode. It’s been a long, long time coming and we’re sad it’ll be over soon, but we are finally, hopefully, going to dig into the line that started it all.

Nevertheless, it’s sad. Sad that this season is almost over. Sad that this episode seemingly wrote off Irving and Miss Huang, and almost Dylan in a way too. Surely, at least Dylan and Irving’s stories will continue, but the sadness each is dealing with will make them less than fun to watch. Everyone else though, from Mark, Cobel, and Devon, to Helly, Gemma and Jame, are right where they need to be to give us another unforgettable finale of Severance.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Allerta meteo per le forti precipitazioni in Toscana ed Emilia-Romagna. Rischio alluvione per le esondazioni dei fiumi nelle due regioni settentrionali per le forti piogge. A Firenze si aspetta la piena dell'Arno. L’Italia, però, è spaccata in due con pesanti nubifragi al nord e clima con caldo eccezionale nelle estreme regioni meridionali, soprattutto al sud. Nella giornata di venerdì 14 marzo la temperatura a Palermo ha raggiunto i 25 gradi.

Allerta meteo in Toscana

A Sesto Fiorentino (Firenze) ha esondato in pieno centro il torrente Rimaggio, in piazza del Mercato, allagando le strade adiacenti. Ma le piogge intense che vanno avanti da questa mattina hanno provocato allagamenti rilevanti anche in altre zone della città fanno sapere dal Comune. L'invito rilanciato attraverso i canali social dell'amministrazione, è quello di interrompere ogni attività, "non uscire di casa, non mettersi alla guida e a spostarsi ai piani alti".

A Firenze e in tutto il territorio della città metropolitana, riferisce l’Ansa, è stata disposta la chiusura di musei e luoghi di spettacolo come cinema e teatri. Chiuso anche l’info point della stazione di Santa Maria Novella. Una nuova ordinanza del sindaco Sara Funaro è stata disposta la chiusura anche per sabato 15 marzo di scuole, giardini, mercati, cimiteri, ma anche biblioteche e impianti sportivi fino alle 14, quando dovrebbe cessare l’allerta rossa. “L'intensità e l'estensione degli eventi previsti potrebbero determinare gravi criticità idrauliche e idrogeologiche. Tutto il sistema regionale di Protezione Civile della Toscana, Vigili del Fuoco, Forze di Polizia, soccorso ed emergenza sanitaria è in stato di massima allerta con interventi in corso", ha affermato il presidente della Regione Toscana Eugenio Giani.

Attività commerciali e industriali chiuse a causa della forte ondata di maltempo anche a Campi Bisenzio (Firenze), comune già colpito pesantemente dall'alluvione del 2023. Un’ordinanza del sindaco Andrea Tagliaferri ha disposto la chiusura per oggi e domani anche di tutti gli uffici pubblici e privati sul territorio, salvo garantire i servizi pubblici essenziali, gli impianti sportivi e le farmacie comunali salvo quelle San Donnino e di Capalle. Dal Comune arriva anche l'invito ai cittadini a evitare gli spostamenti e a salire ai piani alti degli edifici.

Scuole e strutture pubbliche chiuse anche a Pistoia fino a sabato 15 marzo alle 14. Il Comune di Prato ha chiuso le attività commerciali e produttive.

Nell'Empolese Valdelsa si segnalano allagamenti e strade chiuse.

Maltempo in Emilia-Romagna

Forti piogge e rischio alluvione anche in Emilia-Romagna. L’allerta durerà almeno fino a sabato su bassa collina e pianura romagnola, costa romagnola e pianura bolognese, interessando quindi le province di Ravenna, Forlì-Cesena, Rimini, ma anche Ferrara e Bologna. Frane e smottamenti sono segnalati nel Bolognese, con allagamento di strade e sottopassi.

A Faenza (Ravenna) preoccupa il fiume Lamone, con una piena record. “Il fiume Lamone è già in sofferenza e sta aspettando l'arrivo di una o due nuove piene importanti. La piena più grande dovrebbe arrivare nella seconda metà del pomeriggio. Per questo dobbiamo mettere in atto azioni immediate" ha detto sui social il sindaco di Faenza Massimo Isola.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>is platforms and communities reporter with five years of experience covering the companies that shape technology and the people who use their tools.

Briefly, here’s what’s up with Tesla over the past few weeks: its stock is down more than 50 percent since December; Tesla sales in California are plummeting; Cybertruck deliveries are reportedly paused because the vehicles are falling apart; protesters are demonstrating outside Tesla showrooms across the country; and Tesla owners are selling their cars to avoid getting called Nazis.

But that’s not all. According to data from YouGov, a market research firm, the public’s impression of the company has never been worse, reaching its lowest point since YouGov began tracking Tesla in 2016. YouGov asks members of the public daily questions about Tesla to gauge overall sentiment. (Sherwood first reported the data.)

As of March 12th, the net impression for respondents across the political spectrum is -12.8. “Impression” measures whether consumers have a positive or negative impression of a given brand. The company fares even worse with liberals, with a -35.5 net impression. Moderates sit at a -9.2 net impression. Conservatives are the only group with a positive net impression of Tesla, measured at 7.5.

YouGov also asks whether respondents would consider purchasing a Tesla. According to YouGov data, around 8 percent of liberals indicated they would consider purchasing a Tesla, down from 12 percent at the beginning of 2022. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the percentage of conservatives who say they would consider buying a Tesla has increased from 6.7 percent to 8.4 percent. Even those numbers are lagging: when looking at the average response rate for all carmakers, 10 percent of the general population say they would consider buying a vehicle.

There are also more indications that Tesla sales are slowing down. New registrations in the US fell 11 percent in January compared to a year prior, Automotive News reported. That follows reports of nosediving sales in several European countries, including France, Norway, Spain, and Germany.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>United States District Court Judge Christopher R. Cooper ruled that the Department of Government Efficiency is subject to FOIA requests. Cooper’s ruling is long, catty, and funny. It comes to the ultimate conclusion that the “[United States Digital Service] is likely covered by FOIA and that the public would be irreparably harmed by an indefinite delay in unearthing the records.”

The court filed the ruling on March 10, and Court Watch published it on March 14. The ruling is part of an ongoing battle between the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), DOGE, and the Office of Management and Budget.

CREW is a non-profit that attempts to hold American democracy accountable “using bold legal action and in-depth investigations.” In December and January, it sent three Freedom of Information Act Requests to the OMB asking about its contact with DOGE and seeking basic information about the new government agency whose official name is the United States Digital Service [USDS].

FOIA requests can take years to drag out of a government agency, but requesters can demand they be processed fast when there’s a strong public interest. “OMB accepted CREW’s requests and agreed to process them on an expedited basis given the public importance of the records sought. USDS, on the other hand, refuses to process CREW’s request to it on the grounds that USDS is not an ‘agency’ subject to FOIA,” the court explained.

Cooper called bullshit on this and ruled that DOGE is, in fact, an “agency.” CREW originally wanted the FOIA requests filled by March 10 so that Congress could have the information before its budget fight. Cooper denied the CREW’s request for the agencies to meet that timeline but did agree that the requests needed to be expedited.

“Finding that USDS is likely covered by FOIA and that the public would be irreparably harmed by an indefinite delay in unearthing the records CREW seeks, the Court will order USDS to process CREW’s request on an expedited timetable and, after receiving proposals on a production schedule, to begin producing documents on a rolling basis as soon as practicable,” Cooper said in his ruling.

Cooper also demanded that both agencies “preserve all records that may be responsive to CREW’s FOIA requests.” He doesn’t exactly trust the people working at DOGE to follow the law in this regard. “This evidence gives rise to the possibility that representatives of the Defendant entities may not fully appreciate their obligations to preserve federal records,” he said. “This is especially true for USDS, many of whose staffers are reported to have joined the federal government only recently and, to put it charitably, may not be steeped in its document retention policies.”

The bulk of the ruling walks through the claim that DOGE isn’t technically an “agency” and therefore not subject to FOIA requests. The FOIA legislation defines an agency as “includ[ing] any executive department, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of the President).”

If DOGE’s sole responsibility was to advise and assist the President, then it could not be hit with a records request. If, however, DOGE has wielded significant authority independent of Trump then FOIA would consider it an agency. Cooper said CREW would likely prove that DOGE was an “agency” and pointed to three stark pieces of evidence.

“First, the relevant executive orders appear to endow USDS with substantial authority independent of the President,” the court documents said. “Second, [Elon] Musk and the President’s public statements indicate that USDS is in fact exercising substantial independent authority,” it said.

Then Cooper started quoting Musk and Trump’s social media posts. When Trump announced DOGE just after the election in a post on X, he said it would have the power to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.”

“Musk also took credit for the cuts at USAID, boasting: ‘We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper,’” the court pointed out. “These statements and reports suggest that the President and USDS leadership view the department as wielding decision-making authority to make cuts across the federal government.”

The bragging also went to the court’s third point. The EO gave DOGE authority, Musk and Trump had bragged about the authority, and DOGE had demonstrated that authority through concrete actions by shredding USAID and putting thousands of government employees on administrative leave. “The Court need not stretch to conclude that USDS likely drove the charge to shutter USAID, and conducting such mass firings evidently requires substantial authority,” it said.

Cooper’s write-up of the case makes it sound as if DOGE has been recalcitrant during the proceedings. When asked to defend itself before the court, DOGE declined and said that CREW’s arguments fail for “multiple independent reasons” but did not seem to articulate what those were. “USDS cannot escape the consequences of refusing its opportunity to refute any of CREW’s allegations suggesting that USDS is acting with substantial independent authority,” the court said.

“For all these reasons, the Court concludes that USDS likely qualifies as an agency for the purposes of FOIA,” Cooper ruled in the end. He said that getting the documents to Congress before the budget fight wouldn’t matter one way or another, but did acknowledge that getting the records fast was important.

“The rapid pace of USDS’s actions…requires the quick release of information about its structure and activities. That is especially so given the secrecy with which USDS has operated,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Se il 6 marzo tutto fosse andato secondo i piani, in questo momento ci sarebbe una rete 4G LTE in una minuscola area della Luna. La prima rete lunare 4G, realizzata da Nokia, doveva fornire la connettività a diversi rover per la missione IM-2. L’impresa avrebbe aperto la strada ad Artemis III nel 2027, la prima missione con equipaggio sulla Luna dal 1972, in vista della quale Nokia e Axiom Space integreranno la comunicazione 4G LTE nelle tute spaziali degli astronauti.

Sfortunatamente però il lander di Intuitive Machine, Athena, è atterrato su un fianco – lo stesso destino toccato anche alla missione IM-1 – e a 250 metri di distanza dal sito di atterraggio previsto, al polo sud lunare. L’orientamento dei pannelli solari, la direzione della luce solare e le rigide temperature nel cratere in cui è atterrata hanno impedito al lander di ricaricarsi. Il 7 marzo la società ha così annunciato la brusca conclusione della missione (quello di IM-2 tuttavia non è stato l'unico velivolo ad atterrare di recente sulla Luna: all’inizio di questo mese il Blue Ghost Mission 1 di Firefly Aerospace è riuscito a raggiungere la superficie del satellite).

Un successo a metà

Anche se la rete 4G di Nokia non ha funzionato come previsto, l’azienda ritiene comunque di aver “stabilito la prima rete cellulare sulla Luna”, dal momento che ha “convalidato aspetti chiave del funzionamento della rete". All'interno di Athena, oltre a diversi strumenti e rover c'era infatti anche il network in a box (Nib) di Nokia. In un'intervista al Mobile World Congress 2025, il direttore generale dei Bell Labs' Space Communications Systems di Nokia, John Dow, aveva spiegato a Wired US che il dispositivo consiste in una radio, una stazione base, routing e core, tutti integrati in un sistema compatto.

Nokia dichiara di aver avviato con successo la Nib, che ha ricevuto istruzioni e trasmesso dati alla stazione terrestre di Intuitive Machines. Tutti i componenti del sistema erano perfettamente funzionanti, sebbene il dispositivo sia rimasto attivo solo per 25 minuti circa prima che la corrente s'interrompesse. L’azienda aveva in programma di effettuare la prima chiamata cellulare sulla Luna con i rover, ma i veicoli non sono stati dispiegati.

Ma cosa sarebbe dovuto accadere? Poche ore dopo l’atterraggio, e in seguito ai controlli di sistema, lo sportello di Athena avrebbe dovuto aprirsi lasciando uscire i veicoli al suo interno. Dopo aver attraversato la superficie lunare, i rover avrebbero spiegato le loro antenne e si sarebbero connessi alla rete. “Pensate a questi veicoli come a dei dispositivi connessi – afferma Dow –, dotati di uno user equipment che abbiamo costruito e in grado di comunicare attraverso un collegamento 4G alla rete di Athena”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Reddit has shown a growing commitment to promoting ads on its platform, especially since going public a year ago. But in the interest of not completely alienating customers with incessant, irrelevant, or personally offensive ads, the social media company is giving users the ability to block advertisers for a year.

In a Reddit post last night, a Reddit employee known as cozy_sheets said that clicking “Hide” on an unwanted ad on Reddit will soon result in Reddit automatically hiding “future ads from that advertiser account for at least a year (you can re-hide the ad after that period of time).” The change will debut on the Reddit website and Reddit’s iOS and Android app throughout “the next several weeks,” according to the announcement.

Reddit didn't detail what limits it will use to ensure that users don't block every single advertiser for an ad-free Reddit. Some users have already reported seeing a daily limit for hiding ads, though.

Reddit's representative said the ad blocks are a response to users wanting “more control over the ads they see.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Molti fan non avevano smesso di crederci, come giustamente aveva insegnato il motto della serie Ted Lasso: “Believe”. Ecco allora che Apple Tv+ ha confermato in queste ore che il suo fiore all'occhiello dal punto di vista delle produzioni seriali tornerà con una quarta stagione. Gli episodi della terza, diffusi tra il marzo e il maggio 2023, erano considerati da molti come un epilogo definitivo, anche se nel frattempo si erano diffuse diverse ipotesi e indiscrezioni su un possibile spin-off con alcuni dei suoi personaggi. Il nodo, in effetti, era il ritorno del suo protagonista assoluto e produttore esecutivo Jason Sudeikis: l'attore americano aveva dato vita al personaggio, un allenatore di football americano prestato al calcio con tutta la sua inesperienza ma anche tutto il suo ottimismo, per la prima volta in alcuni spot della Nbc e poi l'aveva ripreso appunto in questa serie.

Il rinnovo di Ted Lasso per la quarta stagione e i nuovi episodi

Inizialmente il suo coinvolgimento era escluso, mettendo in qualche modo a repentaglio la continuazione stessa di Ted Lasso come l'abbiamo sempre conosciuta. Ora invece la situazione è ribaltata e lui stesso dichiara l'entusiasmo di essere di nuovo a bordo: “Continuiamo a vivere in un mondo in cui molti fattori ci hanno condizionati a ‘guardare dove metti i piedi prima di saltare’”, ha dichiarato riferendosi agli insegnamenti sportivo-filosofici che Ted è solito impartire ai suoi calciatori: “Nella quarta stagione, i ragazzi dell'AFC Richmond imparano a SALTARE PRIMA DI GUARDARE, scoprendo che ovunque atterrino, è esattamente in cui sono destinati a essere”. I nuovi episodi vedranno la conferma di Brett Goldstein come co-sceneggiatore e, anche se non ci sono state ufficializzazioni per quanto riguarda il resto del cast, Hannah Waddingham, Jeremy Swift e lo stesso Goldstein avevano firmato delle opzioni per tornare in eventuali nuovi episodi. New entry sarà Jack Burditt, re delle comedy (Nobody Wants This, Modern Family, 30 Rock) e vincitore di diversi Emmy in qualità qui di produttore esecutivo.

Dopo il suo debutto nell'agosto 2020, Ted Lasso si è imposto come un successo inaspettato, diventando ben presto non solo la serie più vista su Apple Tv+ (almeno fino al debutto di Scissione), ma anche un vero e proprio fenomeno di costume che ha conquistato, grazie al suo brio e alla sua filosofia uplifting, anche chi non era interessato propriamente ai contenuti più sportivi: “Ted Lasso è stato un vero e proprio fenomeno, capace di ispirare una fanbase appassionata in tutto il mondo e di regalare infinite gioie e risate, il tutto diffondendo gentilezza, empatia e un’incrollabile fiducia”, conferma ora Matt Cherniss, responsabile della programmazione di Apple TV+: “Tutti in Apple sono entusiasti di poter continuare la collaborazione con Jason e le brillanti menti creative dietro questa serie”. Non è ancora stata definitiva una data di debutto ma, anche in questo caso, bisogna solo credere che arriverà molto presto.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are among the best graphics cards. However, not all the usual vendors have embraced AMD's Radeon RX 9000-series (RDNA 4) lineup. MSI has confirmed that it chose to forgo this generation of AMD Radeon graphics cards.



We contacted MSI to determine if the company had plans to release any Radeon 9000-series graphics cards utilizing the RDNA 4 architecture. A company representative responded to Tom's Hardware, saying, "Regarding your question, MSI is not manufacturing AMD GPUs this generation."



The statement suggests that MSI's decision isn't restricted to the Radeon RX 9070 series that has recently come out of the oven. We infer that it encompasses RDNA 4 as a whole, considering MSI's use of the phrase "this generation." Whatever the core reasons, MSI isn't saying, and this doesn't mean there won't be future AMD-based graphics cards from the company. But for now, MSI doesn't plan to offer any RDNA 4-based graphics cards.

If we analyze the last three generations of Radeon graphics cards, it's evident that MSI was a devoted AMD partner until the launch of the Radeon RX 7000-series (RDNA 3). For instance, the shift from the Radeon RX 5000-series (RDNA) to the Radeon RX 6000-series (RDNA 2) resulted in a 50% increase in the number of models available. However, you can argue that the Radeon RX 6000 refresh helped boost the numbers. Excluding the refreshed models would reduce the RDNA 2 total to 33 different models, still amounting to a 10% increase over RDNA.



Things took a turn for the worse with RDNA 3, as MSI offered only four custom models: one Radeon RX 7900 XTX, one Radeon RX 7900 XT, and two Radeon RX 7600. This marked a significant 91% decrease in models compared to RDNA 2. MSI even neglected to release custom models for other RDNA 3 SKUs, such as the Radeon RX 7800 XT, Radeon RX 7700 XT, or the Radeon RX 7600 XT.

While we didn't collect the data for Nvidia's GeForce graphics cards, it's not difficult to see that MSI clearly invests more effort in supporting the Green Team. A quick look at MSI's website shows that the last-generation RTX 4090, despite its eye-watering $1,599 price tag, was offered in 12 different variants, 3X more than the entire RDNA 3 lineup.

Is MSI turning into the new EVGA?

In a way, the writings were always on the wall that MSI could participate less in AMD's graphics card launches. MSI did not partner with AMD for a few product launches in the last generation, like the Radeon RX 7800 XT. The brand didn't put out any new designs but salvaged coolers from the previous generation. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX Gaming Trio Classic 24G utilized a recycled cooler that stemmed from the Radeon RX 6900 XT Gaming Trio Plus 16G.



MSI did not specify why it isn't producing AMD RDNA 4 graphics cards, though we can speculate on several possible reasons.



One key thought is that MSI may want to become a premiere Nvidia partner to fill the void that EVGA has left behind. Skipping RDNA 4 means MSI can allocate all the company's resources toward the latest GeForce RTX 50-series (Blackwell) graphics cards and potentially receive better pricing or special incentives. According to the latest Steam Hardware and Software survey, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the graphics card market, with a usage share of 83.07% compared to AMD's 11.49% from September 2023 to February 2025.



Perhaps MSI's decision not to offer RDNA 4 graphics cards is related to demand. The company likely ran the numbers and determined that the ROI didn't warrant the brand's involvement this generation. That might seem difficult to understand, given the strong demand that has left the Radeon RX 9070 series nearly sold out worldwide, but that's all in hindsight. MSI likely made a decision on this a year or more in the past, when it wasn't clear that Nvidia supply would be lower than normal resulting in more demand for alternative options. It seems like a missed opportunity for MSI in retrospect.



We've also heard rumblings (not from MSI) that AMD didn't disclose its intended MSRPs for the 9070 series until that information was given in AMD's live presentation — that the AIB partners were simply supposed to assume that the recommended pricing would leave enough margin. If that's true, it's just one more reason for a partner to balk. Conversely, we also have Acer entering the U.S. market and elsewhere as an AMD (and Intel) GPU provider, potentially taking over MSI's former spot.



Whatever the case, MSI hasn't disclosed any plans for future AMD graphics cards. We'll have to wait and see if RDNA 5 (UDNA 1?) can persuade MSI to hop back on the AMD train, or if MSI ultimately transforms into the new EVGA.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was Meta itself that first told me about the new book attacking Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and the allegedly bankrupt morals of their company. On March 7, a Meta PR person contacted me to ask if I’d heard about Careless People, a presumed takedown of the company that was due for release in a few days. I hadn’t. No one at Meta had read the book yet, but the comms department was already proactively debunking it, issuing a statement that the author was a former employee who had been “terminated” in 2017.

My first thought was Wow, I’ve got to read this book! And in fact I did, devouring it in a night as soon as it was published. With the benefit of attention from Meta’s complaints, I suspect Careless People might become a must-read. Meta—the company that promotes itself as an avatar of free speech—has successfully convinced an arbitrator to silence author Sarah Wynn-Williams, who was a director in charge of connecting Meta’s executives with global leaders. The ruling, relying on an NDA signed after Wynn-Williams was fired, demands she stop promoting the book, do everything in her power to stop its publication, and retract all comments “disparaging, critical or otherwise detrimental” about Meta. That’s pretty much the whole book. Wynn-Williams, who has registered as a whistleblower with the SEC, did not attend the hearing and doesn’t seem inclined to respect it. As I write this, Careless People is now the third-best-selling book on Amazon.

This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech.

The arbitrator’s Meta-friendly “emergency” ruling was the climax of an intense campaign against the book that erupted once the company got a look at it. Even as I turned the pages of Careless People, my inbox was fattening with dispatches from Meta. “Her book is a mix of old claims and false accusations about our executives,” a company spokesperson says. They characterize her firing as the result of “poor performance and toxic behavior.” They call her “a disgruntled activist trying to sell books.” Meanwhile on social media, current and former employees posted comments defending the maligned executives.

If the news is so old, one might ask why is Meta going nuclear on Wynn-Williams? For one thing, its author was a senior executive who was in the room, and on the corporate jet, when stuff happened—and she claims that things were worse than we imagined. Yes, Meta’s reckless disregard in Myanmar, where people died in riots triggered by misinformation posted on Facebook, was previously reported, and the company has since apologized. But Wynn-Williams’ storytelling paints a picture where Meta’s leaders simply didn’t care much about the dangers there. While the media has written about Zuckerberg’s obsession with getting Facebook into China, Wynn-Williams shares official documents that show Meta instructing the Chinese government on face recognition and AI, and says that the company’s behavior was so outrageous that the team crafted headlines to show what the company would have to deal with if their plans leaked. One example: “Zuckerberg Will Stop at Nothing to Get Into China.” While making blanket statements that the book can’t be trusted, Meta hasn’t denied all these allegations specifically. (In general, when a company tries to dismiss charges as “old news,” that translates to a confirmation.)

Still, in the context of what we know about Meta already, nothing Wynn-Williams says about the company’s actions and inactions is shockingly new. Careless People is not an investigative work, but a memoir, with the narrative thread being the observed callousness of the company’s leaders. Given this personal focus, it’s no wonder that Careless People’s most memorable moments come not from Meta’s substandard corporate morals, but gossipy anecdotes of misbehavior on the corporate plane or at luxury hotels. Despite the lofty F. Scott Fitzgerald title reference, much of the book reads like a Big Tech–themed episode of White Lotus. Wynn-Williams says that Sheryl Sandberg pressured her to share a bed mid-air, that Meta’s chief global affairs officer Joel Kaplan called her “sultry” and grinded against her while dad-dancing at a corporate retreat. (This led her to file a sexual harassment claim that Meta now says was “misleading and unfounded.”) Also, Mark Zuckerberg thinks Andrew Jackson was the greatest president because he “got stuff done.”

Can she be trusted? Meta calls Wynn-Williams an unreliable narrator, and she is certainly self-interested. I tend to think that she isn’t making things up but spinning events in the least favorable light for her subjects and the most favorable light for herself. And though she may not admit it, she’s one of the careless people too. By her own account, she was the Susan Collins of Facebook’s policy team, wringing her hands over morally questionable practices, and sometimes offering objections—but ultimately going with the flow. She says that for years she plotted an escape but couldn’t afford to leave the job and the medical coverage due to her serious health issues. Since she was a corporate director who made many millions of dollars in compensation, and California includes preexisting conditions for private health insurance, that doesn’t ring true. She stuck around until she got canned. By then, according to her own account, she was slow-walking her efforts because she disagreed with the policies of her bosses.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quando la sete si fa sentire non c'è piacere più grande che avere subito a portata di mano un bel bicchiere di acqua fresca. I frigoriferi con dispenser soddisfano proprio questa esigenza e lo fanno nel migliore nei modi. Non c'è bisogno di aprire la porta per tirare fuori bottiglie e caraffe ingombranti: basta avvicinare il bicchiere all'erogatore, premere il pulsante (oppure tirare la leva, a seconda dei modelli) e la magia è fatta: acqua a volontà, pura e alla temperatura desiderata, senza sforzi. E non è tutto: chi all'acqua preferisce cocktail e bevande rinfrescanti può puntare su un frigo equipaggiato anche con un dispenser per il ghiaccio, a cubetti o tritato (o entrambi). Un piccolo lusso che un tempo era prerogativa dei frigoriferi americani e che oggi è possibile trovare anche sui formati più piccoli, dai combinati ai doppia porta. Ma come funzionano? E quali sono i modelli su cui vale la pena investire? È tutto nella nostra gallery qui sotto.

Come funzionano i frigoriferi con dispenser per acqua e ghiaccio

L'acqua ovviamente non arriva dal nulla. I meccanismi che riforniscono i dispenser sono sostanzialmente due. Il primo è quello più semplice: si appoggia a un serbatoio in vetro o in plastica - installato sulla porta interna o su un ripiano del frigorifero - da riempire con acqua potabile e ovviamente rimpinguare ogni volta che si svuota. La sua grandezza varia a seconda dei modelli, ma in media può arrivare a contenere fino a 5 litri di liquido, e l'ingombro è ottimizzato per essere d'impiccio il meno possibile.

Il secondo meccanismo è un po' più articolato e prevede un lavoro di installazione iniziale, anche se poi non necessita di interventi manuali: attraverso un tubo ben nascosto nella struttura del frigo, il dispenser viene collegato direttamente alla rete idrica di casa, da cui attinge acqua a ciclo continuo.

Per garantire che quello che beviamo sia salubre e di qualità, è presente un sistema di filtraggio - da sostituire periodicamente - che lavora per rimuovere qualsiasi tipo di impurità o sostanza nociva. Sui frigoriferi più evoluti c'è a supporto anche la tecnologia uv nano che si preoccupa di igienizzare in autonomia il beccuccio dell'erogatore così da evitare la proliferazione di batteri che trovano terreno fertile nella aree umide.

La nostra selezione

Detto questo, è arrivato il momento di capire quali sono i frigoriferi con dispenser per acqua e ghiaccio più interessanti del momento. Nella nostra gallery siamo andati oltre i classici frigoriferi americani perché non sono alla portata di tutti, sia per i costi sia per gli ingombri. Abbiamo quindi ampliato la nostra ricerca per soddisfare tutte le esigenze, anche estetiche, affiancando ai mastodontici side by side modelli combinati e doppia porta. Sono tutti dotati di erogatori, solo per l'acqua o per l'acqua e il ghiaccio insieme, con o senza collegamento alla rete idrica diretto. Per il resto, supportano le più recenti tecnologie in fatto di conservazione degli alimenti, dal sistema di raffreddamento no frost che impedisce la formazione di brina alle funzionalità smart per la gestione da telefono, passando per la regolazione automatica della temperatura in ottica di contenimento dei consumi energetici.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China-based AI company Deepseek is reportedly focusing on development and research, instead of chasing revenue, unlike many of its western AI rivals like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic. According to the Financial Times, the Hangzhou-based company is focused on developing two new models, R2 and V4, with the intention to hit their goal of achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Deepseek garnered significant attention in January 2025, triggering a stock market shakeup that resulted in Nvidia losing $589 billion in market cap in a single day, following the launch of Deepseek R1.

Despite the newfound attention, the billionaire founder and CEO of Deepseek, Liang Wenfeng, is allegedly taking a different approach when compared to the company's western competitors.

Speaking to the Financial Times, sources close to Deepseek said that there is "little intention to capitalize on Deepseek's sudden fame to commercialize its technology in the near term". Instead, the company is instead focusing on "model development" and developing towards AGI.

Deepseek's revenues are also reported to be covering ongoing costs, likely thanks to interest garnered thanks to the release of the Deepseek R1 model in January.

Wenfeng is also notoriously difficult to contact, with the Deepseek CEO outright declining interest in any further investment from "venture and state-backed funds", the report continues.

But, Wenfeng clearly has enough resources to fund further development. He's also the founder of one of China's leading hedge-funds, High Flyer. According to sources speaking to the Financial Times, he purchased 10,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs, and 10,000 A100s. Though, the chips were purchased before they were banned for sale in China. Deepseek has already incurred over $1.6 billion in hardware costs, and has total fleet of over 50,000 Nvidia GPUs.

However, the company might find it difficult to access more advanced Nvidia chips in the future, and could "consider future partnerships" to resolve the issue. In late February, a Singapore-based smuggling ring was busted for alleged illegal re-export of high-performance GPUs, destined for Deepseek, bypassing trade restrictions.

It's also alleged that if Deepseek's future demand exceeds their current data center capacity, that the company will rely on "third-party providers", instead of procuring more for themselves. The Chinese government has also thrown support behind Deepseek, with the company gaining access to state-funded datacenters.

Deepseek has also invested over $500 million into its technology, and will remain self-funded. "They clearly are not interested in scaling up right now. It's a rare situation where the founder is wealthy and committed enough to keep it lean in a Navy Seal-style for his pursuit of AGI", one industry insider told the Financial Times.

Deepseek's 160 employees are dedicated to development

Deepseek has "about 160" employees, which is significantly fewer than OpenAI's gargantuan headcount of around 2000 employees (as of December 2024), according to sources speaking to the Financial Times. This makes the company much leaner than many of its rivals.

The team is focused on development of the next-generation R2 and V4 models, which are currently slated for release in May. However development "may be accelerated to keep its momentum going" according to Financial Times sources.

With Deepseek's next move just a short few months away, another Chinese AI company named Manus AI, which is developing autonomous AI agents, has enjoyed heightened interest.

But, it has yet to come within spitting distance of the impact that Deepseek has had on the AI industry. Whether Deepseek's next release can trigger another shock moment for stock markets is also yet to be seen, as the company hones in its focuses on rapid development of advanced AI technologies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Asus released a new motherboard model — the Asus ROG Crosshair X870E Apex — and reviewers quickly spotted a change to the Q-Release Slim feature that the company did not mention. According to Uniko’s Hardware post on X (formerly Twitter), Asus updated the PCIe bracket, removing the metal piece between the power and data slots that was suspected of scratching the GPU PCIe pins.

Asus was in hot water with enthusiasts earlier this year when it was discovered that its Q-Release Slim feature had been damaging GPU PCIe connectors. The scratches are superficial and do not affect the performance or reliability of the graphics card. But given that the Q-Release Slim feature is often found on its most expensive motherboard models, it does not sit well with its users who are likely to have expensive GPUs.

The company eventually released a comment, saying that the damage is caused by typical wear-and-tear, especially if you remove and reattach your graphics card on the motherboard over 60 times.

While the company did not specifically say that owners were using the feature wrong, it also issued official removal guidelines to help prevent GPU pins from getting scratched. Nevertheless, Asus said that any issue caused by the scratches is covered by warranty and that anyone affected should contact it.

We did not hear any statement from Asus North America after that, although the company’s China operations did confirm that it’s working on a revision for the feature.

In the meantime, Gigabyte (through Aorus Japan) went ahead and roasted Asus on the issue, saying that its EZ Latch Plus quick-release feature will not scratch your GPU pins, even after 100 cycles. They even went ahead and posted a video to prove it.

While Asus did not make any statement about updating Q-Release Slim in the U.S., the just-released motherboard on Newegg features a PCIe slot with a tweaked design. We haven’t seen any tests yet that will prove that this will no longer scratch GPUs, but it seems that the removal of the metal piece that directly contacts the area where the scratches are seen would solve the issue.

The company hasn’t issued any recalls on the motherboards affected by the scratching issue, likely because it only affects enthusiasts who frequently detach and reattach their GPUs. After all, the average user will likely install their GPU once and use it until it needs upgrading.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I wasn’t expecting to write about a smartphone that advertises itself as a tank, but here we are. Unihertz, the Chinese brand you probably know for making networking hardware and some of the most fascinating tiny smartphones, has announced the Tank 3 Pro. The “ultimate 5G smartphone” has an intriguing set of features that will pique the interest of anyone living who spends a lot of time outside.

The release of the Tank 3 Pro is under a brand called 8849, which is known for its tough smartphones and tablets jam-packed with features. The flashy feature of the Tank 3 Pro is its 23,800 mAh battery pack, which powers a 100-lumen DLP projector built into the smartphone chassis. Yes, there’s a projector in there with a 1.2:1 throw ratio, so you can stream a movie in the dead of night on the wall of a pitched tent. When you’re not using the projector, there’s a 6.79-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate to gawk at. The processor powering it up is a MediaTek Dimensity 8200 chip with the option of 16 to 18GB of RAM and 512GB of storage—plenty of space to offload movies or hours-long light effects for a camping trip, and it’s expandable up to 2TB. There is even a 200-megapixel primary camera, plus a 64-MP camera with “super night vision.”

This is a smartphone for the great outdoors. The big ass battery pack can last days on a charge. It charges fast, with a maximum charging wattage of 120W. The Tank 3 Pro is IP68 water, dust, and shock resistant, and the projector has a built-in cooling fan for heat dissipation. If you forget your camping lights, the phone has one with adjustable brightness and a red and blue emergency warning light. And so you don’t get lost out there, the Tank 3 Pro includes GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo, and L1+L5 dual-band GPS in the price.

All of this costs $600, which is not bad for a smartphone built to withstand the world and streaming movies on the side of a building. However, there are caveats to getting this kind of niche smartphone. For one, the software update schedule may be slower than you experience with a Pixel or Samsung Galaxy device with a case on top. The Tank 3 Pro doesn’t even ship with the latest version of Android. Also, while the processor is a 4nm process, its benchmarks are ranked among the low-cost subset of smartphones. The Tank 3 Pro does have 16GB of “extended” RAM, so it can throttle itself a little easier than other devices.

Despite the downsides, I love these phones because they genuinely keep the dream of the all-you-need gadget alive and well. I almost want to hit the road in my car with nothing but this phone to see if it gets me out of trouble. You can buy it now online or at Amazon.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Who needs vaccines and Vanicream, when you have raw milk and beef tallow? That’s what the internet thinks, anyway. TikTok (or TallowTok) is currently slathered with devotees hailing beef tallow (yes, the rendered fat from a cow) as a miracle moisturizer. As of March 2025, there have been more than 68.5 million posts on tallow. Brands cash in, while influencers flaunt before-and-after transformations, render tallow from suet, or smear beef lard on their skin, thinking it’s tallow (it’s not).

The backlash against industrialized beauty mirrors anxieties about ultra-processed food. The same people avoiding seed oils in their diets are now seeking beef-fat balms for their faces—it’s not a coincidence that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is selling “Making Frying Oil Tallow Again” merch. But in a rush to eliminate toxins and stick it to big corporations, you may have overlooked other risks. I bought some on the internet and smeared it on myself to figure it out.

A Brief History of Tallow

Cow fat as face cream is not as far out as you might think. For centuries, terrestrial animal fats—beef tallow, lard, and lanolin—were staples in skin care. The Babylonians used ash and rendered fat to craft soap. Over time, tallow found its way into early-candle-making and medicinal remedies. Nineteenth-century ointments relied on them to treat everything from burns and chapped skin to wounds and ingrown nails. Traditional soap was a mix of tallow and coconut oil, and early lipsticks blended animal fat and beeswax. Some tattoo artists will still recommend beef tallow soaps to better preserve ink.

By the 1990s, advances in cosmetic chemistry favored plant-based and synthetic alternatives that offered greater stability and consistency. Safety concerns surrounding bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) also prompted companies to distance themselves from animal-derived ingredients. Though byproducts like collagen, hyaluronic acid, and keratin evolved with modern skin care, tallow was (mostly) left behind.

But now, beef tallow is back.

TikTok content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

This revival is part of a cultural obsession with ancestral living. It’s the same impulse driving the popularity of the carnivore diet, bone broth, and unpasteurized milk. Grand View Research reports that the U.S. tallow market brought in $627.9 million in 2023 and is projected to surpass $1 billion by 2030. At its core is the rejection of modernity, the belief that industrialization has corrupted nature and that the past held purer solutions. The beauty industry, with its preservatives, emulsifiers, and laboratory formulations, has become the enemy. Tallow, by contrast, is framed as a return to the untainted.

Beef tallow is rich in triglycerides and also contains essential vitamins A, D, K, E, and B12. Some studies suggest that tallow can increase fatty acid concentration in the skin, making it a moisturizing agent. However, comparative studies have found that alternatives like pumpkin seed oil and linoleic acid offer superior hydration. While some might tout its “natural” benefits, that word is more marketing than fact.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the only AIOs available in pink

There aren’t many options for pink-colored AIOs. ID-Cooling’s FX360 INF Pink performs well with high-end CPUs, though just like its aesthetic, it isn’t particularly quiet.

Why you can trust Tom's Hardware Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.

It’s fair to say most of the PC market is targeted towards male gamers, with most components available in black or white. But today we’re testing something decidedly more colorful: ID-Cooling’s FX 360 INF Pink. As its name implies, this AIO liquid cooler sets itself apart from its competition with a pink and white theme.

While I’ve already reviewed the standard version of ID-Cooling’s FX360 INF , I’ve learned the hard way that even if a product shares the same name, different colored versions can have different performance levels. A great example of this is Cooler Master’s Cryofuze thermal paste. When I tested thermal pastes last year for an update to our best thermal paste , the white variant of the Cryofuze thermal paste outperformed the black version by 2.5 degrees Celsius!

Will this pink-themed AIO make our list of best coolers on the market? Let’s take a look at the specifications and features of the cooler, then we’ll go over thermal performance and noise levels to see where it lands.

Features of ID-Cooling’s FX360 INF Pink

▶️ Premium Frost X45 thermal paste

The FX360 INF Pink arrives with a tube of ID-Cooling’s premium Frost X45 thermal paste. When I tested thermal pastes last year, the Frost X45 was the best-performing traditional thermal paste!

▶️ Pink aesthetic theme

This AIO is one of the few liquid coolers on the market available in Pink. When I started this review, I looked for competing pink 360mm AIOs, and I could only find two available: ID-Cooling’s previously released Pinkflow 360 (which isn’t widely available) and Vetroo’s V360. So your options are pretty limited if pink is an important part of your cooling plan.

▶️ Cable management clips

Three cable management clips are included to help keep cables and tubing tidy and organized.

▶️ Accessible refill port

I go out of my way to recognize companies when they don’t include a consumer-unfriendly “warranty void if removed” sticker on top of the refill port – an action that’s technically illegal under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act in the USA. ID-Cooling includes an accessible refill port without any warnings so that users who wish to service their equipment can do so – though it is hidden behind a sticker. Most users won’t have to do this during the lifespan of the five-year warranty, but it’s nice to have the option should the need arise.

It is hard to see in this photo, but if you look carefully you can see the outline of the screw behind the white sticker.

▶️ Standard 27mm radiator

The radiator included has a standard 27mm thickness, which means it should fit in the vast majority of PC cases without space constraints.

▶️ 120mm AF-127-Pink fans

There’s more to a cooler than just the heatsink or radiator. The bundled fans have a significant impact on cooling and noise levels, as well as how the cooler looks in your case.

Despite this cooler having a similar name to the previously released FX360 INF, ID-Cooling’s FX360 INF Pink’s fans are different in more than just color. They have higher ratings for static pressure and airflow – and they’re louder, too!

These fans are 27mm thick and have a quick connect system designed to simplify installation while reducing cable clutter. ARGB accents also live on the sides of the fans.

There are many factors other than the CPU cooler that can influence your cooling performance, including the case you use and the fans installed in it. A system's motherboard can also influence this, especially if it suffers from bending , which results in poor cooler contact with the CPU.

To prevent bending from impacting our cooling results, I’ve installed Thermalright’s LGA 1700 contact frame into our testing rig. If your motherboard is affected by bending, your thermal results will be worse than those shown below. Not all motherboards are affected equally by this issue. I tested Raptor Lake CPUs in two motherboards. And while one of them showed significant thermal improvements after installing Thermalright’s LGA1700 contact frame, the other motherboard showed no difference in temperatures whatsoever! Check out our review of the contact frame for more information.

I’ve also tested this cooler with Intel’s latest platform, Arrow Lake and LGA 1851.

LGA 1700 and 1851 installation

The installation of the AIO is simple. These instructions will assume you have attached the fans and radiator to your computer case before proceeding.

1. You’ll first need to place the backplate against the rear of the motherboard.

2. Next you’ll need to take the mounting studs and screw them into the backplate. ID-Cooling includes a tool you can use to make this step easier to complete.

3. Next, you’ll take the mounting bars and place them on top of the studs, securing them with the included screws.

4. Apply the included thermal paste to your CPU. If you have any questions on how to do this properly, please refer to our handy guide on how to apply thermal paste .

5. Place the CPU block on top of the mounting bars, and secure it with a screwdriver.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Unless Microsoft changes its mind at the last minute, Windows 10 will stop receiving free security updates this coming October. For those who can upgrade to Windows 11, the solution is obvious: Run the new OS even if you don’t like it. But there are hundreds of millions – by one estimate 240 million – PCs that don’t meet Microsoft’s stringent Windows 11 hardware requirements.

If you’re a consumer or a business, Microsoft and the PC industry would very much like you to toss these systems in the trash and buy new computers to take their place. But forgotten in this capitalist crush are all the charities that refurbish older computers and give them to people who can’t afford to purchase one.

These non-profits are sitting on a plethora of still-working computers that can’t run Microsoft’s latest OS. Do they give clients a soon-to-be-insecure Windows 10 computer, send older computers to an ewaste recycler, toss them in the trash or try to install some form of Linux?

And Windows 11-ineligible PCs can be pretty recent and powerful. Microsoft’s list of system requirements for Windows 11 seem basic at first glance. You need a 1-GHz or faster CPU with at least two cores, you need 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, Secure Boot capability and TPM 2.0 compatibility.

However, Microsoft’s supported Intel CPU list for Windows 11 only goes back as far as 8th Gen chips (Coffee Lake), which first came out in 2017, and its AMD CPU list only incorporates Ryzen 2000 series (from 2018) and above. That means computers which came out in 2017, 2018 or maybe even 2019 (with a last-gen chip for the time) are ineligible. They could have 16GB of RAM and a 500GB SSD and still not make the cut.

Some of these ineligible computers will continue to run old Windows, others will be loaded with a different OS entirely. Some will end up in ewaste recycling where most of the parts can be reclaimed. However, a good chunk will end up in landfills. According to one estimate, only 14 to 40 percent of U.S. ewaste gets recycled at all.

My 12 year old son and I recently joined a local computer refurbishment charity where we live on Long Island. The folks who run our organization are still installing Windows 10 on non-Windows 11-eligible computers because they don’t want to give our clients an unfamiliar user experience.

Many of the clients are seniors, and they may not have the patience or tenacity to work with a different OS that can’t run all the same software they are used to. School children are used to running Windows in school and would want a computer that more closely mirrors the experience they have in class. Installing a new OS might also mean more support calls from folks who can’t figure out the subtle differences between the Linux desktop and Windows.

However, by sticking with Windows 10, we are also leaving our clients with insecure computers that could put them in some danger when the updates stop in October.

“Deploying Windows 10 at this time is a bad idea,” Chester Wisniewski, who serves as Director and Global Field CISO for Sophos, a major security services company, told us. “The writing is on the wall. Microsoft has made the internal decision to obsolete this equipment, so I guess they just don't want more people to use Windows.”

It almost goes without saying that charity clients won’t be the only ones running Windows 10 later this year. According to Statcounter , Windows 10 still makes up 58.7 percent of all Windows installs versus just 38.1 percent for Windows 11. It seems unlikely that all of those computers will have been upgraded to Windows 11 or replaced with newer, Windows 11 PCs by October.

It seems even more unlikely that those 58.7 percent will be paying $61 per year for Microsoft’s Extended Security Update program , which will bring continued patches to Windows 10 PCs after October 2025. And charities and their clients are extremely unlikely to have the funds or the desire to pay ongoing service fees to keep the OS up-to-date. We asked Microsoft for its take on the situation, but the company would not comment on the record.

So how bad will it really be to run an end-of-lifed Windows 10? Should people worry? Wisniewski and other experts I talked to are unequivocal. You’re at risk.

“To put this in perspective, today [the day we talked] was Patch Tuesday,” he said. “There were 57 vulnerabilities, 6 of which have already been abused by criminals before the fixes were available. There were also 57 in February and 159 in January. Windows 10 and Windows 11 largely have a shared codebase, meaning most, if not all, vulnerabilities each month are exploitable on both OSs. These will be actively turned into digital weapons by criminals and nation-states alike and Windows 10 users will be somewhat defenseless against them.”

So, in short, even though Windows 10 has been around since 2015, there are still massive security holes being patched. Even within the past few weeks, dozens of vulnerabilities were fixed by Microsoft. So what’s a charity to do when these updates are running out and clients will be left vulnerable?

“What we decided to do is one year ahead of the cutoff, we discontinued Windows 10,” said Casey Sorensen, CEO of PCs for People, one of the U.S.’s largest non-profit computer refurbishers. “We will distribute Linux laptops that are 6th or 7th gen. If we distribute a Windows laptop, it will be 8th gen or newer.”

Sorensen said that any PC that’s fifth gen or older will be sent to an ewaste recycler.

PCs for People has refurbishing centers in 11 states and distributes computers throughout the United States. The company sells refurbished computers at very affordable prices, both through its websites and some brick and mortar locations. As of this writing, the website has a ThinkPad T490 with Windows 11 and 8GB of RAM for just $125. Sorensen also said that low-income individuals can qualify for a completely free laptop and others can buy low-cost Internet connectivity so they can get online.

Every year, the company refurbishes 140,000 PCs, most of which are donated by corporations. PCs for people then wipes the drives, puts on a fresh OS and even replaces laptop batteries if they don’t hold a significant amount of their original charge. However, the company also has to send 7 million pounds of ewaste from outdated or unfixable gear to recyclers.

Sorensen, who founded the company in 1998, told us that he’s comfortable giving clients computers that run Linux Mint, a free OS that’s based on Ubuntu. The latest version of Mint, version 22.1, will be supported until 2029.

“Ten years ago if we distributed Linux, they would be like what is it,” he said. But today, he notes that many view their computers as windows to the Internet and, for that, a user-friendly version of Linux is acceptable.

To see what some of Sorensen’s clients experience, I installed Linux Mint 22.1 into a virtual machine on my desktop. The process took more than 30 minutes and while the user interface was very Windows-like, complete with a Start menu button in the lower left corner, it wasn’t Windows. Instead of the Microsoft Store, there’s Software Manager, which lacked a lot of key titles.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Google Chrome browser isn’t in the store, but open-source Chromium is. Instead Firefox was the default browser. You can install Google Chrome if you go to Google’s site and know that you need to download the installer for Ubuntu Linux (I was using Mint, but Mint is based on Ubuntu).

Some of the apps I use most commonly aren’t available for Linux at all, including Microsoft Office, Slack (there’s a beta but no final version) and Notepad++. Instead of the easy-to-use Photoshop Elements, there’s GIMP. Sure, there are alternatives out there, but sometimes you just want the software you’re comfortable with.

While it was easy for me to feel at home on Mint’s “Cinnamon” UI, I wouldn’t hand a computer with this interface to my mother. I’d be getting tons of calls asking me why her fifteen-year-old copy of Print Shop doesn’t work or wondering about how to change settings.

So which choice is right for recyclers with PCs that can’t support Windows 11? Give users a soon-to-be-insecure Windows 10, make them learn Linux or just throw the computer out? Whatever charities choose, there’s sure to be a lot of people running Windows 10 after October and a lot of laptops turning into unnecessary ewaste.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pasqal est un des fleurons français de l’informatique quantique. Auteure d’une levée de fonds de 100 millions d’euros en mars 2024, la startup a déjà livré plusieurs ordinateurs quantiques, notamment au CEA.

Pour développer les usages de sa technologie, Pasqal noue des partenariats avec des géants mondiaux, comme IBM, et désormais Microsoft.

L’accord conclu avec la firme de Redmond prévoit l’intégration de l’accès à ses processeurs quantiques au service cloud Azure Quantum.

Plus grande accessibilité à la technologie quantique

Ce rapprochement signifie pour les clients Azure la mise à disposition de “diverses capacités de calcul quantique analogique pour résoudre des problèmes informatiques complexes.” Pasqal justifie ce partenariat au nom d’une “plus grande accessibilité à la technologie quantique” via le cloud.

La startup le reconnaît, l’adoption en entreprise du quantique se “heurte à certains obstacles”, dont les coûts d’infrastructure élevés. L’accès à de la puissance de calcul quantique par le biais du cloud vise à résoudre cette problématique financière.

“Contrairement aux intégrations classiques de l'informatique quantique, la technologie des atomes neutres de Pasqal offre une évolutivité et une efficacité énergétique”, revendique la deeptech hexagonale.

Une première sur le cloud Azure

“Pasqal est le premier ordinateur quantique à atomes neutres sur le service cloud de Microsoft Azure, une reconnaissance”, se félicite encore Loïc Henriet, le co-CEO de l’entreprise de technologie. Un premier pas avant d’autres accords avec des fournisseurs cloud ?

Pasqal collabore déjà depuis juin dernier avec IBM, un acteur de référence du quantique et du calcul haute performance. L’accord entre les deux partenaires vise d’ailleurs en partie à hybrider quantique et HPC.

Avec IBM, Pasqal prévoit également de développer les usages de l’informatique quantique dans les domaines de la chimie et de la science des matériaux. La pépite française est aussi présente dans l’automobile avec BMW et l’industrie pétrolière aux côtés du géant Saudi Aramco.

Saudi Aramco s’équipe auprès de Pasqal d’un ordinateur quantique d'une puissance de 200 qubits. Le lancement est prévu pour le second semestre 2025. Pasqal se chargera de l'installation, mais aussi de la maintenance et de l'exploitation de l'appareil.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Welcome to Edition 7.35 of the Rocket Report! SpaceX's steamroller is still rolling, but for the first time in many years, it doesn't seem like it's rolling downhill. After a three-year run of perfect performance—with no launch failures or any other serious malfunctions—SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket has suffered a handful of issues in recent months. Meanwhile, SpaceX's next-generation Starship rocket is having problems, too. Kiko Dontchev, SpaceX's vice president of launch, addressed some (but not all) of these concerns in a post on X this week. Despite the issues with the Falcon 9, SpaceX has maintained a remarkable launch cadence. As of Thursday, SpaceX has launched 28 Falcon 9 flights since January 1, ahead of last year's pace.

As always, we welcome reader submissions. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.

Alpha rocket preps for weekend launch. While Firefly Aerospace is making headlines for landing on the Moon, its Alpha rocket is set to launch again as soon as Saturday morning from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. The two-stage, kerosene-fueled rocket will launch a self-funded technology demonstration satellite for Lockheed Martin. It's the first of up to 25 launches Lockheed Martin has booked with Firefly over the next five years. This launch will be the sixth flight of an Alpha rocket, which has become a leader in the US commercial launch industry for dedicated missions with 1 ton-class satellites.

Firefly's OG ... The Alpha rocket was Firefly's first product, and it has been a central piece of the company's development since 2014. Like Firefly itself, the Alpha rocket program has gone through multiple iterations, including a wholesale redesign nearly a decade ago. Sure, Firefly can't claim any revolutionary firsts with the Alpha rocket, as it can with its Blue Ghost lunar lander. But without Alpha, Firefly wouldn't be where it is today. The Texas-based firm is one of only four US companies with an operational orbital-class rocket. One thing to watch for is how quickly Firefly can ramp up its Alpha launch cadence. The rocket only flew once last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Electric blankets—especially ones older than 10 years old—have become a bit infamous for being fire hazards. But when it comes to safety, modern heated blankets have come leaps and bounds past their predecessors. Look for independently tested blankets and bedding that have met safety standards (such UL or ETL). These agencies ensure that the blankets can handle wear and tear, that they don’t get too hot, that they’re machine washable, and more.

Make sure to treat electric blankets gently. You don’t want to fold them tightly, ball them up, or otherwise damage the inner electric components. You shouldn’t use heavy bedding on top of heated blankets or wrap them too closely around your body—it can cause overheating. (I experienced this when I fell asleep underneath mine wrapped up like a burrito and woke up hours later drenched in sweat.)

You shouldn’t plug your blanket into an extension cord, and you should never leave the blanket on if you’re not using it. Keep it out of reach of pets, kids, or anyone with reduced heat sensitivity who might not be able to tell if they’re getting too hot. Make sure the heated blanket is fully dry after washing before you use it again. And finally, be on the lookout for anything amiss, like strange smells or spotty performance. If you encounter these scenarios, immediately unplug the blanket and reach out to the manufacturer for further instructions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While the whole market was looking at the appointment of Lip-Bu Tan as Intel chief executive, there was another major development at the company this week: The first 18A (1.8nm-class) wafers are running around Intel's Arizona fab. Intel's Fab 52 and Fab 62 in Arizona are high-volume production facilities, so running 18A fabs there is a major milestone for the company.

The most important $INTC announcement today wasn't the CEO announcement.It was 18A wafers coming off the line at their new fab in Arizona. This fab is only meant to start output mid 25 so it looks like it is ahead of schedule.Congratulations to all the @Intel engineers! 🔥🔥 pic.twitter.com/730Otd4B3pMarch 13, 2025

"Exciting Milestone for Intel 18A," wrote Pankaj Marria, an engineering manager at Intel, in a LinkedIn post that was eventually hidden but captured by @Mojo_flyin on X. "Proud to be part of the Eagle Team, leading the way in bringing Intel 18A technology to life! Our team was at the forefront of running the initial lots right here in Arizona, marking a key step in advancing cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing."

Up until recently, Intel processed wafers on its 18A production technology at its site near Hillsboro, Oregon, where new manufacturing processes are developed. While the company can volume produce chips in Oregon as well, porting this new fabrication process to a brand-new fab in Arizona is indeed a milestone for the company.

For now, the company is running test wafers to ensure that the fabrication process transfer is a success, but eventually the fab will start running actual chips for commercial products.

Intel is set to mass produce compute chiplets for its upcoming codenamed Panther Lake processors on 18A technology later this year. Eventually, Intel's 18A production node will be used to make Intel's Xeon 7 codenamed Clearwater Forest processor for datacenters.

Intel pins a lot of hope on the upcoming 18A fabrication process. The manufacturing technology relies on gate-all-around RibbonFET transistors that promise to increase performance and cut down power consumption.

It also features backside power delivery, which is meant to ensure steady power delivery to power-hungry processors and increase transistor density by decoupling signal and power wires within a chip.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A chaque nouvelle technologie, les opérateurs télécoms ont une propension à survendre ses performances quitte à tordre le cou à la réalité. Après la 5G qui n’a pas créé l’effet « waouh » espéré lors de son lancement commercial, il y a près de quatre ans et demi, le phénomène se répète avec le WiFi 7.

La nouvelle norme de communication sans fil est censée apporter un débit multiplié par cinq et des capacités de bande passante accrues.

Des arguments qui peuvent faire pencher la décision d’un particulier au moment de souscrire un nouvel abonnement internet. Alors que les usages numériques se multiplient et que les foyers français possèdent en moyenne plus de dix terminaux, du smartphone à l’enceinte connectée, disposer d’une bonne connexion Wifi devient un enjeu clé.

Présentation trompeuse et dénigrement

En France, Bouygues Telecom et Free ont lancé une offre de box WiFi 7 et le premier s’estime lésé par la communication du second. Selon des informations de L’Informé, confirmées par Les Echos, la filiale du groupe de BTP a assigné l’opérateur, propriété de Xavier Niel, devant le tribunal de commerce de Paris, pour présentation trompeuse.

Fin janvier 2024, lors du lancement de sa nouvelle Freebox Ultra, la filiale du groupe Iliad a revendiqué, avec toute l’emphase qu’on lui connaît, être « le tout premier opérateur au monde à lancer le WiFi 7 à grande échelle. » Intégrant près d’un an plus tard cette nouvelle technologie, Bouygues Telecom n’a pas apprécié de se faire griller la politesse.

Lors de la présentation de sa dernière Bbox, Bouygues Telecom a rappelé qu’il proposait le « vrai » WiFi 7, revendiquant, à la différence de son concurrent, la certification de la WiFi Alliance. Garant de la technologie sans fil, ce consortium international a précisément défini les spécificités techniques associées au dernier standard en date. C’était le 8 janvier 2024, quelques jours avant le lancement de la Freebox Ultra.

En cela, Bouygues Telecom pouvait prétendre être le premier opérateur en France à commercialiser une box fibre certifiée WiFi 7. La filiale du groupe Bouygues s’estime, par ailleurs, dénigrée par le patron de Free. Lors du lancement de la Freebox Ultra, Xavier Niel a, comme à son habitude, multiplié les piques à la concurrence.

Free et Bouygues Telecom, un lourd contentieux juridique

Ce nouvel épisode judiciaire ne fait qu’alimenter le lourd contentieux entre Bouygues Telecom et Free. Après avoir écopé l’an dernier d’une lourde amende dans l’affaire dite des smartphones subventionnés, le premier a poursuit le second pour pratiques commerciales trompeuses.

Cette affaire de vrai WiFi rappelle d’ailleurs l’épisode de la « fausse 5G ». En novembre dernier, Free a été condamné par la Cour d’Appel de Paris pour avoir communiqué de façon trompeuse sur les performances de son réseau 5G lors de la commercialisation de ses premières offres. L’association Familles Rurales, qui poursuivait l’opérateur, lui reprochait « d’induire sciemment les consommateurs en erreur quant aux performances de son réseau ».

La surenchère marketing autour de la 5G+ pourrait produire les mêmes effet. Le marché télécoms constitue, de toutes façons, un terrain propice aux litiges. Dans une enquête datant de 2023, la répression des fraudes en concluait que plus d’un quart des opérateurs ont des pratiques commerciales douteuses, entre les fausses promotions, les abonnements forcés ou les manquements aux règles de la vente à distance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Appleはワイヤレスイヤホン「AirPods」にリアルタイム翻訳機能を追加する計画だと、Bloombergが米国時間3月13日に報じた。

Bloombergは「事情に詳しい人物」の話としてこの情報を伝えている。Appleの広報担当者はコメントの依頼にすぐには応じなかった。

Bloombergによれば、この機能は2025年内に提供される見込みで、Appleの次期モバイルOS「iOS 19」と連携するAirPods向けソフトウェアアップグレードの一部になるようだ。

使い方は想像通りだ。誰かが外国語を話している場合、「iPhone」が相手の発言をユーザーの言語に翻訳してAirPodsに送信し、その逆も行う。ユーザーが自分の言語で話すと、iPhoneがそれを翻訳して相手の言語で再生してくれる。まさに「スタートレック」の万能翻訳機さながらだ。

Bloombergは、Appleが2020年からiPhone向けに「翻訳」アプリを提供していることにも触れている。米CNETの編集者であるBridget Careyは、2024年のスペイン旅行時にこのアプリを使い、翻訳したい内容を音声や文字で入力したり、美術館で説明文にiPhoneのカメラを向けてリアルタイム翻訳させたりしたという。

なお、Googleの「Pixel Buds」など一部の競合製品は、こうした機能を何年も前から備えている。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Back in 2020, when the COVID pandemic was still new, everyone was "sheltering in place" and bingeing films and television. Pandemic-related fare proved especially popular, including the 1995 medical disaster-thriller Outbreak, starring Dustin Hoffman. Chalk it up to morbid curiosity, which some researchers have suggested is an evolved response mechanism for dealing with threats by learning from imagined experiences. Outbreak turned 30 this week, making this the perfect time to revisit the film.

(Spoilers for Outbreak abound below.)

Outbreak deals with the re-emergence of a deadly virus called Motaba, 28 years after it first appeared in an African jungle, infecting US soldiers and many others. The US military secretly destroyed the camp to conceal evidence of the virus, a project overseen by Major General Donald McClintock (Donald Sutherland) and Brigadier General William Ford (Morgan Freeman). When it re-emerges in Zaire decades later, a military doctor, Colonel Sam Daniels (Hoffman), takes a team to the afflicted village to investigate, only to find the entire town has died.

Daniels takes blood samples and realizes the villagers had been infected by a deadly new virus. But Ford shrugs off Daniels' concerns about a potential global spread, not wanting the truth to come out about the bombing of the village nearly 30 years ago. Daniels alerts his estranged ex-wife, Dr. Roberta "Robby" Keough, who works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about the virus, and she, too, is initially unconcerned.

Meanwhile, a local monkey is captured and brought to the US as an exotic pet. A smuggler named Jimbo (Patrick Dempsey)—who works at an animal testing facility—tries to sell the monkey to a pet shop owner named Rudy (Daniel Chodos) in the fictional town of Cedar Creek, California. The monkey bites Rudy. Unable to sell the monkey, Jimbo lets it loose in the woods and flies home to Boston. Both Jimbo and his girlfriend (who greets him at Logan Airport and passionately kisses a feverish Jimbo right before he collapses) die from the virus.

Naturally Keough hears about the Boston cases and realizes Daniels was right—the new virus has found its way to American soil. Initially she thinks there aren't any other cases, but then Rudy's demise comes to light, along with the death of a hospital technician who became infected after accidentally breaking a vial of Rudy's blood during testing. When the virus strikes down a cinema filled with moviegoers, Daniels and Keough realize the virus has mutated and become airborne.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The classic arcade game Asteroids is so accessible and timeless that every time I see a vector graphics triangle, it acts as a reminder of the retro gaming era. The original arcade cabinet hit the scene in 1979, while the more familiar Atari 2600 title debuted in 1981. Forty-five years after the game’s debut, Atari worked with watch brand Nubeo to create a series of limited edition mechanical timepieces to mark the anniversary. I’ve slapped one around my wrist, and now, whenever I look down, I can almost hear the UFO sound effect warbling in my mind.

The company sent us one of the limited edition watches for review. Ours is the Nebula Blue, numbered 104 out of 125. The classic triangular ship in the center of the watch face spins indefinitely, acting as the seconds hand. Two flying saucers tick out the hours and minutes, slowly rotating around the center. The rest of the stenciled asteroids are merely decoration. It takes more than a few seconds of squinting to gauge the time on the crowded watch face. In dim light, the blue UFO tends to blend into the background.

What’s the point of a watch that’s not great for telling the time? Kids these days may have difficulty reading the hands on analog clocks, but the Nubeo and Atari collaboration seems very specific to the aging gamer with rose-colored glasses for a past age of gaming. The default silicon watch band and its fancy clasp are built for medium-to-large-sized wrists. I’m an average-sized adult male, and I needed to use the smallest bead on the band to keep it from sliding down while typing out this review.

The Nubeo-Atari collab is a hypnotic scene of floating rocks on a black field. It’s also a large watch face that is 50mm and 16mm thick. With those specs, the watch isn’t light either at 179 grams or nearly .4 pounds. At the very least, it’s a well-constructed timepiece. It uses a Japanese automatic watch system powered by wrist movement rather than a battery. It sports a sapphire lens with a stainless steel case in both black and brushed metal. To round off the aesthetic, so many little accents make this watch unique, from the Atari logo on the crown to the stenciled asteroids on the back of the watch.

All the different versions of the Atari-Nubeo collab are limited edition, and the version in my possession is currently sold out. The stated MSRP is $1,650, but we doubt it will ever leave the sale price of $500 before stock runs dry. Even that price point is a lot for a watch, especially for those not used to dropping multiple Benjamins on a single accessory.

There’s something to be said for gamer chic, but this seems designed for older nerds with deep pockets. The $500 price is more than many are willing to spend on a solid smartwatch today. An Apple Watch Series 9 starts at $400, and that’s at the high end of what you can get without opting for “Ultra” variants. I’m not one to regularly accessorize, but I was already such a big fan of the Timestop D-20 watch (which I still regularly wear to my TRPG table), I now plan to take the Nubeo on the road with me.

I’m not a member of the generation who could have played Asteroids in its glory days. Instead, I’ve played the classic game on aging cabinets in the odd barcade, or failed to keep my ship alive for more than a few levels on the Atari 7800+. The game is still one of the most interesting designs of the arcade era. Players don’t just need to factor in momentum, but the “hyperspace” mechanic where you and asteroids can dive through one side of the screen and come out on the other.

Before spending $500 on a watch, consider a few more things. For one, it’s only rated 5 ATM, which is water—and dust-resistant only to a certain extent. You should be safe dunking it in water but can’t snorkel with it. Each watch has a two-year warranty for any defect with the mechanics or materials. According to the watch’s manual, the warranty doesn’t cover damage to the lens or strap and normal wear and tear.

This is the watch I would wear to my nerdiest shindigs if I were inclined to show off. Already, people in my office were asking me about it, and if you want to strike up a conversation, there are worse—or at least more expensive—ways to make yourself stand out. If Asteroids were the kind of game to make time fly by, why would you want a watch to remind you how much time you spent playing?</p>

横浜から日本全国のビジネスパーソンの

働き方を変えたい 國谷 ハリントンさんは、アトラシアンに入社されてからどのくらいになりますか？ ハリントン氏 私が入社したのは12年前になります。アトラシアンの日本法人を作ることが私の最初の仕事でした。会社を設立し、私が第一号社員になりました。 國谷 日本では一貫して横浜を拠点にされています。何かこだわりがあるのでしょうか？ ハリントン氏 実は最初は渋谷でスタートしたのですが、私自身が鎌倉で長く暮らしていることもあって、横浜スタジアムの近くに素晴らしい物件が見つかったんです。実際に移転してみると、横浜の利点がたくさん見えてきました。交通の便がよく、東京にもほど近い。その後は馬車道へ移転したのですが、築100年以上の歴史ある倉庫をオフィスにできました。天井高6メートルという開放的な空間で、横浜らしい環境です。そして現在は観光地として世界中の人も訪れるみなとみらいのランドマークタワーをオフィスにしています。 子供の頃、教科書で学ばれたかもしれませんが、江戸末期に横浜が開港しました。開港後、海外の文化を横浜から日本全国に広げたという歴史があります。諸説ありますがたとえば、ビールやアイスといった嗜好品、電話や水道のような社会インフラ、そしてラグビーやテニスといったスポーツ。横浜には 日本の近代化を支えた多くの「初めて」があるんです。アトラシアンがグローバルで培ってきたモダンな働き方。これを横浜から日本中に広げていければと考えています。

急速な成長を続けるアトラシアン

秘訣はチームワーク 國谷 アトラシアンは2002年の創業から20年以上、継続的な成長を遂げています。 ハリントン氏 アトラシアンは23年前、オーストラリアの2人の学生が「ネクタイをしたくない」という理由で始めた会社なんです。当初はカスタマーサービスを行う会社に技術サポートを提供することを生業とする会社を作ろうとしていました。しかしオーストラリアはどこへ行くにも10時間かかることから、コラボレーションの重要性に気づき、課題・プロジェクト管理ツールである「Jira」を開発したのです。 Jiraの提供をはじめたら、コアビジネスよりも成功してしまったため、ソフトウェアビジネスへと舵を切りました。その後すぐに、2つ目の製品としてエンタープライズ・ウィキ「Confluence」を投入。最近ではサービスマネジメントのニーズに応えて、「Jira Service Management（JSM）」を展開しています。 今ではグローバルの社員数が1万3,000人以上の規模になり、製品数も10を超えています。現在も成長しつづけていますし、2024年10月～12月でも20％以上の成長を記録しています。 アトラシアンは開発者向けのツールを提供する会社というイメージが特に日本では強いのですが、世界のユーザーの半分は営業やマーケティング、人事などのビジネス部門であるという点も成長の要因のひとつだと思います。 國谷 継続的な成長を遂げてこられた秘訣は何でしょうか？ ハリントン氏 ひとつは製品開発に多大な投資を行っているという点があります。私たちの提供するツールは現在、クラウドから提供するSaaSの形態をとっています。お客様からサポートにくる問い合わせやご依頼、そしてコミュニティからの生の声を製品の機能改善に活かし、新機能をお客様に提供するというよいサイクルができあがっています。お客様の声から製品を改善し、それによってさらにお客様が増え、より多くのフィードバックを得られる。また製品を改善して、より多くの方に使っていただけるというわけです。 また、私たちはいくつか重要な価値観を持っています。その中でも特に重視しているのが「チーム」という価値観です。証券取引所に上場する際のティッカーシンボルを、企業略称ではなく「TEAM」にしたほどです。 一人では大きなことはできない。1プラス1が3になるようなチームを作ろうという考えです。F1レースのピットワークのように、数秒で作業を完了させるには、全員が息を合わせる必要がある。みんなで上を目指すというチームワークの文化を、今も変わらず大切にしています。 國谷 アトラシアンはDevOpsやサービスマネジメント以外の領域でも高く評価されています。 ハリントン氏 複数の調査会社から複数の分野でリーダーポジションの評価を受けているのは重要なことと感じます。特にフォーチューン誌の「これからの会社トップ50」で1位になったのはすごいことです。Open AIやSnowflakeよりも上位に評価されたのは、私 も驚きました（笑）。 2024年からはマーケティングマネジメントプラットフォームというアナリスト企業による新しいカテゴリーでも高く評価されていますし、ユーザー数もこれまで以上に伸びています。開発者だけでなく、IT運用やビジネスパーソンにも広く使われるようになりました。 私たちはプラットフォームとしての価値を特に重視しています。今後ますますAIの重要性が高まりますが、AIの力を最大限に活かすには、企業内で何が起きているかを可視化できる環境が重要であるからです。アトラシアンのプラットフォームはそれを実現できる位置にいると考えています。

真のチームワーク文化を醸成するアトラシアン 國谷 アトラシアンといえばJiraが非常に有名ですが、その他のツールも注目度が高いようです。 ハリントン氏 世界全体で見ると、Jiraは12万社以上にご利用いただいていますが、Confluenceも10万社、Jira Service Managementは5万5000社、非同期ビデオメッセージングツールの「Loom」に至っては20万社にご利用いただいています。特に日本ではConfluenceのファンが多いように思います。文書作成や情報共有に対する意識が高いせいかもしれません。 また最近では、「Jira Service Management（JSM）」の伸びが顕著です。比率で見ると、おそらく過去最高の成長率を記録しているのではないでしょうか。サービスデスクの効率化や人件費の最適化を目指す企業が増えています。 特にグローバル企業では、Jira Service ManagementとConfluenceを組み合わせて使うケースが増えています。日本は人材不足が深刻化していますから、この組み合わせで効率を上げていく方向性は、とても理にかなっていると思います。 國谷 日本企業のコラボレーションやサービスマネジメントについて、どのような課題を感じていらっしゃいますか？ ハリントン氏 特に日本企業では、情報を自分で抱え込んでしまう傾向が強いようです。「秘伝のタレ」のように、情報を公開しないことが勝利につながるという文化があったためでしょう。しかし、生産性の低下やグローバル競争の激化など、多くの課題に直面している現代企業は、変化しなければならない時期に来ています。 ただし、テクノロジー、カルチャー、実践(Practice)という3つの要素が揃わないと変革は難しいものです。アトラシアン以外に、これら3つすべてを提供できる企業は少ないと思います。技術も、成功事例も、そして変革の手法も、すべてお見せできます。 最近では、グローバルに事業を展開している日本企業からの相談が増えています。海外子会社がアトラシアンを活用しているため、「これを機にプラットフォームを統一したい」というご要望をいただきます。開発部門でJiraとConfluenceを使うところから始め、これらのツールをビジネス部門へ展開、さらにサービスマネジメントへと広がっていく。そういったパターンが多いですね。 國谷アトラシアンのツール群は、企業全体のプラットフォームとして導入することが理想と感じます。 ハリントン氏 もともとアトラシアンは、ジムコリンズの『ビジョナリーカンパニー』で取り上げられている「フライホイール（弾み車）」モデルを採用しており、とても手ごろな価格で自らオンライン購入できるのが特長で、10人～100人の部署単位で導入されることが多かったんです。ところがユーザー企業の上層部から「社内のたくさんのグループがアトラシアンのツールを使っているようだが、一つの契約にできないか」という相談が増えてきました。 そこで私たちは、Jira、Confluence、LoomそしてRovoをすべてのチームのプラットフォームとして構築し、その上に開発者向けのポートフォリオ、IT運用やサポートチーム向けのポートフォリオ、そして経営者向けのポートフォリオを配置しました。これによって、経営層は企業戦略とポートフォリオ管理を行い、アプリケーション開発部門はDevOpsによってデジタルサービスを素早く開発・展開、運用とサポート部門はITSM関連の製品を使いITとビジネスのサービス管理を行うことが可能になります。これが理想的な形です。 もちろん、私たちのソフトウェアだけでビジネス全体を回せるわけではありません。他社製品とのインターフェースも用意していますので、アトラシアンプラットフォームをビジネスのハブとして導入いただくことが可能になるとともに、重複したソフトウェアを整理 することでコスト削減につながりますし、企業全体としての情報共有とコラボレーションがスムーズになります。

横浜から日本全国のビジネスパーソンの

働き方を変えたい 國谷 ハリントンさんは、アトラシアンに入社されてからどのくらいになりますか？ ハリントン氏 私が入社したのは12年前になります。アトラシアンの日本法人を作ることが私の最初の仕事でした。会社を設立し、私が第一号社員になりました。 國谷 日本では一貫して横浜を拠点にされています。何かこだわりがあるのでしょうか？ ハリントン氏 実は最初は渋谷でスタートしたのですが、私自身が鎌倉で長く暮らしていることもあって、横浜スタジアムの近くに素晴らしい物件が見つかったんです。実際に移転してみると、横浜の利点がたくさん見えてきました。交通の便がよく、東京にもほど近い。その後は馬車道へ移転したのですが、築100年以上の歴史ある倉庫をオフィスにできました。天井高6メートルという開放的な空間で、横浜らしい環境です。そして現在は観光地として世界中の人も訪れるみなとみらいのランドマークタワーをオフィスにしています。 子供の頃、教科書で学ばれたかもしれませんが、江戸末期に横浜が開港しました。開港後、海外の文化を横浜から日本全国に広げたという歴史があります。諸説ありますがたとえば、ビールやアイスといった嗜好品、電話や水道のような社会インフラ、そしてラグビーやテニスといったスポーツ。横浜には 日本の近代化を支えた多くの「初めて」があるんです。アトラシアンがグローバルで培ってきたモダンな働き方。これを横浜から日本中に広げていければと考えています。

急速な成長を続けるアトラシアン

秘訣はチームワーク 國谷 アトラシアンは2002年の創業から20年以上、継続的な成長を遂げています。 ハリントン氏 アトラシアンは23年前、オーストラリアの2人の学生が「ネクタイをしたくない」という理由で始めた会社なんです。当初はカスタマーサービスを行う会社に技術サポートを提供することを生業とする会社を作ろうとしていました。しかしオーストラリアはどこへ行くにも10時間かかることから、コラボレーションの重要性に気づき、課題・プロジェクト管理ツールである「Jira」を開発したのです。 Jiraの提供をはじめたら、コアビジネスよりも成功してしまったため、ソフトウェアビジネスへと舵を切りました。その後すぐに、2つ目の製品としてエンタープライズ・ウィキ「Confluence」を投入。最近ではサービスマネジメントのニーズに応えて、「Jira Service Management（JSM）」を展開しています。 今ではグローバルの社員数が1万3,000人以上の規模になり、製品数も10を超えています。現在も成長しつづけていますし、2024年10月～12月でも20％以上の成長を記録しています。 アトラシアンは開発者向けのツールを提供する会社というイメージが特に日本では強いのですが、世界のユーザーの半分は営業やマーケティング、人事などのビジネス部門であるという点も成長の要因のひとつだと思います。 國谷 継続的な成長を遂げてこられた秘訣は何でしょうか？ ハリントン氏 ひとつは製品開発に多大な投資を行っているという点があります。私たちの提供するツールは現在、クラウドから提供するSaaSの形態をとっています。お客様からサポートにくる問い合わせやご依頼、そしてコミュニティからの生の声を製品の機能改善に活かし、新機能をお客様に提供するというよいサイクルができあがっています。お客様の声から製品を改善し、それによってさらにお客様が増え、より多くのフィードバックを得られる。また製品を改善して、より多くの方に使っていただけるというわけです。 また、私たちはいくつか重要な価値観を持っています。その中でも特に重視しているのが「チーム」という価値観です。証券取引所に上場する際のティッカーシンボルを、企業略称ではなく「TEAM」にしたほどです。 一人では大きなことはできない。1プラス1が3になるようなチームを作ろうという考えです。F1レースのピットワークのように、数秒で作業を完了させるには、全員が息を合わせる必要がある。みんなで上を目指すというチームワークの文化を、今も変わらず大切にしています。 國谷 アトラシアンはDevOpsやサービスマネジメント以外の領域でも高く評価されています。 ハリントン氏 複数の調査会社から複数の分野でリーダーポジションの評価を受けているのは重要なことと感じます。特にフォーチューン誌の「これからの会社トップ50」で1位になったのはすごいことです。Open AIやSnowflakeよりも上位に評価されたのは、私 も驚きました（笑）。 2024年からはマーケティングマネジメントプラットフォームというアナリスト企業による新しいカテゴリーでも高く評価されていますし、ユーザー数もこれまで以上に伸びています。開発者だけでなく、IT運用やビジネスパーソンにも広く使われるようになりました。 私たちはプラットフォームとしての価値を特に重視しています。今後ますますAIの重要性が高まりますが、AIの力を最大限に活かすには、企業内で何が起きているかを可視化できる環境が重要であるからです。アトラシアンのプラットフォームはそれを実現できる位置にいると考えています。

真のチームワーク文化を醸成するアトラシアン 國谷 アトラシアンといえばJiraが非常に有名ですが、その他のツールも注目度が高いようです。 ハリントン氏 世界全体で見ると、Jiraは12万社以上にご利用いただいていますが、Confluenceも10万社、Jira Service Managementは5万5000社、非同期ビデオメッセージングツールの「Loom」に至っては20万社にご利用いただいています。特に日本ではConfluenceのファンが多いように思います。文書作成や情報共有に対する意識が高いせいかもしれません。 また最近では、「Jira Service Management（JSM）」の伸びが顕著です。比率で見ると、おそらく過去最高の成長率を記録しているのではないでしょうか。サービスデスクの効率化や人件費の最適化を目指す企業が増えています。 特にグローバル企業では、Jira Service ManagementとConfluenceを組み合わせて使うケースが増えています。日本は人材不足が深刻化していますから、この組み合わせで効率を上げていく方向性は、とても理にかなっていると思います。 國谷 日本企業のコラボレーションやサービスマネジメントについて、どのような課題を感じていらっしゃいますか？ ハリントン氏 特に日本企業では、情報を自分で抱え込んでしまう傾向が強いようです。「秘伝のタレ」のように、情報を公開しないことが勝利につながるという文化があったためでしょう。しかし、生産性の低下やグローバル競争の激化など、多くの課題に直面している現代企業は、変化しなければならない時期に来ています。 ただし、テクノロジー、カルチャー、実践(Practice)という3つの要素が揃わないと変革は難しいものです。アトラシアン以外に、これら3つすべてを提供できる企業は少ないと思います。技術も、成功事例も、そして変革の手法も、すべてお見せできます。 最近では、グローバルに事業を展開している日本企業からの相談が増えています。海外子会社がアトラシアンを活用しているため、「これを機にプラットフォームを統一したい」というご要望をいただきます。開発部門でJiraとConfluenceを使うところから始め、これらのツールをビジネス部門へ展開、さらにサービスマネジメントへと広がっていく。そういったパターンが多いですね。 國谷アトラシアンのツール群は、企業全体のプラットフォームとして導入することが理想と感じます。 ハリントン氏 もともとアトラシアンは、ジムコリンズの『ビジョナリーカンパニー』で取り上げられている「フライホイール（弾み車）」モデルを採用しており、とても手ごろな価格で自らオンライン購入できるのが特長で、10人～100人の部署単位で導入されることが多かったんです。ところがユーザー企業の上層部から「社内のたくさんのグループがアトラシアンのツールを使っているようだが、一つの契約にできないか」という相談が増えてきました。 そこで私たちは、Jira、Confluence、LoomそしてRovoをすべてのチームのプラットフォームとして構築し、その上に開発者向けのポートフォリオ、IT運用やサポートチーム向けのポートフォリオ、そして経営者向けのポートフォリオを配置しました。これによって、経営層は企業戦略とポートフォリオ管理を行い、アプリケーション開発部門はDevOpsによってデジタルサービスを素早く開発・展開、運用とサポート部門はITSM関連の製品を使いITとビジネスのサービス管理を行うことが可能になります。これが理想的な形です。 もちろん、私たちのソフトウェアだけでビジネス全体を回せるわけではありません。他社製品とのインターフェースも用意していますので、アトラシアンプラットフォームをビジネスのハブとして導入いただくことが可能になるとともに、重複したソフトウェアを整理 することでコスト削減につながりますし、企業全体としての情報共有とコラボレーションがスムーズになります。

AIから見えるデータを重視すると統合プラットフォームが理想 國谷 多くの企業が成長や効率化のためにAI活用を検討していますが、アトラシアンにはどのような優位性があるのでしょうか？ ハリントン氏 AIのパワーそのものも必要ですが、むしろ“どのデータを見られるのか”という視点が重要だと考えています。アトラシアンのプラットフォームは企業内の事象、各部門の社員が何をしているかをすべて見える環境となっています。 具体的には、全社のデータにアクセスでき、誰が何を行っているのか、何を話し合ったのか、過去の活動履歴も可視化できます。自社のデータや取り組みがどのようにつながっているかがわかるという点で、アトラシアンは大きな価値を提供できます。 國谷 日本のユーザーでもAIの活用は進んでいるのでしょうか？ ハリントン氏 正直に申し上げると、まだ実験的な段階です。世界中がAIに注目している状況ですから、日本企業もどうしようかと考えている段階でしょう。 ただ申し上げたいのは、アトラシアンを使い始めると止まらないという点です。特にマーケティング部門では、企画段階などでAIを活用すると、今まで浮かんでこなかったようなアイデアがどんどん出てくるのです。英語の契約書を受け取ったときには、翻訳するだけでなくサマリーまでAIが作成してくれます。プロンプトを書くことなくアトラシアン上のすべてのデータを活用できる点が重宝します。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Happy Pi Day! We celebrate pi on March 14 because 3-14 gives the first three digits of this famous number. But what’s the big deal about pi anyway? Why does it get a day? Well, for starters, it defines the simplest, most perfect shape, the circle. So it’s everywhere around you. Pi is the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle: π = C/d.

No matter how big or small a circle is, that ratio is always the same. In decimal notation, it’s 3.141592653 … aaand you can run that out as far as you want, because it’s an irrational number, and it never, ever, ever ends.

What people do—in fact what calculators do if you press the π button—is choose a certain number of decimal places, depending on the precision required, and round off to that number. It’s not really pi, but you could say … it’s a piece of pi. (Sorry, but every Pi Day story needs a pi pun.)

Irrational Is as Irrational Does

Being infinitely long doesn’t in itself make a number irrational. For example, say you have a rectangle that measures 4 by 11 meters. The ratio of the sides, 4/11, equals 0.36363636 … This number is also endless, but it follows a pattern. With irrational numbers, there’s no repetition.

The real distinction is that rational numbers can be written as a ratio of two integers. (Get it? ratio-nal.) And ratios are the same thing as fractions. So:

It’s also the case that any finite decimal number, no matter how long, can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. (Which is pretty mind-boggling all by itself.) Irrational numbers, on the other hand, can’t be expressed in fractional form.</p>

本連載「松岡功の『今週の明言』」では毎週、ICT業界のキーパーソンたちが記者会見やイベントなどで明言した言葉を幾つか取り上げ、その意味や背景などを解説している。

今回は、デル・テクノロジーズ 執行役員 インフラストラクチャー・ソリューションズ営業統括本部 製品本部 本部長の上原宏氏と、アクセンチュア Accenture Song Design & Digital Products マネジング・ディレクターの野田慎太郎氏の「明言」を紹介する。

「当社がデータセンター運営事業をやることはない」

（デル・テクノロジーズ 執行役員 インフラストラクチャー・ソリューションズ営業統括本部 製品本部 本部長の上原宏氏）

米Dell Technologies（以下、Dell）の日本法人デル・テクノロジーズ（以下、デル）の上原氏は、同社が先頃開いたサーバーの最新動向とコンピューティング技術の進化に関する記者説明会の質疑応答で、「Dellがデータセンター運営事業をやることはないのか」と聞いた筆者の質問に、上記のように答えた。現在やっていない事業を「やることはない」と答えたものなので、わざわざ取り上げる発言かと見る向きもあろうが、この質問の背景にあるこれまでの同社の動きと筆者の意見を述べたいので、「明言」として取り上げた。

会見の内容は関連記事をご覧いただくとして、ここでは上原氏の発言に注目したい。

その前に、上原氏が会見の冒頭で示した2つの図を紹介しておきたい。

図1は、1400年ごろからのテクノロジーの進化の軌跡を示したグラフである。

「かつてのテクノロジーは、基本的には“高速化”によって伝達や移動の手段を革新しようというものだった。加えて、豊かなライフサイクルを追求してきた。その進化のスピードが、2000年から今までの四半世紀、加速度をつけて進んでいる。そして、“自動化・効率化”によってこれまで人がやってきたことをAIが代行する時代が到来しようとしている」（上原氏）

（図2）コンピューティング技術の主なマイルストーン（出典：デル・テクノロジーズの会見資料） （図2）コンピューティング技術の主なマイルストーン（出典：デル・テクノロジーズの会見資料）

今回の会見は基本的にサーバーの話なので、この図もインフラベースのキーワードが中心だ。上原氏がこの図を示しながら、懐かしそうに解説していたのが印象的だった。

会見での説明を聞いて、筆者が改めて思ったのは、Dellはサーバーをはじめとしてデータセンターに必要な技術や製品、サービスを提供しているのだから、データセンターも自前で整備して運営する事業に乗り出せば、自社のサーバーももっと使われるようになるのではないかということだ。データセンター運営事業をやるということは、すなわちクラウド基盤サービスに乗り出すということだ。

会見の質疑応答でデータセンター運営事業をやることはないのかと聞いた筆者の質問に対し、上原氏は「今のハイパースケーラーがクラウドサービスを始めた頃、当社でも乗り出す動きがあったが、結果的にはそうしたクラウドサービス事業者およびデータセンター運営事業者をお客さまとして最適なインフラ環境を提供するビジネススタイルをとった」と答えた。

同氏も「動き」として触れたように、実はDellは2010年代半ば、クラウドサービスおよびデータセンター運営事業に乗り出す動きがあったが、ハイパースケーラーとの競合を避け、製品・サービスの提供に徹することにした経緯がある。その名残を感じさせる記事（2015年11月13日掲載「デルがデータセンター事業を立ち上げ—狙いはハイパースケールの少し下」）があったので参照していただきたい。

とはいえ、ハイパースケーラーに対抗せず、企業のプライベートクラウドニーズに応えるだけでも相当な需要があるような気がするのだが。もちろん、データセンター運営事業は建設業であり不動産業でもあるので、適切なパートナー企業と組むのが得策かもしれないが、年間売上高956億ドル（150円換算で14兆3400億円、2025年1月期）で業績も堅調なDellならば、AI時代到来を機に事業を広げてみてはどうか、というのが筆者の意見である。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ソニーは、従来の液晶（miniLED）テレビよりも色の純度が高く、映像をより鮮やかに広色域で再現できるディスプレイ方式を開発したと発表した。

同パネルは、液晶パネルのバックライトとして細かなLEDを敷き詰める「miniLED」のいわば強化版だ。細かなLEDを3原色（RGB）で発光できるようにした。

この技術は「RGB LED」と呼ばれていて、LEDの赤・緑・青の3つの原色それぞれを独立して制御する。これによって色の純度が高まり、DCI-P3色域の99％、ITU-R BT.2020規格の約90％をカバーする。また、有機ELパネルは高輝度化に難があるが、同パネルはピーク輝度4000cd/m2以上を達成する。

また、ソニー独自の「高度なバックライト制御技術」も搭載する。これはRGB各色が独立して発光する際に、シーンに応じた最適な電力を各色に割り当てる機能だ。従来の高輝度のテレビでは、夜景などの暗いシーンで星や月などの明るい部分に光を集中させ、ピーク輝度を高めるといった、明暗に合わせた輝度調整を行っていた。一方の同パネルでは、色の濃淡に応じた輝度調整もあわせて実施し、真っ青な空や真っ赤な紅葉など単色のシーンでも、明るく鮮やかな映像を再現する。

さらに、96ビットの高ビットレートで駆動し、漆黒とまばゆい白を同時に表現できるだけでなく、中間色の多いシーンでもその明暗の違いを繊細に表現するという。既存の有機ELパネルでは技術的に難しい、明るさや彩度が控えめな色調も表現できるとしている。高ビットレートでの信号処理により、細部まで精密に階調を制御できるため、大画面においても斜めから見た際の色や明るさの変化が抑え、広い視野角も実現する。

具体的な発売時期はまだ不明だが、ソニーは今年中に量産体制に入ると予告している。MediaTekなどの業界パートナーと協力して、この新方式を搭載したテレビを市場に送り出す計画だ。

現行の有機ELテレビは、高輝度化や大画面化に課題を抱えている。液晶の技術革新が消費者に受け入れられれば、トレンドが逆回転する可能性もある。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>David McAfee, AMD Vice President and General Manager over Client Channel Business, called the demand for AMD's newest GPU release "really unprecedented" this week. In an appearance on HotHardware's Thursday livestream, McAfee shared some details about what caused RX 9070 and RX 9070 XTs to sell out worldwide at blistering speed, and AMD's plans to get the cards into the hands of customers now and in the far future.

McAfee, who oversees much of AMD's consumer CPU and GPU businesses, was amazed by the success of the RX 9000-series' first wave. "The launch of RDNA 4 was really a milestone event for our graphics business. The demand was very, very, very strong all around the world," said the Radeon boss.

The AMD RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 hit the shelves on March 6th, heralding the beginning of AMD's "RDNA 4" GPU generation. Though the cards launched with a $599/$549 price tag, one week later it is near impossible to find the cards for this price, as all models of the cards across all of AMD's board partners are either sold out or being sold for as much as 22% over the MSRP from legitimate retailers.

McAfee explained in part why selling GPUs for appropriate prices and with ample stock can be a challenging game. "In [AMD's CPU business], we put a processor in a box, we set a price for that product, we ship it directly into the market, and we control that end-to-end."

In stark contrast to this, AMD's supply chain for selling GPUs involves a large number of AIB partners, which buy AMD's ASICs and build multiple models of each GPU, which models are then selected and ordered from by primary sellers.

"If you look at where we stand today, priority number one is restocking all of our partners," confirmed McAfee, then reiterating the lengthy process which stands between AMD shipping supply to partners and finished products hitting shelves. AMD is said to be intensely focusing on pushing Navi 48 into the hands of board partners/

McAfee and AMD affirm that when supply returns for RX 9070 XT, it will be accessible at the starting price point of $599. This echoes Frank Azor's pre-launch promise that RDNA 4's MSRP is not just launch-only pricing, but will persist throughout the lifespan of the cards.

This claim may fall on consumers' deaf ears, however; for the last several GPU generations, especially from Nvidia cards, GPU prices skyrocket immediately after launch and then never recovered. Nvidia RTX 4090 prices never settled back at or below MSRP for its entire lifespan, with the card now costing upwards of $3,000 even with the existence of the RTX 5090.

McAfee remains optimistic about RX 9070 XT's price settling down soon, however, and about the current state of AMD's consumer offerings. "As we refill the channel from what happened last week, you'll see more supply coming," claimed the Radeon boss. "Not just at the opening price points, but across the entire range as we look at the rest of this quarter, Q2, and beyond."

Ever since the launch of the Ryzen 9 9800X3D, AMD internally has apparently been riding hit after hit with pride. McAfee boldly proclaimed, "We think we've got the most compelling portfolio in the industry right now across the entire range", including notebooks, laptops, high-end desktops, enterprise use, and everything in between.

For those anxious to see AMD make a return to halo-tier top-end GPUs, more patience will be necessary. Per McAfee, the vast majority of consumers buy GPUs at sub-$700 price points. For AMD right now, building up broad appeal and brainspace is far more important.

"We have aspirations to cover the entire gamut of gaming solutions that are out there in the market, and maybe one day we'll get there. But for now, we're really focused on growing scale and deriving the developer relationships that come from having a bigger footprint in the graphics market."

With AMD snatching GPU market share away from Nvidia even in Q4 2024, and the launch of the Ryzen 9 9950X3D securely claiming AMD's top dog status for CPUs for any consumer use-case, the future is bright for AMD (thanks in no small part to the struggles of its competitors). What comes next? Hopefully affordable RX 9070 XTs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Si vous êtes développeur depuis un certain temps, vous savez que les interfaces de programmation d'applications (API) sont susceptibles d'être modifiées selon le bon vouloir du fournisseur.

Toute l’actualité de la tech pour les pros chaque jour dans notre newsletter En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles

Il se peut que vous vous couchiez un soir en pensant votre application solide. Puis vous vous réveillez le matin pour découvrir que l'un de vos fournisseurs d'API a annoncé un changement qui vous obligera à passer les six prochains mois à recoder votre application pour qu'elle fonctionne avec la nouvelle API.

Et les applications basées sur l'IA ne sont pas à l'abri de cette loi. OpenAI a ainsi annoncé l'introduction de API Responses, qui entraînera la fin de l'API Assistants en 2026. Comme la plupart des changements d'API, la nouvelle API en fait plus et fonctionne mieux. Cependant, malgré ces capacités, la nouvelle API demande un peu de travail pour les utilisateurs des API précédentes.

Pourquoi les éditeurs utilisent des API ?

OpenAI a annoncé de nouvelles fonctionnalités pour les programmeurs qui créent des agents d'IA, y compris au niveau de l'API. Mais avant de nous pencher sur les nouveautés, replaçons ce changement dans son contexte.

Vous avez probablement remarqué que depuis que l'IA générative (Gen AI) a fait irruption sur la scène de la technologie, presque tous les produits et services informatique semblent avoir soudainement ajouté une fonctionnalité d'IA à leurs offres. Mais ces fournisseur n'ont pas tous, loin de là, des équipes de recherche en IA qui construisent des LLM.

Au lieu de cela, ces entreprises utilisent des API sous licence qui fournissent des services d'IA moyennant des frais relativement prévisibles par transaction. Les coûts varient selon les modèles. Mais selon une estimation approximative, un développeur peut effectuer 67 requêtes de chat GPT-4.5, 1 176 requêtes GPT-4o ou 20 000 mini requêtes GPT-4o pour un euro.

Grâce aux API d'OpenAI (et aux API d'autres sociétés d'IA), les fonctionnalités d'IA peuvent être ajoutées au code avec de simples appels de fonction et une carte de crédit. De quoi écourter des années de développement et économiser des millions d'euros de coûts d'infrastructure et de recherche.

La nouvelle API Responses

Jusqu'à présent, OpenAI proposait une API, l'API Chat Completions, pour envoyer des requêtes de chat à ChatGPT et obtenir une réponse. OpenAI proposait également une API, l'API Assistants, qui permet aux agents d'effectuer des raisonnements en plusieurs étapes et d'accéder à des fichiers.

La nouvelle API Responses combine les caractéristiques de ces deux API. Si l'API Chat Completions devrait être conservée, l'entreprise a annoncé son intention de supprimer l'API Assistants dès l'année prochaine au profit de l'API Responses, plus performante.

Les tarifs pour l'utilisation de l'API Responses se trouvent sur la page de tarification d'OpenAI et varient en fonction du modèle et de l'utilisation.

L'API Responses comporte trois outils que les programmeurs peuvent appeler :

La recherche sur le web

La recherche de fichiers

L'utilisation de l'ordinateur

L'outil de recherche Web

Si vous avez déjà utilisé ChatGPT pour effectuer une recherche sur le Web et agréger une réponse, vous savez ce que fait l'outil de recherche Web. Dans le cas de l'API Réponses, elle permet aux programmeurs de lancer de telles requêtes à partir de leurs programmes.

Lorsqu'elle est utilisée, l'API fournit un texte en guise de réponse, ainsi que des liens vers des sources et des citations en ligne. OpenAI dit que les tests de recherche sur le web avec GPT-4o ne sont correct qu'à 38 % (gardez cela à l'esprit la prochaine fois que vous utiliserez ChatGPT pour faire une recherche).

Mais que les recherches utilisant l'aperçu de recherche GPT-4o et le mini aperçu de recherche GPT-4o sont corrects neuf fois sur dix.

L'outil de recherche de fichiers

Vient ensuite l'outil de recherche de fichiers. Il permet d'effectuer des recherches dans une bibliothèque de vos documents d'entreprise. OpenAI affirme ne pas entraîner ses IA sur ces données d'entreprise. Vous pouvez donc être certain que le téléchargement de toutes vos données sera sécurisé et n'apparaîtra pas dans la réponse de quelqu'un d'autre à un prompt.

Il y a cependant des problèmes. Tout d'abord, à 0,10 $ par giga, par mois, le stockage de fichiers n'est pas bon marché. La base de données des documents d'entreprise de ma petite société pèse 57 To. Si cette base de données était téléchargée vers OpenAI pour une recherche d'IA contextuelle, le stockage coûterait... près de 6 000 dollars par mois.

L'avantage d'un outil de recherche en IA est qu'il permet de briser les silos. Mais si les silos sont ce qui rend le stockage des données plus abordable en ne téléchargeant que des données sélectionnées, cette tarification pourrait limiter l'utilité de cette fonctionnalité.

Outil d'utilisation de l'ordinateur

Enfin, OpenAI inclut son outil d'utilisation de l'ordinateur, l'outil de visualisation d'écran et de clic au cœur de son offre d'agent Operateur.

Cet outil est censé être capable de lire des écrans et, en fonction de leur contenu, d'effectuer des traitements ou de cliquer pour déclencher des actions.

D'après les démonstrations, en particulier dans l'aperçu de la présente annonce, il semble que l'outil ait encore un long chemin à parcourir avant d'être utile.

Agents SDK

Une API est un ensemble de points de terminaison ou d'appels de fonction permettant d'interagir avec un système externe. Un SDK (kit de développement logiciel) est un ensemble plus large, comprenant souvent des outils logiciels, certaines API, des bibliothèques et des utilitaires, qui fonctionnent tous ensemble.

OpenAI a annoncé Agents SDK, un ensemble d'outils pour construire, déboguer et surveiller les agents en action. Le kit comprend l'API Responses et ajoute l'orchestration de flux de travail, permettant aux codeurs d'effectuer un raisonnement en plusieurs étapes et d'exécuter des tâches.

Le kit permet également aux codeurs de créer des équipes d'agents, chacune chargée de responsabilités spécifiques. Une fonctionnalité de "transfert" permet à un agent d'effectuer un certain travail, puis de transférer le traitement à un autre agent, et ainsi de suite.

En outre, et je pense que c'est l'une des fonctionnalités les plus importantes, un tableau de bord permet de voir chaque interaction avec l'IA, d'identifier quels agents ont été utilisés pour quoi, et comment ils ont été chargés. Avec la prévalence des hallucinations de l'IA, il est important de pouvoir suivre ce que font toutes ces tâches indépendantes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple released a new version of the basic $349 iPad this week, though you could be forgiven for not noticing. The new 11th-generation iPad (also known as the "iPad (A16)" or just plain-old "iPad") looks identical to the previous version, it was introduced in a single paragraph buried in the middle of an iPad Air announcement, and the company didn't offer to send any to reviewers. The one I have I bought myself for our 5-year-old, whose hand-me-down 2019 iPad Air 3 is slightly older than he is and a little worse for wear.

There's nothing exciting or even particularly interesting about this tablet. The design is recycled from 2022's 10th-generation iPad, which was itself a lower-rent version of the 2020 iPad Air design. It's powered by a variant of the Apple A16, originally an iPhone chip from 2022. It still doesn't support the regular Apple Pencil or Pencil Pro or the same keyboard accessories as other iPads. It still doesn't have an anti-reflective screen coating, and the screen doesn't feel as nice to use as an iPad Air's or Pro's.

But for all that, this is still probably the purest expression of what the iPad is: a cheap Internet-connected screen for reading and watching things. I say this as someone who has tried every new piece of hardware and software that Apple has introduced to try and make the iPad a powerful and versatile laptop replacement—it still feels like trying to make a square peg fit into a round hole. The more expensive iPads are nice, but I don't end up using them much differently from how I use this bare-bones tablet.

Features and limitations

The A16 iPad is a typical post-Home-button iPad design, with a slim-ish symmetrical bezel running all the way around a 10.86-inch screen. Apple used to round this up to 10.9 inches, and now it rounds it up to 11 inches, but what has changed is the rounding and not the screen size.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A high-profile network of investors and founders in Silicon Valley are promoting a new moral vision for the tech industry, in which job choices and other decisions are guided not by the pursuit of wealth, but according to Christian values and Western cultural frameworks.

At an event in San Francisco last week hosted in a former church, Trae Stephens, cofounder of the defense contractor Anduril and a partner at the Peter Thiel–led venture capital firm Founders Fund, characterized the idea as the pursuit of “good quests” or careers that make the future better, a concept that he said has theological underpinnings.

“I’m literally an arms dealer,” Stephens said at one point, prompting laughter from the crowd of roughly 200 people, which included Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan. “I don’t think all of you should be arms dealers, but that’s a pretty unique calling.”

The hour-long discussion was part of a series of ticketed gatherings organized by ACTS 17 Collective, a nonprofit founded last year by Stephens’ wife, health care startup executive Michelle Stephens. The group, whose name is an acronym that stands for “Acknowledging Christ in Technology and Society,” is on a mission to “redefine success for those that define culture,” she says.

In Michelle's view, tech workers mostly believe in arbitrary metrics of success, like money and power, leaving some of them feeling empty and hopeless. She wants them to believe instead that “success can be defined as loving God, myself, and others.”

People of all denominations—including atheists—are welcome at ACTS 17 events. Last Thursday’s event had low-key party vibes. Bartenders served beer and wine, a DJ was spinning light worship beats, and prayer booklets rested on a table. The idea for ACTS 17 and a speaker series on faith actually took root at a party, Michelle says. In November 2023, during a three-day 40th birthday party for Trae in New Mexico, Peter Thiel led a talk on miracles and forgiveness. Guests were intrigued.

“Folks were coming up to us saying things like, ‘I didn’t know Peter is a Christian,’ ‘How can you be gay and a billionaire and be Christian?’, ‘I didn’t know you could be smart and a Christian,’ and ‘What can you give me to read or listen to learn more?’” Michelle says.

The Stephens have long-standing connections to Thiel. In addition to helping start Anduril and working at Founders Fund, Trae was also an early employee at data intelligence firm Palantir, a company cofounded by Thiel that develops tools used by the US military.

At the ACTS 17 last Thursday, Trae appeared to echo a number of ideas Thiel has also espoused about technology and Christianity. He emphasized that jobs outside the church can be sacred, citing Martin Luther’s work during the Protestant Reformation. “The roles that we’re called into are not only important and valuable on a personal level, but it’s also critical to carry out God’s command to bring his kingdom to Earth as it is in heaven,” Trae said.</p>

Copilot for Gamingは、プレイヤーが時間を節約し、より快適にゲームを楽しめるように設計されている。例えば、ゲームのダウンロードやアップデートの手間を軽減したり、見逃しそうなサイドクエストのヒントを提供したりすることも含まれる。Copilot for Gamingはまず4月にモバイルにて提供予定で、早期アクセスを希望する人は「Xbox Insider」プログラムでサインアップできる。最初はXboxモバイルアプリを介したセカンドスクリーンのコンパニオンとして機能する。

「ユーザーの好みに合わせてパーソナライズされ、ゲームをさらに楽しめるよう支援し、仲間としても機能し、家族やコミュニティーとのつながりを支援するものでなければならない」と、XboxのGaming AI担当コーポレートバイスプレジデントであるFatima Kardar氏はポッドキャストで語った。

ゲームに関してはまだ経験が浅いというKardar氏にとって、Copilotはおすすめのゲームを教えてくれる点が助かるという。最新リリースの情報を常に把握しているわけではない人にとって便利な機能だ。

XboxのNext Generation担当バイスプレジデントであるJason Ronald氏は例として、レースゲームで自分のプレイスタイルに合った車種をCopilotが推奨してくれると語った。ポッドキャスト内のデモでは、「オーバーウォッチ 2」で相手を迎撃するのに向いたヒーローをCopilotが提案する場面もあった。

Kardar氏は、ゲームが他のメディアとは違い、行き詰まることがある点を指摘する。そういうときこそ、Copilotがプレイヤーを支援し、ゲームをクリアできるよう手助けするという。同時に、Copilot for Gamingを押しつけがましいものにしたくないため、プレイスタイルに合わせてAIがパーソナライズされていく仕組みになっている。

プレイヤー同士のカード交換をよりスムーズにすることで、より多くのプレイヤーがコレクションを楽しめることを目指す。

まず、レアカードの交換に必要な「トレードメダル」を廃止する。カード交換のためにカードを消費する必要がなくなるが、代わりに「3」「4」「☆1」のカードのトレードには「ひかりのすな」が必要となる。

ひかりのすなは、拡張バックの開封などの際に入手したカードが図鑑に登録済みだった場合に自動的に付与する、エフェクトの入手に必要なアイテム。夏以降にトレードでの用途が追加されることを考慮し、今後の提供量を増やすことを検討しているという。これにより、以前よりも多くのカードをトレードできるようになる見込みとしている

加えて、所持しているトレードメダルはアイテムの廃止時に、ひかりのすななどに変換可能となる予定。また、「1」「2」カードのトレードに変更はないとしている。

そのほか、トレードで自分が欲しいカードをゲーム内で公開できる機能を追加する予定。現在トレード対象となっていないカードのうち、「☆2」のカードのトレードや、特定のプロモカードの再入手についても検討していることを明かしている。

その一環としてGoogleは米国時間3月13日、「Deep Research」と「Gems」という、とりわけ人気がある2つの機能について、すべてのユーザーに提供を開始すると発表した。これらの機能を使うことで、ユーザーはGeminiから、これまでとは一段違うレベルの支援を得られるようになり、エージェント機能さえも無料で使えるようになる。

Deep Research

Deep Researchは、ユーザーに代わって徹底的な調査を行ってくれるエージェント機能だ。この機能では、Geminiはマルチステップのカスタム調査プランを作成し、数分間にわたって依頼を受けたユーザーの代わりにウェブを広範にブラウズして情報を収集する。そして、調べた内容を網羅したレポートを作成する。

他の方法では何時間もかかりかねない徹底的な調査を数分で完了してくれるので、Deep Researchは強力な調査ツールとなる。しかも、すでに強力な体験をさらに強化するため、Googleは「Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking（experimental）」でDeep Researchをアップグレードした。これによりさらに質の高い複数ページのレポートを作成してくれるはずだ。

このアップグレードに伴い、Deep Researchはウェブブラウジング中の思考の経過も表示するようになる。しかも、これだけのアップグレードにもかかわらず、新しいプロンプトバーかモデル選択リストからDeep Researchを選択するだけで、今後は誰もが無料で試せるようになると、Googleはブログ投稿で説明している。1月のリリース当初、Deep Researchは「Google One AIプレミアム」プランの一部である「Gemini Advanced」のユーザーのみが対象で、月額20ドル（2900円）の利用料が必要だった。

Gems

GeminiのGems機能は、任意のトピックについて個々のユーザーに合わせた独自のAIエキスパートを作成できる。しかも、自分の具体的なニーズに合わせたAIチャットボットをカスタマイズするだけなので、コーディングや機械学習のトレーニングに関する広範なスキルは必要ない。

こちらの機能も、リリース時にはGoogle One AIプレミアムプランの登録有料ユーザーしか利用できなかったが、今後はGeminiアプリの全ユーザーに無料で提供が開始される。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>生成AIモデルの「Gemini」によって、人工知能（AI）分野のダークホースだったGoogleは、一気にフロントランナーに転じた。この勢いを維持しようと、Googleは、AIアシスタントの全体的なユーザー体験を強化する、Geminiのアップデートを矢継ぎ早に発表している。この中には、無料ユーザー向けの機能強化も含まれている。

その一環としてGoogleは米国時間3月13日、「Deep Research」と「Gems」という、とりわけ人気がある2つの機能について、すべてのユーザーに提供を開始すると発表した。これらの機能を使うことで、ユーザーはGeminiから、これまでとは一段違うレベルの支援を得られるようになり、エージェント機能さえも無料で使えるようになる。

Deep Research

Deep Researchは、ユーザーに代わって徹底的な調査を行ってくれるエージェント機能だ。この機能では、Geminiはマルチステップのカスタム調査プランを作成し、数分間にわたって依頼を受けたユーザーの代わりにウェブを広範にブラウズして情報を収集する。そして、調べた内容を網羅したレポートを作成する。

他の方法では何時間もかかりかねない徹底的な調査を数分で完了してくれるので、Deep Researchは強力な調査ツールとなる。しかも、すでに強力な体験をさらに強化するため、Googleは「Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking（experimental）」でDeep Researchをアップグレードした。これによりさらに質の高い複数ページのレポートを作成してくれるはずだ。

このアップグレードに伴い、Deep Researchはウェブブラウジング中の思考の経過も表示するようになる。しかも、これだけのアップグレードにもかかわらず、新しいプロンプトバーかモデル選択リストからDeep Researchを選択するだけで、今後は誰もが無料で試せるようになると、Googleはブログ投稿で説明している。1月のリリース当初、Deep Researchは「Google One AIプレミアム」プランの一部である「Gemini Advanced」のユーザーのみが対象で、月額20ドル（2900円）の利用料が必要だった。

Gems

GeminiのGems機能は、任意のトピックについて個々のユーザーに合わせた独自のAIエキスパートを作成できる。しかも、自分の具体的なニーズに合わせたAIチャットボットをカスタマイズするだけなので、コーディングや機械学習のトレーニングに関する広範なスキルは必要ない。

こちらの機能も、リリース時にはGoogle One AIプレミアムプランの登録有料ユーザーしか利用できなかったが、今後はGeminiアプリの全ユーザーに無料で提供が開始される。

これらのアップグレードに加えて、Googleは、「Gemini with Personalization」もリリースした。こちらは実験的なオプトイン機能で、Geminiを自身の検索履歴に接続することで、Geminiからの回答に必要な情報の質を向上させる試みだ。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Che si viaggi per lavoro o per piacere, gli organizer da valigia sono uno stratagemma furbo per evitare di diffondere il caos nel proprio bagaglio. Gli oggetti da portare con sé, si sa, sono sempre più del previsto e in mancanza di un'organizzazione razionale rischiano di vagare senza un senso in valigia rendendo matematicamente certa la possibilità di arrivare a destinazione già belli stropicciati e disordinati, peggio di come pensavamo saremmo stati al ritorno. Per sfoggiare outfit impeccabili come quei soggetti che guardiamo con ammirazione nelle hall degli hotel chiedendoci da quale universo siano atterrati, basta puntare sugli organizer giusti. Ce ne sono di tantissime tipologie diverse: alcuni sono multiuso, altri pensati per indumenti specifici, altri ancora sono sportivi o salvaspazio, con cerniere a compressione per far stare tantissime cose in pochi centimetri. Il meglio lo abbiamo raccolto qui sotto.

Tutte le tipologie

L'imbarazzo della scelta c'è, quindi meglio provare a capire cosa può fare per noi per individuare la soluzione più adatta per i nostri spostamenti:

Organizer da valigia a cubi : sono i più popolari e versatili tra gli accessori da viaggio. Si presentano sotto forma di piccoli cubi rettangolari o quadrati e sono ideali per suddividere il contenuto della valigia in compartimenti ben separati.

Possono essere sacchetti con cerniera o buste impermeabili, alcune sono dotati anche di uno strato interno per una protezione extra.

Come sceglierli

Scegliere gli organizer da valigia giusti dipende dalle necessità specifiche. Per chi viaggia leggero e vuole ottimizzare lo spazio senza compromettere l'ordine, i cubi di imballaggio sono ideali. Se invece si ha bisogno di comprimere capi particolarmente ingombranti, gli organizer con compressione aiutano a ridurre il volume del bagaglio. Per chi poi porta con sé tanti prodotti liquidi, un beauty case ben organizzato è imprescindibile, mentre l'organizer per scarpe non dovrebbe mancare mai, a prescindere dal tipo di viaggio e di valigia, perché a livello igienico è fondamentale per evitare che lo sporco accumulato sotto le suole vada a finire sugli altri capi.

I migliori organizer da valigia secondo Wired

Per scegliere i migliori organizer da viaggio abbiamo preso in considerazione tutte le tipologie possibili e immaginabili, puntando sempre sulla qualità. Inutile dire che in questa categoria di prodotti l'affidabilità dei materiali è fondamentale: dalle cerniere che devono essere scorrevoli, resistenti e durevoli ai tessuti scelti per cubi e sacche che devono essere leggeri e indistruttibili, senza rinunciare alla traspirabilità e alla facilità di lavaggio e asciugatura. Ecco allora qui sotto tutte le nostre proposte sul tema pensate sia per i viaggi all'insegna dell'avventura sia per le occasioni più formali.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One researcher’s analysis of Webb Space Telescope images could indicate that we’re all stuck in a black hole, according to research published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.

“The main finding of the study is that the vast majority of the galaxies in the universe, as seen from Earth, rotate in the same direction,” explained Lior Shamir, an astronomer at Kansas State University and lead author of the study, in an email to Gizmodo. “That adds another observation that disagrees with the existing current cosmological model.”

The current cosmological model, called Lambda CDM (short for Cold Dark Matter), has faced numerous stress tests over the years. One such test indicated that data from the decommissioned Planck satellite would be better explained if the universe was round.

It’s becoming increasingly clear that “Lambda CDM is at least incomplete,” Shamir added. “Perhaps the advantage of this observation is that anyone can very easily see it by just looking at the images of the early Universe.”

Shamir’s study examined 263 galaxies in the Webb telescope’s Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, or JADES. About two-thirds of the galaxies rotated clockwise, he found, while just a third rotate in the opposite direction. Though the motion was detected quantitatively, Shamir said that Webb’s sharp vision made it possible to visually determine the direction each galaxy’s rotation.

“In my opinion we see a higher number of galaxies that rotate in the opposite direction relative to the Milky Way because of the motion of these galaxies relative to the motion of the Milky Way,” Shamir said. “The motion makes them brighter, and that is why we see more of them. But I might be wrong, and in that case the real Universe has more galaxies that rotate in the same direction.”

Shamir explained that black holes are born rotating, and it could be that there are more black holes rotating clockwise as a result. This is taken as a clue that our universe itself might reside within a black hole.

We perceive black holes as regions of spacetime with such intense gravity that not even light can escape beyond a certain boundary, known as the event horizon. Beyond this point, the densely packed matter within a black hole remains invisible—hence its name. But some theoretical black holes could be perceived as infinitely expanding to an observer within them, while remaining a static, finite size to an outside observer.

Thus, it also could be possible that baby universes reside within our own, beyond the limits of our perception and within a larger cosmos. In this way, so too could our universe simply be within a black hole in some larger, uh, universe, thereby challenging the word “universe” and introducing the whole multiverse concept. The idea is not new, but the study of galactic rotation suggests another line of evidence that there is almost certainly more to the universe than meets our eye in the form of light.

But there is another possibility for the uneven split in galactic rotation: That the Milky Way’s own rotational velocity has an effect on the team’s measurements. More observations could clear up the discrepancy.

In the meantime, expect JADES to yield more insights into the distant cosmos. In 2023, astronomers thought they may have spotted stars powered by dark matter in JADES images, and last year the most distant galaxy yet seen (which was weirdly bright) was spotted by the project. Suffice to say, JADES will serve up many more mysteries before we get complete answers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wokeの過剰を反省する作品!?

この映画『名もなき者/A COMPLETE UNKNOWN』は、なにはさておき、ボブ・ディランについての映画だ。それもデビューして最初期の1961年から1965年までのわずか4年間の足跡を追ったもの。ミネアポリスからニューヨークにやってきた19歳の青年が、激動の時代である60年代の息吹の中で一気にスターダムを駆け上がり、その栄光＝偶像性を本人自ら破壊して終わる伝説を描いたものである。

そう聞くと、なんだ、ハリウッドによくあるバイオピック＝伝記映画か？ と思うかもしれない。通り一遍のディランの軌跡が扱われるドキュメンタリーなのかと。

だが、観終わっての印象は全く違った。まず単純に面白かった。2時間20分という長尺の映画であるにもかかわらず、全くその長さが気にならない。途中から次はどうなるのだろう？ とワクワクしながら身を乗り出し、時には笑いながら観ている自分がいた。途中からすっかり虜になっていた。

この映画で描かれたのは、ボブ・ディランのアルファでありオメガである。毀誉褒貶、賛否両論の絶えない「音楽求道者」としてのディランの「元型＝アーキタイプ」が発現する過程を描く神話的なドラマだ。「神話的」というのは、なによりそこに登場する、ティモシー・シャラメ演じるボブ・ディランが、若々しいエネルギッシュな存在としてあるからだ。そんなディランの原点となる1960年代初期の物語である。

面白いのは、1960年代の過去にあった話というよりも、むしろ2020年代の現代に対する風刺のように見えたことだ。ディランがフォークからロックへ転じるところは、2020年代の現代文化の窮屈さをそれとなく糾弾しているようにすら感じられた。Wokeの過剰を反省しアートを解放するといった印象だったのだ。

60年代が現代のように見える、というのは、一種の倒錯だが、おそらく監督はそれこそを狙っている。バイオピックやドキュメンタリーというのはあくまでも人寄せのための見せかけであり、映画の本質は、それを入口にした現代のおとぎ話なのである。

誰か一人が正しいわけではない

もちろん、この映画に魅入られた理由はほかにもあって、ひとつには、ディランの周りに配置された人物たちが、皆、生き生きと自分を生きていたことがある。この映画はポリフォニック、つまり多声的な映画だ。誰か一人だけが真実を語っているわけではないし、誰か一人だけが正しいわけでもない。冒頭で、この映画は「ボブ・ディランについての映画」だと書いたのも、ボブ・ディランはこの映画の主役ではあるが必ずしも主人公ではないためだ。場合によっては「視点人物」でもいいくらい。それほど、周りの人物たちが勝手気ままに振る舞っている。全体として沸騰しているのだ。60年代のイースト・ヴィレッジという当時の最先端の文化拠点のもつ磁場のせいかもしれないが、登場人物の誰もが自分本位に自分の意志を主張する。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the past decade, encrypted communication has become the norm for billions of people. Every day, Signal, iMessage, and WhatsApp keep billions of messages, photos, videos, and calls private by using end-to-end encryption by default—while Zoom, Discord, and various other services all have options to enable the protection. But despite the technology’s mainstream rise, long-standing threats to weaken encryption keep piling up.

Over the past few months, there has been a surge in government and law enforcement efforts that would effectively undermine encryption, privacy advocates and experts say, with some of the emerging threats being the most “blunt” and aggressive of those in recent memory. Officials in the UK, France, and Sweden have all made moves since the start of 2025 that could undermine or eliminate the protections of end-to-end encryption, adding to a multiyear European Union plan to scan private chats and Indian efforts that could damage encryption.

These latest assaults on encryption come as intelligence agencies and law enforcement officials in the United States have recently backtracked on years of anti-encryption attitudes and now recommend that people use encrypted communication platforms whenever they can. The drastic shift in attitude followed the China-backed Salt Typhoon hacker group’s widespread breach of major US telecoms, and it comes as the second Trump administration ramps up potential surveillance of millions of undocumented migrants living in the US. Simultaneously, the administration has been straining longtime, crucial international intelligence-sharing agreements and partnerships.

“The trend is bleak,” says Carmela Troncoso, a longtime privacy and cryptography researcher and the scientific director at the Max-Planck Institute for Security and Privacy in Germany. “We see these new policies coming up as mushrooms trying to undermine encryption.”

End-to-end encryption is designed so only the sender and receiver of messages have access to their contents—governments, tech companies, and telecom providers can’t snoop on what people are saying. Those privacy and security guarantees have made encryption a target for law enforcement and governments for decades, because officials claim that the protection makes it prohibitively difficult to investigate urgent threats such as child sexual abuse material and terrorism.

As a result, governments around the world have frequently proposed technical mechanisms to bypass encryption and allow access to messages for investigations. Cryptographers and technologists have repeatedly and definitively warned, though, that any backdoor created to access end-to-end encrypted communications could be exploited by hackers or authoritarian governments, compromising everyone’s safety. Additionally, it is likely that criminals would find ways to continue to use self-made encryption tools to conceal their messages, meaning that backdoors in mainstream products would succeed at undermining protections for the public without eliminating its use by bad actors.

Broadly, the recent threats to encryption have come in three forms, says Namrata Maheshwari, the encryption policy lead at international nonprofit Access Now. First, there are those where governments or law enforcement agencies are asking for backdoors to be built into encrypted platforms to gain “lawful access” to content. At the end of February, for example, Apple pulled its encrypted iCloud backup system, called Advanced Data Protection, from use in the UK after the country’s lawmakers reportedly hit the Cupertino company with a secret order demanding Apple provide access to encrypted files. To do so, Apple would have had to create a backdoor. The order, which has been criticized by the Trump administration, is set to be challenged in a secret court hearing on March 14.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>iPhone and Android users will be able to exchange end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messages in the near future thanks to newly updated RCS specifications. The GSM Association announced that the latest RCS standard includes E2EE based on the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol, enabling interoperable encryption between different platform providers for the first time.

The GSM Association said it had started working to enable E2EE on messages sent between Android and iPhone in September last year. E2EE is a privacy and security feature that prevents third parties, such as messaging providers or cell carriers, from viewing the content of your texts. The GSMA says the new RCS standard was developed in collaboration with “mobile operators, device manufacturers, and technology providers,” including Apple.

“End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA,” said Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer. “We will add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates.”

Apple introduced RCS support to iPhones as part of an iOS 18 update in September. While Apple’s proprietary iMessage system already supported E2EE, this wasn’t extended to RCS messaging because the previous RCS standard didn’t provide cross-platform support. Google Messages also enabled E2EE by default for RCS texts, but only conversations between Google Messages users were E2EE, and not those exchanged with iMessage users or users of other RCS clients on Android.

“We’ve always been committed to providing a secure messaging experience, and Google Messages users have had end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messaging for years,” Google spokesperson Ed Fernandez told The Verge. “We’re excited to have this updated specification from GSMA and work as quickly as possible with the mobile ecosystem to implement and extend this important user protection to cross-platform RCS messaging.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Plus d’un après le leak d’I-Soon, cette fuite de données dévoilant les coulisses du cyberespionnage chinois, la justice américaine jette un nouveau coup de projecteur sur cette entreprise considérée comme l'un des prestataires des services de renseignement de Pékin. Plusieurs documents judiciaires viennent en effet d’être publiés à la faveur de la mise en cause de douze ressortissants chinois il y a quelques jours.

Ils montrent d'abord que l'espionnage peut être aussi un juteux business. Avec plus de cent employés, I-Soon, Anxun Information Technologies de son vrai nom, créée il y a environ quinze ans à Shanghai, visait un chiffre d’affaires de 75 millions de dollars pour 2025. Un volume atteint en vendant des accès piratés à des boîtes de messagerie de 10 000 à 75 000 dollars. “I-Soon proposait également l'analyse du contenu des données volées, moyennant des frais supplémentaires”, précise aussi la justice américaine.

Autant de piratages menés à partir de 2016 à la demande des clients d’I-Soon, une quarantaine d’agences gouvernementales. Mais également à la propre initiative de l’entreprise, qui aurait ainsi proposé a posteriori des accès volés à ses clients. Ces attaques informatiques étaient désignées pudiquement comme des tests d’intrusion dans les documents internes de l’entreprise, affirme la justice américaine.

Vulnérabilités et solutions offensives

Pour obtenir ces accès frauduleux, les employés d’I-Soon auraient eu accès à des vulnérabilités zero-day, ces failles non corrigées, ou des portails pour cloner des sites web ou craquer des mots de passe. L'entreprise vendait d'ailleurs des solutions pour cibler des services précis, comme les messageries Outlook et Gmail. Elle pouvait par exemple, en cas de clic sur un lien d'hameçonnage dédié au réseau social X, prendre le contrôle d'un compte et contourner l'authentification à double facteur.

Mais ses pirates seraient passés aussi par des techniques plus classiques de hameçonnage ciblé. L'un des manuels de l’entreprise aurait enjoint par exemple à ne pas faire d’envoi groupé ou d’attendre plusieurs messages avant d’envoyer le lien malveillant.

Pour pirater la Defense Intelligence Agency, une agence de renseignement militaire américaine, les hackers d’I-Soon seraient ainsi passés à l’automne 2017 par une campagne de hameçonnage ciblée. Elle renvoyait les employés visés vers un faux site de leur agence destiné à voler leurs informations d’identification.

Primes de plusieurs millions de dollars

Autres exemples signalés par la justice américaine: le piratage du Trésor américain, à la fin de l'année 2024, celui d'une organisation religieuse basée aux Etats-Unis ou encore celui d’un journal new-yorkais relayant la voix d’opposants chinois.

Ce dernier aurait été visé par une attaque en déni de service en décembre 2016, avant que des messageries de ses dirigeants et de journalistes ne soient compromises quelques mois plus tard, en mai. Puis l’entreprise se serait intéressée aux visiteurs du site basés en Chine, une façon d’identifier des dissidents.

Les dirigeants d'I-Soon sont désormais visés par une prime pouvant atteindre jusqu'à 10 millions de dollars pour toute information permettant de les localiser. Un chèque qui se monte à "seulement" 2 millions de dollars pour Yin Kecheng et Zhou Shuai, alias "Coldface", accusés eux d'être derrière le groupe APT -27. Outre l'intrusion sensible aux dépens du Trésor américain, ils sont soupçonnés d'avoir pillé via l'infrastructure d'I-Soon les données de nombreuses cibles américaines depuis une dizaine d'années.</p>

La CNIL a annoncé à plusieurs plaignants l'ouverture d'une procédure de sanction visant l'opérateur suite au piratage des données de ses utilisateurs au mois d'octobre 2024.

Une information confirmée par la CNIL auprès de France Info.

Fuite de données

La Commission dit avoir dans un premier temps ouvert une procédure de contrôle suite au. signalement de la fuite de données en octobre 2024.

C'est à l'issue de celle-ci que la présidente de la CNIL a décidé d'engager une procédure de sanction.

Cette procédure prévoit l'examen du dossier par la formation restreinte de la CNIL, organisme habilité à prononcer des sanctions.

Large éventail de sanction

La formation restreinte de la CNIL dispose d'une large latitude en matière de sanctions. Cela peut être une simple injonction à se mettre en conformité avec la loi. Mais aussi des amendes importantes pouvant monter jusqu'à 2% du chiffre d'affaire annuel mondial de la société. Voire 4% dans les cas impliquant des manquements grave. La formation peut également décider ou non de rendre public la sanction.

L'opérateur Free avait annoncé une fuite de données affectant un peu plus de 19,4 millions de ses abonnés au mois d'octobre 2024. Un internaute de 17 ans avait été interpellé quelques semaines après le piratage. Il a été mis en examen le 16 janvier 2025.

Les enquêteurs le soupçonnent d'avoir mis en vente la base de données volées sur le web. Selon son avocate, il n'aurait eu qu'un rôle mineur dans cette affaire. Mais le jeune homme avait déjà été mis en examen quelques mois plus tôt dans le cadre du dossier Epsilon.</p>

In my last post, ‘RCS Now in iOS: a New Chapter for Mobile Messaging‘, I celebrated the integration of Rich Communication Services (RCS) with Apple’s iOS 18, a culmination of years of collaboration across mobile operators, device manufacturers, and technology providers. Today, I am pleased to announce the next milestone: the availability of new GSMA specifications for RCS that include end-to-end encryption (E2EE) based on the Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol.

Most notably, the new specifications define how to apply MLS within the context of RCS. These procedures ensure that messages and other content such as files remain confidential and secure as they travel between clients. That means that RCS will be the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers. Together with other unique security features such as SIM-based authentication, E2EE will provide RCS users with the highest level of privacy and security for stronger protection from scams, fraud and other security and privacy threats.

These enhancements to support E2EE are the cornerstone of the new RCS Universal Profile release. In addition to E2EE, RCS Universal Profile 3.0 makes it easier for users to engage with businesses over RCS messaging through a richer deep link format and includes additional smaller enhancements such as improved codecs for audio messaging and easier management of subscriptions with business messaging senders. In addition, RCS continues to support a range of interoperable messaging functions between iOS and Android users, such as group messaging, the ability to share high-resolution media, and see read receipts and typing indicators.

I would like to thank all of the contributors for their support in developing and finalising these new specifications; they represent significant progress in enabling even more of a thriving RCS ecosystem built on the foundation of secure and private messaging for the benefit of end-users worldwide.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>こうした概して平和的な、歩道での抗議行動──華やかに装飾されたマリアッチ楽団や人形遣い、大きな段ボール製「サイバートラック」などが使われる──は、「TeslaTakedown」（打倒テスラ）というウェブサイトにより組織されている。そして抗議活動の多くは、継続的にメディアに取り上げられている。

同サイトの創設者は、ロサンゼルスを拠点に活動するドキュメンタリー作家兼俳優のアレックス・ウィンターだ。米SFコメディ映画『ビルとテッドの大冒険』（1988年）で主人公ビルの役を演じた人物だ。ウィンターは『WIRED』に対して、TeslaTakedown運動でマスクを失脚させたいのだと語った。「ブランド価値を下げるのが目的です。人々が街頭に出て抗議するのは、とてもシンプルながら効果的な手段なのです」

そこにメディアによる報道が加わり、抗議活動のメッセージを拡散させているとウィンターは話す。「マスクとDOGEについての検証可能で事実に基づいた情報を広めたいのです。そして、なぜテスラの価値を下げたいのかを知ってもらいたいのです」

「マスク自身がテスラのブランドを貶めているのです」とウィンターは語る。「わたしたちは、ただ彼を助けているだけなのです」

TeslaTakedownのサイトは先月スタートした。きっかけは2月10日に、「いますぐ、国際的なピケ（抗議行動）に参加しましょう。地元で#TeslaTakeoverしましょう」というBlueskyへの投稿だった。投稿したのは、情報操作に関する研究者で、ボストン大学でジャーナリズムと新興メディアを専門に教えている助教授のジョアン・ドノバンだ。ドノバンはその後、抗議活動の名称をTeslaTakedownに改名したと話した。

「（マスクに関する）認識を高めるために、わたしは物理的に何をしたいのか？と自問してみました。そう。土曜日にはテスラのディーラーのところまで出かけていき、目の前で抗議しようと思います」とドノバンは『WIRED』に語った。「まずはチラシをつくって、ネットで拡散し始めました。その投稿をアレックス（・ウィンター）が見てくれて、わたしたちは何をすべきか、すぐにテキストで意見交換を始めました。なにもかもが、ものすごいスピードで決まりました」

抗議行動の効果

2月15日にボストンで行われた最初のデモには、50人が集結した。それが3週目には300人に増えた。「教師や公衆衛生に携わる人、退職した人、大学の学生など多くの米国人が来てくれました。みんなDOGEの消滅を願っていました」とドノバンは言う。「これは、テスラに対する戦略的なボイコットというだけでなく、多くの不満を表明する多声的な抗議行動なのです」

イーロン・マスクとテスラは、コメントの要請には応じなかった。

世界中で起きている300以上の社会的・政治的抗議行動について研究しているハーバード大学の政治学者エリカ・チェノウェスは、人口の3.5％が運動に参加すると、必然的に変化が起きるという調査結果を得た。

「活動に積極的に参加する人よりも、その活動に共感する人のほうがはるかに多いのが一般的です」と、チェノウェスは『WIRED』に語っている。

では、TeslaTakedownはすぐに効果を発揮するのだろうか？「どのくらい時間がかかるかではなく、わたしは通常、抗議行動がその後に起きる運動ごとに、その圧力や勢いを増しているかどうかに注目しています」とチェノウェスは言う。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>音楽に合わせて衝動的に体を動かしたくなる感覚は、音楽用語で「グルーヴ感」と表現される。これまでグルーヴ感がもつ「快感」と「体を動かしたくなる衝動」という2つの要素には密接な関連性があると考えられていたが、実は完全に独立した生理反応である可能性が高いことが、このほど最新の研究で明らかになった。

カナダのコンコルディア大学の研究チームによると、後天的な脳の障害などにより音楽から快感を得られない音楽無感症の人でも、リズムに合わせて動きたくなる衝動は生じている。こうした人々は音楽自体からは快楽を感じにくいものの、音楽に合わせて体を動かしたいと感じることで結果的に“快感”を得ているのだという。

体が動く衝動と快感は別物

研究チームは今回、148人の被験者を対象に大規模なオンライン調査を実施した。音楽から得られる快感の程度を評価する「バルセロナ式音楽報酬質問紙（BMRQ）」を用いて、被験者がもつ音楽に対する報酬感覚を複数の側面から測定したところ、このうち17人が音楽無感症の条件に該当した。なお、これらの被験者がリズムやテンポといった音楽の構成要素を正常に知覚できることは、事前に実施した「モントリオール式失音楽症評価テスト（MBEA）」によって確認されている。

さらに研究者たちは、リズムと和声の複雑さがそれぞれ異なる51種類の短い楽曲を被験者に聴かせ、「どれくらい快感を得られたか」や「どれくらい体を動かしたくなったか」を5段階で評価してもらった。その結果、音楽無感症に該当した17人と他の被験者の評価には、快感の程度と体を動かしたくなる程度の両方において大きな違いは見られなかった。これは研究チームの当初の予想に反する結果だったという。

この研究を主導した博士課程研究員のアイザック・ロムキーによると、一般的に音楽のリズムの複雑さはグルーヴ感に対して逆U字効果があるとされる。つまり、リズムが単純すぎても複雑すぎても、人は快感を得たり体を動かしたくなったりしないことを意味する。そこそこ複雑な楽曲が最もグルーヴ感を生み出すということだ。

音楽無感症に該当する被験者は音楽から快感を得ることが難しいことから、この逆U字型のカーブはより平坦になるだろうと、研究チームは予想していた。しかし、実際には音楽無感症のグループも、そうでない他の被験者たちと同様に特定の楽曲から“快感”を得ており、同じように体を動かしたいと感じていることがわかった。このため音楽無感症の人々は音楽そのものから快感を得ているのではなく、体を動かしたくなる衝動を通じて心地よく感じている可能性が高いと、ロムキーは説明する。

現在のところ、音楽無感症のメカニズムは十分に解明されていないが、遺伝的な要因が関係している可能性を研究者たちは指摘している。ロムキーによると、体を動かしたくなる衝動は、脳内で運動機能をつかさどる背側線条体に関連している。一方で快楽の感覚は、報酬や動機づけを制御する腹側線条体によって処理されているのだという。

今回の研究結果は、音楽を心地よいと感じるかどうかはグルーヴ感とはほとんど無関係であり、リズムに合わせて体を動かしたくなる衝動は脳内に生じる生理的な反応である可能性を示唆している。研究チームは今後、磁気共鳴画像（MRI）検査や脳磁図（MEG）などの画像診断技術を用いて、音楽無感症患者の線条体の機能や構造に違いがあるかどうかを調査する予定だとしている。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Googleは米国時間3月13日、「Gemini with Personalization」を発表した。これにより、生成AI「Gemini」がユーザーの検索履歴を参照し、それに基づいて応答できるようになる。試験的なオプトイン方式の機能となる。「Google Photos」と「YouTube」にも今後対応する予定。

Gemini with Personalizationは、「Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking（experimental）」モデルを活用する。ユーザーは手動で機能を有効にし、自分の検索履歴と接続する必要がある。具体的には、Geminiアプリのドロップダウンメニューから「Personalization（experimental）」モデルを選択する。

機能が有効になると、Geminiは応答を生成する前に検索履歴を分析し、回答にコンテキストを追加できるかどうかを判断する。検索履歴は、AIモデルが応答を強化できると判断した場合にのみ使用される。これは試験段階の機能になるため、Googleはユーザーからのフィードバックを引き続き収集するという。

当然ながら、AIモデルが検索履歴を調べることはプライバシーの懸念を引き起こすだろう。これらの懸念に対処するために、Googleはユーザーが自分で設定を管理でき、いつでも簡単にGeminiを検索履歴から切り離せることを強調している。

さらに、この試験機能を使用する際には、Geminiが検索履歴との接続を簡単に解除できるリンク付きのバナーが表示される。検索履歴にアクセスしているため、通常どおり履歴を編集することも可能であり、別の方法で管理することもできる。



提供：Google 提供：Google

同社はまた、Geminiを検索履歴にリンクする前に明確な通知を行い、アプリや検索履歴に接続する前に許可を求めるポップアップメッセージを表示すると述べている。Geminiは、過去のチャットや検索履歴から回答を生成したかどうかなど、応答に使用したデータソースの概要も示す。

Gemini with Personalizationは、13日からウェブ上でGeminiおよび「Gemini Advanced」の利用者向けに試験提供される。モバイル向けには段階的に展開される予定となっている。この機能は、18歳未満のユーザー、「Google Workspace/Education」では利用できない。</p>

Toute l’actualité de la tech pour les pros chaque jour dans notre newsletter En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles

Il s’agit notamment de deux de ses fonctionnalités les plus populaires, Deep Research et Gems.

Deep Research

Deep Research est une fonctionnalité qui peut effectuer des recherches avancées en créant un plan en plusieurs étapes, en parcourant le Web pendant quelques minutes avant de livrer un rapport complet.

C'est un outil de recherche puissant qui permet de réaliser en quelques minutes des recherches qui prendrait autrement des heures. Pour optimiser encore davantage l'expérience, Google a mis à niveau Deep Research avec Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental.

Chacun pourra désormais l'essayer gratuitement en sélectionnant Deep Research dans la nouvelle barre d'invite ou dans le menu déroulant des modèles. Lors de son lancement en janvier, cette fonctionnalité était réservée aux utilisateurs de Gemini Advanced, inclus dans l'abonnement Google One AI Premium.

Gems

Gems permet aux utilisateurs de créer leurs propres experts en IA sur n'importe quel sujet en adaptant les chatbots IA à leurs besoins spécifiques, sans que cela nécessite de compétences approfondies en codage ou en apprentissage automatique. Cette fonctionnalité était elle aussi réservée aux abonnés Google One AI Premium lors de son lancement. Gems est disponible gratuitement pour tous les utilisateurs de l'application Gemini.

Pour configurer un Gem, il suffit de lui donner une instruction, de la nommer et de l'utiliser pour exécuter une fonction spécifique. Les Gems peuvent notamment être personnalisées pour gérer des tâches répétitives, comme être partenaire de codage, éditeur ou coach d'apprentissage.

Cette fonctionnalité est quasiment identique aux GPT personnalisés de ChatGPT. Pour le moment, seuls les abonnés payants d'OpenAI, peuvent créer leurs propres GPT.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Googleは、「Google Chrome」の機能拡張プラットフォームとして「Manifest V3」を正式に実装した。これには良い知らせと悪い知らせの両方がある。前者は、Manifest V3によってChrome内での安全性とセキュリティが向上する可能性が高いということ。後者は、サポートされていない拡張機能が積極的に無効化またはブロックされていることだ。

過去数年にわたり開発されてきたManifest V3は、「Manifest V2」の後継であり、拡張機能の動作をより厳密に制御するものである。悪意のある拡張機能や疑わしい拡張機能は、Chromeを含むあらゆるブラウザーにとって問題となっている。この問題に対処するため、新しいプラットフォームでは、「Chromeウェブストア」で提供される拡張機能の安全性と信頼性をより確実なものにするという。

バグのある拡張機能や悪意ある拡張機能をChromeにインストールしたことがある人は、Manifest V3を前向きな一歩だと感じるだろう。誰もがChromeで適切に動作する安全性の高い拡張機能を求めている。しかし、多くの拡張機能がManifest V3をサポートできない、またはサポートしないため、その対策をChromeユーザーが考えなければならなくなった。

Chromeで表示される「uBlock Origin」の警告

まずはuBlock Originから見ていこう。これはChromeの拡張機能として長年提供されている人気の広告ブロッカーだ。ChromeウェブストアでuBlock Originのページを開くと、インストールがブロックされ、次のようなメッセージが表示される。「この拡張機能は、Chrome拡張機能のベストプラクティスに沿わないため、まもなくサポートされなくなる可能性があります」

uBlock Originを既にインストール済みの場合は、次にChromeを開くときに、uBlock Originが無効になったことが通知される。「拡張機能を管理」を確認すると、この拡張機能のサポートが終了したため、無効にされたと説明するメッセージが表示される。

開発元は2024年11月に「GitHub」で次のように述べていた。「『Google Chrome 127』より、Chrome拡張機能のページにuBlock Origin（uBO）の警告が表示されるようになる」「これはManifest V2のサポートが廃止され、Manifest V3が採用されるからだ。uBOはManifest V2の拡張機能であるため、Google Chromeブラウザーに警告が表示される。uBOのManifest V3版はないため、ChromeはuBOの代わりに別の拡張機能を提案するだろう」

uBlock Originを引き続き使用したいなら、Chromeでの唯一の選択肢は「uBO Lite」（uBOL）を使うことだ。uBOLはManifest V3に準拠する軽量版だが、完全版には含まれるサポート対象外の機能は一切利用できない。

他にも多くの拡張機能が使用不可に

もちろん、この大整理の影響を受ける拡張機能は、uBlock Origin以外にも多数ある。米ZDNETのAly Windsor記者は、使用していた3つのChrome拡張機能、「Image Downloader」「Publisher Extension」「Word Counter Plus」が無効になり、動作しなくなったことを確認した。筆者に関しては、「XBrowserSync」という拡張機能を使用して、異なるブラウザー間でブックマークを同期していたが、この拡張機能が無効化され、Chromeウェブストアでアクセスできなくなった。

ウェブストアを調べたところ、以下のような無効になった拡張機能が大量に見つかった。

「360 Ads Blocker」

「Adblock Fast」

「Awesome Bookmarks Button」

「Block Ads」

「Bookmark All」

「Bookmark It」

「Bookmark Lock」

「Bookmark Manager Speed Dial」

「Bookmark My Tabs」

「Comodo Ad Blocker」

「Comodo Online Security Pro」

「Content Blocker」

「Delicious Bookmark Bar Sync」

「Domain Blocker」

「Ethical AdBlock -- Ad Blocker」

「Fast Bookmark」

「Ghostery Private Search for Chrome」

「Google Ad Blocker」

「Google Privacy Shade」

「Hover Zoom+」

「Little Bookmark Box」

「Location Guard」

「MalwareAI Browser Security」

「Pinboard Bookmark Bar Sync」

「Popup Fixer」

「Privacy Extension」

「Private Bookmarker」

「Private Bookmarks」

「Simple Site Blocker」

「Touch VPN」

「Trump Blocker」

「TunnelBear Blocker」

「Website Blocker」

「Wikipedia Popup」

「YouTube Anywhere Remote」

この中には本当に安全でない拡張機能もあるだろう。それらについては、Googleによるブロックや無効化がChromeユーザーの役に立っているといえる。しかし、多くの拡張機能は今でも安全に使用可能で、GoogleがManifest V3で定めたガイドラインに適合していないだけだろう。</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>中国各地の行政や医療などの公的機関が、大規模言語モデル（LLM）である「DeepSeek-R1」の自前システムへの導入を相次いで発表している。その動きは深センや北京といった大都市にとどまらず、中国全土に広がっている。これまでLLM導入の話題はあまり見られなかったが、安価で高品質なDeepSeekは非常に魅力的なのだろう。

これらの発表が中国中央電視台（CCTV）や新華社通信といった報道機関によって積極的に取り上げられていることから、政府がAIの導入を積極的に推進しようとしている意図がうかがえる。先日行われた全国人民代表大会（全人代）でもAIという言葉が繰り返し登場しており、中国政府がAIを後押しする姿勢を示しているのは明らかである。

中国の公的機関における導入事例としては、次のようなものが挙げられる。

北京市豊台区の政府窓口では、職員のPCに「馮小正」というデジタルアシスタントが導入されている。市民からの相談に応対する際、職員が対応や答えに窮すると、従来は専用データベースや関連ウェブサイトで情報を調べていた。しかし、現在は馮小正を呼び出して質問するだけで、詳細な回答を得られるようになった。このような相談窓口での対応は、導入事例としてよく見られるものだ。

他にも、企業や個人がオンラインで申請書を記入する際に、DeepSeekが情報の整合性を自動的に検証するという利用方法を行っている行政もある。例えば、企業が営業許可を申請する場合、システムは申請者に対して記入漏れのある必須項目を即座に通知する。これにより、不完全な情報による審査ミスをなくせるようになり、結果として申請者が何度も資料を提出したり、職員が人力で確認したりする手間を大幅に軽減できる。

広東省珠海市では、公的文書の作成、推敲（すいこう）、校正、組版、査読といった処理にDeepSeekが活用されている。他の都市でも、DeepSeekによる公式文書作成アシスタントが政策の解釈や文書の起草、検証を行うという事例があり、これにより重要な情報をインテリジェントに抽出し、公務員が迅速に意思決定を下せるようになるという。同省韶関市では、DeepSeekが市の行政システムに接続され、約8万7000人の公務員が窓口対応での質疑応答や文書作成などに活用している。

また、前述の韶関市では、DeepSeekを政府機関だけでなく公立病院のスマート医療システムにも接続している。医師は、患者の状態に関する情報や画像データをアップロードすることで、カルテを迅速に作成できるようになった。さらに、患者からのオンライン相談に24時間体制で対応し、健康管理に関する適切なアドバイスを各患者に提供するだけでなく、これまで以上に詳細な体の異常を、正確かつ短時間で発見できるようになったという病院もある。江蘇省無錫市では、DeepSeekを使用して住宅保障や積立金管理などのサービスを最適化し、それを世帯登録、社会保障の照会、医療予約などに適用できるようにした。

導入は行政窓口や医療サービスにとどまらない。各都市は「都市大脳」と呼ばれるスマートシティーの情報基盤にDeepSeekの導入を進めている。都市大脳というと阿里巴巴（アリババ）本社のある浙江省杭州市が比較的よく報道されているが、導入都市はそこだけではない。多くの都市で導入が進み、交通管理、治安維持、エネルギー、環境などの分野で活用されている。

都市大脳へのDeepSeekの導入例としては、珠海市では市内の市場動向を把握し、市内での起業を支援している。内モンゴル自治区フフホト市では、DeepSeekを都市大脳に統合することで、自然災害や潜在的な事故などのリスクをリアルタイムに分析することが可能になった。江蘇省無錫市では、交通、環境保護、エネルギーなど、異なる部門間でのデータ統合と共同ガバナンスが実現している。各部門のデータ統合は長年の課題であったが、DeepSeekなどのLLMによって実現が早まりそうだ。多数のデータから必要なデータを抽出できるようになるため、中国式の監視社会は強化され、そこからの逸脱は難しくなるだろう。

ところで、なぜ1月末の「DeepSeekショック」から1カ月程度という短い期間で、次々と導入が進んでいるのだろうか。例えば、珠海市の都市大脳は中国移動（チャイナモバイル）が手がけており、同市側との密接な連携によっていつでも新しいソリューションを協議できる状況にあった。チャイナモバイルは、将来の技術トレンドを見越して、あらかじめ関連システムを開発していたという。そのため、DeepSeekの導入に当たって、必要な部署の準備やハードウェア・ソフトウェアの対応などをスムーズに行うことができ、迅速に導入を進められたようだ。

中国では、各都市がそれぞれ異なるIT企業に依頼して都市大脳を構築している。そのため、スマートシティー開発を手がけるIT企業間の競争と、中国国内の都市間の競争という、2つの競争が組み合わさることで相乗効果が生まれ、各地でDeepSeekの導入が急速に進んだと考えられる。

冒頭で述べたように、CCTVや新華社が後押ししていることから、この流れは続くと考えられ、今後はDeepSeekなどのLLMがどのような場面で活用できるかという、革新的なソリューションに話題が移っていきそうだ。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>東京大学発のヘルスケアスタートアップとなるissinは3月13日、指輪型のウェアラブルデバイス「Smart Recovery Ring（スマートリカバリーリング）」を発表した。

つけるだけで日々の回復力を可視化し、毎日をベストな状態で迎えられるようサポートするという。

毎朝の回復力「リカバリースコア」分析--つけるだけで健康管理

Smart Recovery Ringは、厚みが2.2mm、重さが約3g。指につけ続けることで「睡眠スコア」「ストレスレベル」「活動量」を計測できる。IP68、5ATMの防水性能を持ち、手洗い・シャワーなどでも利用可能。バッテリーは2時間の充電で最大7日間を連続使用できるという。

計測データを閲覧できる専用アプリは、同社ヘルスケア製品「スマートバスマット」向けアプリをアップデートし、「ウェリー」というアプリ名で提供する。

両製品の計測データを確認できるほか、Smart Recovery Ringのデータを分析して毎朝の回復力「リカバリースコア」も表示可能。睡眠の質・ストレスレベル・活動量・心拍変動（HRV）などのデータを統合的に分析し、体調変化の把握、適切なリカバリー方法の発見などができるとしている。

また、アプリでは、パーソナルヘルスケアAIとなる「ウェリーくん」が登場。朝の散歩や就寝時のリラックスの案内など、ユーザーの状態に合わせてさまざまなチャレンジを提案し、健康管理の習慣づくりを支援するという。

issin 代表取締役CEOの程涛（テイトウ）氏は、「睡眠で一番大事なことは、前日の疲れから回復していること。睡眠そのものだけでなくストレスなどの要素も関係してくるが、それらを計測してサポートできる」と話す。

全国2100のKDDIリアル店舗で販売--KDDI創業者も「乱入」で猛プッシュ

Smart Recovery Ringは「マットブラック」「マットシルバー」の2色展開で、価格（税込）は2万9800円。サイズはUS 8～13号を用意し、サイジングキットも提供する。3月14日に発売し、全国のKDDI直営店、au Style、auショップ、UQスポットおよびau Online Shopで購入できる。

KDDI パーソナル事業本部 パーソナル第1営業本部 商品需給部 関連商品1G グループリーダーを務める久保雅彦氏は、「携帯電話関連商品を扱う『au ＋1 collection』は、2012年にSDカードや充電器などから取り扱いを開始し、今ではチューナーレステレビやヘルスケア商品、防犯カメラなど、顧客ニーズに寄り添う8100以上のアイテムを取り扱っている。issinとの第1弾の取り組みとして発売したスマートバスマットは、6カ月で累計1万台以上を販売した」と語る。第2弾商品となるSmart Recovery Ringも、同社の2100のリアル店舗とオンラインで展開し、ヘルスケア分野における事業の拡大を狙う。

また同製品の発表会では、KDDIの共同創業者でissin アドバイザーを務める千本倖生氏が突如、「もしもし。ミュート外して、ちょっとしゃべらせて」と、同時配信していたオンラインから声で“乱入”する一幕もあった。担当者によると、完全に予定外の出来事だったようだ。

千本氏は、先々週はアメリカ、先週はバルセロナ、今週は台湾と、83歳という年齢ながら仕事で世界各国を飛び回っていると明かし、「体の回復に対する今回の新しい製品は、私自身も使用して大変有用に感じている。健康の管理はすごく大事な要素で、是非こういったサービスを皆さんに実際に使っていただき、人生を豊かにしていただきたい」と話した。

程氏は、「83歳であのような生命力にあふれている方こそ、まさしくわれわれが求める人物像。80歳、90歳、100歳でも介護不要で自分のやりたいことができるような状態を、issinの製品でサポートしていきたい」とした。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>3月24日からマイナンバーカードと運転免許証の一体化が始まる。この「マイナ免許証」をめぐって、前デジタル大臣の河野太郎衆院議員がX（旧Twitter）で注意喚起した。

河野氏は「2025年9月までにマイナンバーカードの有効期限が切れる人は、マイナンバーカードを更新してから一体化して」と投稿。その理由として「（該当者がマイナ免許証の利用を開始した後に）マイナンバーカードを更新すると、今年の9月までは新しいマイナンバーカードの発行時に免許情報が記録されず、そのままではマイナ免許証として機能しない」とした。

マイナンバーカードの有効期限は「カード発行日から10回目の誕生日まで」で、カードの表面に印字されている。

●マイナ免許証のメリット

マイナ免許証は3月24日から手続きできる。免許の新規取得や免許更新と同時に申し込めるほか、「まだ免許証の有効期限は残っているが、マイナ免許証を使ってみたい」という人も各都道府県の警察窓口から手続きできる。

マイナ免許証のメリットは複数ある。まず、マイナンバーカードが運転免許証の代わりとなるため、運転免許証を別に持ち歩かなくても良い点。2つ目は住所変更が生じた場合に警察への届け出が不要となる点。3つ目は免許更新時の講習もオンラインで受けられるようになる点だ。

さらに、今後はスマートフォンへのマイナンバーカード搭載が予定されている。これが実現すれば、スマートフォンが運転免許証となり、運転時に物理カードが必要なくなる。

●よくある勘違いと保有形態について

健康保険証をマイナンバーカードと一体化する「マイナ保険証」では、従来の健康保険証は原則廃止され、マイナ保険証に1本化された。

一方の「マイナ免許証」では、従来の運転免許証も存続する点が異なる。そして、マイナ免許証を保有したうえで、従来の運転免許証も保有、つまり「2枚持ち」が可能だ。運転時は免許証またはマイナ免許証のいずれかを携帯すれば良い。

●その他注意点

なお、従来の免許証を返納して「マイナ免許証」だけにすることも可能だが、ここで気をつけたいのが紛失のリスクだ。マイナンバーカードを紛失すると、それ以外の本人確認手段が限られてしまうほか、マイナンバーカードは運転免許証と比べて再発行の期間が長い。かつ、再度「マイナ免許証」の申請も必要になる。

また、マイナ免許証には券面に免許情報や有効期限が表示されないため、免許情報を読み取るにはマイナポータルにログインするか、マイナ免許証読み取りアプリを利用する必要がある。さらに、海外で運転する場合、渡航先の国によっては従来の運転免許証が必要になる場合もある。

このため、マイナ免許証を申し込む場合は、従来の運転免許証との2枚持ちがベストなのかもしれない。

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Aujourd’hui, on parle des revendeurs informatiques en France et de leur transition vers le marché du cloud computing.



Toute l’actualité de la tech pour les pros chaque jour dans notre newsletter En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles

Une transition nécessaire puisque le marché du cloud pour les entreprises explose en France. Il a généré plus de 20 milliards d’euros en 2024 selon Numeum, avec une croissance de 27 %, et ce alors que en conséquence d’autres secteurs comme le stockage d’entreprise ou l’équipement réseau reculent fortement.

L’intérêt pour le cloud est bien là

Près de 70 % des revendeurs français veulent accélérer sur le cloud note une étude du distributeur Westcon-Comstor.

Pourquoi ? Parce que leurs clients professionnels le demandent.

Deux tiers des entreprises recherchent des compétences spécialisées dans ce domaine.

Le vrai défi, c’est le manque d’expertise

35 % des revendeurs disent ne pas avoir les compétences nécessaires, notamment sur deux aspects clés.

Il s'agit de la gestion du cloud d'une part, et de l’optimisation des coûts, aussi appelée FinOps.

Autre difficulté est de parvenir à mieux exploiter les programmes des fournisseurs comme AWS ou Microsoft Azure. 67 % des revendeurs français disent avoir du mal à s’y retrouver, et c'est un frein pour conseiller efficacement leurs clients.

La concurrence n’est pas le principal souci sur le marché français

Seuls 28 % des revendeurs ressentent une forte pression concurrentielle, contre 40 % à l’international.

Leur priorité, c’est plutôt le recrutement et la formation pour répondre aux attentes des clients, notamment en cybersécurité et gestion des coûts du cloud.

Comment fonctionne l'articulation entre les distributeurs et les revendeurs informatiques ?

Le distributeur achète directement aux fabricants et revend aux revendeurs et intégrateurs. Il gère les stocks, la logistique et la distribution à grande échelle.

Le revendeur, lui, vend aux entreprises utilisatrices, souvent en plus petites quantités, en apportant en plus du conseil, de la maintenance et du support technique.

En résumé, si les revendeurs veulent profiter du boom du cloud, ils devront investir massivement dans la formation et mieux tirer parti des programmes des fournisseurs, notamment avec l’appui des distributeurs.

Toute l’actualité de la tech pour les pros chaque jour dans notre newsletter En savoir plus sur l’utilisation des données personnelles

Google officialise la compatibilité d'Auracast avec Android. Les utilisateurs de smartphones compatibles peuvent désormais connecter leurs écouteurs ou prothèses auditives compatibles à des diffusions via Bluetooth.

Téléphones Android compatibles Auracast

Dans son communiqué, Google souligne l'importance d'Auracast pour aider les personnes malentendantes à mieux interagir avec le monde qui les entoure, en utilisant la technologie pour suivre des cours magistraux, des émissions publiques ou des concerts.

Les personnes portant des prothèses auditives GN Hearing, Starkey ou Jabra peuvent accéder à cette fonctionnalité, à condition de posséder un smartphone compatible. Actuellement, les smartphones Samsung Galaxy sous UI 7 ou Android 15, ainsi que les smartphones Google Pixel 9 sous Android 16 bêta, sont compatibles Auracast.

Google a également intégré la possibilité d'appliquer des préréglages d'aides auditives aux flux Auracast, permettant ainsi aux utilisateurs de personnaliser leurs paramètres audio.

Cas d'utilisation concrets

Bien qu'Auracast offre des fonctionnalités d'assistance importantes pour les personnes malentendantes, cette technologie est utilisable par tous. Un exemple : vous êtes dans un bar et souhaitez regarder un match diffusé en prime time sur une télévision sans son. Connectez votre smartphone compatible Auracast à vos écouteurs ou aides auditives, puis utilisez votre téléphone pour rechercher la diffusion dans vos paramètres Bluetooth.

A terme, l’objectif est de ne plus avoir à accéder aux paramètres pour accéder à une diffusion Auracast. La gamme Google Pixel 9 sera la première à prendre en charge la lecture de codes QR pour se connecter aux flux audio Auracast.

De nombreux autres écouteurs et enceintes Bluetooth compatibles Auracast sont disponibles sur le marché, notamment les Sony WF-1000XM5, Google Pixel Buds Pro 2, JBL Charge 6 et Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.

L'intégration d'Auracast prend de l'ampleur

Aux États-Unis, Samsung et Google sont les seuls fabricants de smartphones à prendre en charge Auracast, mais les derniers modèles du fabricant chinois Xiaomi sont également compatibles avec cette fonctionnalité.

L'intégration d'Auracast repose sur la collaboration des fabricants de smartphones, de tablettes, d'écouteurs et d'enceintes Bluetooth avec le Bluetooth SIG. Ce groupe d'intérêt supervise la normalisation, l'adoption et l'octroi de licences de la technologie Bluetooth.

Le Bluetooth SIG a introduit Auracast en 2022, démontrant ainsi qu'une adoption généralisée est un processus long. Bien que l'intégration d'Auracast progresse, les applications réelles dépendent désormais des lieux publics, comme les salles de concert, les restaurants, les cinémas, les aéroports, etc., pour adopter cette technologie.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>キンドリルジャパンは、メインフレームの動向を解説するメディア向け説明会を行った。メインフレームはレガシーシステムの代表格として扱われることが多いが、さまざまな方法でモダナイズ（最新化）する事例が増えており、多数の企業が今後も経営や事業の基幹を担うミッションクリティカルなシステムに位置付ける考えであるという。



Kyndryl Core Enterprise＆zCloud部門担当グローバルプラクティスリーダーのPetra Goude氏 Kyndryl Core Enterprise＆zCloud部門担当グローバルプラクティスリーダーのPetra Goude氏

解説を担当した米Kyndryl Core Enterprise＆zCloud部門担当グローバルプラクティスリーダーのPetra Goude氏によると、同社はグローバルで約3000社、日本では約600社の顧客のメインフレームを担当する。同社は2021年にIBMからスピンアウトしたが、IBM時代から現在まで「IBM z」や「zCloud」などのIBMメインフレームを中心に、他社のメインフレームソリューションを含め約60年わたりメインフレーム顧客をサポートしているという。

メインフレームの現状についてGoude氏は、「DXやビジネス変革が求められる時代になり、顧客が最も重要としているのは、優れたビジネスの成果を得るためのデータの活用やAIの効率的な利用だ。一方で、クラウドなど新しいシステムとのハイブリッド環境で適正なバランスをどう図るのか、どのような方法で最新化していくべきか、高まるセキュリティのリスクやコンプライアンスの課題にどう対応すべきかといった課題がある。そして、それらの課題に対処する人材やスキルが世界的に不足している」と指摘する。

約3000社のメインフレーム顧客を対象に実施した同社の2024年の調査では、大半の顧客にとって、今後もメインフレームが重要な位置付けにあることが明確になったとのこと。「メインフレームが業務に不可欠」との回答は89％に上り、66％がメインフレームの最重要機能にセキュリティを挙げた。

Goude氏は、「しかし、パラドックス（逆説）がある」とも述べる。回答者の96％は、メインフレームから一部のワークロードを他の環境に移行しているという。また、別の調査では、94％（日本では94％）がIT環境自体の最新化を最優先事項としつつも、実際に進めているのは29％（同25％）だった。つまり、回答企業が示すメインフレームの重要性やITシステムへの期待とは裏腹に、ハイブリッド化の進展や最新化の遅れといった現実がある。なお、同社のクラウド型IT運用自動化ソリューション「Kyndryl Bridge」のデータに基づくと、Kyndryl Bridgeで管理する顧客システムのサーバー、ストレージ、ネットワーク、OSの44％（同38％）が耐用年数を迎えている現実もあるとそうだ。

同社は、メインフレームの最新化について「Modernize On」「Integrate With」「Move Off」の3つのパターンを顧客に提案しているという。

Modernize Onはメインフレームそのものの最新化になり、国内では保険会社が富士通製のメインフレームをIBM製に移行、統合した事例がある。Integrate Withは、メインフレームとクラウドなどのハイブリッド構成によってワークロードの配置の最適化や部分的な変更を実施する。国内では、クレジットカード会社がメインフレームとAmazon Web Services（AWS）間でデータレプリケーションを行う構成にして、アプリケーション開発でのアジリティーを向上した。Move Offは、メインフレームから完全に脱却するもので、国内では、鉄鋼メーカーがメインフレームのアプリケーションとデータをLinuxベースのプライベートクラウドに移行したケースがあるとのことだ。



メインフレーム最新の主な3つのパターンとKyndryl顧客の事例（Goude氏の説明資料より） メインフレーム最新の主な3つのパターンとKyndryl顧客の事例（Goude氏の説明資料より）

Goude氏は、いずれのパターンにおいても最新化を図ることで、メインフレーム性能値（Million Instructions Per Second：MIPS）の消費量が削減され、金額的なコストが大幅に削減されると説明する。例えば、上述のIntegrate Withにおけるクレジットカード会社では年間で約100万ドル、Move Offの鉄鋼メーカーでは同1000万ドルの削減が見込まれているという。

日本についてGoude氏は、IBM以外にも富士通やBIPROGY（旧称：日本ユニシス）など複数メーカーのメインフレームが稼働したユニークな市場だと話す。「メインフレームが日本の社会を動かしていると言ってよく。メインフレームを頼りにしており、今後も長く利用する意向が強い。グローバルの中でも最新化へのニーズは日本が高い。だからこそ、われわれは、これからも日本のメインフレーム事業に投資を続け、強化もしていく」と語った。

そうした取り組みとして同氏は、直近では日本向けに、メインフレームが稼働する最新鋭データセンターとクラウドをつなぐネットワークハブ機能を新たに提供したほか、東日本と西日本の同社データセンターで「IBM z16」を用いて、15万MIPS以上の高い処理能力を持つzCloudサービスを拡充したことを強調。パートナーエコシステムを通じてメインフレームが抱える課題の解決も支援しているとアピールした。</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is reassuring employees on the Siri team who may be feeling demotivated by the recent ‌Siri‌ delays and the bad press surrounding the company's decisions, reports Bloomberg.



In a ‌Siri‌ team meeting, Apple senior director Robby Walker acknowledged that employees might be feeling "angry, disappointed, burned out and embarrassed" following the ‌Siri‌ delay, but he praised the hard work of employees and the "incredibly impressive" features they developed, saying that Apple would continue to work to "ship the world's greatest virtual assistant" to Apple users. "I saw so many people giving everything they had in order to make this happen and to make incredible progress together," he said.

The situation was described as "ugly" because the ‌Siri‌ features were shown off in public with marketing campaigns and TV commercials before there was a fully functional product. ‌Siri‌'s new functionality was also tied to the iPhone 16 launch in advertising, and it was a feature that Apple used to promote its ‌iPhone 16‌ models.

Apple decided to delay the functionality because of quality issues, with Walker telling employees that ‌Siri‌'s new features were only working properly 60 to 80 percent of the time.

To encourage employees, Walker demonstrated ‌Siri‌ locating his driver's license number, manipulating apps by embedding content in an email and adding recipients, and finding specific photos of a child. Employees on the ‌Siri‌ team will be able to use time away to recharge and prepare for "hard work ahead."

Walker told employees that it is not yet clear when the new ‌Siri‌ features will be ready for launch, but Apple's statement about the delay mentioned "in the coming year." That has been interpreted as 2026, or in an update to the iOS 19 operating system launching this fall.

Walker said that Apple is aiming for ‌iOS 19‌, but that the timeline "doesn't mean that we're shipping then." Apple will ship the ‌Siri‌ functions when they're ready to launch, and the company does not want to provide the public with unfinished features, even if "competitors might have launched them in this state or worse."



"We have other commitments across Apple to other projects," Walker said, citing new software and hardware initiatives. "We want to keep our commitments to those, and we understand those are now potentially more timeline-urgent than the features that have been deferred." He said decisions on timing will be made on a "case-by-case basis" as work progresses on products planned for next year. "Customers are not expecting only these new features but they also want a more fully rounded-out Siri," he said. "We're going to ship these features and more as soon as they are ready."

According to Bloomberg, Apple does not have plans to fire ‌Siri‌ chief John Giannandrea or any other ‌Siri‌ executives at this time, though there have been discussions about moving additional senior executives under Giannandrea to speed up development.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Brief

President Trump’s family has been weighing an investment in Binance.US, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal. The investment would come just a couple of years after Binance’s U.S. arm pleaded guilty to violating anti-money laundering regulation.

As part of that guilty plea, Binance’s founder, Changpeng Zhao, better known as CZ, paid a $4.3 billion fine and spent four months in prison back in 2023. He also agreed to step down as CEO — but remains the main shareholder in the cryptocurrency exchange.

Zhao is currently the 24th richest person in the world, according to Forbes’ ranking. The WSJ claims he’s been pushing for a pardon from the Trump administration.

Zhao’s conviction has made it difficult for Binance to find commercial partners in the U.S. or apply for crypto licenses in Europe. “I have had no discussions of a Binance U.S. deal with … well, anyone,” Zhao said in a post on X refuting the WSJ’s reporting.

But if discussions between Binance and representatives of the Trump family are indeed taking place, it seems to boil down to a simple question: What’s the value of a presidential pardon?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On March 14, 2025, the GSMA, an association representing mobile network operators worldwide, officially unveiled RCS Universal Profile 3.0, the latest iteration of the Rich Communication Services standard. At first glance, this might seem like a dry, technical update—another incremental step in the world of messaging protocols that most people would shrug off. But dig a little deeper, and it’s clear this one’s a game-changer. After years of fragmented messaging experiences, RCS 3.0 promises to finally bridge the gap between Android and iOS users, delivering secure, interoperable, end-to-end encrypted communication across platforms—a fix that’s been a long time coming.

Joe Hindy for Mashable:

‎

When Apple added RCS support to iOS 18, the company used an older version of the protocol. This caused chat messages between iPhone and Android users to be unencrypted. Fortunately, Apple has already agreed to update to the latest RCS protocol, thereby permanently fixing the issue. Google also confirmed to The Verge that it would support the new standard, making it the first time both Apple and Google did so at the same time. Google said it would work as quickly as possible to include it with Android. Of course, you’ll need to use the proper messaging apps. In this case, it would be Apple iMessage and Google Messages. Third party texting apps typically don’t support RCS at all right now, although that may change someday.

‎

MacDailyNews Note: Currently, messages between iOS users and Android settlers users remain unencrypted until both companies can get it rolled out. No date for that has yet been disclosed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Text messages sent between iPhones and Android devices will soon benefit from end-to-end encryption (E2EE), after the GSM Association (GSMA) yesterday published new specifications for the Rich Communication Services (RCS) protocol that include support for cross-platform E2EE.

RCS is a long-standing effort to enable SMS-style cross-platform communications with richer features, such as group messaging, typing indicators, read receipts, and file-sharing — similar to what messaging apps such as WhatsApp provide.

While many Android handset makers had adopted RCS through the years, Apple was the main outlier until it finally succumbed with the introduction of iOS 18 last year. Most of the core RCS features have been available for cross-platform messaging since then, but E2EE has hitherto been missing — until now.

Selling point

E2EE, for the uninitiated, is a data encryption method that ensures only the sender and the recipient of a message can read its content. For tech companies, this privacy-preserving promise is a major selling point, as it assures users that their messages are safe from snooping. Apple has offered E2EE since it launched iMessage back in 2011, though of course that only worked between iOS devices, while WhatsApp completed its E2EE rollout in 2016 (and, again, it only worked between WhatsApp users).

Google, for its part, has previously added E2EE to its own Messages app, but this was its own proprietary undertaking separate to the RCS protocol itself.

Encrypting messages across not only different clients but also entirely different platforms comes with its own unique challenges, which is where the GSMA’s universal profile enters the fray, providing a standardized specification for consistent, interoperable RCS messaging across devices, networks, and operators.

Based on the cryptographic Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol, the new E2EE mechanism in the RCS Universal Profile 3.0 is a vital piece of the interoperable jigsaw, one that will ultimately enable iPhone and Android users to communicate securely via their device’s native messaging app.

“That means that RCS will be the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers,” GSMA technical director Tom Van Pelt said in a statement. “Together with other unique security features such as SIM-based authentication, E2EE will provide RCS users with the highest level of privacy and security for stronger protection from scams, fraud and other security and privacy threats.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of the downsides of RCS messaging for a while was a lack of support for end-to-end encryption but, now, the GSMA has announced that the latest update to RCS will add the long-awaited security layer, and both Google and Apple will support it.

Starting with RCS Universal Profile 3.0, the GSMA is officially supporting end-to-end encryption via RCS messaging. This will be based on the “Messaging Layer Security” (MLS) protocol. The updated specs “define how to apply MLS within the context of RCS.” This will include support for using E2EE across different RCS clients and providers.

The GSMA explains:

Most notably, the new specifications define how to apply MLS within the context of RCS. These procedures ensure that messages and other content such as files remain confidential and secure as they travel between clients. That means that RCS will be the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers. Together with other unique security features such as SIM-based authentication, E2EE will provide RCS users with the highest level of privacy and security for stronger protection from scams, fraud and other security and privacy threats.

This comes after another major boon to RCS adoption, as Apple finally integrated support for RCS messaging into iOS last year. It was teased around that time that the GSMA, and Google, were working to bring encryption to the RCS standard.

In a statement to our sister site 9to5Mac, Apple says that it is “pleased to have helped lead” the effort to bring E2EE to the Universal Profile and says that updates to iOS, macOS, iPadOS, and watchOS are forthcoming.

End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA. We will add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates.

Beyond that, Google is also going to support this updated standard. In a statement to The Verge, Google reiterates that it has supported E2EE in Messages “for years” – Google was first added in 2020 – and says that it will “work as quickly as possible” to implement this updated specification. Presumably, this will also make it possible for Google Messages to support E2EE with other RCS apps on Android, waning in numbers as those may be.

We’ve always been committed to providing a secure messaging experience, and Google Messages users have had end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) RCS messaging for years. We’re excited to have this updated specification from GSMA and work as quickly as possible with the mobile ecosystem to implement and extend this important user protection to cross-platform RCS messaging.

To be clear, these updates are not available yet, but the required standard update is ready.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple says it will add support for a new Rich Communication Services (RCS) specification that includes end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for messages sent over the protocol in future software updates.

"End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA," said an Apple spokesperson. "We will add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates."

The GSM Association (GSMA), the organization responsible for developing the RCS standard, started working to enable E2EE on messages sent between Android and iPhone in September last year. It only announced the new RCS specification with E2EE support today, so it's not clear how long it will take Apple to incorporate the updated profile into its software. But at least it's coming.

Apple adopted RCS with last year's release of iOS 18.1, which replaced SMS with ‌RCS‌ messaging for texts sent to Android users. While the update brings improvements such as high-resolution media sharing, read receipts, and typing indicators, it notably lacks E2EE – something Apple's proprietary iMessage system already supports.

The implementation of E2EE for cross-platform ‌RCS‌ messages would prevent third parties, such as messaging services or cell carriers, from viewing the content of texts. This added layer of security would also prevent state surveillance of citizens' ‌RCS‌ communications.

Google Messages already supports E2EE by default for RCS texts, but this applies only to conversations between Google Messages users. Messages exchanged with iPhone users or those using other RCS clients on Android are not encrypted.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In collaboration with the GSM Association, Apple today announced it will add support for end-to-end encryption for RCS messages. This brings RCS much closer to iMessage in terms of security standards.

The new RCS Universal Profile 3.0 including end-to-encryption was only just released today, so it’s not clear exactly when this support will ship to customers. Apple said it helped lead a cross industry effort to bring end-to-encryption to the RCS Universal Profile …

Apple first added RCS support to the iPhone with iOS 18.1 last fall. RCS enables more rich communication experiences with Android users who aren’t using iMessage, through an industry standard which supplants traditional SMS.

RCS includes features like typing indicators, emoji reactions, read receipts and support for higher-resolution photo and video attachments.

However, until today, the RCS Universal Profile standard did not support end-to-encryption for messages sent over the protocol. But now that this capability has been incorporated into the standard, Apple has committed to integrating it.

In a statement to 9to5Mac, Apple said:

End-to-end encryption is a powerful privacy and security technology that iMessage has supported since the beginning, and now we are pleased to have helped lead a cross industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile published by the GSMA. We will add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates.

It is great to see Apple immediately commit to support such a significant advancement in the RCS standard, helping improve the security of communications for all of its users.

As a reminder, end-to-end encryption means the decryption keys for your conversations are only available on your own device, and thus no backend intermediary is able to intercept and read them. iMessage has offered end-to-end encryption since its inception.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We’re one week removed from Apple’s decision to indefinitely delay the “more personalized” version of Siri that was first announced at WWDC 2024, and the blowback hasn’t let up.

Now, Bloomberg has the details from an all-hands meeting for the Siri division inside Apple, where the Apple Intelligence delays were panned as “ugly” and “embarrassing.”

The meeting was led by Robby Walker, a senior director of “Siri and Information Intelligence” at Apple. Walker has been at Apple since 2013, working across Siri technologies. During the meeting, Walker reportedly emphasized that “it’s unclear” when the promised Siri features will launch. This includes Siri with personal context, in-app actions, and on-screen awareness.

Apple’s goal remains to ship these features at some point in the iOS 19, but Walker said “it doesn’t mean that we’re shipping then.” In its current form, the new Siri features only work properly “up to two-thirds to 80% of the time,” Bloomberg reports:

“We have other commitments across Apple to other projects,” Walker said, citing new software and hardware initiatives. “We want to keep our commitments to those, and we understand those are now potentially more timeline-urgent than the features that have been deferred.” He said decisions on timing will be made on a “case-by-case basis” as work progresses on products planned for next year. “Customers are not expecting only these new features but they also want a more fully rounded-out Siri,” he said. “We’re going to ship these features and more as soon as they are ready.”

As far as accountability is concerned, Walker told staffers that there is “intense personal accountability” shared by John Giannandrea, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Machine Learning and AI Strategy, and software boss Craig Federighi.

Bloomberg reports that Apple “doesn’t plan to immediately fire any top executives over the AI crisis.” It is, however, planning “management adjustments” in response to the problems, including “moving more senior executives under Giannandrea to assist with a turnaround effort.”

Walker also called out Apple’s marketing department’s decision to promote these features even though they weren’t ready. This decision “[made] matters worse,” according to Walker.

But when Apple demonstrated the features at WWDC using a video mock-up, it only had a barely working prototype, Bloomberg has reported. Walker told staff in the meeting that the delays were especially “ugly” because Apple had already showed off the features publicly. “This was not one of these situations where we get to show people our plan after it’s done,” he said. “We showed people before.”

Despite the struggles, Walker also praised the team for the “incredibly impressive” features and doubled down on the goal of shipping “the world’s greatest virtual assistant.” He told staff they should “feel really proud of innovative work” they’ve done up to this point.

Walker defended his Siri group, telling them that they should be proud. Employees poured their “hearts and souls into this thing,” he said. “I saw so many people giving everything they had in order to make this happen and to make incredible progress together.” But Apple wants to maintain a high bar and only deliver the features when they’re polished, he said. “These are not quite ready to go to the general public, even though our competitors might have launched them in this state or worse.” Walker compared the endeavor to an attempt to swim to Hawaii. “We swam hundreds of miles — we set a Guinness Book for World Records for swimming distance — but we still didn’t swim to Hawaii,” he said. “And we were being jumped on, not for the amazing swimming that we did, but the fact that we didn’t get to the destination.”

While Apple has not shown public demos of the promised SIri upgrades, Walker did highlight several examples of the features working during this meeting.

For regular readers of TechCrunch Mobility, you may be wondering, “Why did this newsletter land in my inbox on Friday?” Folks, we’re moving days in an effort to bring you a more complete rundown of the news of the week.

I spent the last week at SXSW, the annual tech, film, comedy, and music festival in Austin. I recommend scrolling through our live blog to catch up on all the transportation, AI, social media, creator economy — basically tech — news that happened during the conference.

I’ve watched Austin evolve over the years with some good and bad outcomes. Protected bike lanes have been one positive development, which I appreciated as I rode a few Lime scooters and two Mod Bikes e-bikes around the city. Austin is also becoming a hub for autonomous vehicle activity with Avride headquartered there, Zoox testing on public roads, and Waymo launching a commercial robotaxi service.

I was lucky enough to be matched with two Waymo robotaxis — all ride-hails occur through the Uber app, so it’s never a guarantee. I also had one coordinated match courtesy of Waymo. As I wrote earlier this week, it is absolutely wild that Waymo and Uber are working together. Here’s why.

Oh, and here is what I discovered in my Waymo-Uber robotaxi ride. Hint: some updates to the user interface.

The firm, which has funded around 20 startups, broadly focuses on decarbonization with a portfolio that includes EV companies, space and battery plays, and four nuclear fusion startups.

That’s not the interesting part. Here’s what is: All of the money in its fund came from the Volkswagen Group. Check out the full story about why the German automotive giant has committed $300 million to Leitmotif’s first fund.

Other deals that got my attention …

Carpool Logistics, a vehicle logistics platform, raised $12 million in a Series A funding round led by Wavecrest Growth Partners, with participation from CarMax, Impel founders Devin Daly and Michael Quigley, and automotive industry veteran David Metter.

Daqus Energy, a startup working on battery materials, raised $6 million in a seed round led by Morningside with participation from unnamed individual investors.

Nirvana, an AI-based insurance platform that uses real-time driving telematics and 20 billion miles of truck driving data to build and manage insurance policies for truckers, raised $80 million in a Series C round of funding led by General Catalyst. Lightspeed Venture Partners and Valor Equity Partners also participated. The investment values Nirvana at $830 million post-money.

Northvolt filed for bankruptcy in Sweden, the latest blow to Europe’s attempts to create a battery-manufacturing juggernaut that could rival the Chinese giants.

Rivian rolled out a hands-free version of its driver-assistance system for highway driving, which founder and CEO RJ Scaringe discussed onstage at SXSW in Austin. The new hands-free feature puts Rivian in competition with Ford and GM, which have similar hands-free systems that control steering, acceleration, and braking under certain conditions and locations.

Autonomous vehicles

Hugging Face teamed up with AI startup Yaak to expand LeRobot — a collection of open AI models, datasets, and tools to help build real-world robotics systems — with a training set to allow robots and cars to navigate environments like city streets autonomously.

Trucks VC general partner Reilly Brennan had an interesting column, Don’t mistake ridehailing for AV ridehailing.

Travis Kalanick, the former CEO of Uber, thinks the company’s decision to abandon its autonomous driving program was a mistake. Reminder: Uber ATG was burning through cash when it was sold to Aurora in 2020.

Waymo keeps expanding — this time in Silicon Valley. And that expansion has come with hundreds of parking tickets.

Electric vehicles, charging, & batteries

The Mint 400 off-road race put two EVs — a Rivian R1T truck and a Chevrolet Silverado EV ZR2 off-road race truck concept — to the test.

Rad Power lost its CEO and gained a new one in a span of a few days.

President Donald Trump said he will label violence against Tesla dealerships as domestic terrorism — yet another sign of his deep support for Elon Musk. As reporter Sean O’Kane notes, “Tesla Takeovers” have been breaking out across the globe at Tesla dealerships as people protest what they see as a hostile takeover of the federal government by Musk (who is CEO of Tesla and its largest shareholder) and his Department of Government Efficiency. Some of the protests have resulted in graffiti on Tesla signs, charging stations set on fire, even Molotov cocktails being thrown in one dealership’s lot.

This week’s wheels

This week I tried two e-bikes from Austin-based Mod Bikes. I’ll focus on its newest one, the Groove, which launched earlier this week.

I spent 24 hours with the Groove, an all-electric step-through bike with a souped-up beach cruiser look and feel. The Groove existed before, but Mod Bikes discontinued it. Now it’s back and has been updated throughout, including the frame, battery, torque sensor, smart display, and motor.

The bike itself is sporty and polished with lots of thoughtful details that make the $1,999 price seem like a steal. The design is thoughtful with easy-to-read and easy-to-operate controls and an integrated bike lock that folds neatly on the frame.

The Groove is a throttle and pedal assist bike, and I found it easy to switch between the various modes. I rarely relied on the throttle alone because the assist provided plenty of oomph. The bike has a payload capacity of 275 pounds and reaches a top speed of 28 miles per hour. The Groove has 50 miles of range; however, there is a dual-battery option that pops it up to 100 miles.

One note, though: Wow, this bike is hefty. And while that is generally a good thing, folks should give themselves a bit of time to adjust to its weight.

I also tested Mod Connect, which allows users to wirelessly pair a Lumos ultra-smart helmet to sync and control turn signals directly from the bike. The connected bike helmet made me feel far more visible to drivers as I navigated the busy streets of downtown Austin.



What is “This week’s wheels”? It’s a chance to learn about the different transportation products we’re testing, whether it’s an electric or hybrid car, an e-bike, or even a ride in an autonomous vehicle.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In Brief

The U.K. government’s secret order to Apple demanding it backdoor the end-to-end encrypted version of its iCloud storage service has now been challenged by two civil rights groups, Liberty and Privacy International, which filed complaints Thursday. They called the order “unacceptable and disproportionate” and warned of “global consequences” as the access order is thought to extend to non-U.K. users too.

The pair, along with two named individuals — Privacy International’s executive director Gus Hosein and the civil liberties advocate Ben Wizner — have instructed law firm Leigh Day to challenge Home Department Secretary of State Yvette Cooper’s decision to serve Apple with a technical capability notice (TCN) under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA). The existence of the secret order only emerged via press reports last month.

“Privacy International and Liberty fear this TCN, or similar TCNs in the future, could be used to undermine end-to-end encryption essential to the protection of privacy and free expression,” they wrote in a press release.

Apple has already filed a legal challenge to the TCN — and its appeal is due to be heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), the body that oversees complaints against U.K. intelligence agencies. Both civil rights groups, Hosein, and Wizner contend that they are direct victims of the government’s TCN decision and are asked for their complaints to be joined to Apple’s.

They are also calling for the case to be heard in public, rather than behind closed doors — joining earlier calls from privacy rights groups. The IPT hearing is thought to be scheduled for Friday, March 14.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We’ve all experienced that moment of frustration when the GPS glitches and you miss an exit on the highway. The team at Tern AI, which is building a low-cost GPS alternative, says that’s because the current technology is limited by its reliance on satellite positioning.

Tern AI says it has figured out how to locate the position of a vehicle using only map information and a vehicle’s existing sensor data. The company’s pitch: It’s a cheap system that doesn’t require any additional expensive sensors.

At SXSW, the Austin-based startup demonstrated exclusively for TechCrunch that it could “derive a position from nothing.”

“No triangulation, no satellites, no WiFi, nothing. We just figure out where we are as we drive,” Brett Harrison, co-founder and president, told TechCrunch while Cyrus Behroozi, senior software developer at Tern, loaded up the demo on his iPhone. “That’s really game changing because as we move away from triangulation-based, which limits technology, now we have the ability to be fully of that grid.”

Harrison says this breakthrough is important for a number of reasons. From a commercial standpoint, companies that rely on GPS — including ride-hail apps to delivery companies — lose time, money, and gas every time their drivers have to double back because of faulty GPS positioning.

More importantly, our most critical systems such as aviation to disaster response to precision farming rely on GPS. Foreign adversaries have already demonstrated that they can spoof GPS signals, which could have catastrophic impacts both on the economy and national security.

The U.S. has signaled that it wants to prioritize alternatives to GPS. During his first term, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to reduce reliance on a single source of PNT (positioning, navigation, and timing) services, like GPS. There are also several other initiatives which direct agencies and bodies like the Department of Defense and the National Security Council to ensure resilient PNT by testing and integrating non-GPS technologies.

“DeepSeek came out and said it cost us $6 million to do what it took [OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies] billions to do,” Harrison said. “To get that dot to move across a map in real-time in a vehicle, it took the government billions of dollars and a few decades. We did it with less than $2 million.”

Tern came out of stealth in February 2024 and announced its $4.4 million seed round a few months later. That’s a quick turnaround to achieve the type of positioning I experienced this week at SXSW.

Testing Tern’s system in Austin

To start the demonstration, Behroozi connected his 2019 Honda Civic to his phone via Bluetooth, allowing the Tern application to pull in data from the vehicle’s existing sensors. He noted that Tern’s tech can be integrated directly into vehicles, beginning model years 2009 and up.

Usually, Tern sets the position manually to speed things up, but for our demo, the team wanted a “cold start.” Fehroozi turned off his phone’s location services, so the Tern intelligent system had only a cached map of a 500-square-mile boundary around Austin and vehicle sensors to work with.

As the car drove, the system picked up road data to work towards “convergence.” It took roughly 10 minutes for the system to reach full convergence from a cold start, but Harrison assured me it usually takes around one to two minutes when it has a starting point. Plus, we were stuck in a bit of traffic, which slowed things down, Behroozi added.

Harrison noted that Tern’s system can also localize vehicles in parking garages, tunnels, and on mountains, which GPS struggles to do. Harrison wouldn’t explain exactly how, saying the information is “proprietary.”

We drove around for a few more minutes after the system reached full convergence, and I watched as it steadily tracked our precise movements in a way that appeared as good as, and in some cases better than, GPS. That became more apparent when we drove into downtown Austin, where my Google Maps regularly mislocated me throughout the week as I navigated urban streets dotted with towering buildings.

Harrison said that Tern’s system is also safer from a privacy perspective because with GPS, “if anyone knows your ID, they can find you at any time.”

“Our system is a total closed loop,” he said. “Right now, we’re not emitting anything. It’s independently deriving its own position [via on edge computing], so there are no external touchpoints.”

Built to scale

“We set up the company and the solution from the start to be scalable. If you look at that Waymo car and all of the hardware that’s embedded, we don’t see that going on a Nissan Sentra anytime soon. It’s just too expensive. ” Harrison said, pointing ahead of us to a Waymo-Uber robotaxi.

“At the manufacturer level, if [Tern] is implemented within the infotainment system, it’s just a software download, so extraordinarily scalable. All new vehicles have the sensor data we need. The map data already exists with all the providers today. So it’s quite simple.”

Tern’s potential future customers could be anyone from automakers to mobile phone manufacturers, from Google to Uber. Harrison said the startup is open to growing the company, but also an acquisition.

“The primary thing is getting this out into the economy’s hands, with the growing threats and the emergence of tech that’s not realizing its full potential because of the limits of triangulation,” Harrison said.

He noted that Tern is exploring possibilities with the government. The startup recently received a contract award from the U.S. Department of Transportation after a week of demonstrating its technology along with nine other companies from around the world.

“We’re hoping we did a good job of showing the government what’s possible now with American innovation,” Harrison said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The new Netflix movie “The Electric State” depicts a world full of robots — but not robots as we know them.

Directed by brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (who previously helmed two Avengers blockbusters, “Infinity War” and “Endgame”) for a reported budget of $320 million, “The Electric State” takes place in an alternate version of the 1990s, one where sentient robots have existed for decades. That’s long enough for them to have rebelled against their human masters, lost the war, and found themselves exiled to an area of the Southwest — an area that the film’s heroes (played by Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt) must sneak into.

Crucially for visual effects supervisor Matthew E. Butler, design-wise, these robots are “deliberately the antithesis” of the robots that exist today.

“Most of us have seen modern-day robots … and are used to these designs,” Butler told me. “If you look at Boston Dynamics robots, you’ll notice that they concentrate the mass of the robot at the center of the robot, and then as you go out to the extremities, they get less and less massive, because that’s just a defensible design.”

In contrast, the movie’s robot Cosmo has “a giant head on a tiny neck,” which Butler described as “the worst design for a robot.”

Like the movie itself, that design is based on Simon Stålenhag’s illustrated novel of the same name. But Butler explained that there’s an in-movie explanation for Cosmo and the other quirky robots that are often drawn from real and imagined pop culture: They were created to be “unthreatening,” which is why they all look “kind of cutesy and goofy and fun.”

All of that meant Butler’s team had to start with a design that was innately impractical but eventually create something that felt “physically believable and real.” He said that to do that, they decided to honor Cosmo’s design in “silhouette fashion.”

“If you squint and you put him a distance away from [the] camera, he looks like Cosmo, the way he is in the book,” Butler said. “But if you go up close and you scrutinize a shoulder, you’ll see that there are push rods in there, and you can see the motors, you can see the circuitry, same with the ankles and the feet.”

The goal is to convince audiences that “the thing can really work.” Once they’re convinced, they’ll accept Cosmo’s design, and the design of the other robots, without seeing all the details.

And yes, there are plenty of other robots. Butler said his team had to bring “hundreds and hundreds of unique robots” to life — unique not because every robot in this alternate world is one-of-a-kind, but because “in the movie, we typically just showcase individuals.”

And unfortunately, there were no shortcuts.

“We scratched our heads so many times — like, ‘How the hell do we do this?’” he said. “If you’ve got 100 different robots and they’re all moving, they’ve got to be able to move, which means you’ve got to be able to rig them, so someone has to design them, someone has to paint them, someone has to animate them.”

To bring those robots to life, Butler said the team used a combination of traditional optical motion capture and a newer system using accelerometer-based suits. That allowed a troupe of seven motion capture performers to work with the live action actors on location and on set, with their performance then providing the basis for the animated robots — whether they’re human-sized, gigantic, or fit into the palm of a character’s hand.

Butler emphasized that the process was far more complicated than simply transposing an actor’s movements onto a robot body.

“Take little Herman as an example,” he said. “You’ve got the [motion capture] performer, and he’s adding his flair, his performance, and it’s someone that Chris Pratt can now act with. Then you say, ‘Well, OK, but the actual robot can’t do a lot of the things that this guy can do.’ So now you need to change it based on the limitations of the design of the robot itself.”

And it’s not over yet: “And then you talk to the directors, and there’s a particular change of characteristics, which you now need to honor, so then you change that, and then you’ve got your fabulous voice actors who add so much, and now it’s like, ‘Well, if the character [sounds like] that then the cadence needs to change.’”

Butler said the robots we ultimately see on screen were created by the work of all those artists and performers coming together: “And that’s why we really just rolled up our sleeves and got on with it.”</p>

China appears to think homegrown AI startup DeepSeek could become a notable tech success story for the country.

After DeepSeek’s sudden rise to fame in January with the release of its open “reasoning” model, R1, the company is now operating under new, tighter government-influenced restrictions, according to The Information. Some of the company’s employees have been prevented from traveling abroad freely, and the Chinese government is now playing a role in screening potential investors, according to The Information.

DeepSeek is enforcing the travel restrictions by having its parent company, quantitative hedge fund High-Flyer, hold onto certain staff’s passports.

The developments come a few weeks after it was reported that the Chinese government was instructing AI researchers and entrepreneurs to avoid traveling to the U.S., fearing the loss of trade secrets.

TechCrunch has reached out to DeepSeek for comment.</p>

Not quite four weddings and a funeral, but almost.

Hinged: Hinge Health, a virtual physical therapy startup that uses technology to help treat chronic musculoskeletal conditions, filed to go public and is hoping to raise up to $500 million through this offering.

Fervor: Fervo Energy, a well-funded startup that is working with Google on a first-of-its-kind geothermal power plant, is reportedly planning to IPO in the next two years.

Picked: Peak.ai, a startup founded in Manchester, England, that builds “decision-making” AI, was acquired by UiPath, the now public robotic process automation (RPA) company. Peak had raised $121 million, including a $75 million round backed by SoftBank in 2021.

Butterfly effect: Manus, the “agentic” AI platform launched by Chinese startup Butterfly Effect, is generating a ton of buzz, although some early users warned it is no panacea, writes TechCrunch’s newly appointed AI editor Kyle Wiggers. But the butterfly effect is still there: Browser Use, one of the tools powering Manus, is also going viral.

The end: Swedish battery manufacturing startup Northvolt filed for bankruptcy in Sweden this week. It had already filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. in November.

Most interesting VC and funding news this week

Image Credits:Ditto

Plenty of deals, but also another week in which the round’s size won’t tell you the round’s letter.

Ditto: San Francisco-based startup Ditto raised an $82 million Series B at a $462 million post-money valuation to make sure corporate clients can access data on edge devices even when connectivity is unstable.

Good karma: Nirvana, an AI-based insurance platform that uses telematics data to build and manage insurance policies for truckers, raised an $80 million Series C round of funding at an $830 million post-money valuation.

BI: Omni, a business intelligence platform that helps organizations better analyze their data, closed a $69 million Series B round. The company also expects its annual recurring revenue to triple this year, increasing from nearly $10 million.

Pentesting: Pentera, a cybersecurity startup founded in Tel Aviv but now based in Boston, raised a $60 million Series D at a valuation over $1 billion. It plans to use the funding for M&A and product development.

Problem zolved: Zolve, a neobank for highly skilled foreigners moving to the U.S. without credit history, raised $51 million in equity for its Series B round. It also secured $200 million in debt and plans to enter new geographies.

New name, new money: Estonia-based startup Blackwall, formerly known as BotGuard, raised a €45 million Series B round (approximately $49.2 million) to protect SMBs from malicious online traffic via midmarket hosting platforms and other service providers.

Predictive maintenance: Indian startup Infinite Uptime, which helps factories optimize equipment usage thanks to a sensor-based predictive maintenance solution, raised a $35 million Series C funding round to expand into the U.S. and other markets.

Italians do it better? Early-stage Italian VC firm Vento is launching a €75 million fund to back Italian startup founders, including those living abroad. This is Vento’s second fund; its portfolio already includes some 100 startups.

Last but not least

Y Combinator’s latest Demo Day signaled a “vibe shift,” according to a regular attendee. Terrence Rohan, an investor with Otherwise Fund who’s been investing in Y Combinator since 2010, noted that it is now common to see founders raising less money on purpose — and not for lack of VC interest. This stirred discussion as to whether it is a good idea.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arizona lawmakers are debating a bill that would protect utilities from wildfire-related lawsuits, a move that would likely send shockwaves through the insurance industry.

The bill would make it harder to prove that utilities are to blame for wildfires started by faulty or poorly maintained equipment while also limiting damages. In exchange for reduced liability, utilities would need to file plans every two years detailing the steps they’re taking to limit the risk of wildfires.

The bill, as currently written, doesn’t really require utilities to stick to those plans. If a utility doesn’t follow its plans or is negligent in maintaining its equipment, it is still protected from claims.

The insurance industry has been reeling from wildfires, and the bill could have the unintended effect of shifting the burden of wildfire claims from utilities onto homeowners’ insurers.

“There’s no free lunch in this,” Marcus Osborn, an insurance company lobbyist, said at a public hearing on the bill. “You’re either going to pay in higher insurance premiums or you’re going to pay in higher utility costs.”

Some homeowners in Arizona have seen their rates triple this year while others have had their coverage dropped.

That’s largely a result of insurance companies trying to cover their losses as wildfire claims stack up. Hippo, an insurance startup that went public via SPAC in 2021, reported $42 million in losses as a result of the recent Los Angeles wildfires. Lemonade, another startup that went public in 2020, is expecting to lose $45 million from the same disaster.

Compounding risks from wildfires have given other startups an opening. Kettle, for example, sells reinsurance and models possible wildfire outcomes to help other companies backstop their wildfire risk. Still, the overall trend has been toward higher costs for homeowners.

The Arizona bill is being mooted as states throughout the Western U.S. grapple with the threat — and fallout — of wildfires made worse by climate change and over a century of fire suppression.

For decades, fires in the U.S. were stamped out as quickly as possible. Before, low-intensity fires would race through the understory, killing weak saplings and transforming dry leaf litter into rich ash that fertilized the soil. But as fires were suppressed, understories grew thick with brush and years of accumulated leaf litter.

Those conditions created what wildfire experts call “ladder fuels,” which help carry low-intensity fires from the forest floor into the canopy, where they can turn catastrophic.

Against that backdrop, climate change has been compounding the risk of high-intensity canopy fires. Rising temperatures have exacerbated droughts, according to a study published in November, by increasing evaporation. In other words, what little precipitation does fall to the ground ends up back in the atmosphere more quickly than before, leading to even drier conditions.

Warmer winters have also been to blame. Lower snowpack leads to drier spring conditions, and insects whose populations were usually kept in check by bitter cold temperatures have been thriving. For example, warmer temperatures and voracious pine beetles killed more than 100 million trees in California between 2014 and 2017. Those dead trees became an ideal fuel that drove wildfires in subsequent years.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Silicon Valley is bullish on AI agents. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said agents will “join the workforce” this year. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella predicted that agents will replace certain knowledge work. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said that Salesforce’s goal is to be “the number one provider of digital labor in the world” via the company’s various “agentic” services.

But no one can seem to agree on what an AI agent is, exactly.

In the last few years, the tech industry has boldly proclaimed that AI “agents” — the latest buzzword — are going to change everything. In the same way that AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT gave us new ways to surface information, agents will fundamentally change how we approach work, claim CEOs like Altman and Nadella.

That may be true. But it also depends on how one defines “agents,” which is no easy task. Much like other AI-related jargon (e.g. “multimodal,” “AGI,” and “AI” itself), the terms “agent” and “agentic” are becoming diluted to the point of meaninglessness.

That threatens to leave OpenAI, Microsoft, Salesforce, Amazon, Google, and the countless other companies building entire product lineups around agents in an awkward place. An agent from Amazon isn’t the same as an agent from Google or any other vendor, and that’s leading to confusion — and customer frustration.

Ryan Salva, senior director of product at Google and an ex-GitHub Copilot leader, said he’s come to “hate” the word “agents.”

“I think that our industry overuses the term ‘agent’ to the point where it is almost nonsensical,” Salva told TechCrunch in an interview. “[It is] one of my pet peeves.”

The agent definition dilemma isn’t new. In a piece last year, former TechCrunch reporter Ron Miller asked: What’s an AI agent? The problem he identified is that nearly every company building agents approaches the tech differently.

It’s a problem that’s worsened recently.

This week, OpenAI published a blog post that defined agents as “automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks on behalf of users.” Yet in the same week, the company released developer documentation that defined agents as “LLMs equipped with instructions and tools.”

Leher Pathak, OpenAI’s API product marketing lead, later said in a post on X that she understood the terms “assistants” and “agents” to be interchangeable — further muddying the waters.

Meanwhile, Microsoft’s blogs try to distinguish between agents and AI assistants. The former, which Microsoft calls the “new apps” for an “AI-powered world,” can be tailored to have a particular expertise, while assistants merely help with general tasks, like drafting emails.

AI lab Anthropic addresses the hodgepodge of agent definitions a little more directly. In a blog post, Anthropic says that agents “can be defined in several ways,” including both “fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods” and “prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows.”

Salesforce has what’s perhaps the most wide-ranging definition of AI “agent.” According to the software giant, agents are “a type of […] system that can understand and respond to customer inquiries without human intervention.” The company’s website lists six different categories, ranging from “simple reflex agents” to “utility-based agents.”

So why the chaos?

Well, agents — like AI — are a nebulous thing, and they’re constantly evolving. OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have just started shipping what they consider to be their first agents — OpenAI’s Operator, Google’s Project Mariner, and Perplexity’s shopping agent — and their capabilities are all over the map.

Rich Villars, GVP of worldwide research at IDC, noted that tech companies “have a long history” of not rigidly adhering to technical definitions.

“They care more about what they are trying to accomplish” on a technical level, Villars told TechCrunch, “especially in fast-evolving markets.”

But marketing is also to blame in large part, according to Andrew Ng, the founder of AI learning platform DeepLearning.ai.

“The concepts of AI ‘agents’ and ‘agentic’ workflows used to have a technical meaning,” Ng said in a recent interview, “but about a year ago, marketers and a few big companies got a hold of them.”

The lack of a unified definition for agents is both an opportunity and a challenge, Jim Rowan, head of AI for Deloitte, says. On the one hand, the ambiguity allows for flexibility, letting companies customize agents to their needs. On the other, it may — and arguably already has — lead to “misaligned expectations” and difficulties in measuring the value and ROI from agentic projects.

“Without a standardized definition, at least within an organization, it becomes challenging to benchmark performance and ensure consistent outcomes,” Rowan said. “This can result in varied interpretations of what AI agents should deliver, potentially complicating project goals and results. Ultimately, while the flexibility can drive creative solutions, a more standardized understanding would help enterprises better navigate the AI agent landscape and maximize their investments.”

Unfortunately, if the unraveling of the term “AI” is any indication, it seems unlikely the industry will coalesce around one definition of “agent” anytime soon — if ever.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DeepSeek has gone viral.

Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week after its chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts (and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques, have led Wall Street analysts — and technologists — to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain.

But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly?

DeepSeek’s trader origins

DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions.

AI enthusiast Liang Wenfeng co-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.

In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek.

From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China, DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies.

DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The company reportedly aggressively recruits doctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities. DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science background to help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times.

DeepSeek’s strong models

DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice.

DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.

DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety.

According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’s Llama and “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’s GPT-4o.

Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claims R1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks.

Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math.

There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject to benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy.

A disruptive approach

If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free. It’s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest.

The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some experts dispute the figures the company has supplied, however.

Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models, developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1 that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined.

DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has been described as “upending AI” and “over-hyped.” The company’s success was at least in part responsible for causing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18% in January, and for eliciting a public response from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.

Microsoft announced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said spending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage” for Meta. In March, OpenAI called DeepSeek “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,” and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek.

During Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,” saying that it and other “reasoning” models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute.

At the same time, some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entire countries and governments, including South Korea. New York state also banned DeepSeek from being used on government devices.

As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to be growing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TikTok, owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, has been at the center of controversy in the U.S. for four years now due to concerns about user data potentially being accessed by the Chinese government. Just this past month, the app experienced a temporary outage in the U.S. that left millions of users in suspense before it was quickly restored.

TikTok returned to the App Store and Google Play Store in February.

Nonetheless, TikTok’s future remains uncertain, and a number of investors are competing for the opportunity to purchase the app. The platform’s U.S. business could have its valuation soar to upward of $60 billion, as estimated by CFRA Research’s senior vice president, Angelo Zino.

TikTok ban: What’s happened so far

To fully understand this high-stakes drama, we’ll first revisit the timeline of TikTok’s tumultuous relationship with the U.S. government, which resulted in various legal battles and negotiations.

The drama first began in August 2020, when Trump signed an executive order to ban transactions with parent company ByteDance.

A month later, Trump’s administration sought to force a sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations to a U.S.-based company. The leading contenders included Microsoft, Oracle, and Walmart. However, a U.S. judge temporarily blocked Trump’s executive order, allowing TikTok to continue operating while the legal battle unfolded.

Things began to progress even more last year following the transition to the Biden administration. The U.S. House of Representatives, in an overwhelming 360-58 vote, passed the legislation against TikTok. On April 23, 2024, the Senate passed the bill.

Shortly after, President Joe Biden signed the bill requiring TikTok to be sold or banned. In response, TikTok sued the U.S. government, challenging the constitutionality of the ban and arguing the app and its American users were having their First Amendment rights violated. The company has consistently denied that it poses a security threat, asserting that its data stored in the U.S. complies with all local laws.

Trump has a change of heart

On December 27, 2024, Trump opposed the potential ban of TikTok in a court filing, stating he could find a way to keep the app in the U.S. This stance was a stark contrast to his approach during his first presidency and presented a surprising turn of events for TikTok.

In January, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA), commonly referred to as “the TikTok ban.” TikTok made a formal announcement that it would likely have to go dark on January 19.

TikTok shuts down … then comes back online

Although TikTok indeed shut itself down in the U.S. when the act came into effect, it didn’t last long. The app came back online less than 12 hours later. The platform noted, “As a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.”

Where we are today

On January 20, Trump signed an executive order that postponed the TikTok ban for 75 days. This extension provides the app with additional time to either sell a stake in the platform or reach an agreement with Trump. His goal is to achieve a 50-50 ownership arrangement between ByteDance and a U.S. company.

More recently, in early March, Trump told reporters that his administration was in talks with four different groups that are interested in buying the platform, per Reuters.

No definitive deal has been reached yet for the sale of the platform, but we could find out very soon.

Below is a list of the investor groups and companies rumored to be potential buyers of TikTok’s U.S. operations. (Surprisingly, Elon Musk is not among them.)

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Text messages sent between iPhones and Android devices will soon benefit from end-to-end encryption (E2EE), after the GSM Association (GSMA) yesterday published new specifications for the Rich Communication Services (RCS) protocol that include support for cross-platform E2EE.

RCS is a long-standing effort to enable SMS-style cross-platform communications with richer features, such as group messaging, typing indicators, read receipts, and file-sharing — similar to what messaging apps such as WhatsApp provide.

While many Android handset makers had adopted RCS through the years, Apple was the main outlier until it finally succumbed with the introduction of iOS 18 last year. Most of the core RCS features have been available for cross-platform messaging since then, but E2EE has hitherto been missing — until now.

Selling point

E2EE, for the uninitiated, is a data encryption method that ensures only the sender and the recipient of a message can read its content. For tech companies, this privacy-preserving promise is a major selling point, as it assures users that their messages are safe from snooping. Apple has offered E2EE since it launched iMessage back in 2011, though of course that only worked between iOS devices, while WhatsApp completed its E2EE rollout in 2016 (and, again, it only worked between WhatsApp users).

Google, for its part, has previously added E2EE to its own Messages app, but this was its own proprietary undertaking separate to the RCS protocol itself.

Encrypting messages across not only different clients but also entirely different platforms comes with its own unique challenges, which is where the GSMA’s universal profile enters the fray, providing a standardized specification for consistent, interoperable RCS messaging across devices, networks, and operators.

Based on the cryptographic Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol, the new E2EE mechanism in the RCS Universal Profile 3.0 is a vital piece of the interoperable jigsaw, one that will ultimately enable iPhone and Android users to communicate securely via their device’s native messaging app.

“That means that RCS will be the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers,” GSMA technical director Tom Van Pelt said in a statement. “Together with other unique security features such as SIM-based authentication, E2EE will provide RCS users with the highest level of privacy and security for stronger protection from scams, fraud and other security and privacy threats.”</p>

Rostislav Panev, a 51-year-old dual Russian and Israeli national who is accused of being a key developer for the notorious LockBit ransomware gang, has been extradited from Israel to the United States, the Department of Justice announced on Thursday.

Panev was arrested in Israel in December 2024, becoming the third person arrested for their role in LockBit. Since then, Panev had been awaiting extradition in Israel.

Prosecutors allege Panev was a developer working for the LockBit ransomware group from its beginnings in 2019 and until at least February 2024. Panev and other LockBit developers designed the gang’s malware and maintained its infrastructure, and split the criminal proceeds with the gang’s affiliates, who were the ones carrying out cyberattacks and extorting victims, according to the DOJ.

“If you are a member of the LockBit ransomware conspiracy, the United States will find you and bring you to justice,” said U.S. Attorney John Giordano.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A group of bipartisan U.S. lawmakers are urging the head of the U.K.’s surveillance court to hold an open hearing into Apple’s anticipated challenge of an alleged secret U.K. government legal demand.

U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, along with four other federal lawmakers, said in a letter this week to the president of the U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) that it is “in the public interest” that any hearings about the alleged order are not held in secret.

The lawmakers’ letter also says that the alleged U.K. order has barred California-based Apple from engaging in speech that is “constitutionally protected” under U.S. law and impedes the lawmakers’ ability to conduct congressional oversight.

The Washington Post revealed in February that the U.K. government had earlier this year secretly ordered Apple to create a “backdoor,” allowing U.K. authorities to access the cloud-stored data of any Apple customer worldwide. Apple, which is legally barred from disclosing or commenting on the “technical capabilities notice,” reportedly refused and pulled its Advanced Data Protection iCloud data-encryption feature from U.K. customers, rather than comply with the backdoor order.

The U.K.’s Investigatory Powers Tribunal, which hears legal cases related to the use of U.K. surveillance powers, is scheduled to hear a private petition on Friday, per the tribunal’s public schedule. The hearing reportedly relates to Apple, according to Wyden’s letter.

Apple did not comment when contacted by TechCrunch on Friday.

The U.K. government has so far declined to comment on operational matters, which includes “confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,” per a spokesperson.

It’s not clear how many companies have received a technical demand from the U.K. government.

According to the lawmakers’ letter, Google “also recently told Senator Wyden’s office that, if it had received a technical capabilities notice, it would be prohibited from disclosing that fact.”

Two civil rights groups, Liberty and Privacy International, are also challenging the U.K. government’s backdoor order via legal submission to the IPT. The pair have also called for the oversight body’s hearing into Apple’s appeal to be held in public, joining similar calls earlier this week by privacy rights groups.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kerry Washington is expanding her angel investment portfolio, serving as lead investor in the pre-seed round of the wedding marketplace Cheersy.

Cheersy, which was founded in 2024 by Amy Shack Egan, helps couples find day-of-service wedding coordinators and has raised a total of $550,000 from other investors, including Elizabeth Cutler, co-founder of Soul Cycle, and Jennifer Gilbert, founder of Save the Date. Joanna Rosholm, the former press secretary to First Lady Michelle Obama, and Christina Tosi, the founder of Milk Bar, advised the round.

Washington did not immediately respond to our request for comment.

Shack Egan said she met Washington through the actor’s director of social impact. They both attended a dinner party in Los Angeles where Shack Egan struck up a conversation. By the end of the dinner, the director of social impact offered an introduction to Washington as a possible angel investor. Washington has been making a name for herself as an angel investor alongside other Hollywood titans edging their way into the world of startups.

She’s an investor in the social website Spill, a Black-owned alternative to X. She’s also backed the eating disorder treatment startup Equip and, according to PitchBook, has cut checks for the charity fundraising platform Omaze and the healthcare company Solv. She was also an investor in The Wing, the women’s social club that shut down in 2022.

“The dinner was a few days after I was supposed to fly home, but I knew I needed to be in that room of power players,” Shack Egan told TechCrunch. “I extended my trip and went to the dinner.”

From there, Shack Egan dealt with the rest of the fundraising market, an experience she called “challenging.” “I didn’t know what I didn’t know. I said yes to everything. Jumped on a flight. Got strung along, told no, and put my foot in my mouth more times than I can count,” she said.

This is Shack Egan’s second business. She also founded wedding planning business Modern Rebel, launched in 2015. She founded Cheersy because Modern Rebel was getting so many requests for day-of wedding coordination, meaning having someone make sure that the wedding is running smoothly the day it happens.

“Day-of coordination is the most booked wedding planning service, and so I responded to requests for this service we didn’t offer with handpicked recommendations,” she said, adding that she then realized her offering recommendations could simply be built into a marketplace business. The result of that was Cheersy, which, she says, has a similar model to Airbnb.

Couples look for vetted matches that fit their budget, vision, and vibe, searching by date, price, and specialty. Then the two parties can book a call and, if everything is a fit, the couple can book the talent.

Shack Egan considered her small business background a strength but said it was not the “easiest pill to swallow” for investors who were looking for Big Tech companies on her résumé.

“The fundraising journey can be so lonely and a real knock on your mental health,” she continued.

She joined the Power to Pitch program, which helped connect her with more people in the startup world. The company will use this fresh capital to enhance the features on the booking platform and make some hires, such as a user experience designer. Shack Egan also wants to up the marketing budget a bit and bring in a community manager as the company seeks to expand into six new cities in the upcoming months. It’s currently offered in New York City and Hudson Valley.

“I started in this industry in 2015 as an event freelancer,” Shack Egan said. “I know the pain points of this job personally. I love the idea that we’re making the experience of being someone that works in the wedding industry, in such a tough — and often, thankless — job more supported and more fun.”

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This week, Google released a family of open AI models, Gemma 3, that quickly garnered praise for their impressive efficiency. But as a number of developers lamented on X, Gemma 3’s license makes commercial use of the models a risky proposition.

It’s not a problem unique to Gemma 3. Companies like Meta also apply custom, non-standard licensing terms to their openly available models, and the terms present legal challenges for companies. Some firms, especially smaller operations, worry that Google and others could “pull the rug” on their business by asserting the more onerous clauses.

“The restrictive and inconsistent licensing of so-called ‘open’ AI models is creating significant uncertainty, particularly for commercial adoption,” Nick Vidal, head of community at the Open Source Initiative, a long-running institution aiming to define and “steward” all things open source, told TechCrunch. “While these models are marketed as open, the actual terms impose various legal and practical hurdles that deter businesses from integrating them into their products or services.”

Open model developers have their reasons for releasing models under proprietary licenses as opposed to industry-standard options like Apache and MIT. AI startup Cohere, for example, has been clear about its intent to support scientific — but not commercial — work on top of its models.

But Gemma and Meta’s Llama licenses in particular have restrictions that limit the ways companies can use the models without fear of legal reprisal.

Meta, for instance, prohibits developers from using the “output or results” of Llama 3 models to improve any model besides Llama 3 or “derivative works.” It also prevents companies with over 700 million monthly active users from deploying Llama models without first obtaining a special, additional license.

Gemma’s license is generally less burdensome. But it does grant Google the right to “restrict (remotely or otherwise) usage” of Gemma that Google believes is in violation of the company’s prohibited use policy or “applicable laws and regulations.”

These terms don’t just apply to the original Llama and Gemma models. Models based on Llama or Gemma must also adhere to the Llama and Gemma licenses, respectively. In Gemma’s case, that includes models trained on synthetic data generated by Gemma.

Florian Brand, a research assistant at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence, believes that — despite what tech giant execs would have you believe — licenses like Gemma and Llama’s “cannot reasonably be called ‘open source.’”

“Most companies have a set of approved licenses, such as Apache 2.0, so any custom license is a lot of trouble and money,” Brand told TechCrunch. “Small companies without legal teams or money for lawyers will stick to models with standard licenses.”

Brand noted that AI model developers with custom licenses, like Google, haven’t aggressively enforced their terms yet. However, the threat is often enough to deter adoption, he added.

“These restrictions have an impact on the AI ecosystem — even on AI researchers like me,” said Brand.

Han-Chung Lee, director of machine learning at Moody’s, agrees that custom licenses such as those attached to Gemma and Llama make the models “not usable” in many commercial scenarios. So does Eric Tramel, a staff applied scientist at AI startup Gretel.

“Model-specific licenses make specific carve-outs for model derivatives and distillation, which causes concern about clawbacks,” Tramel said. “Imagine a business that is specifically producing model fine-tunes for their customers. What license should a Gemma-data fine-tune of Llama have? What would the impact be for all of their downstream customers?”

The scenario that deployers most fear, Tramel said, is that the models are a trojan horse of sorts.

“A model foundry can put out [open] models, wait to see what business cases develop using those models, and then strong-arm their way into successful verticals by either extortion or lawfare,” he said. “For example, Gemma 3, by all appearances, seems like a solid release — and one that could have a broad impact. But the market can’t adopt it because of its license structure. So, businesses will likely stick with perhaps weaker and less reliable Apache 2.0 models.”

To be clear, certain models have achieved widespread distribution in spite of their restrictive licenses. Llama, for example, has been downloaded hundreds of millions of times and built into products from major corporations, including Spotify.

But they could be even more successful if they were permissively licensed, according to Yacine Jernite, head of machine learning and society at AI startup Hugging Face. Jernite called on providers like Google to move to open license frameworks and “collaborate more directly” with users on broadly accepted terms.

“Given the lack of consensus on these terms and the fact that many of the underlying assumptions haven’t yet been tested in courts, it all serves primarily as a declaration of intent from those actors,” Jernite said. “[But if certain clauses] are interpreted too broadly, a lot of good work will find itself on uncertain legal ground, which is particularly scary for organizations building successful commercial products.”

Vidal said that there’s an urgent need for AI models companies can freely integrate, modify, and share without fearing sudden license changes or legal ambiguity.

“The current landscape of AI model licensing is riddled with confusion, restrictive terms, and misleading claims of openness,” Vidal said. “Instead of redefining ‘open’ to suit corporate interests, the AI industry should align with established open source principles to create a truly open ecosystem.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google will replace Google Assistant on Android phones with Gemini later this year, the company announced on Friday.

Google said in a blog post that it’ll upgrade more users from Google Assistant to Gemini “over the coming months.” Later this year, Assistant will no longer be accessible on most mobile devices or available from app stores.

“Additionally, we’ll be upgrading tablets, cars and devices that connect to your phone, such as headphones and watches, to Gemini,” the company added. “We’re also bringing a new experience, powered by Gemini, to home devices like speakers, displays and TVs.”

Google said it’ll share more details with users in the next few months, and that, until then, Assistant will continue to operate on the aforementioned devices.

Google notes it has worked to improve the Gemini user experience ahead of the Assistant wind-down, especially for users relying on various Assistant functions. For instance, Google has added several highly requested features to Gemini on Android devices, such as the ability to play music, support for timers, and an option to take actions directly from a user’s lock screen.

The move to drop Assistant in favor of Gemini isn’t surprising, especially considering Google launched its Pixel 9 smartphone line with Gemini as the default virtual assistant. Google notes that Gemini has more advanced capabilities than Assistant (in theory, at least), and provides new ways of getting help and info on topics via tools like Gemini Live and Deep Research.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SoftBank is marching ahead on its ambitions to build out a major AI operation in its home market of Japan, on its own steam and in strategic partnership with others like OpenAI. On Friday, the tech company confirmed it would pay $676 million for a factory previously used by Sharp to build LCD panels and convert it into an artificial intelligence data center.

SoftBank’s purchase and sale agreement with Sharp includes both the land and buildings of the Sharp Sakai Plant in Osaka, for 100 billion yen ($676 million).

This was a necessary early step for SoftBank since data centers are a lynchpin in the massive wave of generative AI sweeping the tech world: substantial data center capacity is needed both to train models and to provision and run subsequent services.

When asked if the site is part of its plans to commercialize OpenAI’s models in Japan, a SoftBank spokesperson pointed TechCrunch to its previous announcement regarding a collaboration with OpenAI to deploy an advanced enterprise AI called “Cristal Intelligence” in Japan. Contacted for a response, OpenAI declined to comment on the news.

OpenAI reportedly intends to bring its AI foundational models to the Japanese market, leveraging GPUs to develop models at the Sakai plant. SB OpenAI Japan, a joint venture between SoftBank and OpenAI, will train models using clients’ data from marketing and other activities. The JV will then sell customized AI agents to clients, per a report by Nikkei.

The data center plan underscores how SoftBank and OpenAI are broadening the scope of their collaboration.

The two tech companies unveiled their joint venture in Japan following OpenAI’s collaborations with SoftBank, Oracle, and other companies to build several AI data centers in the U.S. The Japanese telco giant is also investing in OpenAI. Talks have been going on for months, and the latest is that SoftBank is reportedly investing as much as $25 billion in OpenAI at a valuation of nearly $300 billion. However, that fundraise has yet to close and has not been announced officially.

SoftBank’s purchase of the plant comes roughly 10 months after signing an MOU to construct a large AI data center at a plant Sharp previously used for LCD panel production.

SoftBank aims to commence operations in 2026. SoftBank expects the LCD panel factory to have sufficient power capacity to operate the AI data center, initially at around 150 megawatts and eventually increasing to over 240 megawatts.

The Sakai facility will be SoftBank’s third data center. It already operates a data center in Tokyo and another one is being built in Hokkaido.</p>

Mark Klein, a former AT&T technician turned whistleblower who exposed mass surveillance by the U.S. government, has died at age 79.

Klein went public in 2006 with documents revealing that the NSA was using a secret room in an AT&T hub in San Francisco to tap into the backbone of the internet.

Behind the door of the now-infamous Room 641A, optical splitting wiretaps were creating an identical copy of raw internet traffic and funneling it back to the NSA.

Klein’s disclosure was confirmation that the U.S. government was accessing the internet data on millions of Americans using powers granted by Congress in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.

In 2013, then-NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified documents to journalists detailing widescale NSA surveillance around the world.

Klein’s death was confirmed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the San Francisco-based digital rights group who Klein turned to, and which went on to sue the federal government following Klein’s disclosures. The case was eventually dismissed.</p>
