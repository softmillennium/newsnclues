As Web3 adoption accelerates, the demand for robust security solutions has never been more urgent. Over $2.3 billion was lost to hacks in 2024 alone , highlighting persistent vulnerabilities in decentralized applications and blockchain ecosystems. This growing threat underscores the need for cutting-edge security measures which are critical to sustaining trust and innovation in the blockchain industry .

India has emerged as a key player in the global Web3 space. The country's share of the Web3 developer base has surged from just 3% in 2018 to 12% in 2024. Also, since 2023, India has onboarded the most new crypto developers, moving past the US, reflecting increased interest and expertise in blockchain technology. As more Indian developers and startups build on decentralized platforms, the demand for scalable and AI driven security solutions to protect smart contracts and blockchain infrastructure has also intensified.

Traditional smart contract auditing methods are often slow, expensive, and limited in scope, leaving room for critical security gaps. Recognizing this challenge, CredShields, a blockchain security firm, has introduced SolidityScan, an AI-powered security solution that automates smart contract auditing.

“Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to devastating financial losses. SolidityScan offers a scalable, real-time, and cost-effective way to detect and mitigate these risks before they can be exploited. Unlike traditional audits , SolidityScan instantly analyzes smart contracts with its 450+ AI powered vulnerability detectors for weaknesses, enabling developers to focus on innovation without compromising security,” said Shashank, co-founder of CredShields.

With blockchain adoption increasing across finance, gaming, and decentralized governance, cybersecurity remains a major concern. “The decentralized nature of Web3 makes it both powerful and vulnerable. SolidityScan is designed to provide proactive, AI-driven security solutions that adapt to evolving threats,” said Indranil, co-founder of CredShields.

By integrating automated security tools like SolidityScan, businesses and developers can mitigate risks and strengthen trust in blockchain-based platforms. As Web3 continues to expand, the role of AI in securing decentralized ecosystems will be indispensable in preventing financial losses and fostering sustainable growth.

There is one downside though - all tech and everything that comes with it costs money, and usually a pretty penny too! This can leave us feeling deflated about the money we're spending on something that's essentially, a pass time. Luckily, there are clever ways in which you can save money on these luxuries and in this article, we're going to tell you exactly how!

If you're someone that loves gaming, you'll know all too well how expensive new games can be. It can be anything from £40 and upwards, and that's usually just for the base game! However, there are really smart ways around this. Depending on what console you use for gaming, you'll be able to get some sort of game pass. For example, for Playstation users, you can subscribe to a PSN account for much cheaper per month than buying a brand new game. And, you'll have access to a myriad of new games while you're subscribed.

The same goes for Xbox users or even PC gamers. There's the Xbox game pass or EA subs you can activate for around £15 a month that will give you access to loads of games under their umbrella. While it's still costing you some money each month, you can enjoy more games for less money!

Not only that, when you're subbed to these kinds of services, you'll notice that your system will detect and download updates for your games, meaning you no longer have to wait around for downloads or installations.

As mentioned briefly above, there sometimes comes a time when you either don't have time for certain games and tech, or you've outgrown it and would like to make some money from them to put towards your next upgrade. Lots of stores buy all sorts of games, consoles, phones, and other tech from people in exchange for cash. While you can do this on the website, it might be easier to head to your nearest store so that your items can be checked there and then in store, and you can walk away that day with the cash. Selling your old phone, games or console is a great way to make extra money when you're in a pinch.

It's all too easy to wake up one day and realise that you're paying an extortionate amount for your broadband deal. The first step that you should take is to phone your current provider and ask them for a cheaper deal. More often than not they will be able to lower your price by a small amount.

However, you shouldn't always settle for this figure as there are many other internet providers around the world that would be more than willing to do you better broadband deals. Make sure that you know you've got the cheapest price before settling for a company so that you can save yourself that little bit of extra money each month and not feel so guilty!

There are so many free trials these days, so why not make the most of them? Services like Netflix and Spotify offer a month's trial completely free of charge. If you use these kinds of trials in a clever way, you can enjoy lots of free entertainment without having to spend a single penny. For example, you could trial Netflix for a month and then try out Disney+ for a month.

It's not just entertainment deals you should be looking out for either. Services like Canva offer free pro trials that are a month long, meaning you could create high-quality media if you need it for work or a personal blog. The same goes for cloud storage - there are loads of services that will give you the space for free for a whole month! The only thing you have to do is remember when your free trials are ending so that you can cancel the subscriptions before they renew!

Like many, there's a chance that you have games on your phone or you use it for personal reasons like social media and chatting to family and friends via text message. Like with your internet bill, it's too easy to add on features and then end up with a large bill that you don't truly need. Most providers will claim that they cannot reduce your bill because obviously, they want to continue receiving money from you. This however, is untrue, so make sure that you push it with them so that they offer you a much cheaper deal. You may even find that your cheaper deal doesn't actually change many of your current terms, so it's definitely worth a shot!

If you're on pay as you go, it might be an idea to use a messaging service like Whatsapp with your friends and family so that all of you can save some money on your phone bills. Whatsapp runs on the use of the internet, so if you're in Wifi range you're able to text, video, and call for absolutely nothing!

It's understandable that when a new game comes out on a console that you don't have, that you want to rush out and buy that console so that you can join in on the fun that everyone is having. However, new consoles no matter how long they've been out can still cost you a fair amount of money. Instead, consider buying second hand consoles so that you can still join in on all of the fun, but save yourself a nice amount of money! Often people sell their consoles because they are simply too busy for them, so there's actually nothing wrong with them! Just be sure to have it all turned on before handing over any cash!

Try these easy yet clever ways of saving money on your tech so that you can have some spare cash for other things in life that you want to enjoy!

As the first publicly listed robotaxi company, we remain committed to pushing the boundaries of autonomous technology, delivering safer, smarter, and more sustainable transportation solutions worldwide.”

Jennifer Li, WeRide's Chief Financial Officer, added, “Amidst a challenging macro environment, we adopted a comprehensive approach in 2024 to optimize revenue and customer structure through internationalization, competitive pricing, and strategic partnerships. This strategy delivered meaningful results in 2024, including achieving record-high robotaxi revenue and the strongest growth of international revenue since company's inception. As we expand into new markets and scale our autonomous fleet, we continue to break through in technology, optimize operations, and enhance overall efficiency. Collaborating with local partners and stakeholders enables us to execute a cost-effective, rapid go-to-market model, allowing us to adapt quickly to diverse competitive landscapes.

Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars are made at a rate of RMB7.2993 to US$1.00, the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of December 31, 2024.

Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures 

In evaluating its business, the Company considers and uses the non-IFRS financial measure of adjusted net loss as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. The Company believes that adjusted net loss provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company's consolidated results of operations in the same manner as it helps the Company's management. The Company defines adjusted net loss as net loss for the year/period excluding share-based compensation expenses, fair value changes of financial liabilities measured at FVTPL, fair value changes of financial assets at FVTPL and changes in the carrying amounts of preferred shares and other financial instruments subject to redemption and other preferential rights.

The Company presents the non-IFRS financial measure because it is used by its management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. Adjusted net loss enables the Company's management to assess the Company's operating results without considering the impact of the aforementioned non-cash adjustment items that it does not consider to be indicative of its core operations. Accordingly, the Company believes that the use of this non-IFRS financial measure provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as its management and board of directors.

This non-IFRS financial measure is not defined under IFRS and is not presented in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measure has limitations as an analytical tool. One of the key limitations of using the adjusted net loss is that it does not reflect all items of expenses that affect the Company's operations. Further, this non-IFRS measure may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore its comparability may be limited.

The non-IFRS financial measure should not be considered in isolation or construed as an alternative to loss for the year/period or any other measure of performance information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS or as an indicator of the Company's operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review the Company's historical non-IFRS financial measure in light of the most directly comparable IFRS measure, as shown below. The non-IFRS financial measure presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measure presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing the Company's data comparatively. It is encouraged that you review the Company's financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

Good Samaritan Pulmonologist Johnathon Grant, DO, during an Ion procedure.

Good Samaritan announced in a recent press release the addition of the Ion Endoluminal System, a state-of-the-art robotic-assisted platform for minimally invasive lung biopsies.

"This innovative technology enhances precision and access when diagnosing lung nodules, potentially leading to earlier detection and treatment of lung cancer," the press release read.

Good Sam reported that lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, but early detection significantly improves survival rates. The Ion Endoluminal System, developed by Intuitive—the makers of the da Vinci Surgical System—offers a revolutionary approach to lung biopsies. By allowing physicians to navigate deep into the lungs with enhanced stability and precision, this technology enables tissue sampling from hard-to-reach nodules while reducing the need for more invasive procedures.

“With the introduction of Ion, we can provide our patients with a more advanced and minimally invasive approach to lung biopsy,” said Good Samaritan Pulmonologist Johnathon Grant, DO, in the press release. “This means greater accuracy, faster results, and ultimately, better outcomes for those at risk of lung cancer.”

Compared to traditional bronchoscopy methods, the press release shared that the Ion system offers increased reach and flexibility, which allows for more successful biopsies with fewer complications. This means patients can receive a diagnosis sooner, helping them and their care teams make informed treatment decisions more quickly.

Patients can learn more about this groundbreaking technology by visiting gshvin.org/ion.

Tata Technologies Ltd, a subsidiary of Tata Motors encountered a ransomware attack earlier this year that affected the company's network and forced it to suspend some of its services. Now, TechCrunch has reported that a ransomware group that goes by the name Hunters International has published what it claims to be data stolen from the Pune headquartered company.

According to TechCrunch, who claims to have seen the data published on the gang's dark web leak site said it includes personal details about current and former employees along with some confidential information like purchase orders and some contracts with customers in India and the United States.

The leaked data, which amounts to about 1.4TB in size includes more than 7,30,000 documents like Excel spreadsheets, PDF files and PowerPoint presentations. However, it is still unclear if the data shared by the Hunters International group is in any way related to the recent ransomware attack.

In a filing with the Indian stock exchanges, Tata Technologies had said that an investigation was underway “in consultation with experts to assess the root cause and take remedial action as necessary.”

For those unfamiliar, Hunters International is a relatively new ransomware-as-a-service group that offers its infrastructure to hackers and takes a cut of the ransom payments. It is also affiliated with the Hive gang, which may have previously leaked stolen data from Tata Power back in 2022.

Founded in 1989 as an automotive unit of Tata Motors, Tata Technologies focuses on automotive design, aerospace engineering and research and development and has an annual revenue of $600 million, operating in more than 18 locations in India, Asia-Pacific, Europe and North America.
