Formula 1 race fans planning on a trip to Austin, Texas, and the Circuit of the Americas for the United States Grand Prix on October 25 can be excused if they do a double take this fall.

COTA is growing up... and growing fast. Of course, fast is what the F1 circuit is known for, so that should be no surprise at all.

The circuit is adding a 30-acre amusement park with some 30 rides to the grounds adjacent to the track. According to an article on the Austin Business Journal website this week, the most dramatic expansion to the facility to date—COTALAND—is on schedule to open in time for this fall's F1 race.

COTALAND is a theme park with a fact sheet from organizers that proclaims:

COTALAND takes entertainment to new heights with thrilling rides, family-friendly attractions, world-class entertainment, and more.

Palindrome, the first infinity shuttle coaster in the U.S. and the only steel coaster in the U.S. to go over and active road, and Circuit Breaker, America's first tilt coaster, are both expected to be open ahead of the United States Grand Prix.

A 1,000-room hotel and convention center is also on the drawing board.

And you thought the only roller coaster ride at COTA was a hot lap on the track...</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/310033/public-keys-coinbase-irl-gemini-bitcoin-believers-look-up'>Public Keys: Coinbase IRL and Gemini Wants Bitcoin Believers to Look Up</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 20:02:29 <p>
Public Keys is a weekly roundup from Decrypt that tracks the key publicly traded crypto companies. This week: It’s spring time for Coinbase and on-chain assets. The company is going after its tokenized security white whale. CEO Brian Armstrong and his founders have been wanting to offer tokenized stocks since before the company even went public in 2021. If Coinbase got the OK to tokenize securities, it would be a huge boon for the already growing RWA, or real-world asset, segment. The RWA market aims to bring assets like stocks, bonds, property, or even land on-chain. Sometimes that’s been looked at as gimmicky by traditional finance types. But Wall Street has been working to reduce settlement times for years. What faster way to get there than by bringing some assets on-chain? Just yesterday its BUIDL fund topped $1 billion worth of assets under management. The fund holds dollar-equivalent assets like cash, U.S. Treasury bills, and repurchase agreements. Next in line is the Hashnote Short Duration Yield Coin, which boasts an AUM of $868 million and grants traders exposure to short duration U.S. Treasuries and reverse repo U.S. Treasuries. RWAs are an interesting, but not at all surprising, counterbalance to the global crypto market—which has dropped 16% in the past month, according to CoinGecko data. As more RWA products come on-chain, it would mean investors could flock to the safety of T-bills without having to off-ramp funds into a traditional brokerage account. But Coinbase doesn’t just want to do this on its home turf. The San Francisco company said in a blog post earlier this week it’s calling for “regulatory frameworks that match the scale of opportunity” in Europe. Perpetual futures are the vast majority of global crypto trading - but there has been no path to launch them in the US...until now. This week the crypto exchange also launched 24/7 access to Bitcoin and Ethereum futures. Adding more trading hours for its products is the kind of news that will likely help pad Coinbase’s bottom line. As the company pointed out in its most recent 10-K filing: “Our largest source of cash provided by operations are revenues generated from transaction fees.” There’s a growing list of companies rumored to be considering an IPO in 2025, but—look, a flying Bitcoin (and an excuse to talk about this news we missed last week). What do you think we’ll see first: A buzzing horde of drones snatching their record or an IPO? People familiar with the matter told Bloomberg last week that the company confidentially filed for an IPO with Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. If any of the other crypto companies start filing IPO paperwork, it may be a while before investors hear about it because of relaxed Securities and Exchange Commission rules. But relaxed rules are precisely why this year could see an uptick in public offerings, according to a recent Law360 column. It was another bye week for Michael Saylor's Bitcoin amassing Strategy. “Until now, these bonds have been difficult for individual investors to reach,” REX Financial CEO Greg King said in a statement. “BMAX removes those barriers making it easier to invest in the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor.”</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A respected crypto market commentator has provided an overview of Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and the emerging DeFi-focused Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Now in the third round of its presale at $0.02, it has attracted close to $3.3 million from more than 5,600 investors. Many analysts predict prices beyond $5 for MUTM (an 84x increase), and the team is currently completing a smart contract audit through CertiK, with the final results to be published on their social media channels. Mutuum Finance is quickly making waves with a novel dual-lending system, enabling the platform to attract over $3.3 million in backing from more than 5,600 early investors. Given its unique DeFi features, market watchers project the token could top $5 once it launches at $0.06, underscoring Mutuum Finance’s strong growth prospects. Meanwhile, the P2P model removes intermediaries, letting users negotiate loan terms directly while retaining full ownership of their digital assets. By combining these strategies, Mutuum Finance provides a more secure, efficient, and decentralized alternative for yield-seeking DeFi investors. Reinforcing its infrastructure, Mutuum Finance plans to introduce a fully collateralized stablecoin on Ethereum. Unlike algorithmic versions, this USD-pegged token will be overcollateralized to lower user risk and maintain long-term stability. Supported by an open financial framework and verified smart contracts, Mutuum Finance reduces the vulnerabilities that can befall less-robust DeFi efforts. The Mutuum Finance tokenomics structure aims to manage supply effectively, creating a deflationary trend that supports consistent price escalation. Additionally, the platform’s staking mechanism provides attractive incentives to token holders, promoting active participation and establishing a robust, self-sustaining ecosystem for long-term success. With Mutuum Finance evolving into a premier DeFi player—alongside Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA)—its presale has so far raised $3.3 million from over 5,600 investors. A 25% price increase is imminent, and analysts see room for the token to jump 84x beyond $5 after launch.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Would-be Tesla Cybertruck owners are now reporting that some trucks scheduled for delivery are being held back for additional inspection. The issue comes after over a month of reports from existing owners that their trucks have had issues with loose bodywork, including at least one owner who has footage of a panel flying off of his truck at speed. Most owners waiting on the delay have not reported any specific reason for the wait, but one user on a Cybertruck owner forum has shared a screenshot from a conversation with a service advisor that suggests "the cantrail concern" is the problem being inspected. It is also the piece of bodywork most frequently mentioned in reports of loose bodywork, including in what are now four different official NHTSA complaints. Reid Tomasko, the owner who shared footage of his truck shedding this particular piece of bodywork at speed, told Road & Track in February that he had seen the issue on "five to seven" different trucks encountered at his wrapping business. This includes his own truck and another truck in his shop when he filmed a YouTube video that dug into the problem. Tomasko has since claimed in another video that Tesla told him the problem was "glue delamination." It's worth noting that Tesla has not yet announced a recall, stop sale, or any other sort of formal delay over the issue. Road & Track has reached out to Tesla for comment, and we will update this story in the event that the brand responds. You Might Also Like</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Breidinger began racing go-karts at age 9 and instantly discovered her passion for the sport. Like many of today’s young race car drivers, Toni Breidinger has been competing since childhood, but unlike her fellow competitors in NASCAR’s Craftsman Truck Series the Toyota driver works as a model and a social media influencer when she isn’t competing at the track. Breidinger is a fixture in Toyota commercials and when this year’s Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue is released, she’ll be featured alongside athletes from a variety of sports. They include three-time team USA Olympic gold medalist sprinter Gabby Thomas, USA Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles, paralympic swimmer Ali Truwit, track-and-field heptathlon medalist Anna Hall, and the WNBA’s Cameron Brink. When the two are combined, her following across both platforms is more than 5 million. She cites authenticity as the key to her large following. “I think people want to know the real you,” Breidinger says. I do feel like my fan base is very international.” Breidinger’s contract with Toyota is not through the manufacturer’s driver development program, but rather its marketing department where she’s viewed as an “influencer from a driver standpoint.” In fact, Paul Doleshal, group manager, motorsports, Toyota Motor North America, admits it was her large social media following that impacted Toyota’s decision. “Toni reaches outside that (motorsports) sphere and can bring that … what’s going on over there, let me go check it out kind of aspect …” Doleshal says. Since she wasn’t involved with another manufacturer in a different series on her off-ARCA weekends, Doleshal said it made it easier for Toyota to decide to lock her into a contract from the marketing side. She still receives all of the benefits the Toyota Performance Center in Cornelius, North Carolina, provides competitors in Toyota’s Driver Development Program. Our program is more about track performance and how do we compete. For us, it’s finding elite level talent, and who do we think has a chance to really evolve and matriculate up into the higher series.” Breidinger began racing go-karts at age 9 and instantly discovered her passion for the sport. Breidinger elected to drive a race car, while Annie became an engineer. In 65 races, she recorded four top-five and 27 top-10 finishes, the most top 10s by a female ARCA competitor. This year, Breidinger moved to a full-time Truck Series ride with TRICON Garage. Breidinger would like to be in NASCAR’s Cup Series in five years, but she wants to be successful at each level before advancing.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A NASCAR drama filmed using practical effects is also rumored to be in the works. Since they were all filmed using practical effects, not the cheesy CGI we see in movies way too often these days, we’re pumped to see all the action unfold. The same approach was used in Top Gun: Maverick to great effect. Like Top Gun: Maverick, F1 tells the story of a washed-up old man who’s been pushed out of the limelight, only to be given one more chance to prove himself. Sonny Hayes, played by Brad Pitt, is an older racecar driver who apparently was supposed to be big in Formula One back in the day but flamed out. Still racing in other series, he’s approached with an opportunity to be the second driver on a fictional APX Mercedes team and mentor a young hotheaded driver, Joshua Pearce, played by Damson Idris. Of course, the two clash, face adversity, and get zero respect from their competitors. We love a good underdog story and this looks like it could be just that. "Watching Brad drive around at speeds over 180 miles an hour was really impressive to see because it's not something you can just learn overnight," said Hamilton, according to ESPN. Some scenes shot at GPs involved Pitt removing his helmet, and that’s when people started talking about an upcoming movie.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/does-high-mileage-engine-oil-192500676.html'>Does High-Mileage Engine Oil Really Make A Difference?</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 19:25:00 <p>
One of the best things about modern cars is just how long they last. There was a time, not too long ago, when a car — especially an American car — was likely clapped out after 75,000 miles. I've personally owned four cars that easily hit the quarter-million mile mark — a Cadillac, two Mazdas, and a Saturn — and while I know that the plural of anecdote isn't data, that's still a pretty good ratio. Now, the thing about cars when they get old enough is that their diet changes, so to speak. Much like when you get past a certain age you need more vegetables and vitamins than pizzas and beer, older cars need different kinds of fluids than they needed when they were fresh off the lot. Probably the most important thing you can give your elderly car, aside from regular maintenance, is high-mileage engine oil. What exactly is high-mileage oil and when should you use it? Engine oil being poured from a silver plastic bottle. The additives grant protection to things like cylinder walls and cam lobes that do a lot of heavy lifting at high speeds and temperatures. Finally, the detergents work to clear sludge and gunk out of all the engine's nooks and crannies (or, well, they claim to at any rate). Well, that kinda depends on how and where you drive. An engine with, say, 150,000 highway miles on it may still be in top condition while the same engine only driven in the city might be tired out by 80,000 miles. It will not cure mechanical damage like heavily worn rings, burnt valves, blowby, rod knock, power loss, etc. Nor will it plug up heavy leaks, stop a car from smoking, or fix non-oil-related issues. It is cheap insurance in the form of preventative maintenance, however. Sure, especially if you have a well-maintained, high-mileage engine.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/epa-rollback-biden-rules-alter-191400543.html'>EPA Rollback of Biden Rules Will Alter EV Industry, Emissions Regs</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 19:14:00 <p>
EPA reveals it will reexamine dozens of past climate-related rules implemented by the agency under prior administrations. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the agency would reconsider rules that had "hamstrung" the US auto industry, signaling that a number of key climate provisions, including 2032 CO2 goals, would be reevaluated. The wave of announcements impacting key climate-related rules prompted a backlash from environmental advocacy groups. Signaling a wide-scale rollback of emissions regulations, the EPA revealed this week that it would reconsider a number of key targets put into place by the Biden administration to curb greenhouse emissions, citing impediments to the US auto industry. The agency also said it would reconsider 2022 Heavy-Duty Nitrous Oxide (NOx) rules, citing high costs of compliance for various industries, part of the Clean Trucks Plan. "As we reconsider nearly one trillion dollars of regulatory costs, we will abide by the rule of law to protect consumer choice and the environment." On the same day, the EPA signaled it would "modernize" a set of rules governing wastewater discharges by oil and gas extraction facilities, aiming to lower production costs for gas and oil extraction. In all, the agency said it is studying dozens of past environmental regulations. This rule has been frequently (and perhaps reductively) cited by its opponents as having mandated that some "two-thirds" of all new car and truck sales to be EVs by 2032, though on paper it was far less rigid than that. The adopted 2024 rules did not specifically mandate these percentages, rather reflecting one of the EPA's estimated routes toward what car sales could look like by 2032 to achieve the industry-wide average goal of 85 grams of CO2 per mile emissions targets by that year. Yet another possible route to the same 2032 goals could have seen PHEV sales of 29% and BEV sales of 43% and still arrive at the same planned CO2 reduction target, with ICE sales still accounting for 21% of the market at that point. Just how realistic any of these scenarios would have been is perhaps moot now, but even the most modest BEV percentage mix would have required year-on-year leaps in EV sales rates by 2032 unlike any that had been seen to date. "With these actions, the Trump EPA is trying to take us back to the days when rivers caught fire, toxic chemicals forced families to abandon their homes, and acid rain ravaged our forests," said Alexandra Adams, chief policy advocacy officer at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Over the past year a number of automakers with EVs in their lineups have quietly revised their own BEV targets, prioritizing ICE and hybrid powertrains in the coming years while citing a gradually deteriorating momentum for battery-electric models. One simple explanation for automakers is that they had already assumed a long time ago that the 2032 targets would be reversed early in the second Trump administration and had effectively priced in these developments. This wave of deregulation gives them an easy out from their own overly ambitious EV plans announced years ago. Would the 2032 targets have been achieved if they remained in place, or were these scenarios too unrealistic? Let us know what you think in the comments below.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/tesla-model-ys-special-headlights-190000650.html'>New Tesla Model Y's Special Headlights Won't Blind Oncoming Drivers</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 19:00:00 <p>
Such headlights are already widely available elsewhere, but U.S. regulations present a stumbling block. One drawback, though, is that poorly aimed LED headlights can temporarily blind oncoming drivers. The tech has various names depending on what brand is offering it, but we can start by calling it matrix LED headlights since Audi was among the first to bring it to market (just not in the U.S.—more on that in a bit). Think of an LED headlight working as a constellation of light pixels rather than a single source, so individually controlling those pixels allows you to shape the light beam projected by the headlight. In Canada, where Audi's matrix LED headlights are legal, this allows for headlights that will dip to the left so as not to shine through the windshield of fellow drivers when oncoming traffic is detected. Since then, a 2022 rule change allowed for "Adaptive Driving Beam" (ADB) headlights theoretically but adopted a testing method that differed from the SAE-approved regulations used in Europe and Canada. Audi would have had to come up with a completely new solution just for the U.S. market, so it simply delivered vehicles with the tech software disabled. It's much the same case with some recent BMW models. However, the second generation of Rivian's R1S and RIT trucks did come with ADB headlights that meet U.S. regulations. The refreshed 2025 Tesla Model Y is also now available with this technology, though it should be noted that Canadian and European Model Ys already had a version of it. A Tesla spokesperson told Car and Driver that the ADB headlights are not yet enabled on older versions of the Model Y and Model 3. Now that matrix LED headlights are available from some manufacturers, it may push others to come up with a solution that will meet U.S. regulations.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Ram discontinued its absolutely bonkers range-topping Ram 1500 model, the TRX, by sending it off with a "Final Edition" model, as done with almost all Hellcat-powered Stellantis products. Like with many other "last Hemi-powered" Stellantis products, it turns out there might be a few more in the pipeline. Shoppers were instead stuck with a choice of turbocharged inline-sixes. An alleged email released on Sportsnaut suggests that not only is the TRX coming back, but it's getting more power, too. Over at Mopar Insiders, their "reliable sources" have confirmed that the Ram TRX "will indeed make a comeback in 2026…it will have HEMI V8 power under the hood." Mopar Insiders has a few takes on why the next Ram 1500 TRX will make more power. Alternatively, it could be a retuned Hellcat engine that pushes power up to 717 horsepower. That would still be 15 over the outgoing model. In the interview, ousted CEO Carlos Tavares is blamed for nearly every wrong turn Stellantis took in the last 12 months. Including, of course, the decision to pursue greener pastures instead of leaning into the Ram bread and butter—V8-powered trucks. So all of this could change quickly as the organization names a new CEO, which should happen in the next three months. Stellantis will likely not make the same mistake twice. A new CEO that's V8-friendly might be just what the brand needs to get some traction. More importantly, a V8 supertruck could be the first brick towards building a lineup of Stellantis vehicles that anyone actually cares about.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Among them was one of the most controversial McLaren F1s ever built—chassis #39—a car that disappeared after his lieutenant was gunned down, leaving behind a mystery that has puzzled car collectors and cartel historians alike. Painted in Brazilian Metallic Brown with a red leather interior and gold wheels, it was originally purchased by McLaren CEO Ron Dennis. However, his wife reportedly hated the color scheme so much that she refused to let him keep it. Dennis quickly offloaded the car and ordered another one. By 1997, the McLaren had made its way to Mexico, falling into the hands of Umberto Ojeda, also known as Ricardo Beltran or "El Robachivas," El Chapo’s top lieutenant. For a man who operated in extreme wealth and violence, the rare McLaren F1 fit perfectly into his lifestyle. Ojeda’s time behind the wheel of chassis #39 didn’t last long. In 2000, he was ambushed and gunned down inside his armored car. Some claimed it was hidden under a tarp in rural Culiacán, untouched for years. Others believe it was quietly driven and possibly even made road-legal in Mexico. The search for chassis #39 took a new turn when YouTuber and car collector Ed Bolian, best known for his VINWiki channel, set out to track down the missing supercar. Bolian, knowing the risks, negotiated the price down to $2.5 million and scrambled to figure out how he could afford it. The seller refused to provide clear, verifiable photos, sending only blurry or irrelevant images. When pressed for proof, the seller threatened to cut off all communication unless Bolian wired a deposit immediately. Bolian believes Ojeda’s son, now living in New York City, may have real information about the car’s whereabouts. The McLaren F1 is one of the most coveted supercars in history, and chassis #39, with its bizarre backstory, cartel connections, and decades-long disappearance, may be one of the most valuable of them all. But one thing is certain—whoever finds it won’t just be holding a rare piece of automotive history. They’ll be holding a piece of the cartel’s dark and twisted legacy.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Painful To Watch: Suzuki GSX-R1000 Rider Runs From Texas Trooper It constantly amazes us how many riders, like the guy on this Suzuki GSX-R1000 running from a Texas trooper, think they know how to handle a motorcycle when they’ve clearly taken zero lessons. What’s even worse is when they’re on a high-powered sportbike and try riding it super aggressive to ditch the cops, the whole thing ending tragically, just like this police chase. With a 1,000cc engine (hence the name) it can blast through the quarter mile in just over 10 seconds and hit a top speed of 173 mph. Things get even worse once they exit the highway and enter downtown. In a way, it’s like watching a baby deer try walking for the first time, only not nearly as cute but also even more pathetic. If the guy were to have any sense, he would know ditching the trooper isn’t likely, but injuring himself is. While going through a gentle turn on the road, our inexperienced suspect just falls for no good reason, kissing the pavement.

Of course, each one has its pros and cons, which can only mean one thing: The ideal vehicle is some Hegelian synthesis of the two. Something like this Honda N600, perhaps, which eschews its traditional little two-cylinder for an inline-four out of a Fireblade — and swaps its 45 stock horses for 170 horsepower at 13,000 screaming RPM. The build comes from the mad geniuses over at Cars and Cameras, who have really come into their own as our own little domestic Garage54. Cars and Cameras released part one of the CBR1000RR-powered N600 build, which is nearly 44 minutes of cutting, welding, and making the big four cylinder fit behind the N600's front seats. It's sort of a Renault 5 Turbo layout, which is a far cry from the car's original front-engine, front-wheel-drive design.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://autos.yahoo.com/finally-know-name-bmws-1st-180500539.html'>We Finally Know the Name of BMW's 1st 'Neue Klasse' Car, and When It'll Arrives</a></h2><b>Source:</b> yahoo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 18:05:00 <p>
These cars represent ideas for the future of all of BMW's sedan, crossover, and M performance businesses, but they are also representative of specific future products around the size of the current 3-Series and X3. Now, we finally know when one of those actual future products is set to be revealed. BMW Chairman Oliver Zipse has announced at the company's annual conference that the all-new iX3 — effectively the production version of the Vision Neue Klasse X — will debut at Munich's IAA Mobility auto show in early September. BMW has also shared official images of the production version of the iX3 and a still-unnamed sedan, presumably an electric 3-Series, iun testing. The images of camouflaged cars don't reveal much, but the design does look in line with a previously-leaked patent rendering of a production version of the iX3 crossover. Both the sedan and crossover variants of the Vision Neue Klasse had a focus on massive, low-slung side windows that increase natural light within the car's airy cabin. Photos of camouflaged production cars indicate BMW has gone with a more conservative approach on the final cars, but both vehicles still seem to have unusually large side windows. The unique lighting-based interpretations of BMW's famous kidney grilles seen on the concepts are hidden under camouflage, but the shape beneath the camouflage suggests some version of those design elements may have made their way to the production cars. The two upcoming cars on the Neue Klasse platform are just the beginning of a new product wave; BMW says that 40 new and refreshed models will be revealed between now and the end of 2027. Some of those updates should be major design updates to current cars that bring models like the new M5 in line with Neue Klasse's design direction, a possibility that would be in line with Zipse's claim that all new launches "will have the DNA of Neue Klasse."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Cardano (ADA) is known for its robust blockchain and commitment to scalability, but recent developments in the crypto space suggest it may face tough competition. By incorporating cutting-edge technologies and innovative solutions, BinoFi offers features that could redefine crypto investing. Here’s how it stacks up to Cardano and why serious investors are taking notice. However, its growth has slowed as it faces delays in delivering advanced functionalities like smart contract scaling and interoperability. BinoFi embraces AI-driven trading and automation, giving users an edge in executing trades. Cardano, in contrast, doesn’t currently offer automated trading tools or AI capabilities tailored for its users. This gap makes BinoFi particularly attractive for investors with a focus on efficiency and profitability in dynamic markets. While Cardano emphasizes decentralization and a secure consensus mechanism, it hasn’t introduced measures like PoR that provide ongoing reassurance for users. This level of transparency gives BinoFi a distinct advantage in fostering investor confidence. Navigating regulatory frameworks is increasingly important as governments crack down on crypto projects. BinoFi sets itself apart with Zero-Knowledge (ZK) KYC technology, allowing users to fulfill regulatory obligations while maintaining their privacy. These cryptographic methods enable identity verification without exposing sensitive information, balancing security with compliance. Cardano’s focus on infrastructure development hasn’t included innovative compliance solutions like ZK KYC. While Cardano’s progress has been steady, it lacks these forward-thinking features that position BinoFi as a leading-edge platform ready to meet modern regulatory demands. Unlike Cardano, which offers long-term potential but has shown slower growth recently, BinoFi delivers immediate innovation and wide-ranging solutions. With features like AI-driven trading, Proof-of-Reserves for unparalleled transparency, and privacy-enhancing ZK KYC technology, BinoFi addresses the emerging needs of crypto investors.

While touchscreens offer versatility and sleek aesthetics, they have come at the cost of usability. Many drivers have criticized VW’s reliance on touch-sensitive controls, particularly for essential functions like climate control and volume adjustment. CEO Thomas Schäfer made a similar promise in 2023, admitting that the company’s earlier approach was difficult to use. VW won’t be eliminating touchscreens altogether — they remain necessary for navigation, infotainment, and backup camera functions. However, critical controls like volume, temperature adjustments, and hazard lights will have dedicated physical buttons in all future VW models. “They will be in every car that we make from now on. If VW follows through on its promise, it could regain goodwill from drivers frustrated by the industry’s shift toward touch-sensitive everything. A growing safety movement is pushing automakers to rethink their reliance on touchscreens. Starting in 2026, the European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) will require physical controls for five critical functions — turn signals, hazard warning lights, horn, windshield wipers and the emergency call (eCall) system — for a vehicle to earn a five-star safety rating. While these regulations don’t yet apply in the U.S., they could influence future safety standards and consumer expectations globally. Some automakers, including Mazda and Toyota, have resisted fully touchscreen-based interiors, maintaining physical buttons for key controls. For now, driving enthusiasts can celebrate: buttons are back, and hopefully this time, they’re here to stay.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

The iX3 is scheduled to arrive late this year, and an electric 3-series sedan will follow in 2026. The Neue Klasse platform will also be compatible with hybrid and gas powertrains. BMW has shared new photos and details about two important products launching soon: the iX3 electric SUV and the electric 3-series sedan, possibly called i3. These new models ride on the company's "Neue Klasse" architecture, which promises faster-charging and longer-range EVs, plus flexibility to incorporate hybrid and gasoline powertrains. These new images of the Neue Klasse prototypes are still camouflaged, but we can see that they look far more production-ready than the concept versions shown last year. These vehicles appear to be electric, as we didn't spot any exhaust pipes like we did on a seemingly gas-powered 3-series prototype we spied testing earlier this year. The company described a control unit it calls "Heart of Joy" that will be installed in every electric Neue Klasse model to handle the drivetrain, braking, charging, regeneration, and steering functions. The Neue Klasse story will go even further in this direction with an upcoming performance M3. BMW has already previewed a prototype of this model, showing an enticing widebody configuration, and has talked about its quad-motor electric powertrain. At the same time, there are hints that the M3 may continue offering an inline-six gasoline engine as well.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Who doesn’t love some competitive go-karting? Well, this spot in Da Lat, Vietnam isn’t exactly that in the traditional sense — but the beautiful downhill luge course, where drivers chase one another while winding downhill as gravity pulls them along faster and faster, sure does look fun in its own right. And it also gives us serious visions of real-life Mario Kart. Called Cao Nguyen Hoa, this course is set up in the hills and mountains around Da Lat in the southern region of Vietnam in the opposite direction of a hill climb. They use handlebars for steering, and thankfully, they have brakes to yank on when your speed gets a bit high entering one of the many hairpins on the course. And the videos posted on various social media platforms depict a Nintendo-esque scene. The waterfalls, beautiful foliage, exotic landscape and vibrant colors everywhere sure do remind us of Mario Kart tracks like DK Jungle, Shy Guy Falls and others. Sadly, there don’t appear to be any power-ups or banana peels you can pick up along the way... though a little bumper-to-bumper racing and crashing definitely looks to be within the realm of possibilities. And based on the videos, there’s no telling what you’ll find further down the mountain: people who overcooked it into a hairpin; people who found themselves stuck behind one of the many chicane-like obstacles in the course; and of course, all sorts of slower traffic for you to pass. It definitely looks like a situation ripe for channeling your inner Lewis Hamilton (or Toad), so if you find yourself near Da Lat in Vietnam, check out Cao Nguyen Hoa — and let us know your fastest time.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Now that it’s been a few years and the hype has died down, thousands are sitting unsold at dealers, and markups have all but vanished. Over 5,000 C8 Corvettes are currently in Chevy’s inventory system, the vast majority from the 2025 model year, which means that more than likely you can go to your local dealership at this very moment and drive away with one. You’ll also likely have several to choose from if you don’t mind buying your new car off the lot, as most Americans do. New Corvettes currently start at $68,300 for the base Stingray and in exchange you get 495 horsepower, a zero to 60 time of 2.9 seconds, and a top track speed of 194 mph. An 8-speed dual-clutch transmission comes standard and the C8 Corvette Stingray is the most powerful production Stingray ever; you might even call it a budget supercar if you’re feeling generous. These prices don’t include tax, title, and other fees. That car starts at $174,995, and has renewed some interest in the C8 right as it gets past midlife. That’s because pretty soon, all eyes will be on the C9 Corvette, which is rumored to debut sometime in 2028, and could be the first all-electric Corvette. By then, most of the C8 Corvettes on dealer lots will have moved on, though for now thousands are still there, in plain sight.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-the-pectra-upgrade-inside-ethereums-future-roadmap'>What Is the Pectra Upgrade? Inside Ethereum’s Future Roadmap</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 17:00:00 <p>
Key features include account abstraction, smart contract optimizations, and improved staking. One of Pectra’s most user-friendly improvements is flexible gas payments. In Ethereum, “gas” refers to transaction fees that compensate validators for securing the network. The Pectra upgrade also introduces Peer Data Availability Sampling or PeerDAS. PeerDAS improves Ethereum's scalability by allowing nodes to verify transaction data without storing it entirely, making the network more efficient. Another improvement is Verkle Trees, a new data structure that combines Vector Commitments and Merkle Trees, and provides a more efficient data storage upgrade for Ethereum. Verkle Trees optimize information storage and verification, significantly reducing the amount of data validators need to keep while allowing quick and secure access to network information. The last major Ethereum upgrade, Dencun, took place on March 13, 2024. It introduced proto-danksharding, which reduces transaction costs for layer-2 blockchains using temporary data called binary large objects or 'blobs.' Instead of relying on permanent on-chain storage, these blobs minimize network congestion, improving scalability and setting the stage for upgrades like Pectra. Account Abstraction : This feature enables gas payments using multiple tokens (e.g., USDC, DAI) and allows third-party fee sponsorship. : This feature enables gas payments using multiple tokens (e.g., USDC, DAI) and allows third-party fee sponsorship. pectra is shaping up to a BIG upgrade, possibly the largest in ethereum's history, so let's review all the code changes that are going into pectra so far and what is still TBD: ⚡️🧵 — Christine Kim (@christine_dkim) June 6, 2024 What Ethereum Improvement Proposals are part of the Pectra upgrade? The Pectra upgrade introduces several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to enhance wallet usability, staking, and scalability. EIP-7702 temporarily functions as smart contracts for externally owned accounts (EOAs), simplifying transactions and replacing the now-deprecated EIP-3074. temporarily functions as smart contracts for externally owned accounts (EOAs), simplifying transactions and replacing the now-deprecated EIP-3074.

Once the Pectra upgrade comes online, Ethereum users may see lower or even zero gas fees as third-party services and decentralized applications will have the option to sponsor transaction fees, potentially eliminating transaction fees in some cases. Pectra also introduces new wallet features to improve Ethereum’s usability and accessibility, including transaction batching, which allows the bundling of multiple transactions into one, reducing costs and improving efficiency. Social recovery provides a safety net for lost private keys by enabling trusted contacts to help restore access to a wallet, while native multisig (multi-signature) wallets enhance security by requiring multiple approvals before executing a transaction, making funds safer from unauthorized access. Ethereum developers expect a smooth Pectra rollout, but key risks remain. Operator centralization may also increase slashing risks if staking consolidates under fewer entities. Another challenge is that the Pectra upgrade’s wallet verification changes could expose outdated protocols to exploits if they are not updated in time. Meanwhile, raising staking limits may encourage centralization, concentrating power among larger players and attracting regulatory scrutiny. Those challenges became apparent in February 2025, when the Pectra upgrade was activated on Ethereum's Holesky testnet, but failed to achieve finality—the point when a transaction is confirmed and permanently recorded on the blockchain. While it represents a setback, testnets "exist to find issues," said Georgios Konstantopoulos, general partner and chief technology officer at crypto investment firm Paradigm. Developers are eyeing April 25 as the launch date for Pectra on mainnet, if all goes to plan.

Buterin emphasized the need for L2 networks to support ETH's value by burning some of their fees or staking them for the community's benefit. “We should think explicitly about the economics of ETH,” Buterin wrote. “We need to make sure that ETH continues to accrue value even in an L2-heavy world, ideally solving for a variety of models of how value accrual happens.” Buterin also called for standardizing cross-chain features, enhancing interoperability, and prioritizing security to prevent censorship on layer-2 chains. Signifying the moment's importance, Buterin likened it to a “wartime mode,” underscoring his commitment to addressing these challenges head-on and driving Ethereum's development forward.

REX Shares debuted an exchange-trade fund on Friday providing exposure to Strategy’s convertible bonds, a form of debt the ETF issuer said was hard to access for most investors. The REX Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF (BMAX) provides exposure to debt from three U.S. companies. Since Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, issued its first batch of convertible senior notes in 2020, REX Financial CEO Greg King said in a statement that retail investors and investment advisors have lacked the same opportunities as institutional investors to access these products. “Until now, these bonds have been difficult for individual investors to reach,” he said. “BMAX removes those barriers making it easier to invest in the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor.” Aside from Strategy’s convertible notes, which account for 81% of the fund’s exposure, the fund contains similar products issued by Bitcoin miners Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms. The fund is actively managed, and REX said it may invest up to 20% of its assets in equities issued by companies that leverage Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Those could be purchased on a secondary market or stem from converting convertible bonds. The company currently offers leveraged ETFs providing 2x long or short exposure to Strategy’s stock.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/takes/bitcoin-is-a-strategic-asset-not-xrp'>Bitcoin Is A Strategic Asset, Not XRP</a></h2><b>Source:</b> bitcoinmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 15:09:00 <p>
A new proposal submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) newly-established Crypto Task Force by a Maximilian Staudinger makes the case for XRP as a “strategic financial asset” for the United States (using some very questionable math and logic). I’m here to tell you that XRP is not a strategic asset and that the logic in this proposal is dubious at best. And he claims that if certain regulatory conditions were created — including the SEC classifying XRP as a payment network, the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) providing legal clearance for banks to use XRP, and the Federal Reserve mandating that banks use XRP as a liquidity solution — then 30% of this capital ($1.5 trillion) would be freed up for the U.S. government to buy 25 million bitcoin at $60,000 per bitcoin. So, let’s break down why this makes little sense. I’m not sure what sort of logic includes these domestic banks turning over the U.S. dollars that XRP would theoretically replace to the Federal government so that these dollars could then be used to acquire bitcoin on behalf of the government. Lastly, there’s a hard cap of 21 million bitcoin (and approximately 4 million have been lost), which is a well-known fact in the Bitcoin or crypto space. Therefore, it’s quite silly to suggest that the U.S. government could buy 25 million bitcoin. Given how faulty the logic behind this proposal is, it’s difficult to consider XRP a strategic asset. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a globally distributed asset that many around the world use as both money and a store of value. Theses factors make bitcoin a logical reserve asset, which is how the U.S. government now officially classifies it. So, hopefully, the SEC already understands what I’ve outlined in this piece and doesn’t spend much time even considering Mr. Staudinger’s proposal.

Ethereum is preparing for its Pectra upgrade, which aims to boost the network’s scalability and offer better staking flexibility, by launching a testnet on Monday codenamed Hoodi. This comes after two previous testnets, Holesky and Sepolia, encountered technical issues. The second largest cryptocurrency’s price appears unmoved by this news. Zooming out, ETH has lost 13.3% in the past week amid macro pressures from President Trump’s trade war. Pectra looks to boost Ethereum’s scalability, efficiency, and staking flexibility as it expands storage capacity for layer-2 networks. Previous tests of the upgrade faced challenges, most notably Holesky saw an uptick in invalid blocks. As a result, devs are launching Hoodi on Monday, March 17 in hopes it’ll address the issues seen with the last testnet. That’s left room for coins like XRP to gain 258.98%. But slow and steady wins the race—or so Ethereum maxis would have other investors believe. It’ll also allow for third-party fee sponsorship, which allows an entity to pay gas fees on behalf of the user—something that has become hugely important on layer-2 scaling networks. With this, many believe that Pectra will be the biggest upgrade to Ethereum since The Merge and one of its largest in its history. Once Ethereum’s core developers “feel confident” in the state of testing, a mainnet update will be scheduled at least 30 days after the Hoodi fork.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A California man has been sentenced for his role in using Bitcoin to launder the proceeds of an operation selling MDMA on the dark web. According to Texas police, Khuu’s operation would import MDMA from Germany and sell it on various dark web markets, accepting payment in Bitcoin. Khuu would allegedly then trade the Bitcoin stored in seller accounts for U.S. currency and launder the dirty money through “hundreds of transactions and dozens of financial accounts." The operation played a part in 21 people being arrested in 2022 for acting as "money mules" and helping to launder the proceeds of various crypto scams, including real estate, email, and romance scams. Last month, a Montana man was also convicted for crypto money laundering as part of the federal agency crackdown. It’s no surprise that the federal government is taking an all-inclusive approach to fighting Bitcoin money laundering. Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis thinks 2024 was likely the biggest year ever in terms of money laundered through cryptocurrency at over $40 billion, exceeding the previous record set in 2023. A 2024 risk assessment from the U.S. Treasury found that though traditional methods to launder drug money are still dominant, using crypto to launder drug money is rising both in popularity and sophistication. Many of these crypto drug money laundering operations are increasingly international in scope. The DEA’s most recent National Drug Threat Assessment established how Mexican cartels operating in the U.S. have "mutually profitable partnerships with China-based money laundering organizations to launder drug proceeds and are increasingly using cryptocurrency."</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://decrypt.co/309983/google-openai-trump-ai-copyright-restrictions'>Google Joins OpenAI in Asking Trump to Relax AI Copyright Restrictions</a></h2><b>Source:</b> decrypt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 11:31:03 <p>
Google has joined OpenAI in urging President Donald Trump’s administration to ease restrictions on AI training, particularly around the use of copyrighted materials. Both tech giants submitted policy proposals on Thursday, advocating for a more flexible approach to artificial intelligence regulations as the U.S. government prepares its "AI Action Plan" by mid-2025. The proposals submitted by Google and OpenAI are in response to President Trump’s new focus on artificial intelligence regulation, following his revocation of the previous administration's AI executive order in January 2025. “Fair use and text-and-data mining exceptions” are critical for continued AI research, Google said, noting how strict copyright policies could hinder progress in artificial intelligence fields, including healthcare, scientific discovery, and economic development. In its proposal, Google welcomed the Trump administration’s focus on artificial intelligence, saying the goal of developing a plan to “sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance” is crucial for U.S. leadership. In January, Trump unveiled a $500 billion Stargate Project, aimed at strengthening U.S. AI infrastructure, which includes OpenAI among major contributors, alongside other tech giants like Microsoft and Oracle. OpenAI, for example, is currently embroiled in several high-profile lawsuits filed by authors and publishers accusing the company of using their copyrighted works without permission. Similarly, Google has faced accusations of using copyrighted content to train its AI models, including its AI-powered tools like YouTube's music recommendation system, which was shelved due to copyright concerns. Google has called for a cohesive federal policy that sets a clear framework for artificial intelligence development, so that companies can operate across state lines without facing conflicting regulations. Trump’s new executive order prioritizes maintaining U.S. global dominance in artificial intelligence and mandates that a comprehensive “AI Action Plan” be presented to the president within 180 days.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. A UK National Crime Agency officer has been charged with the alleged theft of 50 Bitcoin in 2017, then worth $77,000. Paul Chowles, 42, from Bristol, stands charged with 15 counts of criminal offences in relation to the theft, which he is accused of having committed while working as an operational officer at the NCA. The alleged theft took place during an ongoing investigation into online organized crime, according to the investigating Merseyside Police. In a statement, Malcolm McHaffie, Head of the Crown Prosecution Service Special Crime Division, said: "Mr Chowles, 42, is due to be charged with 11 offences of concealing, disguising, or converting criminal property, three offences of acquiring, using or possessing converting criminal property and a single count of theft." Mr Chowles is due to appear at the Liverpool Magistrates' Court on 25 April 2025. Mr McHaffie added that, "The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against this defendant are now active and that he has the right to a fair trial. “It is extremely important that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings.” The National Crime Agency is the UK's main agency that works against serious and organized crime, with a focus on cybercrime and economic crime both nationally and internationally. In 2024, the NCA was granted new powers to "seize, freeze and destroy" cryptocurrency used by criminals, enabling it to seize crypto from suspects without being required to make an arrest.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has had its moment, but can it survive the next meme coin crash? And now Shiba Inu (SHIB) may not survive the next meme coin crash. The concentration of SHIB tokens among a few large holders is one such vulnerability. This imbalance could undermine the platform’s success if not addressed, as large-scale sell-offs by major holders can lead to abrupt price declines, eroding investor confidence. Slow exchange withdrawals, excessive fees and banking restrictions have prevented crypto from reaching its full potential as a real-world payment solution. That’s where Remittix (RTX) is stepping in to make a difference. Remittix is also turning heads for its stern focus on privacy.

Remittix provides a privacy-focused alternative, ensuring that transactions are processed without unnecessary scrutiny.

These powerful things are currently on offer for just $0.0734, giving investors a chance to share in the bright future of Remittix.

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://blockonomi.com/court-approves-three-arrows-capitals-1-53-billion-claim-against-ftx/'>Court Approves Three Arrows Capital’s $1.53 Billion Claim Against FTX</a></h2><b>Source:</b> blockonomi&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 09:03:23 <p>
This ruling adds to the ongoing saga involving Sam Bankman-Fried, who is currently seeking a pardon from President Trump Three Arrows Capital (3AC) liquidators can now expand their claim against FTX from $120 million to $1.53 billion. This ruling marks a key development in the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. Judge John T. Dorsey approved the motion filed by 3AC’s joint liquidators, Russell Crumpler and Christopher Farmer. The liquidators originally filed their proof of claim in June 2023. Further investigation revealed much more extensive dealings between the companies. The liquidators discovered that just two weeks before 3AC entered liquidation, about $1.53 billion of 3AC’s assets on the FTX platform were liquidated. The amended filing includes several new allegations against FTX. Judge Dorsey found that much of the delay in filing was due to FTX not providing necessary documents promptly. Three Arrows Capital was once one of the biggest crypto hedge funds. The fund’s downfall came after a sharp crypto market drop. 3AC had placed heavily leveraged bets on digital assets, including the TerraUSD stablecoin, which crashed in May 2022. It triggered a wave of liquidations affecting lenders such as Voyager Digital and BlockFi. According to court filings, 3AC held $1.53 billion in assets on FTX as of June 12, 2022. This latest ruling adds another layer to the complex FTX bankruptcy saga. The exchange collapsed amid allegations of fraud and mismanagement under former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. He’s reportedly trying to secure a pardon from President Donald Trump. To boost his chances, Bankman-Fried has been aligning himself with right-wing figures. He recently appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show and has consulted with a lawyer linked to Trump. Despite Trump’s history of granting pardons, many remain doubtful. The ruling on 3AC’s expanded claim comes 15 months after another key development. This order, issued by a British Virgin Islands court, blocks Zhu, Davies, and Davies’ wife, Kelly Chen, from accessing funds. The freeze remains in place while claims against them are pursued. The arrest occurred at Changi Airport as Zhu attempted to leave the country following a committal order by Singapore courts.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

THE FINAL COUNTDOWN HAS STARTED FOR #XRP.. pic.twitter.com/ndaIDpb995 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) March 12, 2025 XRP has been trading below the exponential moving average (EMA) ribbons for 37 days since early February. This technical indicator is important for traders who use EMA ribbons to spot market trends. During that period, XRP stayed in the bearish zone for 35 days before breaking through. In April 2024, XRP spent 90 days below the ribbons before seeing a 43% price rally. XRP stayed below the ribbons for 64 days, then rose by 47% after breaking through. Based on these patterns, Steph believes XRP might be close to a similar breakout. With XRP already at 37 days below the ribbons, Steph sees reason for optimism about a possible price reversal soon. Based on previous movements, Steph expects at least a 40% rally, with potential for even higher gains. Another factor that could boost XRP’s price is the current funding rates. Steph noted that these rates are very negative, with many traders shorting XRP. “This creates a lot of liquidity above us with very little below. Price typically targets the highest liquidity, so a massive short squeeze is likely to occur soon,” Steph explained. A short squeeze happens when traders who bet against an asset are forced to buy it back at higher prices.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

During Phase 3 of its presale, MUTM is priced at $0.02, having already raised $3.3 million and drawn in over 5,600 backers. Looking beyond, some forecasts suggest Mutuum Finance could surpass $2.40—representing a remarkable 4,050% upswing. Mutuum Finance aims to revolutionize decentralized lending through its dual-lending approach, fueling widespread industry interest. Thanks to its unique lending solution and an official launch price of $0.06, analysts predict MUTM might surge beyond $5 in the months to come, making it a high-value, though under-the-radar, DeFi token. At the core of Mutuum Finance’s value proposition is its two-pronged lending system: Peer-to-Peer (P2P): Users have direct control over their holdings and can establish lending deals on a one-on-one basis without intermediaries. By intertwining these two models, Mutuum Finance ensures a decentralized, secure, and streamlined experience for those seeking to maximize DeFi yields. Mutuum Finance plans to introduce a fully collateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum network, shoring up stability and mitigating insolvency risks typically associated with algorithmic stablecoins. Early adopters benefit from exclusive perks such as staking pools, governance rights, and VIP notifications that deepen their involvement in the platform. The project’s careful tokenomics strategy aims to maintain a controlled supply and foster continual value appreciation. Staking rewards encourage active participation, contributing to a stable, vibrant ecosystem for the project’s native token. Priced at $0.02, MUTM has already secured $3.3 million and over 5,600 investors, with a 25% price jump expected shortly.

World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a project backed by Donald Trump, completed its token sale, raising between $550-590 million Tron founder Justin Sun was credited as a major investor who helped drive the project’s success World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto project associated with President Donald Trump’s family, has successfully completed its token sale. The public sale of WLFI’s governance token began in October 2024. This would be raised by offering 20 billion tokens priced at $0.015 each. Only whitelisted investors who completed Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) verifications could participate in the sale. This restriction limited the pool of potential buyers to accredited investors. Sun reportedly invested $30 million in November 2024 and later increased his investment. The team made an additional 5 billion WLFI tokens available on January 20. Speaking at Consensus 2025 in Hong Kong, WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman credited Justin Sun with the project’s ultimate success. “When we were launching this project, it was a very heated time,” Folkman said during the event. Folkman noted that traditional crypto venture capital firms would not invest in the token. All purchased WLFI tokens will remain locked for 12 months following the sale. This restriction prevents any immediate trading activity on the tokens. WLFI serves exclusively as a governance token within the World Liberty Financial Protocol. It grants holders the ability to submit and vote on proposals. The token does not confer ownership, financial returns, or economic benefits. The token cannot currently be transferred or publicly sold on exchanges. As of March 10, total losses linked to the Trump-backed initiative had reached $110 million. The project had allocated $336 million to acquire nine different cryptocurrency assets. WLFI purchased ETH at an average price of $3,240 per token.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This resilience has caught the attention of several analysts who are now studying technical indicators to predict future price movements. The 100-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) has emerged as a critical level for Dogecoin. According to Trader Tardigrade, a well-known analyst on X, DOGE has historically entered strong bullish phases after breaking above this long-term resistance level. Dogecoin surged after crossing above the 100-week SMA and later used this level as support during retracements. If history repeats itself, a successful breakout could push Dogecoin toward $2.80, according to Trader Tardigrade’s analysis. Another analyst, CryptoElites, points to a symmetrical triangle breakout pattern in Dogecoin’s price action. Based on this formation, DOGE could potentially reach $5 if market momentum remains strong and macroeconomic conditions stay favorable. Glassnode data shows that new DOGE wallet addresses have more than doubled in just one month, rising from 16,400 on February 8 to 34,600 by March 10. Historically, rising adoption has preceded bullish price action for the meme cryptocurrency. He suggests that Dogecoin could surge by 11,811% to reach $20 if it maintains support at the crucial $0.16 level. This metric moved from 16,400 to 34,600 new wallets amid renewed interest in the Dogecoin ecosystem. Technical indicators, network growth, and historical patterns all suggest Dogecoin may be positioning for a potential rally. However, the cryptocurrency must first overcome immediate resistance levels to confirm this bullish outlook.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

This comes as Bitcoin’s price inches closer to the $85,000 mark despite ongoing market uncertainties. March has been a challenging month for crypto ETFs overall. More than $1.67 billion exited US spot Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds during this period. The majority of this money came from Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $1.33 billion in outflows. This represents the lowest daily value since February 20, suggesting a possible slowdown in trading activity. Market experts point to several factors behind the recent ETF outflows. These include broader market downturns, macroeconomic uncertainties, geopolitical tensions, and trade wars. Bearish investor sentiment has also played a role in the exodus of funds. Some analysts believe that unmet expectations regarding President Donald Trump’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve plan have added to the selling pressure. The Bloomberg data shows that BTC ETF inflows have declined slightly to $35 billion. Currently, US Bitcoin ETFs manage a total of $115 billion in assets under management. This highlights the resilience of both retail investors and institutional players who have invested in these products. For example, Goldman Sachs reportedly has more than $1.5 billion invested in Bitcoin ETFs. While ETF investors show mixed sentiment, long-term Bitcoin holders appear to be taking advantage of the market dip.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

WLFI has invested $21.6 million in various cryptocurrencies since late February, including Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, Move, and SEI. SEI hit its lowest price point since November 2023, reaching around $0.18 before showing signs of recovery. The price of SEI cryptocurrency has jumped 7.3% following news that World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a DeFi venture backed by Donald Trump, purchased 541,242 SEI tokens. The acquisition, valued at $100,000 USDC, came at an average price of $0.185 per token and has helped push SEI closer to the $0.20 mark. This purchase occurs as SEI was testing a key demand zone around $0.18, which marked its lowest level since November 2023. Daily trading volume increased by 17% to more than $127 million, showing renewed interest in the token. This surge in trading happened during a week when much of the broader crypto market faced corrections. Technical analysis of SEI shows the token positioning for a potential short-term breakout from its descending triangle pattern on hourly charts. The Elliott Wave count suggests SEI may be completing a corrective phase. This region also corresponds with a key horizontal demand zone. Support remains at $0.175, with $0.15 serving as a critical level that could invalidate the bullish outlook if broken. The project has invested $21.6 million in various cryptocurrencies since late February. These investments include major assets such as Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, and Move, in addition to SEI. Just last week, the DeFi project invested $10 million each in Ethereum and Wrapped Bitcoin. In February, WLFI unveiled its new Macro Strategy Reserve initiative. This strategic move aims to strengthen its position in the cryptocurrency sector by diversifying holdings across various digital assets. Beyond its SEI acquisition, WLFI has also formed a partnership with Sui to explore development opportunities. As part of this collaboration, the project will build a strategic SUI reserve. Evang Cheng, a founding contributor to Sui, expressed optimism about the partnership. Technical indicators show the RSI has been in oversold territory, suggesting selling exhaustion.

Despite positive U.S. inflation data, fears of prolonged trade wars are putting pressure on crypto markets Cardano underperformed other top cryptocurrencies like BNB and XRP, which have found support from positive news Cardano’s price has been on a downward spiral in recent days. On Thursday, ADA dropped by another 5% before finding some stability around the $0.70 level. This price point is now serving as temporary support for the struggling cryptocurrency. The price is trading below key moving averages, signaling that downward momentum remains strong. This occurs when short-term moving averages cross below longer-term ones, typically suggesting continued downward pressure. Cardano’s troubles come despite positive inflation data from the United States. These inflation numbers have increased expectations for a delayed Federal Reserve rate hike. According to CME Group’s FedWatch tool, there’s now a 99% probability that the Fed will leave rates unchanged at its upcoming meeting on March 21. However, rather than boosting crypto markets, these economic indicators have raised other concerns. Many traders fear that lower inflation could encourage the Trump administration to maintain or even increase tariffs on neighboring countries. Many investors are reducing their exposure to risk assets like Cardano in anticipation of prolonged economic tensions. If ADA manages to break above this zone, the next key resistance would be at $0.7520. If this level fails to hold, ADA could retest the recent low around $0.65, with further support at $0.635 and $0.62. In a worst-case scenario, analysts suggest Cardano could test the $0.50 level. This price point was last seen in late 2023 and would represent a major setback for the cryptocurrency. Cardano’s performance stands in contrast to some other major cryptocurrencies. The lack of project-specific good news has left ADA vulnerable to broader market pressures and technical selling. There is also concern about potential funding issues for crypto initiatives.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

While Bitcoin follows gold’s rise, Ethereum has been caught in a persistent downtrend, breaking key support levels and concerning investors. Over the past three weeks, ETH has plummeted more than 33%, trading near $1,891 as of Friday, March 14. Major stock indexes including the S&P 500 have been sliding due to uncertainty from U.S. tariff wars. These conditions have pushed long-term investors toward safer assets like gold and stablecoins. This sentiment is reflected in the consistent cash outflows from U.S. spot Ether ETFs, which have seen withdrawals for three straight weeks. If this level holds, it could help restore bullish sentiment in the near future. Technical indicators suggest the possibility of a recovery if key levels can be maintained. A short-term bearish trend line has formed with resistance at $1,900 on the hourly chart. If Ethereum can break above this, the next targets would be $1,990 and potentially $2,050. It continues to dominate the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector with approximately $45 billion in total value locked (TVL). To maintain its edge, Ethereum developers are actively working on the upcoming Pectra upgrade. Ethereum Foundation core developer Tim Beiko announced that the third testnet, Hoodi, will launch by mid-April 2025 to finalize preparations for this upgrade.

Trade war escalation has created a risk-off sentiment with investors moving to safer assets like gold Russia reportedly using crypto in oil trades with China and India to bypass Western sanctions Technical analysis shows Bitcoin found support at $78,000 and started a recovery above $80,500 Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced more downward trend this week, falling below the $82,000 mark as global economic tensions rise due to President Trump’s recent tariff decisions. Bitcoin extended its losses on Friday, trading at $81,914.20 as of 03:08 ET (07:08 GMT), representing a 1.6% decline. The world’s largest cryptocurrency is set to register a weekly loss of nearly 5%. The drop comes as President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 200% tariff on European alcohol imports. This move was in response to the European Union’s planned levies on American whiskey. These developments have raised fears about a potential U.S. recession, causing investors to pull back from speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. The market sentiment has shifted toward safer investments during this period of uncertainty. Gold prices reached record highs on Friday, highlighting the current risk-averse mood among investors. Adding to market caution is the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting scheduled for March 18-19. The Fed is widely expected to maintain current interest rates as it adopts a wait-and-see approach amid economic uncertainties. The central bank faces a complex situation as ongoing trade disputes could potentially increase inflationary pressures. However, if Bitcoin fails to rise above $82,450, it could face another decline.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Solana’s price dropped below $125 amid FTX and Alameda Research liquidating assets worth millions Solana’s price has fallen below the $125 mark as FTX and Alameda Research continue liquidating assets to repay creditors. The recent price drop coincides with large transactions from wallets linked to these entities. According to Arkham Intelligence, Alameda unstaked over $23 million worth of SOL tokens, distributing them across 38 different addresses. Market participants have grown cautious as they watch these funds potentially entering exchanges. The distribution of tokens to multiple addresses suggests preparations for market sales. This pattern has created hesitation among buyers who fear further price drops. This isn’t the first time FTX liquidations have affected Solana’s price. Since November 2023, FTX and Alameda Research have unstaked approximately 8 million SOL tokens valued at nearly $1 billion. Many of these tokens have already been sold through major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. These sales have put steady downward pressure on Solana’s price over recent months. This lag compared to other altcoins like XRP and ADA highlights the impact of FTX’s continuous liquidations. This overhanging supply creates a cloud over Solana’s price recovery chances. Even with improving broader market conditions, Solana may struggle to gain upward momentum. Recent positive economic indicators like cooling U.S. inflation data have failed to lift SOL prices. Many are waiting for clarity on when the FTX liquidation process might conclude. After briefly reclaiming the $131 level, SOL quickly reversed as bears took control. This price point is now viewed as a critical level for SOL’s future direction. Some analysts point to an Elliott Wave pattern suggesting a potential reversal around $112. This level now serves as a key decision point for trading strategies. However, a buy wall at current prices may provide some support and prevent further sharp declines. Separate from the price action, a major governance proposal for Solana recently failed to pass. It would have replaced the fixed inflation schedule with a dynamic model based on staking participation. The existing model starts at 8% annually and decreases by 15% each year until reaching 1.5%. This adds another factor beyond FTX liquidations that may affect price performance. However, Solana has seen a steep decline of nearly 60% over the past two months. This reduction in network activity adds another headwind to Solana’s price recovery. The combination of FTX liquidations, high inflation, and decreased network activity creates challenging conditions for price growth.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Coinbase stock has dropped 31% year-to-date, closing at $177.49 after a 7.43% dip Cathie Wood has previously predicted Bitcoin could reach $1 million per coin by 2030 Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest has made major moves in the crypto market, purchasing 997 Bitcoin worth $80 million and adding $5.2 million in Coinbase shares to its portfolio. Ark Invest acquired the Bitcoin through Coinbase on March 13, 2025, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. This Bitcoin acquisition comes at a time when institutional investors remain active in the cryptocurrency space. Many large investors are maintaining positions in Bitcoin ETFs despite recent market fluctuations. These shares were worth about $5.2 million based on Thursday’s closing price. Both Coinbase and Robinhood have seen their stock prices decline this year. The crypto exchange’s stock has dropped 31% year-to-date according to Google Finance data. The latest Coinbase share purchase follows earlier acquisitions by Ark Invest. Cathie Wood stated last year that Ark aims to keep individual stock holdings below 10% of a fund’s portfolio. She has previously predicted that Bitcoin could reach $1 million per coin by 2030. Some analysts suggest Bitcoin could fall to the $75,000 support level if selling pressure continues. The recent price movements have been influenced by trading war impacts and other market factors. Ark’s investment approach seems to involve direct Bitcoin purchases while simultaneously expanding its positions in crypto-related companies. The firm previously sold approximately $9 million of its Bitcoin ETF holdings. This sale occurred as part of a broader trend, with about $1.1 billion exiting spot Bitcoin ETFs. Despite these market challenges, Ark Invest appears committed to its long-term strategy in the digital asset sector.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

<h2><a target='_blank' href='https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/rare-bitcoin-buy-signal-could-ignite-next-btc-rally'>This Rare Bitcoin Buy Signal Could Ignite Next BTC Rally</a></h2><b>Source:</b> bitcoinmagazine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Published:</b> 2025-03-14 08:28:12 <p>
Bitcoin has been struggling with lower lows in recent weeks, leaving many investors questioning whether the asset is on the brink of a major bear cycle. However, a rare data point tied to the US Dollar Strength Index (DXY) suggests that a significant shift in market dynamics may be imminent. This bitcoin buy signal, which has only appeared three times in BTC’s history, could point to a bullish reversal despite the current bearish sentiment. Bitcoin’s price action has long been inversely correlated with the US Dollar Strength Index (DXY). However, past occurrences of this rare DXY retracement suggest that a delayed but meaningful BTC rebound could still be in play. Figure 2: There have only been three previous instances of such rapid DXY decline. The first occurrence was after BTC’s price had bottomed out in 2015. After an initial period of price stabilization, BTC followed with a sustained recovery, climbing to substantially higher prices and kicking off the current bull cycle over the following months. In each case, the sharp decline in the DXY was followed by a consolidation phase before BTC embarked on a significant bullish run. Overlaying the price action of these three instances onto our current price action we get an idea of how things could play out in the near future. Figure 3: How price action could play out if any of the three previous occurrences are mirrored. When the DXY retraces sharply, equity markets have historically outperformed their baseline returns. Figure 4: The same outperformance can be observed in equity markets. This correlation suggests that Bitcoin’s performance following a sharp DXY retracement aligns with historical broader market trends, reinforcing the argument for a delayed but inevitable positive response.

Only about 0.8% of Bitcoin is currently being used in DeFi, presenting a large untapped opportunity Bitcoin needs Layer 2 solutions to overcome its lack of native programmability unlike smart contract platforms BTCFi could help sustain miner incentives by generating higher transaction fees This emerging sector focuses on lending, staking, stablecoins, and decentralized exchanges. Moulik Nagesh, an analyst at Binance Research, wrote about this shift in the report. He points out that Bitcoin’s role in DeFi is growing beyond its traditional use as digital gold. DeFi refers to financial activities carried out on blockchains without traditional middlemen. These activities include lending, trading, and other financial services that normally require banks. Currently, only about 0.8% of all Bitcoin is being used in DeFi applications. This low usage rate presents what Binance calls a “large untapped opportunity.” Unlike Ethereum and other smart contract platforms, Bitcoin lacks “native programmability.” This means it can’t easily run complex financial applications. These are systems built on top of the main Bitcoin blockchain that extend its capabilities. While development of Bitcoin Layer 2 networks is progressing, these platforms still need wider adoption. As block rewards continue to halve, miners receive less Bitcoin for their work. By generating more transaction fees, it could provide miners with additional income. It needs to develop in ways that complement Bitcoin’s unique value proposition. This growth has positioned Bitcoin among the top three DeFi ecosystems. However, their adoption will depend on regulatory clarity and user-friendly solutions. Most Bitcoin currently used in DeFi exists as wrapped tokens on other blockchains like Ethereum. These will help bridge liquidity and attract users from existing DeFi ecosystems. Looking ahead, Bitcoin DeFi will need to focus on specific use cases. These include execution quality, continued Layer 2 development, and alignment with Bitcoin’s core values.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Elder-Ray Index turned positive for the first time since January, signaling bullish momentum Market analysts have spotted key technical patterns forming on PEPE’s daily chart. Buy volume is rising while sell pressure appears to be weakening. This combination of factors suggests PEPE might be preparing for a sharp upward move. If a breakout occurs, traders should watch for immediate resistance at $0.0000075 and $0.000010. In a bearish scenario, PEPE could face trouble if it fails to hold above the crucial support level at $0.00000298. On-chain data shows three major investors purchased a combined 689.79 billion PEPE tokens. These purchases amount to approximately $4.3-5 million in value, showcasing renewed confidence from larger market players. The largest buyer was wallet 0x7A7D, which purchased 437.7 billion PEPE for 1,413.4 ETH (about $2.72 million). They typically lead to higher liquidity and stronger market confidence in the asset. Though some analysts have questioned the origin of these funds, as they reportedly came from Tornado Cash. Beyond technical indicators and whale activity, broader economic factors have supported PEPE’s recovery. U.S. inflation data released this week showed a decline in the Consumer Price Index from 3.0% to 2.8%. As a result of improved economic outlook, risk assets including cryptocurrencies experienced renewed interest from investors. This macro trend has provided additional tailwinds for PEPE’s price movement. PEPE’s futures open interest has climbed to between $198-214 million, its highest level since early March. Daily trading volume has also surged, exceeding $1.11 billion and jumping by 18% over the past 24 hours. This signals a bullish shift in investor sentiment toward the altcoin. The Elder-Ray Index assesses market strength by comparing an asset’s price to its moving average. It highlights whether bulls or bears are dominant in the market. A positive value suggests bulls are in control, indicating upward momentum. Despite these positive signals, PEPE continues to trade below its 200-day Exponential Moving Average.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Amid ongoing sanctions over the war in Ukraine, Russia has turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to facilitate some of its oil trade with major buyers China and India. According to a Reuters report, Russian oil companies and traders increasingly conduct transactions in bitcoin and crypto, allowing them to circumvent restrictions from Western nations. JUST IN: 🇷🇺 Russia is using #Bitcoin and crypto in its oil trade with China and India to skirt Western sanctions: Reuters pic.twitter.com/Ld99WAQ1WQ — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) March 14, 2025 The mechanism involves Chinese or Indian buyers purchasing oil and depositing yuan or rupees into an offshore account owned by a middleman company. The middleman then converts the fiat currency into crypto and transfers it to an account in Russia, where it is exchanged into rubles. Bitcoin and crypto’s censorship resistance allows value transfer beyond the reach of sanctions. The Bank of Russia also recently proposed legalizing crypto investments for wealthy citizens. However, Russia’s oil trade still relies primarily on fiat currencies. With the Ukraine conflict still unresolved, Russia’s pivot toward leveraging bitcoin and decentralized technologies appears to aim to reduce its reliance on traditional finance and dollar settlements.

Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, celebrated Vermont’s decision, calling it a sign of "progress." “As we have always said: staking services are not securities,” he wrote on X. Grewal went on to urge other states still pursuing similar actions to “take a page from Vermont’s playbook.” The formation of the new SEC task force to “provide guidance for the promulgation of rules regarding the regulation of crypto products and services” was cited as a pivotal factor in Vermont’s decision to rescind its case against Coinbase. The legal troubles between Coinbase and state regulators date back to June 2023, when Vermont, along with 10 other states, issued a "show cause order" accusing the exchange of violating securities laws by offering staking services without proper registration. The 11 states argued that Coinbase's staking services qualified as unregistered securities, prompting legal action to halt the practice in certain jurisdictions. The legal actions were launched shortly after the SEC filed its own case against Coinbase, accusing the exchange of operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency. The SEC, under its new acting chair, Mark Uyeda, has adopted a more lenient stance on enforcement compared to its previous leadership under Gary Gensler. Following the change, the SEC has dropped multiple lawsuits against crypto companies, notably Binance, Kraken, and OpenSea, among others.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

While Cardano remains a promising choice for many, savvy investors are also turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in pursuit of even higher potential gains. Moreover, some estimates suggest MUTM may reach $6 post-launch, implying a chance for $500 to become $500,000. Over 5,400 investors have collectively contributed $3.2 million, making the token’s opening days a strong success. Experts foresee a possible $6 price per MUTM shortly after listing, with upcoming exchange deals poised to increase the token’s value even further. Mutuum Finance aims for secure, scalable growth through features that combine innovative architecture and consistent development. By using predictive smart contracts, the platform efficiently manages lending operations across multiple networks.

Additionally, the platform offers a referral program that grants newcomers extra perks for joining through existing community members, further boosting user engagement.

Bitcoin’s sharp pullback is deepening as risk aversion grips global markets, yet a surprising policy shift from Washington could inject fresh momentum into the digital asset. The crypto is now trading near $81,600, down 25% from its January peak of $109,000, with selling pressure intensifying as liquidity conditions tighten, according to CoinGecko. “Daily tariff swings and ongoing ETF outflows are keeping risk assets under pressure,” Vincent Liu, Chief Investment Officer at Kronos Research, told Decrypt. “Crypto investors need a real shift in macro conditions to turn sentiment around.” Data from Glassnode shows that Bitcoin’s recent slide below $92,000 marked a key inflection point. Unlike previous pullbacks that sparked renewed accumulation, this time, investors have largely stepped aside. According to Glassnode’s Crypto Balance Distribution heatmap, demand has softened as external risks—including the Bybit hack and escalating U.S. tariff disputes—have driven capital preservation over opportunistic buying. The ASX 200 has slipped into correction territory, now 10% off its February peak, while inflation concerns and U.S. Federal Reserve hawkishness have kept traditional markets under pressure. Still, headlines stemming from the White House are offering crypto investors some hope. At a closed-door roundtable earlier this week, White House official Bo Hines told crypto industry leaders that the Trump administration intends to accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible, reinforcing the government’s commitment to its recent Bitcoin reserve announcement. If Washington moves forward with large-scale purchases, supply constraints may emerge, adding a fundamental catalyst for future price appreciation. Still, without renewed buying interest, Bitcoin could enter a prolonged consolidation or deeper correction before stabilizing, Glassnode wrote. “Whether the two priced-in potential rate cuts will happen this year is a major macro concern,” Marco Lim, managing director at Solowin Holdings and founding partner of MaiCapital, told Decrypt.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

A U.S. bankruptcy court has granted liquidators of defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) permission to expand their claim against FTX to $1.53 billion, rejecting objections from FTX’s debtors that the move was untimely and unfair. Judge John T. Dorsey of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware ruled on Thursday that 3AC’s liquidators had provided sufficient notice of their claim and were hampered in their investigation by FTX’s failure to share relevant records in a timely manner. FTX’s debtors, led by CEO John Ray III, meanwhile, objected to the amendment, arguing that it introduced new legal theories and significantly increased the claim’s size. The fund, founded by Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, had placed heavily leveraged bets on digital assets, including the TerraUSD stablecoin, which lost nearly all its value in May 2022. The collapse of 3AC triggered a wave of liquidations across the crypto industry, affecting lenders such as Voyager Digital and BlockFi. According to court filings, 3AC held $1.53 billion in assets on FTX as of June 12, 2022. Over the next two days, those assets were liquidated to cover a $1.3 billion debt owed to FTX, court documents show. 3AC’s liquidators initially filed a $120 million claim in FTX’s bankruptcy case in June 2023, but later expanded it, alleging claims including breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and breach of fiduciary duty. The ruling comes 15 months after 3AC’s liquidators also secured a worldwide freeze on $1.4 billion in assets tied to the fund’s co-founders. The December 2023 order, issued by a British Virgin Islands court, blocks Zhu, Davies, and Davies’ wife, Kelly Chen, from accessing funds while claims against them are pursued.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

OKX won a license to operate in Europe, Camomile Shumba reported. Coinbase announced plans to offer 24/7 futures trading in the U.S., Helene Braun reported. From our Asia team, Sam Reynolds examined how the latest draft of the GENIUS act aims to split stablecoin regulation between state and federal authorities. Malwa also reported on the implications of over-leveraging in the crypto market, as Hyperliquid lost $4 million due to a massive leveraged trade in ETH. Market maven, Omkar Godbole, pushed out a timely piece on bitcoin's bullish signal ahead of the U.S. CPI report, and was also early to spot how Eric Trump's tweet on crypto were setting up short-term traders for disappointment. Meanwhile, Tom Carreras had an excellent feature on how Bitdeer, a Singapore-based miner, hopes to shake up the mining machine market. Hopefully next week brings better news in the markets.

REX Shares has launched a first-of-its-kind convertible-bonds exchange-traded fund (ETF), allowing investors exposure to the convertible debt issued by corporates to add bitcoin to their balance sheet.

Called the REX Bitcoin Corporate Treasury Convertible Bond ETF (BMAX), the fund is necessarily mostly made up of convertible paper issued by Michael Saylor's Strategy (MSTR), by far the largest issuer of such debt. Other top 10 holdings include the convertible notes of bitcoin miners Marathon Digital (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT).

“Until now, these bonds have been difficult for individual investors to reach,” said Greg King, CEO of Rex Financial, in a statement. “BMAX removes those barriers, making it easier to invest in the strategy pioneered by Michael Saylor — leveraging corporate debt to acquire Bitcoin as a treasury asset.”

The fund officially launched today, and trades on the Nasdaq. It has a gross expense ratio of 0.85% and was seeded with $25 million in assets.

Shares of the ETF are higher in early trading as bitcoin has rallied from an overnight low of around $80,000 to above $84,000.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

Russia has turned to cryptocurrencies to facilitate oil trade with China and India, effectively bypassing Western sanctions in its $192 billion oil trade, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. Just this week, the Bank of Russia submitted proposals to create an experimental legal regime (ELR) lasting three years, allowing a “limited group of Russian investors” to trade cryptocurrencies. See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . Some Russian oil firms use bitcoin, ether, and stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) to convert payments made in Chinese yuan and Indian rupees into roubles, the Reuters report said. These transactions currently represent a fraction of Russia’s oil trade. Other sanctioned countries, including Iran and Venezuela, have used crypto to maintain trade while avoiding reliance on the U.S. dollar, the dominant currency in global oil markets. Russia has developed multiple payment systems to navigate sanctions, and crypto is one of several tools the country uses. Fiat currencies remain the primary method used in Russia’s oil transactions, and other workarounds include using currencies such as the United Arab Emirates dirham, Reuters said. The report also added that even if sanctions were lifted, Russia would likely keep using crypto in its oil trades as it’s seen as a convenient, flexible tool.

"A lot of people wrote us off and said it would have been totally normal for us to end the project right there," said Michael Bentley, CEO of Euler Labs. But his team decided to stick with it and rebuild Euler – from scratch. "There just isn't a one-size-fits-all when it comes to lending and borrowing," Bentley said. Comeback was hardly assured: while victims of the hack had gotten their money back, Bentley and his team questioned whether the market had an appetite for a protocol with a tarnished reputation. It didn't help that Euler basically missed much of 2024's DeFi surge while sitting in pre-launch security reviews. Even now, as ether – a critical collateral asset for lending platforms across Ethereum DeFi – continues spiraling in price, Euler continues to grow.

In November 2024, 3AC’s liquidators amended their claim after discovering new evidence suggesting that FTX had liquidated $1.53 billion in 3AC’s assets just two weeks before the hedge fund commenced its own liquidation proceedings two years prior. They argued that FTX's liquidation of 3AC's funds was carried out to satisfy a $1.3 billion liability to FTX, an obligation that 3AC claimed was not sufficiently substantiated. The ruling allows 3AC to pursue a significantly larger portion of FTX’s remaining assets, potentially reshaping creditor payouts. FTX, which began distributing funds to creditors in February 2025, said the expanded claim should have come sooner, arguing that it would burden other creditors and complicate its reorganization plan. The court, however, determined that 3AC’s delay was justified, given that the liquidators only uncovered the full extent of their claim in mid-2024 due to missing financial records from FTX and a lack of cooperation from 3AC’s founders, Zhu Su and Kyle Davies. Bankman-Fried is currently pursuing an appeal of his criminal conviction and 25-year prison sentence.

Ценовое действие произошло, когда аппетит к риску вернулся и на традиционные Рынки . Между тем, золото, чье ценовое действие превзошло ценовое действие Bitcoin во время продаж последних нескольких недель, опустилось ниже $3000 после того, как вчера впервые в своей истории пересекло этот уровень. «То, что рынок отскакивает от недавних минимумов, скорее всего, является результатом сочетания макроэкономических новостей, касающихся рисковых активов (инфляция/тарифы), и признаком того, что для криптовалют формируется более стабильная база, учитывая падение с максимума всего несколько месяцев назад», — написал в Telegram Пол Ховард, старший директор Криптo торговой компании Wincent. По словам Ховарда, за последние 7 дней было ликвидировано около 2,6 млрд долларов США по кредитным Криптo , в основном длинные позиции, что позволило рынку оздоровиться за счет избавления от чрезмерного кредитного плеча. Сегодняшний отскок также поднял BTC выше своего 200-дневная скользящая средняя после падения ниже этой линии тренда впервые с момента коррекции Криптo в августе прошлого года. 200-дневная скользящая средняя является широко используемый бенчмаркдля трейдеров и инвесторов, позволяющих оценить долгосрочные тенденции цен на активы, что часто служит поддержкой для отскока цен на бычьем рынке, в то время как снижение уровня является сигналом к отказу от риска или к медвежьему рынку.

После мирового финансового кризиса 2008 года индекс упал почти на 60%. Крах COVID-19 в марте 2020 года привел к падению индекса почти на 40%, а Bitcoin потерял 60% своей стоимости. Совсем недавно, в 2022 году, индекс скорректировался на 25%, Bitcoin достиг дна через месяц, упав еще на 25% до циклического минимума в $15 000. Исторически 10%-ные коррекции в S&P 500 были обычным явлением. Между тем, Bitcoin упал на 30% от своего исторического максимума во время этой коррекции. Если посмотреть на прошлые коррекции бычьего рынка, то такие падения являются нормальным явлением, причем последняя 30%-ная коррекция произошла в августе 2024 года во время разворота керри-трейда иены.

В ноябре 2024 года ликвидаторы 3AC внесли поправки в свое требование после обнаружения новых доказательств, свидетельствующих о том, что FTX ликвидировала активы 3AC на сумму $1,53 млрд всего за две недели до того, как хедж-фонд начал собственную процедуру ликвидации два года назад. Они утверждали, что ликвидация FTX средств 3AC была проведена для удовлетворения обязательства перед FTX в размере $1,3 млрд, обязательства, которое, по утверждению 3AC, не было достаточно обосновано. Постановление позволяет 3AC претендовать на значительно большую часть оставшихся активов FTX, что потенциально может изменить порядок выплат кредиторам. FTX, которая начала распределять средства среди кредиторов в феврале 2025 года, заявила, что расширенный иск должен был поступить раньше, утверждая, что это обременит других кредиторов и усложнит ее план реорганизации. Однако суд постановил, что задержка 3AC была оправдана, учитывая, что ликвидаторы раскрыли полную сумму своего иска только в середине 2024 года из-за отсутствия финансовых отчетов у FTX и отсутствия сотрудничества со стороны основателей 3AC Чжу Су и Кайла Дэвиса. В настоящее время Банкман-Фрид подает апелляцию на свое уголовное осуждение и 25-летний тюремный срок. После краха 3AC Су был задержан в Сингапуре и приговорен к четырем месяцам тюрьмы за отказ сотрудничать с ликвидаторами 3AC. Дэвису не были предъявлены никакие обвинения, связанные с крахом хедж-фонда. С решением суда ликвидаторы 3AC теперь имеют значительно большую позицию в процедуре банкротства FTX., что вызывает вопросы о том, как расширенный иск повлияет на распределения другим кредиторам.</p></b><br/><br/></div>

See all newsletters Sign me up By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to our terms of use and privacy policy . The project's raise of $590 million would put it in the top-10 list of token raises, according to data curated by ICODrops. To date, the largest token sale is EOS, which raised $4.21 billion. EOS is a blockchain platform developed by Block.one, which later founded Bullish, CoinDesk's owner. On stage at Consensus 2025 in Hong Kong, WLFI co-founder Zak Folkman credited Tron's Justin Sun with the success of the project's token sale. "When we were launching this project, it was a very heated time," Folkman said during Consensus. This meant that traditional crypto VCs would not touch the token. Rules around WLFI's token sale mean that the token was only available to accredited investors and can't be transferred or publicly sold on exchanges.

The S&P 500 has now entered correction territory, defined as a 10% decline from its all-time high. But is it time to panic? In 2019, amid bitcoin’s bear market, the S&P 500 declined by 20%, bitcoin fell as much as 85% from its all-time high. The covid-19 crash in March 2020 saw the index drop almost 40% with bitcoin shedding 60% of its value. Most recently in 2022, the index corrected by 25%, bitcoin bottomed out one month later after dropping by a further 25% to a cycle low of $15,000. Historically, 10% corrections in the S&P 500 have been common. Meanwhile, bitcoin has dropped 30% from its all-time high during this correction. Looking at past bull market corrections, such declines are a normal occurrence, with the most recent 30% correction happening in August 2024 during the yen carry trade unwind.

Sellers of risk assets are taking a breather on Friday, with crypto markets posting sizable gains along with U.S. stocks after a week of lame price action.

"To see the market bouncing off these recent lows is most likely a combination of the macro news around risk assets (inflation/tariffs) and a sign that a more stable base for cryptocurrencies is coming into place given the drawdowns from the top just months ago,” Paul Howard, senior director of crypto trading firm Wincent, said in a Telegram note. Some $2.6 billion in leveraged crypto derivatives positions have been liquidated over the past 7 days, predominantly longs, Howard pointed out, leaving the market on a healthier footing with flushing excessive leverage. Today's bounce also propelled BTC back above its 200-day moving average after dipping below that trendline for the first time since last August's crypto correction. The 200-day moving average is a widely-used benchmark for traders and investors to gauge long-term trends for asset prices, often serving as support for prices to bounce in a bull market, while losing the level providing a risk-off or bear market signal. Otherwise, confirming the moving average as resistance could foreshadow a deeper pullback. Well-followed cross-asset trader Bob Loukas noted that bitcoin and stocks have more room to run "at least for a while," bouncing from oversold levels. "Feels like should be close to end of panic, for now at least, and spend at least a few weeks back recovering," he said earlier this week.
