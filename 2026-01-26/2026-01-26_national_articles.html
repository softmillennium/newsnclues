                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Border czar to Minnesota: Trump earlier said he is sending Tom Homan to the state, following the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti in an encounter Saturday with federal agents. Read CNN's fact check and watch analysis of videos from several angles. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration could pull back on the deployment of US Customs and Border Protection in Minnesota if state officials cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on the ground. President Donald Trump has called for more cooperation from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, including that they “turn over” all undocumented immigrants incarcerated in the state to federal authorities. Walz and Mayor Frey implement these commonsense cooperative measures, CBP will no longer be needed to support ICE on the ground in Minnesota,” Leavitt said during today's White House press briefing. “ICE and local law enforcement will peacefully work together as they are effectively doing in so many other states and jurisdictions to remove violent criminals from American neighborhoods across the country,” she added. Remember: A surge of federal immigration officers in Minnesota has left the Midwestern state on edge for weeks, with Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in an encounter with Border Patrol officers marking the second time a US citizen has been fatally shot by federal law enforcement this month. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called President Donald Trump a strong supporter of Americans' Second Amendment rights, days after Trump and other officials questioned why Alex Pretti was carrying a firearm prior to being fatally shot by federal agents. “There has been no greater supporter or defender of the right to bear arms than President Donald J. Trump,” she said during a White House press briefing. Still, Leavitt qualified her statement by cautioning that “Americans do not have a right to impede lawful immigration enforcement operations,” and blamed Pretti for inviting the altercation that led to his death. “And again, that's unfortunately what took place on Saturday.” FBI Director Kash Patel also sought to shift blame on Sunday, saying in an interview that “you cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.” Trump said today he is sending Tom Homan to Minnesota this evening, following Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti. Meanwhile, top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino will “continue to lead” the agency nationwide, Leavitt said. The White House is tamping down any appearance of conflict between Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan, as CNN reports they have at times been at odds. US officials told CNN the two have generally not spoken to each other in recent months. Homan is doing an exceptional job and he has been working with Secretary Noem and President Trump over the course of the last year. The move has been met with relief from some Homeland Security officials who have been waiting for Homan to weigh in, given his vast experience in federal law enforcement. “I think it kind of goes without saying that we are in shockingly unusual times,” Menendez said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she has not heard President Donald Trump commit to releasing the federal agents' body camera footage from the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minnesota. Leavitt was asked by CNN's Alayna Treene whether ICE agents should wear body cameras so the footage could be used to settle disputed accounts of activity on the ground. “Well, that's a policy question that I know the policy folks in the building are having with members on Capitol Hill, and I'll leave it to them and the president to make that decision,” Leavitt said. Some context: CNN was first to report that at least two officers involved in the Saturday incident were wearing body cameras, which are part of the internal review. Federal agencies like ICE aren't required to wear body cameras, thanks to a 2025 executive order by Trump rescinding a Biden-era policy. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Donald Trump has not characterized Alex Pretti as a “domestic terrorist,” despite claims made by members of his administration. “I have not heard the president characterize Mr. Pretti in that way. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller have both likened Pretti, who as fatally shot in an encounter Saturday with federal agents, to a domestic terrorist. When pushed again on claims from the administration and whether Miller will apologize for his comments against Pretti, Leavitt said the investigation is underway. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt avoided answering when asked why Trump administration officials rushed to issue unfounded claims in the hours after Alex Pretti was shot and before an investigation had taken place. “Well, look, this has obviously been a very fluid and fast-moving situation throughout the weekend,” Leavitt told reporters during a White House news briefing. Leavitt distinguished President Donald Trump's mindset on the shooting from statements made by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and top White House aide Stephen Miller, who called Pretti a “domestic terrorist.” “As for President Trump, whom I speak for, he has said that he wants to let the investigation continue and let the facts lead in this case,” Leavitt said. “Americans overwhelmingly want exactly what President Trump is delivering: strong borders and strict immigration enforcement against the worst illegal aliens,” she said during a White House press briefing, adding that “polling shows huge support for this exact thing.” Leavitt's defense of the administration's approach came two days after a federal agent fatally shot Pretti, prompting calls from both sides of the aisle for officials to reevaluate their enforcement presence in Minneapolis. The administration's aggressive tactics in Minnesota and other states over the last several months have weighed on voters' views of President Donald Trump's immigration policy, according to a range of polling, including rising disapproval of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's tactics even among those who support Trump's handling of the southern border. Leavitt on Monday blamed state and local officials for failing to help with the deportation efforts, vowing that Trump “will never back down from his promise to deport violent criminal illegal aliens.” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the FBI and Department of Homeland Security are actively conducting investigations into the shooting of Alex Pretti. “As President Trump said yesterday, the administration is reviewing everything with respect to the shooting, and we will let that investigation play out,” Leavitt said. However, top Cabinet and White House officials on Saturday have mad declarative statements about Pretti, including White House chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, who called him a “domestic terrorist.” Investigators have interviewed the immigration agents involved in Saturday's shooting of Alex Pretti, according to a federal law enforcement source. Investigators are also reviewing footage from several officers involved in the incident that led to the fatal shooting, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said Monday. CNN was first to report that at least two officers involved in the incident were wearing body cameras, which are part of the internal review. The investigation is being led by the Department's Homeland Security Investigations agency, while local officials in Minnesota are conducting their own independent investigation. The comments came shortly after President Donald Trump wrote on social media that he had a “very good call” with Walz, saying they're “on a similar wavelength.” “This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota,” Leavitt said during Monday's press briefing. Walz and the mayor, Jacob Frey, and other elected Democrats were spreading lies about federal law enforcement officers who are risking their lives daily to remove the worst criminal illegal aliens from our streets.” Ahead of Friday's government funding deadline, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is demanding Senate Majority Leader John Thune separate the Department of Homeland Security funding bill from the other five appropriations bills in the package. In a statement, Schumer said, “If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.” You said when it started,” US District Court Judge Katherine Menendez said during a court hearing in Minnesota on the matter today. The judge's frustration came after a Department of Justice attorney was unable to say how many officers have been deployed to the Twin Cities under Operation Metro Surge. “Hundreds and hundreds of people being arrested (in the surge) have never been in jail, so that change wouldn't have changed anything,” Menendez said. “Here we have executive action that isn't on paper; it's in the street,” Menendez said. “But that can't put it beyond the reach of consideration.” Republican lawmakers are privately expressing relief that border czar Tom Homan will be taking over leadership of the immigration operations in Minnesota, sources told CNN. Homan is longtime border official with decades of law enforcement experience. While Homan has pushed for some of the Trump administration's most controversial immigration-related policies, allies and advisers view him as being “a grown-up,” one source said. Senate Majority Leader John Thune publicly praised the president's decision Monday, calling Homan's assignment a “positive development.” “This is a positive development — one that I hope leads to turning down the temperature and restoring order in Minnesota,” the Republican leader wrote on X. “I encourage local officials in Minnesota to work with the administration to keep communities safe and continue the important work of enforcing our laws and getting dangerous criminals off of America's streets.” On the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota over the weekend, Republican allies and advisers told CNN no one should be getting ahead of an investigation. “I think everyone wants a transparent and independent investigation,” one lawmaker said. “It seems the White House is getting that message, or at least I hope they are.” Two Italian journalists for state broadcaster RAI posted video of an altercation they had with ICE agents while reporting in Minneapolis over the weekend. Journalist Laura Cappon and filmmaker Daniele Babbo were riding alongside activists who were following ICE vehicles, when their own car was surrounded by ICE vehicles, according to the video posted on social media for RAI's “In Mezz'Ora” program. Cappon can then be heard speaking in Italian saying there is one ICE vehicle in front of them and another behind them. The incident has caused backlash in Italy, with opposition leaders calling on Italian Prime Minsiter Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani to formally protest the incident. A spokesperson for the RAI program told CNN the video speaks for itself and did not rule out filing a formal complaint. Tim Walz said President Donald Trump agreed to consider reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and pledged to talk to his Department of Homeland Security about ensuring state officials can investigate Saturday's fatal shooting. Walz said Trump “also agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals.” Trump has called for more cooperation from Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, including that they “turn over” all undocumented immigrants incarcerated in the state to federal authorities. “The Governor reminded President Trump that the Minnesota Department of Corrections already honors federal detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody isn't a U.S. citizen,” Walz's office said. Members of the Minnesota National Guard handed out coffee, hot chocolate, donuts and hand warmers to protesters and others outside the Whipple Federal Building in frigid Minneapolis temperatures Sunday. A guardsman on the scene told CNN affiliate WCCO that the hospitality was their “demonstration of safety and security and that they're here to help.” The Whipple Federal Building, where many people are temporarily detained after being taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, has become a site of steady crowds and demonstrations against the immigration enforcement blitz in Minnesota. “If you work with us, we will probably need less resources, less boots on the ground,” Department of Justice attorney Brantley Mayers said during a federal court hearing in Minnesota this morning. Today's hearing — which still is underway — relates to a lawsuit in which Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seek an end to Operation Metro Surge, the federal government's influx of immigration officers into the Minneapolis area. Judge Katherine Menendez asked if there was any legal boundary to the number of federal officers that could be sent to the state. “I have a hard time (believing) there is a judicially administrable line as to when too many boots on the ground is too many,” Mayers responded. Menendez spoke skeptically about President Trump's online January 13 statement that the state would get a “day of reckoning & retribution,” but Mayers said the president's threats don't affect his power. Tim Walz called him “with the request to work together with respect to Minnesota” and that he facilitated a call between Walz and border czar Tom Homan, who the president is sending to the state. “It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, striking a notably conciliatory tone, given how he and other administration officials have repeatedly attacked Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future,” Trump said, adding that Walz is “happy” Homan is going to Minnesota. Trump emphasized “tremendous SUCCESS” with federal coordination in other cities, ending on an optimistic note: “Both Governor Walz and I want to make it better!” CNN has reached out to Walz's office for comment on the call. Just yesterday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Walz of spreading “malicious lies about federal law enforcement officers,” “placing targets” on their backs and encouraging chaos.</p>

Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay faced criticism for his decision-making in the NFC Championship loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday night. McVay took a timeout before Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold found Cooper Kupp to convert a third down with 3:20 left. But after a discussion with officials, McVay didn't challenge the play. But the team couldn't muster up a comeback. McVay also faced scrutiny for his decision to have the team go for it on fourth down on their first drive of the fourth quarter. Matthew Stafford led the team on a 14-play, 84-yard drive that ended with a turnover on downs. If Los Angeles took the points, it would have only been a one-point game. Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay reacts as players warm up before the NFC Championship NFL football game against the Seattle Seahawks, Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026, in Seattle. "There are a lot of people that are gonna say, ‘Analytics,' and ESPN analytics will say, ‘Go.' Understand how it goes," ESPN analyst Booger McFarland said on "NFL Primetime." Now, you put the pressure back on Seattle's offense. "Now, if you're Seattle's offense, if you go three-and-out and you give the ball back, we don't need to drive for a touchdown. We got a kicker that can kick a 50-yarder and we're on turf so we don't have to worry about the footing. McFarland added, "You can win with field goals." The ESPN analyst was far from the only one who questioned McVay's play calls. McVay was extremely disappointed with the result and said he firmly believed his team would be celebrating at Lumen Field. Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay speaks during a news conference after the NFC Championship NFL football game against the Seattle Seahawks, Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026, in Seattle. I think the finality of all of it when you don't allow yourself to even think about anything other than just advancing, I felt like we were going to be the team on that podium and we weren't, and you give Seattle the credit, but I love this group and I'm never really short on words, and I am right now," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Thousands of anti-ICE protesters marched through Minneapolis on Sunday to voice their anger at the fatal shooting of a local man a day earlier. “Shut it down,” they chanted, as many waved signs calling for justice for 37-year-old Alex Pretti who was shoot and killed by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday morning. A federal judge is hearing arguments on whether she should at least temporarily halt the immigration crackdown in Minnesota that has led to the fatal shootings of two people by government officers. The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Menendez said if “there were a burner in front of the front burner” this issue would be on it for her and she plans to issue a written opinion, though didn't specify when. A Monday morning call between President Donald Trump and Minnesota Gov. Trump agreed to talk to the Department of Homeland Security about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, Walz' office said, and also agreed to look into either reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota or working with the state “in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals.” He said the people the administration is seeking “are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession” and Walz “very respectfully, understood that.” More than 3,000 federal immigration officers are part of the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, a Department of Justice attorney told a federal judge on Monday. Brantley Mayers, counsel to the DOJ's assistant attorney general, told U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez that at least 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and at least 1,000 Customs and Border Patrol officers were part of the operation, and that he would provide her with an exact number later. Two Minnesota residents have been shot and killed by immigration officials since the crackdown began. Menendez asked Mayers why so many officers were needed. Mayers said it had to do with complications surrounding how immigration officers typically stage for enforcement operations, gathering in parking lots. Twin Cities officials have taken steps to prohibit city-owned parking lots and garages from being used in immigration enforcement operations. Chicago officials took similar steps after immigration crackdowns in that city last year. “I failed to view the DHS funding vote as a referendum on the illegal and immoral conduct of ICE in Minneapolis,” Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., posted on social media. The congressman added that the “senseless and tragic murder of Alex Pretti underscores what happens when untrained federal agents operate without accountability” and called on President Donald Trump to end ICE's enhanced enforcement operation in Minnesota. No, Mayers said — the goal is to enforce federal law. The judge also expressed skepticism about a letter recently sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Gov. All three requests are the subject of litigation, she noted. Tim Walz speaks during a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing, June 12, 2025, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington. FILE - President Donald Trump speaks before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House, Jan. 20, 2026, in Washington. Trump said the people the administration is seeking “are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession” and Walz “very respectfully, understood that.” “He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!” Trump wrote in a social media post which was notable for its warm and collaborative tone toward Minnesota's governor, whom Trump frequently derides. “If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don't think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said. The Justice Department's attorneys were set to speak later Monday. FILE - Former Vice President Mike Pence, waits outside the funeral services for former Vice President Dick Cheney at the Washington National Cathedral, Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025, in Washington. “The images of this incident are deeply troubling and a full and transparent investigation of this officer involved shooting must take place immediately,” the Republican who served during President Trump's first term wrote on X. He also said he was praying for Alex Pretti's family as well as Minnesota citizens and state and federal law enforcement officers. Pence is one of a growing number of Republicans to press for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics in Minnesota. A woman holds a sign memorializing Renee Good as activists protest outside an ICE facility in Pflugerville, Texas, requesting the organization to leave the county, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026, in solidarity with nationwide protests after the killing of U.S. citizen Renee Good by ICE agents in Minneapolis on Wednesday. The attorney representing the family of Renee Good, who was fatally shot by a federal immigration officer earlier this month in Minneapolis, said in a statement that it was “terrifying, deeply disturbing, and heartbreaking” that another person had died. “It is time for a hard reset,” attorney Antonio Romanucci said in the statement released Sunday. We call for a complete and immediate end to the ICE invasion of this beautiful American city.” Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Chris Madel, a Minneapolis attorney who provided legal support to the ICE agent who shot and killed Renee Good, ended his GOP campaign in a surprise video announcement Monday. He was among a large group of candidates seeking to replace Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who dropped his reelection bid earlier this month. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announces issuing “investigative subpoenas” to Orange County employees during a press conference in Orlando, Fla., on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. DeSantis pointed to his administration's signing of cooperative agreements with Homeland Security agencies when it comes to detaining people in the U.S. illegally as a model for other states. As he has before, DeSantis noted that state and local law enforcement agencies had detained nearly 20,000 people in the U.S. illegally in the past year. Following the shooting, several Republican elected officials have questioned President Trump's hard-line immigration crackdown in Minnesota, but DeSantis was not among them. Homan will report directly to Trump, the president said in a social media post, adding that Homan is “tough but fair.” “He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there,” Trump said Monday morning. Citizenship and Immigration Services, saying “my top priority remains keeping Americans safe.” The shooting of Pretti prompted some fellow Republicans to question Trump's hard-line immigration crackdown, but the president on Sunday night continued to blame Democratic officials. After remaining relatively quiet on Sunday, the Republican president in two lengthy social media posts said that Democrats had encouraged people to obstruct law enforcement operations. He also called on officials in Minnesota to work with immigration officers and “turn over” people who were in the U.S. illegally. “Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social media network. Trump's refusal to back away from his pledge to carry out the largest deportation program in history and the surge of immigration officers to heavily Democratic cities came as more Republicans began calling for a deeper investigation and expressing unease with some of the administration's tactics. Leaders of law enforcement organizations expressed alarm Sunday over the latest deadly shooting by federal officers in Minneapolis while use-of-force experts criticized the Trump administration's justification of the killing, saying bystander footage contradicted its narrative of what prompted it. In a bid to ease tensions, the International Association of Chiefs of Police called on the White House to convene discussions “as soon as practicable” among federal, state and local law enforcement. While questions remained about the latest confrontation, use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that bystander video undermined federal authorities' claim that Pretti “approached” a group of lawmen with a firearm and that a Border Patrol officer opened fire “defensively.” There has been no evidence made public, they said, that supports a claim by Border Patrol senior official Greg Bovino that Pretti, who had a permit to carry a concealed handgun, intended to “massacre law enforcement.” The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. Saturday's shooting by a Border Patrol officer of Alex Pretti has only added urgency to the case. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he plans to personally attend. This item has been corrected to show the judges' first name is Katherine, not Kathleen. Six of the 12 annual spending bills for the current budget year have been signed into law by President Donald Trump. Six more are awaiting action in the Senate, despite a revolt from House Democrats and mounting calls for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's impeachment. If senators fail to act by midnight Friday, funding for Homeland Security and the other agencies covered under the six bills will lapse. That support was already in question after Renee Good, a mother of three, was fatally shot and killed earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis. But the fatal shooting Saturday of Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, quickly prompted Democrats to take a more forceful stand.</p>

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by LSEG. Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins reports on the Trump administration's expansion of immigration enforcement operations into Maine on ‘Special Report.' As anti-ICE protests continue to erupt across the country, a new Maine law restricting cooperation between state law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is set to take effect after Democratic Gov. Janet Mills declined to veto or delay the measure, drawing renewed criticism over her progressive record as she runs for Senate. The law, passed by Maine's Democrat-controlled legislature late last year, will soon take effect after the current legislative session ends and bars state and local law enforcement from assisting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a wide range of civil immigration matters. Even though the law has not officially taken effect, Mills, who declined to veto or sign the law, which will take effect without her signature, has already ordered Maine State Police to begin enforcing its provisions, according to a report from the Portland Press Herald. ICE's federal law enforcement officers take a suspect into custody. Mills, who is running for Senate in the Democratic primary to unseat moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins, has recently called ICE "secret police" and said their "reckless actions" have "no place here." As ICE ramps up activity in Maine, including over 50 arrests in one day last week, Republicans in the state have pushed back against the ICE rhetoric coming from Mills. "Let me be very clear: ICE agents are federal law enforcement officers," Assistant House Republican Leader Katrina Smith said last week. And they show up to work knowing that rhetoric alone can make them a target. Mills released a statement on Saturday, shortly after federal immigration agents shot and killed an armed man in Minneapolis, demanding a meeting with President Trump and for him to remove ICE from Maine. The immigration law is the latest in a series of high-profile decisions that critics say underscore Mills' liberal record as Maine prepares for her State of the State address later this month. Since taking office, Mills has expanded eligibility for MaineCare, the state's Medicaid program, to include non-citizens regardless of immigration status. The policy allows taxpayer-funded health care for non-citizen children and pregnant individuals, a move Republicans say has driven up costs for working Mainers. State records show Maine has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on health care for individual illegal immigrants in recent years. MaineWire reported last month on a photo from a Maine city bus advertising how MaineCare is now being offered to "pregnant people and children under 21, with or without proof of citizenship" which prompted criticism of Mills from the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Mills has also repeatedly clashed with Trump, most notably over transgender policies. Last year, she publicly confronted the president over federal funding threats tied to allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports, vowing to sue the administration if funding was withheld. Her administration has signed and defended a slate of laws expanding access to gender-affirming care, including protections for minors to receive certain treatments even if parents object, mandates requiring insurance coverage for such care, and measures shielding providers from out-of-state legal action. On abortion, Mills has signed legislation expanding who can perform abortions, removed criminal penalties tied to reproductive care, and strengthened protections for providers and patients traveling to Maine from other states. Ultimately, the NRSC told Fox News Digital it believes Mills is more focused on a "progressive agenda" than she is on results for the state. "Janet Mills has spent her time as Governor expanding transgender rights, offering taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens, and combating the Trump administration every chance she gets," NRSC Regional Press Secretary Samantha Cantrell told Fox News Digital. "Mainers deserve a Senator who is focused on delivering real results, not Janet Mills who is more concerned with pushing her progressive agenda on Maine."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Border czar to Minnesota: Trump earlier said he is sending Tom Homan to the state, following the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti in an encounter Saturday with federal agents. Republican lawmakers are privately expressing relief that border czar Tom Homan will be taking over leadership of the immigration operations in Minnesota, sources told CNN. He's gets it,” one Republican lawmaker told CNN, saying that Homan understood the system and how to do enforcement operations the “correct way.” Homan is longtime border official with decades of law enforcement experience. While Homan has pushed for some of the Trump administration's most controversial immigration-related policies, allies and advisers view him as being “a grown up,” one source said. On the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota over the weekend, Republican allies and advisers told CNN that no one should be getting ahead of an investigation. “I think everyone wants a transparent and independent investigation,” one lawmaker said. “It seems the White House is getting that message, or at least I hope they are.” Walz said Trump “also agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals.” Trump has called for more cooperation from Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, including that they “turn over” all undocumented immigrants incarcerated in the state to federal authorities. “The Governor reminded President Trump that the Minnesota Department of Corrections already honors federal detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody isn't a U.S. citizen,” Walz's office said. Members of the Minnesota National Guard handed out coffee, hot chocolate, donuts and hand warmers to protesters and others outside the Whipple Federal Building in frigid Minneapolis temperatures Sunday. A guardsman on the scene told CNN affiliate WCCO that the hospitality was their “demonstration of safety and security and that they're here to help.” The Whipple Federal Building, where many people are temporarily detained after being taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, has become a site of steady crowds and demonstrations against the immigration enforcement blitz in Minnesota. “If you work with us, we will probably need less resources, less boots on the ground,” Department of Justice attorney Brantley Mayers said during a federal court hearing in Minnesota this morning. Today's hearing — which still is underway — relates to a lawsuit in which Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seek an end to Operation Metro Surge, the federal government's influx of immigration officers into the Minneapolis area. Judge Katherine Menendez asked if there was any legal boundary to the number of federal officers that could be sent to the state. “I have a hard time (believing) there is a judicially administrable line as to when too many boots on the ground is too many,” Mayers responded. Menendez spoke skeptically about President Trump's online January 13 statement that the state would get a “day of reckoning & retribution,” but Mayers said the president's threats don't affect his power. Tim Walz called him “with the request to work together with respect to Minnesota” and that he facilitated a call between Walz and border czar Tom Homan, who the president is sending to the state. “It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, striking a notably conciliatory tone, given how he and other administration officials have repeatedly attacked Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future,” Trump said, adding that Walz is “happy” Homan is going to Minnesota. Trump emphasized “tremendous SUCCESS” with federal coordination in other cities, ending on an optimistic note: “Both Governor Walz and I want to make it better!” CNN has reached out to Walz's office for comment on the call. Just yesterday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Walz of spreading “malicious lies about federal law enforcement officers,” “placing targets” on their backs and encouraging chaos. I have long been critical of ICE's unlawful behavior and I must do a better job demonstrating that,” Suozzi said in a statement on Monday. Suozzi, who represents a swing district in New York, was one of seven Democrats who crossed party lines to back the bill last Thursday, sending it to the Senate – along with other bills to fund the government – for consideration. “The senseless and tragic murder of Alex Pretti underscores what happens when untrained federal agents operate without accountability. President Trump must immediately end ‘Operation Metro Surge' and ICE's occupation of Minneapolis that has sown chaos, led to tragedy, and undermined experienced local law enforcement,” Suozzi said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday evening that his caucus would not pass a bill to fund a large portion of the government, including DHS, unless restrictions are placed on immigration enforcement, increasing the likelihood of a partial government shutdown Friday at midnight. During an opening exchange with attorneys that lasted well over an hour, a federal judge said today she is reluctant to decide the merits of the Trump administration's immigration policy as the state of Minnesota asks her to roll back Operation Metro Surge. “The state has one set of values around immigration enforcement … the federal government has a different set of values captured in its enforcement,” Judge Katherine Menendez, a Biden appointee, said. “We're at risk of asking me to decide who's right here.” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said he was not asking the judge to make a judgment on policy, but cited a Truth Social post from President Trump to assert the administration has clearly gone too far. “He said, ‘Minnesota, your day of retribution is here.' It's crazy!” Carter said, emphatically raising his hands in the air. When Menendez asked how the state wanted Operation Metro Surge to be changed, Carter replied, “Just end it. The White House border czar who President Donald Trump is deploying to Minnesota following the fatal shooting of two American citizens is a longtime border official who has pushed for some of the Trump administration's most controversial immigration-related policies. Trump said today he was sending Tom Homan to Minnesota this evening, following Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti. The incident has inflamed tensions and drawn bipartisan criticism for the Department of Homeland Security's portrayal — without evidence — of Pretti as a terrorist who wanted to massacre law enforcement. He said at a public event in September 2017 that his agency would arrest undocumented people who came forward to care for the children, which previous administrations had avoided. He virulently opposes “sanctuary city” policies that restrict local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration efforts. A person familiar with the operation had told CNN that Homan accepted the cash as part of a sting operation, and that Homan was being investigated for potential bribery and other crimes after he agreed to help the undercover agents secure government contracts. A White House official said Monday that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will remain in her role leading the department and retains the confidence and trust of President Donald Trump. The assertion came soon after Trump announced he was dispatching veteran ICE official Tom Homan to lead operations in Minnesota. The move suggested he was sidelining top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, whose heavy handed enforcement style had Noem's backing, even as it drew criticism. “Tom Homan is uniquely positioned to drop everything and focus solely on Minnesota to solve the problems that have been created by a lack of cooperation from state and local officials,” the official added. Homan has generally sought to focus enforcement on public safety and national security threats, as well as so-called “collaterals,” meaning undocumented immigrants that may be in the vicinity of a targeted operation. And Homan and Noem have at time been at odds; the two have generally not spoken to each other in recent months, according to US officials. On Friday, no one was anticipating a government shutdown. By Saturday night, it became clear that there may be little way to avoid one. Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to coalesce around a single set of demands, but a source familiar with those talks said conversations about what kinds of reforms Democrats will seek as it pertains to DHS are still ongoing. Democratic leaders are still soliciting suggestions and ideas from their members. Nothing is at all finalized, however, and a quick compromise between the parties on changes to ICE would be difficult. Operation Metro Surge is not an effort to ensure the safety of people in Minnesota, the state attorney general's office argued in federal court this morning, but is rather an attempt to force the state into cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a way that courts have said the federal government can't require. “This administration is not content with the rule of law,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said during the hearing, which still is underway. “They are not content with letting the courts work this stuff out. During legal arguments — which so far have lasted nearly an hour -— state attorneys said that a letter from US Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Gov. And you'd better pray I don't alter the bargain anymore,'” Carter said. A group of federal government health care workers said in a letter to the US Senate that Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations pose “a clear threat to the health and safety of our communities,” and called on Congress to vote against funding for the Department of Homeland Security. Democrats have said they will reject a bill to fund DHS over the shooting, raising the possibility of a partial government shutdown. It continues: “ICE now poses a clear threat to the health and safety of our communities. Families are skipping medical appointments, going without food, and keeping their children out of school for fear of abduction, deportation without due process, or violent assault. U.S. citizens also fear for their safety and well-being when ICE or CBP are present.” A federal judge said in court this morning she was “having a hard time” determining how she would have the authority to roll back Operation Metro Surge as requested by the state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities. “I think it kind of goes without saying that we are in shockingly unusual times,” District Court Judge Katherine Menendez said during today's hearing. Standing at a table alongside his boss, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter acknowledged it is difficult for the state to cite a legal precedent for the order they seek. “We have never had a federal government amass what is essentially an army of 3,000 to 4,000 masked, heavily armed federal agents and sent them into a state and basically stir the pot.” “Since we filed (this lawsuit) on January 12, another person has been shot dead in broad daylight by DHS agents,” Middlecamp said, referring to Saturday's fatal shooting of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. Citing a letter sent to state leaders by US Attorney General Pam Bondi — which called on the state to repeal so-called sanctuary policies and to share Medicaid, food assistance and voter data with the federal government — Middlecamp accused the government of using Operation Metro Surge as a bargaining chip for political disputes. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that no one is interpreting the Trump administration's labeling of Alex Pretti's actions as domestic terrorism by the legal definition, despite Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem saying exactly that. “I don't think anybody thinks that they were comparing what happened on Saturday to the legal definition of domestic terrorism. What we saw was a very violent altercation, and we — I am not going to prejudge the facts,” Blanche said on “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning. Yet on Saturday, Noem directly compared Pretti's actions to the legal definition of domestic terrorism. “When you perpetuate violence against a government because of ideological reasons and for reasons to resist and perpetuate violence, that is the definition of domestic terrorism. This individual, who came with weapons and ammunition to stop a law enforcement operation of federal law enforcement officers, committed an act of domestic terrorism. Just hours after the shooting, top White House aide Stephen Miller called Alex Pretti a “domestic terrorist” who “tried to assassinate federal law endorsement.” Blanche's comments on Fox today also contradict what he said earlier in the interview, urging caution as an investigation plays out. “We always investigate any conduct like this, any shooting like this,” he said, “We'll get to the bottom of everything that happened. Immigration agents have opened fire in 19 incidents since the Trump administration began its immigration crackdown in June 2025, according to a newly updated analysis from The Trace, a nonprofit journalism organization that focuses on gun violence. A federal court hearing in Minnesota on a lawsuit to end Operation Metro Surge, the federal government's surge of immigration officers into the Minneapolis area, has begun. They also want the judge to place several limits on federal officers who remain in the state, including prohibiting them from concealing their identities with masks and approaching suspects based only on “race, ethnicity, accented speech, or proximity to predominantly Immigrant-serving businesses or cultural centers.” The move has been met with relief from some Homeland Security officials who have been waiting for Homan, the White House border czar, to weigh in, given his vast experience in federal law enforcement. Bovino's enforcement style has been backed by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. But Homan has generally taken a more stringent approach to immigration enforcement — wanting to focus on public safety and national security threats, as well as so-called “collaterals,” meaning undocumented immigrants that may be in the vicinity of a targeted operation. While Homan's publicly been in line with the Trump administration, there has been infighting between factions who back him and those who back Noem. In a post on X Monday, Noem called Homan going to Minneapolis “good news,” saying: “I have worked closely with Tom over the last year and he has been a major asset to our team— his experience and insight will help us in our wide-scale fraud investigations, which have robbed Americans, and will help us to remove even more public safety threats and violent criminal illegal aliens off the of streets of Minneapolis.” It was not immediately clear how Bovino's role would change going forward. President Donald Trump sending his Border Czar Tom Homan to Minnesota, “is just escalating tensions,” Minneapolis City Council member Soren Stevenson said. “They are losing the battle in people's minds,” Stevenson told CNN's Sara Sidner. “They're losing this narrative battle, and so he's sending in his top guard. And really, it's escalating, because we just want to be left alone,” he added. Passing a bill to issue further government funding to the Department of Homeland Security after Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis is something American people “cannot stand for,” US Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-New York, said today. “We should not be passing any money to DHS so they can continue the kind of harassment and execution, as we saw, by ICE, of American citizens,” Meeks told John Berman on “CNN News Central.” Meeks previously voted against the bill when it was brought to the House of Representatives, but it passed with some Democratic support. “What we're hearing is the same kind of rhetoric that you hear from totalitarian governments, like when you hear the ayatollah tell peaceful protesters they can't protest,” he said. “Here, you have an individual with a camera … and he is now dead.Shot at 10 times. “And the Trump administration is saying that he was violently going after police officers, denying the American people what they can see with their own eyes.”</p>

Authorities in upstate South Carolina have arrested the 19-year-old grandson of a retired couple found slain in their home earlier this month, charging him with two counts of murder in a case that has shaken a small rural community. The Oconee County Sheriff's Office said Levi Kevin Jones was taken into custody late Friday and charged in connection with the deaths of Larry Moore, 76, and Sandra Moore, 75, who were discovered inside their residence on Cromer Moore Road near Westminster on Jan. 15. Jones is also charged with two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, according to arrest warrants obtained by Fox News Digital. He remains in custody pending a bond hearing. The couple was found after a family member requested a welfare check when repeated attempts to reach them were unsuccessful. According to the Oconee County Coroner's Office, Larry Moore died from multiple stabbing injuries, while Sandra Moore died from manual strangulation. Autopsies were conducted the following day. Arrest warrants allege Jones stabbed his grandfather multiple times in the torso and neck and strangled his grandmother, cutting off her airway and blood flow. Authorities said a knife was used during the attack. Authorities have not provided a motive for the attack. The Oconee County Sheriff's Office said the couple's grandson, Levi Kevin Jones, is charged with two counts of murder in the case, as well as two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. They were also active members of Calvary Church, where friends described them as regular attendees. "They were always there," Stacy Brooks, who attended church, told Fox News Digital. The Oconee County Coroner's Office, which assisted in the investigation into the deaths of Larry and Sandra Moore, is shown in an exterior view. Brooks said the killings have been difficult for residents of the small upstate South Carolina town to process. "This is a close community, and something like this just doesn't happen often," she said.

An Arkansas teenager is behind bars and another man is in the hospital with serious injuries after video of a brutal fight at a local gas station went viral last weekend. Officers with the Hot Springs Police Department responded to a Circle K gas station on Malvern Avenue in Hot Springs – located approximately 55 miles from Little Rock – around 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 17, according to FOX 16. After arriving on scene, authorities located 20-year-old Noah Epperson unconscious and suffering from multiple injuries, the outlet reported. Friends of Epperson reportedly told police that their group subsequently left the party and arrived at a nearby Circle K gas station when the second group allegedly followed. A viral fight reportedly broke out at a Circle K gas station in Hot Springs, Arkansas, last week, in which 20-year-old Noah Epperson was knocked unconscious after suffering multiple serious injuries. A second fight reportedly broke out, with viral video showing Epperson being punched in the face by multiple alleged assailants and having his head stomped on. Immediately following the brawl, bystanders began to leave, and local police were called to the scene by a concerned citizen who believed an individual had either been hurt or killed. Epperson was transported to a hospital, where he was admitted into intensive care with a brain bleed, skull fracture and jaw fracture, according to a GoFundMe created to cover his medical bills. Cooper Camferdam, 18, is charged with felony first-degree battery stemming from a viral brawl in which 20-year-old Noah Epperson was seriously injured at a Circle K gas station in Hot Springs, Arkansas, on Saturday, Jan. 17, 2026. Two days after the alleged attack, 18-year-old Cooper Camferdam turned himself in to police in connection with the alleged attack, FOX 16 reported. Police reportedly said Camferdam is the individual seen in the now-viral video stomping on Epperson's head, which ultimately left him unconscious. "He has suffered a fracture to the skull, fracture to the jaw, and he has hearing loss on his left ear," Katie Epperson, Epperson's mother, told KARK. "The front of his face, there isn't anything. But both sides, big, purple ears and bruises." According to police, the fight reportedly broke out after two groups became involved in an altercation at a party earlier in the evening, with one group following the other to a Circle K gas station in Hot Springs, Arkansas, on Saturday, Jan. 17, 2026. "We'll kind of go from there to see if there will be any long-term effects," Katie Epperson said. "We just really don't know right now." Camferdam is charged with felony first-degree battery and is being held in the Garland County Detention Center on $500,000 bond, according to arrest records obtained by Fox News Digital. Police reportedly said they have used the video to identify additional persons of interest, and they expect to make more arrests. The Hot Springs Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Epperson's mother reportedly added that her son does not have health insurance, and is asking for the public's help in covering his medical bills while hoping for her son's speedy recovery. "I don't want anyone else to get hurt," she continued. "Let the law enforcement do their job, and justice will be served."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Minnesotans are rallying for another day of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement‘s continued operation in the state, after a second protester was killed by federal law enforcement personnel over the weekend. Residents have been demonstrating despite the frigid temperatures after Alex Pretti was killed by a Border Patrol agent. Pretti was killed during a physical altercation after he had been recording federal operations on his cellphone and had intervened, which resulted in a melee. “Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Homan going to the city is “good news for peace, safety, and accountability.” A sit-in at the state capitol is planned for Monday morning in St. Paul, while some University of Minnesota students are staging a walkout at noon and skipping classes, echoing previous actions. Later in the evening, other students are headed to a Twin Cities Hilton hotel, which they believe is housing ICE officers, telling participants to “Get these fascist bastards out of our cities.” Also on Monday, two courts will consider separate cases that could hold sweeping ramifications for ICE's presence in Minnesota, and the Trump administration's efforts to carry out deportation sweeps in blue states antagonistic to the White House. At 2 p.m., a federal judge in Saint Paul will hear arguments regarding Minnesota's attempt to access evidence from the latest shooting involving an ICE operation on Saturday. There is already a restraining order approved by U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud that has paused any destruction or alteration of evidence. In another court hearing, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Menendez is set to consider arguments centered on Minnesota's attempt to end the federal government's “Operation Metro Surge” in the state. ICE says it has removed over 3,000 criminal illegal immigrants, including murderers, rapists, and pedophiles, during the surge, which began in December 2025. Should the state win its case, ICE would face significant restrictions in how it operates in Minnesota, and the surge would be forced to end. Dozens of local business leaders have urged Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Gov.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Skeleton athlete Katie Uhlaender says she should have been going to the 2026 Olympics in Italy next month. As a veteran of five Winter Games from 2006 to 2022, sliding in Turin, Vancouver, Sochi, PyeongChang and Beijing, the American would have made history by competing in a sixth. What denied her entry to the Milan-Cortina Olympics was her final qualification event in the North American Cup earlier this month at Lake Placid, where several Canadian competitors were withdrawn at the last minute. Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton denied anything untoward, telling CNN Sports in a statement, “BCS remains confident that its actions were appropriate, transparent, and aligned with both athlete welfare and the integrity of the sport.” Cecchini didn't respond to CNN Sports' request for comment. Skeleton's governing body also dismissed Uhlaender's complaint, but she wasn't the only athlete to have been negatively impacted at Lake Placid and, since then, an increasing number of national teams have rallied behind her. “The only thing that brings me warmth in my heart, and hope – and lit a fire under my butt that you could equate to the Olympic flame – is that my community is coming together,” Uhlaender told CNN Sports. The Lake Placid incident has thrown skeleton into turmoil. The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) quickly dismissed Uhlaender's complaints after its Interim Integrity Unit ruled that Cecchini had not breached its rules, code of conduct or code of ethics. Uhlaender accuses the governing body of a flawed investigation and that evidence or testimony from the athletes competing in Lake Placid was never considered. “It saddens me that they didn't respond to my email with the evidence,” Uhlaender explained. I think this is an opportunity for us to all come together.” The day after the judgment was posted, Elisabeth Vathje, Executive Committee Member and Co-Chairperson of the Athlete Council within IBSF, resigned her position over what she described in an Instagram post as “a misalignment of values.” In the letter seen by CNN Sports, Rocky Harris, USOPC's Chief of Sport and Athlete Services, wrote, “‘Ms. In support of their athlete, USA Bobsled Skeleton made a similar plea. “Granting Katie Uhlaender the opportunity to compete in Milano Cortina,” wrote CEO Aron McGuire, “would send a powerful message that dedication, character, and lifelong commitment to the values of the Games matter.” She says that many of her fellow athletes who were there, including Janine Flock and Kim Bos, told her to keep going. “I have to emphasize that when I see the younger generation witnessing competition manipulation like some are trying to justify it, ‘through the rules,' it concerns me because, if we didn't speak out and show that people care about the integrity of the sport and ethics, they might just fall in line and behave that way. “I don't want Canada to have a bad reputation; I'm hoping that we don't treat any (athlete) in this situation like an enemy. Uhlaender is now hoping US Vice President JD Vance, who is leading the nation's delegation to Milan-Cortina, will take her case to the International Olympic Committee and persuade the organization of its merits. It's not lost on Uhlaender that one of the first nations to support her cause was Denmark, whose government is currently at loggerheads with the US over the fate of Greenland. “At moments such as this, the Olympic Movement has an opportunity, and a responsibility, to reaffirm its core values,” wrote Carsten P. Wulf, President of Bob & Skeleton Denmark to the IOC. And the Olympic Movement would be strengthened by it.” “I think that this is a great opportunity to show that we really do care about one another more than is portrayed in politics because we're all human,” Uhlaender said. “If people don't fight to uphold those values and keep them alive, then politics will eat us up.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union has launched a wide-reaching investigation into Elon Musk's Grok chatbot on X following global outrage over its ability to generate sexually explicit images, including of children. The scandal erupted at the end of last year when the AI chatbot churned out a barrage of digitally undressed images of women and children in response to requests from users. The global outcry that followed was met by an initial announcement by X that the tool would be limited to paying subscribers, but the company eventually prevented all users from using Grok to create images of real people in revealing clothing. Henna Virkkunen, a senior commission official focusing on technology, as well security and democracy, said in the statement: “Sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation. With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations… or whether it treated rights of European citizens – including those of women and children – as collateral damage of its service.” When contacted for comment, X referred CNN to a January 14 statement on its social media platform that said among other things: “We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking Child Sexual Exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.” After days of outrage, X restricts Grok's ability to create explicit images The probe was opened under the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires Big Tech companies to do more to tackle illegal and harmful online content. There is no timeline for completing the probe nor any indication of what action the European Commision might take based on its findings. However, the official, who asked to remain anonymous, told journalists the body had “quite a few tools at our disposal” and that a fine was possible. “What we are after is changing the platform's behavior,” they said. Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta also announced an investigation into the “proliferation of non-consensual sexually explicit material produced using Grok.” Grok is still banned in Indonesia and Malaysia as a result of the image generation controversy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dozens of CEOs have called for the lowering of tensions in Minneapolis, pleading for a return to normalcy in the aftermath of anti-ICE protester Alex Pretti being fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent. The 60 business leaders called for cooperation between Mayor Jacob Frey, Gov. “The business community in Minnesota prides itself in providing leadership and solving problems to ensure a strong and vibrant state,” read the letter. “The recent challenges facing our state have created widespread disruption and tragic loss of life. For the past several weeks, representatives of Minnesota's business community have been working every day behind the scenes with federal, state, and local officials to advance real solutions.” “With yesterday's tragic news, we are calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local, and federal officials to work together to find real solutions,” read the letter. “In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state, and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future,” noted the CEOs. Pretti was killed on Saturday during a confrontation with Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis who were conducting illegal immigration enforcement operations. He is the third person to be shot in Minneapolis this month by federal law enforcement officers during such an activity. Renee Good, a 37-year-old resident of Minneapolis, was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7, as the agency was engaged in enforcement activities.</p>

At Vox, our mission is to help you make sense of the world — and that work has never been more vital. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Supreme Court is currently considering whether the Constitution requires public schools to out transgender students to their parents, even when those students inform the school that they do not want their family to be informed of their gender identity. California law provides that public school employees “shall not be required to disclose any information related to a pupil's sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression to any other person without the pupil's consent unless otherwise required by state or federal law.” The plaintiffs in Mirabelli argue that this law is unconstitutional, and they ask the justices to embrace a trial judge's claim that “when gender incongruence is observed…parents have a right to be informed.” When a public school student wants to keep their trans identity secret from their parents, these plaintiffs argue, government employees are constitutionally required to defy the child's wishes and inform the parents regardless. Last year, Justice Samuel Alito complained in a third case that, in his view, too many lower courts are avoiding the question of “whether a school district violates parents' fundamental rights” when they permit a transgender student to socially transition. This question, in other words, is clearly a matter of great importance to the conservative legal movement's religious wing. Indeed, the Supreme Court historically viewed this reality as a good thing. To the extent that Americans disagree about which values these schools should teach, the United States has historically managed these disagreements by giving the lion's share of control over public schools to state governments and local school boards. And those six Republicans recently showed that they are very eager to become superintendents of the entire nation's public schools. In a 1948 opinion, for example, Justice Robert Jackson wrote that there were “256 separate and substantial religious bodies” within the United States, and warned that “if we are to eliminate everything that is objectionable to any of these warring sects or inconsistent with any of their doctrines, we will leave public education in shreds.” This hands-off era came to an abrupt halt last June, however, with the Supreme Court's decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor (2025). In Mahmoud, the Court's Republican majority held that parents who object to books with LGBTQ+ characters or themes must be informed if those books will be used in their child's classroom, and given a chance to opt their child out of that lesson. But the opinion speaks in broad terms, suggesting that any parent who objects to any lesson on religious grounds must be given this right — even if the school district could not possibly have known about the parent's objection in advance. Among other things, Mahmoud is likely to impose a “Don't Say Gay” regime on public schools throughout the country. Mahmoud, in other words, fundamentally reshaped the relationship between public schools and the judiciary, forcing judges to police schools for any lesson that might trouble any person's religious beliefs. And, as Mirabelli and similar cases show, advocates for the religious right are already demanding more from their allies on the Supreme Court. Justice Jackson's warning about “leaving public education in shreds” was rooted in the Court's longstanding belief that public schools are an essential institution, and that the Constitution must be interpreted in a way that allows this institution to thrive. As the Court said six years later in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), its most famous intervention in state education policy, “education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments” — and not just because it prepares children to hold a job as adults, but also because it enables people to be good Americans who contribute to the collective project of the nation. Public schools, the Court explained in Brown, lay “the very foundation of good citizenship.” They enable citizens to perform “our most basic public responsibilities.” And they “awaken[] the child to cultural values” that schools seek to inculcate in all Americans. This is why modern-day public schools typically teach texts like the Declaration of Independence, with its statement that “all men are created equal,” or Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s “I Have a Dream” speech. These texts are a kind of secular liturgy, taught to all Americans in the hope that we will all embrace liberal democratic values. Indeed, before Mahmoud, the Court's conservative wing had historically been even more protective of public schools' role as evangelists of universal American values than more liberal justices. Consider, for example, Ambach v. Norwick (1979), where a 5-4 Court upheld a New York state law that prohibited noncitizens from being public school teachers unless they were actively trying to become citizens. Those five justices reasoned that, because training children to be good US citizens is one of the most important functions of public schools, the schools could refuse to hire teachers who are uninterested in US citizenship. Public schools, Justice Lewis Powell wrote for the Court, are an “‘assimilative force' by which diverse and conflicting elements in our society are brought together on a broad but common ground.” Hence Powell's conclusion that public schools “inculcat[e] fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system.” In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), for example, the Court famously declared that students do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.” Yet it also held that those rights must yield when they disrupt teachers' ability to educate. Under Tinker, a public school student may not claim First Amendment protection when their speech “materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.” The justices recognized that public schools could not function if students had a right to disrupt lessons, so they carefully crafted a rule that respects student free speech without undercutting the school's ability to teach math, history, or American values. Mahmoud is incompatible with this more modest approach to judging. Much like a school that teaches the Declaration of Independence in order to foster American values like universal equality, the school district in Mahmoud said that it wanted its curriculum to include some books with LGBTQ+ characters in order to showcase American values such as “the richness of cultural pluralism and commonality.” But, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent, this rule will create “chaos” in public schools because it is not possible for schools to anticipate every objection that a parent might raise, and to warn them in advance. In previous court cases, parents raised religious objections to lessons touching on topics as varied as divorce, interfaith couples, “immodest dress,” evolution, pacifism, magic, women achieving things outside of the home, and “false views of death.” How is a school that wants to teach, say, a biography of President Ronald Reagan supposed to know, in advance, if one of its students' parents finds this book objectionable because Reagan was divorced? In criticizing Mahmoud, I want to be clear that I do not object to the Court's conclusion that classroom instruction on sensitive topics like sexuality may sometimes violate the Constitution's religious protections. The problem with Mahmoud is that it imposes an impossible burden on public schools, requiring them to anticipate any religious view that might be held by any parent. What the Court should have done instead is the exact same thing it did in Tinker: craft a legal rule that respects constitutional rights without undermining public schools' ability to function. If the Constitution requires teachers to tell parents if they plan to teach a book with a trans character, why wouldn't it also require them to tell a student's parents if the student says they are trans? At the Federalist Society's debate on whether public schools must out trans children, University of Chicago law professor Mary Anne Case argued extending Mahmoud beyond a school's curriculum would be even more disruptive than Mahmoud itself. “Many parents have extremely strong religious ethical views about the foods a child consumes,” Case pointed out. If a child's parent wants their family to only eat kosher or halal food, does that mean that the school must immediately inform the parents if their child is caught with a piece of bacon? If a parent believes, for religious reasons, that their child should not form romantic attachments prior to marriage, are teachers obligated to tell the child's parents if they are dating someone? And, what happens if teachers reasonably believe that the parents may be abusive? If a student tells their teacher that they are scared because their father will beat them or kick them out of the house if he discovers that they are trans, does the Constitution really require this teacher to out the student? Unfortunately, it's unlikely that any of these arguments will persuade this Supreme Court — the Republican justices already revealed in Mahmoud that they do not care if their approach to religious liberty forces public schools to do the impossible. But the Constitution provides that all people, parents and children alike, may freely exercise their faith. At one point, their brief even quotes a dissenting opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas, which argues that minors should be stripped of their First Amendment rights because “the concept of total parental control over children's lives extended into the schools.” Accordingly, the plaintiffs' most radical legal argument is rooted in an old Supreme Court precedent that they read to say that parents have a “right of control” over their children. It is true that, more than a century ago, the Supreme Court handed down two cases — Meyer v. Nebraska (1923) and Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) — that held that parents enjoy some amount of “liberty” to “direct the upbringing and education of children.” But those cases involved far more modest legal claims than the one in Mirabelli. In Meyer, the Court struck down a Nebraska law that forbade teachers at private schools from teaching foreign languages prior to the eighth grade. And in Pierce, the Court struck down an Oregon law that forbade most parents from sending their kids to a private school altogether. A ban on teaching foreign languages obviously violates the First Amendment's free speech protections. The Court frequently made up “rights” that do not appear in the Constitution, such as a “freedom of contract” that was frequently used to strike down laws protecting workers. Meanwhile, textually protected rights such as free speech more or less did not exist in the 1920s, at least according to the Supreme Court. So the Mirabelli plaintiffs are correct that, under current law, parents do enjoy some amount of “liberty” to raise their children as they choose. But neither case — both of which merely said that parents may send their children to private schools which may teach different subjects or instill different values than public schools — has ever permitted parents to control how public schools operate. But it is neither possible, nor desirable, for a family to completely insulate its children from other value systems and ideas. And the fundamental question presented by cases like Mirabelli is whether American society as a whole should also play a role in shaping public school students' values. If a family wishes to teach its children that pluralistic democratic values are wicked, are public schools forbidden from teaching an alternative viewpoint? Before Mahmoud, the judiciary's answer to this question was an emphatic “no.” Disagreements about which values should be taught in public schools were dealt with democratically, through elections for state legislature or local school boards. Litigants like the Mirabelli plaintiffs reject this kind of federalized pluralism as well. The fundamental premise of their lawsuit is that control over public education should be transferred from state and local authorities to Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. It's been more than eight years since the last nuclear explosion. Federal agents just shot and killed another person in Minneapolis. And 3 other takeaways from a conversation with the state's attorney general, Keith Ellison.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BEIJING (AP) — China made a major announcement over the weekend, saying it was investigating the army's top general for suspected serious violations of discipline and law. Gen. Zhang Youxia was the highest military member just below President Xi Jinping. The move shakes up virtually the entire commission, chaired by Xi, leaving only one of its six members intact. But some experts say the moves also might have repercussions on Beijing's next move on Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own territory. Here are some elements to understand why Gen. Zhang's removal is important. The next day, the People's Liberation Army Daily published an editorial that fell short of explaining the specific reasons, saying only that it was “for suspected serious violations of discipline and law” and showed China's commitment to punish corruption. That is something Xi has pursued since the early days of his presidency. Rumors have circulated on social media and there have been some media reports about the changes, but nothing official. “I do not believe any evidence publicly released or selectively leaked by Chinese authorities would necessarily reflect the core reason for Zhang's removal,” said K. Tristan Tang, nonresident Vasey Fellow at Pacific Forum. “The critical point is that Xi Jinping decided to move against Zhang; once an investigation is launched, problems are almost inevitably uncovered.” Analysts have said the purges are designed to reform the military and ensure loyalty to Xi. They are part of a broader anti-corruption drive that has resulted in punishment for more than 200,000 officials since the Chinese leader came to power in 2012. He was replaced with Zhang Shengmin, who is now the only commission member. Since 2012, at least 17 Generals from the People's Liberation Army, or PLA, have been removed from their military positions, among them eight who were former top commission members, according to a review of military statements and state media reports made by The Associated Press. Some think the removals could have repercussions for China's decisions on Taiwan, but it is far from clear. China considers Taiwan its own territory and has threatened to take control of the island by force if necessary. China also has increased military pressure and, last month, launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan for two days after the U.S. government announced a major arms sales to Taiwan. It would make a military escalation against the island riskier in the immediate term because of “a high command in disarray,” but in the long term would mean the army has a more loyal and less corrupt leadership with more military capabilities, he said. Asked if this might reinforce the idea that removing top military brass might show China is not ready for war, Tang from the Pacific Forum said it “does not fundamentally change that assessment”. “That said,” he added, “I also do not believe the PLA's combat readiness has been severely disrupted.” But it's not clear if the five vacant positions will be replaced soon or if Xi will wait until 2027, when there will be a selection of a new Communist Party Central Committee, the body in charge of also appointing the new military commission members.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It has recently been a bad stretch for President Donald Trump, perhaps the worst of his second term. The latest Emerson College survey has Trump's approval rate surging among Hispanic voters. Results from the latest New York Times/Siena poll show a similar movement, with Trump's standing among Hispanics rising by 13 points since December. One explanation is that Hispanics enthusiastically support the Trump administration's recent capture of Venezuela's tyrant, Nicolas Maduro. White people, for example, supported the president's decision at 64%. The triumphant military operation saw elite U.S. commandos dive into the heart of a foreign country and snatch a dictator and enemy of America without suffering a single loss. It's no surprise that such an exhibition of strength and competence would play well with voters. The public has become increasingly skeptical of foreign interventions in recent years, but they like to win. Trump's efforts to secure the border and crack down on drug trafficking and violent crime have also received favorable support in this demographic group. Under the Biden administration, America's southern border became a playground for narcoterrorist organizations, with predictable results. Americans of all ethnicities became less safe as their communities deteriorated. So, too, do the Hispanic voters who have played a key role in Trump's political fortunes. In 2024, Trump received a record share of their votes at 43%. While not as high as his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, this is a higher percentage than any Republican candidate in modern history, and an 8-point increase from 2020. It could be the start of something big for Trump and the Republican Party, possibly giving both a needed boost as they look ahead to a difficult midterm. For decades, the Republican Party has sought to attract Latinos and other minority voters who had long been part of the Democratic coalition. This has been key to winning over voters whom the Democratic Party took for granted. But Trump's rebalancing of relations with Latin America, which includes toppling Maduro and deporting illegal immigrants who taint legal immigrants, can be an element in winning Hispanic votes next November. If Trump can lower the cost of living, he will likely hold his gains among Hispanics.</p>

SEATTLE (AP) — Sam Darnold was cast aside by the New York Jets, who drafted him No. The Minnesota Vikings didn't bring him back after he led them to a 14-3 season but flopped in the playoffs. Now, in his first season with the Seattle Seahawks, he's Super Bowl-bound. Darnold threw for three touchdowns, the Seahawks' “Dark Side” defense came up with a critical fourth-down stop, and Seattle advanced to the Super Bowl, beating the Los Angeles Rams 31-27 in an electrifying NFC championship game on Sunday. “He shut a lot of people up tonight, so I'm happy for him.” Led by Darnold — an eight-year veteran playing for his fifth team — the Seahawks (16-3) reached their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history and first in 11 years. Seattle lost that most recent appearance to New England, its opponent in two weeks at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Darnold, who was blown out in his playoff debut last year with the Vikings — by the Rams, no less — played through an oblique injury and completed 25 of 36 passes for 346 yards with no turnovers. Jaxon Smith-Njigba had 153 yards receiving — the second-most in a playoff game in franchise history — and a touchdown on 10 catches. “Can't say enough about Sam, man,” Smith-Njigba said. On fourth-and-4 at the Seattle 6, coach Sean McVay elected to go for it and Stafford's pass was broken up in the end zone by Devon Witherspoon. He plays with just such a raw energy. Stafford threw for 374 yards and three touchdowns, but the Rams were undone by critical errors, including a muffed punt by Xavier Smith in the third quarter. The Seahawks led 31-20 late in the third quarter on Darnold's 13-yard TD pass to Cooper Kupp, but the Rams got back into the game when Seahawks cornerback Riq Woolen was flagged for taunting after breaking up a pass to Nacua on third-and-12, giving Los Angeles a first down. “Even though I made a great play, I wasn't great for my team,” Woolen said, “and I've got to be better with that and celebrate with the team.” The Rams forced a punt on Seattle's next possession and went on a 14-play, 84-yard drive that came up empty thanks to Witherspoon's pass breakup. Seattle stayed aggressive on its final possession, with Darnold throwing for three first downs to run out most of the clock. Four plays later, Walker ran 2 yards for a TD to make it 7-0. Four plays later, Darnold and Smith-Njigba hooked up for a 14-yard TD that made it 17-13 heading into halftime. Whatever y'all ask of me, I'm gonna get it done, whatever that might be,” said Smith-Njigba, the NFL's leading receiver in the regular season. McVay bristled when asked if he expects Stafford to return next season. But this guy played a level that's just different.” Bobo's touchdown catch was his first since Jan. 5, 2025, which also came against the Rams, and the fourth of his three-year career. “It didn't surprise anybody in here, I'll tell you that.” Rams: WR Jordan Whittington (chest) left in the third quarter. Defensive end Kobie Turner (cramps) also exited in the third. Seahawks: LB Drake Thomas (shoulder) left in the fourth quarter. FB Brady Russell (hand) was injured in the second half and did not return. Rams: Stafford turns 38 next month and has to wonder if this was his last, best chance at a second Super Bowl title. Seahawks: Seek their second Super Bowl title after winning it all in the 2013 season with coach Pete Carroll and the “Legion of Boom” defense.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump dodged whether he supported federal agents' decision to shoot and kill 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday during an immigration operation. Trump was pressed by Wall Street Journal reporter Josh Dawsey on whether Border Patrol agents responded appropriately when they killed Pretti, who briefly intervened when an agent pushed a woman to the ground during the operation. According to Dawsey, Trump did not answer the question twice before saying his administration was “reviewing everything.” Trump expressed displeasure with the shooting as a whole, while remaining critical of Pretti's decision to open-carry a handgun while protesting. “But I don't like it when somebody goes into a protest, and he's got a very powerful, fully-loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. The Department of Homeland Security said after the shooting that Pretti was armed with a “9 mm semi-automatic handgun” and likely “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” Bystander footage, however, has largely called that characterization into question. While he was armed, an agent appears to remove the weapon from Pretti's waistband and away from the scene just before he is shot dead. Trump appeared open to that move in the Wall Street Journal interview, saying federal agents will leave the city “at some point.” He did, however, maintain that some agents would be staying indefinitely to continue investigating the Minnesota fraud scandal, which he has attempted to tie to the shooting by alleging a “COVER UP” by state lawmakers.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., speaks during the Senate Democrat policy luncheon news conference at the Capitol, Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2026, in Washington. Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., left, sits at left as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., center, talks with Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., during a round table discussion on the high cost of housing, on Capitol Hill, Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026, in Washington. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, in a social media post hours after the Saturday shooting, said that what is happening in Minnesota is “appalling” and that Democrats “will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.” Six more are awaiting action in the Senate, despite a revolt from House Democrats and mounting calls for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's impeachment. If senators fail to act by midnight Friday, funding for Homeland Security and the other agencies covered under the six bills will lapse. “Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE,” said Schumer, D-N.Y. “I will vote no.” But they have not yet raised any realistic solutions, the aide said. That support was already in question after Renee Good, a mother of three, was fatally shot and killed earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis. But the fatal shooting Saturday of Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, quickly prompted Democrats to take a more forceful stand. On Sunday, House and Senate Democrats convened separate conference calls as they privately assess next steps and press to restrain the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations. “Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,” Murray wrote. Democrats said video released of both shootings showed otherwise. “The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., posted on X. “The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. said Democrats should reconsider their threat to not support DHS funding and work with him to “end the mess created by sanctuary city policies.” “Now is not the time to defund one of our major national security priorities: border protection,” Graham said on X. Much of the government, including the Department of Defense, continues to operate on a short-term bill that provides funding only through Friday. Republican leaders had hoped to avoid another shutdown after last fall's 43-day closure that revolved around Democrats' insistence on extending federal subsidies that make health coverage more affordable for those enrolled in the Affordable Care Act marketplace. House Democrats largely rejected the homeland security portion last week with just a handful joining Republicans to ensure its passage. The House plans to be out of session this week and would have to pass the funding package again if it is changed. Democrats are pushing for policy changes to be added to the homeland security spending bill that would force ICE agents to use warrants for immigration arrests, mandate strengthened training, require agents to identify themselves and have Border Patrol agents stay on the border rather than assisting ICE with immigration raids in the interior of the country. Democratic senators discussed the options on Sunday evening's call but without changes from Republicans, they appeared headed toward a shutdown. On the morning call with House Democrats, they heard from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and the state's attorney general, Keith Ellison, both former congressmen. Several other Democratic senators announced they would vote “no” on homeland security money, including some who had helped Republicans end the record shutdown last year. “The abuses of power we are seeing from ICE in Minneapolis and across the country are un-American and cannot be normalized,” Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said in a post on X. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., also said she opposes that portion of the package. Minnesota's Democratic senators also indicated they will oppose the DHS funding bill. “For those asking where we go from here: Not voting to fund ICE is a great place for us to start,” Sen. Tina Smith wrote on X. We call for a full and transparent investigation with state officials,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. ”And we call on our Republican colleagues to stand up. The Department of Agriculture was funded from a previous measure, which means a shutdown shouldn't stop food assistance this time. But other critical operations of the government would be disrupted.
