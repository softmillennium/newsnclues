                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>USMNT Star's Potential Christian Pulisic-Type Leap Comes With a Risk Fulham have reportedly made a bid to bring U.S. men's national team striker Ricardo Pepi to the Premier League despite his serious arm injury. Pepi got 2025–26 off to a scintillating start, scoring 11 goals in 22 appearances for PSV Eindhoven. The 23-year-old then broke his arm in January and been on the long road to recovery since—a process that is expected to take two months. The reigning Dutch champions are thought to be looking for around €35 million ($41.6 million) for their attacker, who joined the club in 2023. While many American stars are currently making a name for themselves throughout Europe, so few players of the current generation have impressed in the Premier League apart from Christian Pulisic. The USMNT captain bid farewell to Borussia Dortmund and joined Chelsea ahead of the 2019–20 season and went on to make history. Pulisic made 145 appearances in his four seasons at Stamford Bridge, scoring 26 goals along the way. His time in a blue shirt was not always so blissful as that night at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal. Recurring fitness struggles, inconsistent minutes and a carousel of managers and attacking personnel marred Pulisic's days at Chelsea, so much so that he eventually transferred to AC Milan ahead of the 2023–24 season. Still, Pulisic—and now Antonee Robinson and Chris Richards—proved today's crop of impressive Americans can thrive in what is considered the most competitive league in the world, laying the groundwork for someone like Pepi to try and replicate their successes. Returning to play for a new team in a much more difficult league after so much time on the sidelines is a massive challenge, one that could ultimately harm Pepi's chances of logging consistent minutes at this summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup. Just look at what happened to Gio Reyna—the midfielder was regarded as one of the most exciting American talents, and between injuries and a horrible stint at Nottingham Forest, he saw his place in the Stars and Stripes' squad almost completely disappear. Transferring to the Premier League five months before the World Cup is a risk for Pepi, who was looking like a surefire option to at minimum serve as Folarin Balogun's backup next summer. A failure to return to his goalscoring form and play consistent minutes at Fulham could incite Pochettino to look at other options, leaving Pepi as nothing more than an afterthought in the biggest tournament of his career.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The penultimate week of January saw intense weather cast a cold and snowy shadow over much of the continental United States, even as U.S. men's national team players saw their form heat up across Europe. With such consistent performances unfolding each week, USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino's decisions for a March roster and World Cup squad have become even more challenging—no doubt, though, a welcome problem to have. While the 24-year-old former Columbus Crew academy product may not be putting up flashy attacking numbers—he has no goals and two assists in 23 matches with English Championship side Middlesbrough—he has been one of the most consistent players in the league. This week saw him continue to thrive in a midfield pivot alongside 23-year-old English midfielder Hayden Hackney, where he finished all 33 of his attempted passes through a 61-minute showing in a 4–0 win over Preston North End. Middlesbrough now sit second in the Championship in an automatic qualification spot and just three points behind table-topping Coventry City. The USMNT's center back pool has immense depth and Mark McKenzie is making his case to start in the likely back three at the World Cup with his recent form in Ligue 1 with Toulouse. This season, the 26-year-old has played 19 games, including his current streak of eight straight 90-minute performances across Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France. He is playing on the right side of a back three, a role that could be transferable to Pochettino's setup. While continuing to stand out defensively this weekend, McKenzie helped Toulouse to a 2–0 win over Brest on Sunday, chipping in with an assist on Pape Demba Diop's opening goal, while ending the 90-minute shift with seven clearances and eight recoveries. One of the most important players to the USMNT ahead of the World Cup, Chris Richards scored in his 100th appearance for Crystal Palace in a 3–1 loss to Chelsea in Sunday's Premier League action. In addition to his first goal of the season, Richards made five defensive contributions and continued to grow into his left center back role. Next week, he and Crystal Palace look to snap an 11-game winless streak across all competitions when they take on 17th-place Nottingham Forest. Johnny Cardoso's efforts have started to pay off in more consistent performances with Atlético Madrid and this week saw the 24-year-old play 72 minutes in a 3–0 win over Mallorca, a side battling relegation. Cardoso didn't get on the scoresheet, but he  had five passes into the final third and completed three long passes, according to FotMob. Pochettino has a crowded player pool of American midfielders, but consistent minutes and strong showings from Cardoso should see him in the March camp and likely in the World Cup squad. In the Bianconeri's midweek win over Benfica, he played one of his best games of the season, scoring his fifth goal of the campaign across all competitions while also creating two chances and chipping in with two recoveries in a right midfield role. The 27-year-old native of Little Elm, Texas followed his thrilling midweek performance with another strong showing in a 3–0 victory over Napoli on Sunday, where he took on a more attacking role and helped lead his team's frontline, which saw goals from Jonathan David, Kenan Yıldız and Filip Kostić. Beaming with form and versatility, McKennie could prove to be one of the most important players this summer, despite once looking like a potential rotational player in Pochettino's setup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 89-year-old cited Mark Pieth, an anti-corruption expert and law professor who chaired the Independent Governance Committee to oversee FIFA's reform process from 2013 to 2016. In a recent interview with Swiss newspaper Der Bund, Pieth said that President Donald Trump's international aggression and violations within the U.S. made it too risky for fans to travel from abroad. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don't please the officials, they'll be put straight on the next flight home. Blatter approvingly quoted Pieth in a post on X, adding: "I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup." Trump's aggressive posture toward Greenland recently led to calls for a boycott from European countries. There has also been widespread criticism at home as federal agents have killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, Minnesota this month. Fans from Iran and Haiti are already unlikely to visit due to their inclusion among 39 countries whose citizens are banned from entry. "The country itself is in a state of tremendous turmoil," Pieth said. "What we're witnessing domestically – the marginalization of political opponents, the abuses by immigration authorities, and so on – doesn't exactly entice a fan to travel there. "The U.S. is in a similar security situation to Mexico. Blatter served as FIFA president for 17 years before he was forced out in the wake of a corruption scandal that erupted in 2015. He has frequently been critical of his replacement, Gianni Infantino.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A debate recently popped up on social media over whether Weston McKennie has already done enough to be considered the U.S. men's national team's best-ever midfielder. It's a discussion with reasonable arguments on both sides, but the very fact that it's happening speaks to just how good McKennie has been - and how much he has already accomplished in his career. He's a key figure for one of the sport's biggest clubs, Juventus, and, with the World Cup on the horizon, he'll likely be a key part of that tournament, too, as the USMNT look to make a run on home soil. And, if all goes to plan, he might just put a dent in that best-ever debate by the time 2026 is done, particularly if he continues how he's started this calendar year. What should we expect from them next summer? Previous Meet the USMNT: Christian Pulisic | Folarin Balogun|Chris Richards McKennie was born in Fort Lewis, Washington, but that's not the environment that helped make him who he is. There were two of those places: Texas and Germany. Largely raised in Little Elm, Texas, McKennie's soccer education, realistically, began during a three-year stay in Germany from age six to nine. His father, John, was an Air Force officer, and it was during that time that McKennie got his first real taste of high-level soccer. Once back in the States, McKennie rose through the ranks at FC Dallas and the U.S. youth national team system, where he befriended future senior team teammates Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams, among others. For a brief time, he committed to play at the University of Virginia. It took less than a year for the teenage McKennie to make it to Schalke's first team as he made his professional debut in May 2017 against Ingolstadt. Italian megaclub Juventus, who swooped to sign the midfielder in 2020 after McKennie put together several strong seasons in Germany's top flight. McKennie has reached new heights at Juventus, playing for one of the world's most famous clubs. At Juve, he's played alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, scored nine Champions League goals, and lifted three trophies, all while emerging as one of the USMNT's most important pieces through the 2022 World Cup cycle and beyond. It was at that 2022 World Cup that McKennie put in some of his best shifts as an international, famously going toe-to-toe with England's midfield in his second-ever World Cup game. While largely successful, McKennie's run with Juventus has never been easy. Now, midway through this 2025-26 season, McKennie is at another crossroads. His contract with Juve expires after this season, and there are conflicting reports about what comes next. All of this comes with McKennie putting together his best season yet, particularly in the winter months, as the American has been in top, top form. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting In total, McKennie has amassed 62 caps during that time, scoring 11 goals along the way. He's won three CONCACAF Nations League titles, a U.S. Soccer Player of the Year award and was named to CONCACAF's Best XI in 2021. This second cycle has been a bit more up and down, with McKennie playing just four times in 2025, in particular. However, given his form, it's almost certain we see the 27-year-old midfielder contributing next summer. As things stand, McKennie is something of a wild card for the World Cup. Can he hold down the fort next to Adams as a deeper-lying midfielder? Could he make a push for that right-wingback spot, particularly given his success as a right midfielder with Juventus in recent months? It's undoubtedly a difficult decision for manager Mauricio Pochettino, but one that likely doesn't have a wrong answer given McKennie's talent and confidence. Wherever he lines up at the World Cup, expect McKennie to be a player capable of making a difference at the highest level.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Liam Rosenior has made his first signing as Chelsea manager since replacing Enzo Maresca at the helm. The 41-year-old has enjoyed a bright start to life at Stamford Bridge, winning four of his first five games in charge of the Blues in all competitions. Rosenior is also working hard on shaping his squad and has added an exciting young talent to the ranks in west London. Chelsea have won the race to sign Sheffield Wednesday teenager Yisa Alao. The 17-year-old also attracted interest from Manchester United and Liverpool but has opted for Chelsea in a transfer worth around £500,000 plus add-ons. These include performance-related payments and a significant sell-on arrangement. "Our responsibility is to act in the best long-term interests of Sheffield Wednesday and its creditors. This transfer balances immediate value for the club with protection for the future, should Yisa's career develop as we all hope." Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Alao has only made five senior appearances so far in his career, meaning it may be a while before Chelsea fans see him in the first team. Alao is known for being an attack-minded full-back and has come all the way through the academy at Sheffield Wednesday. He made his debut as a 16-year-old against Bolton in the Carabao Cup and also played in the FA Cup this season as Wednesday were beaten by Premier League side Brentford. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Alao's signing continues Chelsea's trend of going for young, exciting talents and the club will hope that he can go on and force his way into the first team. In the meantime, Rosenior and Chelsea are currently preparing for their final Champions League group fixture away at Napoli.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was a case of dry spells, own goals and red cards for some — but momentum continued and lavish praise for others across Europe's U.S. contingent this weekend. Christian Pulisic ranks fifth for goal contributions in Italy this season, and only Serie A top scorer Lautaro Martinez has more goals per 90 minutes than the American. The USMNT star had a scintillating start to the campaign, when he still managed eight league goals and two assists for Milan despite missing five games with a hamstring problem. But in a league and team when he has so often been the leading light and most talked-about performer, things have been a little quiet lately. Six league games have passed without a goal or assist for the 27-year-old, and on Sunday against Roma, his manager Max Allegri preferred to go with two up front, Christopher Nkunku and Rafael Leao, with Pulisic benched. In context, five unspectacular games (he was not involved in the January 15 win at Como) are not overly worrying. Forwards are not judged on their numbers alone — Bukayo Saka hasn't scored in the Premier League for leaders Arsenal since November. And Pulisic, like the England international, has more than enough credit in the bank (and overall influence otherwise) to weather a dry spell. Plenty too for their talismanic top scorer to influence, as soon as his form from last year catches up with 2026. The USMNT defenders have both been in good form for their clubs recently. First, Scally got the ball rolling by bundling it into his own net as his team Borussia Monchengladbach lost 3-0 at home to Stuttgart. Scally had already struggled after dealing inadequately with a cross, which let the high-flying visitors score their first. In Scotland, Trusty saved his own disappointing performance for a crucial game as Celtic faced league leaders Hearts. He was below his own recent high standards before then being sent off in controversial circumstances on 77 minutes, after a VAR review of his foul on Pierre Landry Kabore as he burst through on goal. Obviously, Celtic manager Martin O'Neill did not agree and neither did former refereeing chief Dermot Gallagher on Sky Sports' Ref Watch. For Borussia Monchengladbach, it's just one win and three defeats in their last five Bundesliga games, and for Trusty's Celtic, it was ground lost in their bid to overhaul Hearts. Worse too, rivals Rangers also pinched their second spot in the Scottish Premiership. In the grand scheme of things, neither should be too downhearted. They are both regulars for their teams and neither games are representative of their seasons to date. But they won't want to dwell on this weekend. McKennie scored for the third European game in a row last week, and although he didn't get on the scoresheet against Napoli, he created two chances and prompted lavish praise from manager Luca Spalletti, who underlined the theory that the Texan can play pretty much anywhere. “McKennie would be the perfect centre-forward,” an admiring Spaletti told Sky Italia. So we don't only have [Canadian international striker Jonathan] David. McKennie is the ultimate Swiss Army knife for his team, but being a jack of all trades is rarely to his detriment. The striker was on target again on Friday, getting Derby County's goal in a 1-1 draw with West Brom. He now has eight goals — two in his last three games — during his debut season in England, and seems to be building momentum nicely as he reminds Mauricio Pochettino that it is not Haji Wright he must keep a close eye on in the English second tier during this World Cup year. Folarin Balogun only got a yellow card for his troubles at the weekend with Monaco as they drew with Le Havre on Saturday, but he goes head-to-head with McKennie and Juve on Wednesday at Stade Louis II. Balogun, who has three goals in this season's Champions League, better bring his shooting boots. It will be an intriguing tie as the underdogs are still not totally out of contention for the play-offs, while Cardoso & Co are assured of a place (Wednesday, 3pm, Paramount +). Keep an eye on Malik Tillman and Leverkusen, who need to beat second-bottom Villarreal to be certain of progress too (Wednesday, 3pm, Paramount +). PSV could also do with some Sergino Dest magic as they chase a vital win to make it through, although at least their opponents, Bayern, are second in the table (Wednesday, 3pm, Paramount +). In the Europa League, Auston Trust may have a chance to make immediate amends with Celtic as they take on Utrecht (Thursday, 3pm, Paramount +). Then Tanner Tessmann and Lyon have been in strong Ligue 1 form, they've won four on the spin, and he has started the last two. Last but not least, Sunday in the Premier League sees Chris Richards, who scored at the weekend in his 100th English top-flight appearance for Crystal Palace (the 3-1 defeat by Chelsea) take on Nottingham Forest (Peacock Premium, 7pm). He has also worked as a news and sport journalist for the BBC and hosts a podcast in his spare time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gotham FC signed Florida State University forward and U.S. youth international Jordynn Dudley to a multi-year contract through the 2028 National Women's Soccer League season, the NWSL champions announced on Monday. JERSEY CITY, N.J. – Gotham FC signed Florida State University forward and U.S. youth international Jordynn Dudley to a multi-year contract through the 2028 National Women's Soccer League season, the NWSL champions announced on Monday. Dudley recently completed her junior season with powerhouse Florida State, concluding one of the most prolific collegiate careers in program history. “I know this environment will push my development every day, and I can't wait to compete alongside this incredible team. Thank you to Yael Averbuch West, Juan Carlos Amoros and everyone at Gotham for this opportunity. Dudley, 21, capped her collegiate career as a national champion in 2025, winning the NCAA Division I Tournament for the second time after claiming the title as a freshman in 2023. Her third year earned her recognition as a finalist for the Missouri Athletic Club Hermann Trophy and All-Atlantic Coast Conference first team honors. “Jordynn is a dynamic attacker who has shown the ability to impact games at a very high level,” Gotham FC general manager and head of soccer operations Yael Averbuch. Dudley finished the 2023 campaign with 14 goals, nine assists and 37 points, all second-most by a freshman in school history. She scored the opening goal in the NCAA tournament against Stanford University, helping Florida State to a 5-1 victory. She was named ACC freshman of the year and NCAA Tournament offensive most outstanding player and earned All-ACC freshman team honors. She made five appearances, including two starts, scoring two goals – highlighted by a 98th-minute strike to lift the U.S. to a come-from-behind quarterfinal win over Germany. Last January, Dudley received her first U.S. women's national team call-up. Front Row Soccer editor Michael Lewis has covered 13 World Cups (eight men, five women), seven Olympics and 28 MLS Cups. He has written about New York City FC, New York Cosmos, the New York Red Bulls and both U.S. national teams and has penned a soccer history column for the Guardian.com.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FIFA is boosting women's football. The runner-up will earn $1 million. Each club eliminated in the semifinals will receive $200,000 for its participation, while teams knocked out in the first and second rounds will each earn $100,000. FIFA Secretary General Mattias Grafström said that “the distribution of nearly $4 million in total among the six participants based on performance is a clear statement of confidence in women's club football and in the players, teams, and competitions that are driving its continued growth.” “It reflects the growth of women's football worldwide and FIFA's commitment to making targeted, meaningful investments to strengthen women's club football over the long term. Our objective is clear: to continue investing in women's club football and accelerating its growth, ensuring that opportunities, visibility, and value keep pace with the exceptional performances we see on the pitch,” Grafström added. FIFA also recalled that “the Women's Champions Cup is part of a broader investment and collaboration strategy aimed at strengthening women's club football around the world.” It highlighted the $11.3 million distributed to 1,041 clubs following the 2023 Women's World Cup, as well as the creation of the Women's Club World Cup, whose first edition is scheduled for 2028. The final stage of the inaugural edition will be held in London from January 28 to February 1. On the opening day, Gotham FC (United States) will face Corinthians at Brentford's stadium, followed by a match between Arsenal and Morocco's FAR.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. More than half a billion ticket requests have been made for World Cup 2026 games, which will be hosted by cities across the United States, Canada and Mexico, FIFA reported this month. The U.S. is expecting more than 5 million international visitors, not to mention the tens of thousands of soccer fans here at home, who will not only pack stadiums but also flood fan zones from coast to coast, including in New York, Los Angeles, Kansas City and Atlanta, over the six-week tournament, which kicks off on June 11. This once-in-a-generation opportunity also brings a nationwide, multifaceted rollout of security measures to prepare for potential threats ranging from drone incursions to cyberattacks. However, some human rights advocates have expressed fears that the Trump administration will use law enforcement operations around the World Cup to target migrants as part of the White House's aggressive deportation policy. “Under the Trump administration's policies, immigration enforcement at major sporting events can tear families apart and could expose people fleeing persecution to life-threatening danger,” Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. And there is also trepidation from fans traveling from abroad after the Trump administration broadened its visa ban to 75 countries. The Department of Homeland Security announced earlier this month that it plans to invest $115 million in counter-drone technologies to protect World Cup games, and also events celebrating the country's 250th anniversary this year. The funds will be managed by a new DHS office that will focus on buying and deploying drone and counter-drone tech. “Drones represent the new frontier of American air superiority,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement. FEMA, which is under the umbrella of DHS, said in December that it had allocated $350 million to the 11 states hosting World Cup matches. That money is earmarked for the purchase of counter-drone tech. While most drones are more disruptive than they are overtly dangerous — though there have been cases of falling devices causing serious injury to people on the ground — the war in Ukraine has proven that even relatively inexpensive, commercially available racing drones, outfitted with explosives, can be used as potent weapons. Last week, leaders from the military, law enforcement, and local governments gathered to participate in "tabletop exercises overwhelmingly focused" on drone attacks at World Cup events, where large numbers of people will be gathered in places at predetermined times. Politico reported about the war games that local and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S. have been “encouraged to purchase equipment that can jam inbound drones or redirect them to their origin," and to seek reimbursement for their purchases through a $500 million federal grant program. The World Cup is larger than it has ever been. "The more we build out these things and automate and scale larger — more days, more games, more teams — the more we have to find a way to do that efficiently, and they're not scaling out the human labor force to do it," Chris Grove, director of cybersecurity strategy for Nozomi Networks, a provider of cybersecurity for operational technology told Dark Reading, a cybersecurity news site. Digital threats aren't just a theorized vector for malicious behavior; there is precedent. Grove warned that this year, as a result of heightened political polarization in the U.S., there will likely be an increased likelihood of "hacktivists" targeting the World Cup to make statements. "I think there's more potential and concern for disruption around hacktivists this time around than four years ago," he says. "Four years ago was just a different political and social landscape." Donald Lane, a former Secret Service agent, told the U.S. Sun that while physically attacking an event has become more difficult thanks to increased surveillance and threat-detection technology, malicious actors have found plenty of vulnerabilities through the use of remote access. “Bad actors are realizing they can cause a lot of destruction by accessing these things remotely, which can be just as devastating as a physical attack," he told the outlet. Targeting systems that manage electricity, gas, and water are all possible options for potential bad actors. Postell is a former Secret Service agent and will oversee security preparations alongside local law enforcement. World Cup hosting cities will likely see increased police presence, controlled traffic corridors, and the presence of state and federal law enforcement as has been seen before during major events like the Super Bowl. San Antonio did the same in 2025, but used two-ton stone barriers to block vehicle entry to its Market Square, News 4 San Antonio reports. Michael Donnelly, Georgia's TSA federal security director, said officials at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, in host city Atlanta, are preparing for a massive influx of foreign and domestic travelers. "It's going to be an extremely, busy time when we have games," he told Fox 5 Atlanta. "So we'll be preparing like every game is a Super Bowl." He said that the TSA would be utilizing unspecified "new technologies" to help with screening and expedite wait times as travelers arrive. The Trump administration's aggressive anti-immigration policy – which has seen nearly 3 million people deported and thousands arrested by masked ICE agents and held in detention centers – appears to have left foreign visitors wondering what welcome awaits them in the U.S. In December, Giuliani was asked by reporters if Trump will rule out ICE raids at World Cup games. In January, Lebanese diplomat and FIFA fan Mohamad Safa, announced he'd canceled his World Cup tickets because of the Trump administration's draconian anti-immigration policies. The waived visa program applies to citizens of many European countries and other American allies. The DHS proposal means those visitors may be subjected to expanded scrutiny. If implemented, the new proposal would give Homeland Security the ability to screen travelers' social media posts for any sign of "anti-American" sentiment, even if they aren't seeking long-term stays in the U.S. Trump has said that he "can't wait to welcome soccer fans from all over the globe” but has already banned visa applications for visitors from 21 nations including Iran, Brazil, Colombia, and Egypt — which all have teams in the World Cup or competing to qualify for the event. While exceptions have been made for World Cup teams, their immediate families, and coaching staff, the same cannot be said of their supporters. Trump's immigration crackdown is a concern for domestic fans as well. In July, an asylum seeker in the U.S. took his children to a Club World Cup soccer tournament final and was arrested by ICE, detained for three months, and was then deported to a country where he felt he could be killed, according to Human Rights Watch. FIFA responded on June 3 that it “expects … host countries take measures to ensure that any eligible persons who are involved in the Competition are able to enter the respective countries,” and “is actively working on this matter with relevant authorities.” Join thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Across host cities, revenue managers are shifting from typical pricing patterns toward more aggressive strategies that capitalize on the official tournament draw and the resulting supply-demand compression. A key inflection point for hotel pricing was the official tournament draw, which dictates where teams will be playing, and which fans will be supporting. By analyzing hotel price data across host cities during both the pre-draw and post-draw periods, we can uncover how markets adjust when supporters know where their team will be in the group stages and where they may end up in the knockout round if their team advances. Across all host destinations, there was a clear upward trend in costs as the tournament logistics became concrete. While the aggregate market lift across all destinations was 13.74%, the mean percentage increase per city was higher at 14.75%, driven by more dramatic spikes in some cities. While percentage increases tell one story, the absolute price points reveal a staggering gap between the most and least expensive cities. Vancouver solidified its spot as the most expensive host city for the group stage, with average rates rising from $1,106.38 (pre-draw) to $1,228.62 (post-draw). Houston remained the most affordable option throughout, with prices moving from $179.68 to $225.20. While the group stages saw broad volatility, the knockout rounds show a more concentrated surge in specific markets while others maintain surprising stability. While every destination saw some level of increase, the range of volatility was even more pronounced here than in the group stages. Conversely, some cities remained remarkably consistent and saw the smallest percentage changes, suggesting that their high baseline prices were already baked in early on: Post-draw (as of 12/1/26) these three maintained their exact ranking: Ultimately, the average advertised price increase across all host destinations for the knockout period, comparing late 2025 to early 2026, stands at 10.56%. Whether you are hosting early group stage fixtures or a later stage game, the data suggests there is now significant room price movement following the draw and you should analyse the predictive data from your market and get a strategy in place if you haven't already. By tracking room price evolution from 350 days out to both group and knockout stages, we can see how initial baseline rates have been aggressively adjusted to reflect the true supply-demand compression of both the group and knockout stages. While some cities remained stable, others experienced triple-digit percentage growth as the event moved from a distant date to a reality. The timing of these price peaks tells you lot about varying market confidence. The room price evolution for the knockout rounds, tracked from 350 days down to 164 days before the knockout stage begins, highlights markets that have become increasingly polarized between high-cost stability and low-cost volatility. While the average price increase across all 16 cities was approximately 79.9%, there was explosive price growth in Mexican cities and Kansas: By looking at average prices and standard deviation, we can categorize some of the host cities into four risk/value quadrants which demonstrate the power and variation of local market dynamics when a big event is in town: Currently, the data indicates that most destinations hit their peak pricing within a narrow window between 164 and 173 days, roughly 5.5 to 6 months before the event. While general price trends give us a macro view of the market, the real ‘event tax' is best seen when comparing match days to non-match days. In every host city, match nights consistently command a premium over non-match dates. On average, hotel prices across all 16 host cities jump by 31.44% when a game is in town. However, as expected the intensity of this spike varies dramatically by region. The most significant price differentials are found in Canada and Mexico. When we look purely at the percentage increase, the disparity between a standard night and a match night becomes even more apparent: Commentary from Lighthouse Commercial Strategist Daniel Foreman, with 10 years revenue management experience. As you will know, the dramatic hotel price shifts observed for the FIFA World Cup 2026 are not merely products of organic demand. Here we take a look at some of the potential tactics being used by revenue managers in host cities. Our analysis shows a concentrated pricing peak roughly 5.5 to 6 months out. So far, this appears to be the strategic sweet spot for hoteliers In markets like Vancouver, New York and Boston, high initial rates act as a filter to ensure they don't fill rooms with low-yield leisure bookings (early-bird fans looking for deals) and standard corporate travelers (regular accounts using negotiated fixed rates) before high-value corporate and sponsorship segments enter the market for the event. The 10.56% average room price increase for knockout rounds confirms that revenue managers are currently prioritizing rate growth over pure occupancy for the group stages, assuming there will be plenty of demand to sell out. By maintaining high price floors, revenue managers are banking on a tournament funnel effect. During a mega-event, the traditional business mix is inverted. Revenue managers must navigate a segment swap where standard corporate demand disappears and is replaced by high-yield, event-specific business. It is a historical certainty that regular meetings and conferences will avoid host cities during event dates to escape high prices. Revenue managers are raising transient rates for fans to offset the loss of this reliable base demand. Regular corporate travel is replaced by sponsorship, media, and FIFA-affiliated groups. The minimal price volatility in some US markets, like Atlanta's 1.73% match-day premium and New York's relatively small 12.70% price increase for knockout rounds suggests that revenue managers there are likely using inventory fencing rather than just pure price hikes. During high-compression windows, savvy hoteliers also often close off discounted channels (Expedia, Priceline, etc.) Vancouver consistently outranks even New York as the most expensive city in this tournament, but why you may be asking yourself? Along with the world's biggest sporting event, there is a perfect strom of local dynamics at play in Vancouver which can be broken down into four distinct areas. Between 2002 and 2022, Vancouver saw a net loss of hotel rooms. High land costs and best-use zoning laws historically favored residential condos over hotels because they offered quicker returns for developers. Destination Vancouver reports the city needs 10,000 new rooms by 2050 just to keep up with demand. Bill 35 (Short-Term Rental Accommodations Act), took full effect in May 2024. The crux of this bill focused on a principal residence requirement, in which most secondary suites and investment Airbnbs are now illegal in B.C. A 2025 Deloitte report commissioned by Airbnb suggested that these restrictions contributed to hotel price spikes of up to 20% in the first year of enforcement as travelers were forced back into a limited hotel pool. The summer in Vancouver brings warm, dry weather, attracting tourists for outdoor pursuits like hiking, kayaking, and whale watching. Vancouver's inventory is further constrained in summer by cruise ship arrivals. Most of these passengers require a hotel for at least one night before or after their Alaska cruise. In late 2024 and throughout 2025, workers at major hotels (Hyatt Regency, Westin Bayshore, Pinnacle) represented by UNITE HERE Local 40 secured wage increases of roughly 34% over the life of the contract. These increased operating costs are almost immediately pushed to the consumer via room prices. The 2026 FIFA World Cup will bring extraordinary demand to North America, but as the data clearly shows, every destination is different. Just because your market reacted to a certain way to an event in the past doesn't mean the same pattern will repeat this time around. The extreme demand windows created by big events do not exist in a vacuum. They are in fact highly contextual, with the game schedule also dictated by local supply-demand dynamics. A one-size-fits-all commercial strategy for events leaves money on the table.
