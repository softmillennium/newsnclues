                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a love story, FX-on-Hulu viewers, just say yes. FX has set the premiere date for the inaugural season of Ryan Murphy‘s newest anthology series, Love Story, which is focused on JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette. That said, no one wants a Saturday series, so Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette will bow on Thursday, Feb. 12. After that, one new episode of the subsequent six will air/stream each week. Why Ashton Kutcher Wanted to Play a Villain in 'The Beauty' (Not Inspired by Elon Musk) Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette is inspired by Elizabeth Beller's book Once Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. “Carolyn Bessette was a star in her own right. As their love story unfolded on a national stage, the intense fame and media attention that came along with it threatened to rip them apart.” JFK Jr. and Bessette-Kennedy died in 1999 when his single-engine airplane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near Martha's Vineyard. OK wait, so here's the actual logline: “Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette charts the complex and heartbreaking journey of a couple whose private love became a national obsession.” Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette is created by Connor Hines and executive produced by Murphy, Nina Jacobson, Brad Simpson, Connor Hines, Eric Kovtun, Nissa Diederich, Scott Robertson, Monica Levinson, Kim Rosenstock, D.V.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>She's clearly beyond capable at her job as an accountant—or rather, as she repeatedly clarifies, part of the Strategy And Planning department at a consulting firm where various execu-bros think of everyone they don't golf with as some variation on their secretary. She makes chummy work jokes that already aren't funny before stumbling over her stage-whisper delivery. She brings her lunch from home, and when a bit of tuna fish gets stuck just below her lip before intercepting her new boss Bradley Preston (Dylan O'Brien) for a quick bit of self-promotion, it's not just a casual character note. The camera goes in ultra-close on her mouth, capturing the grotesquerie, and equally close in on Bradley's eyes, alight with horror at the sight of a somewhat older woman who hasn't dolled herself up for him. So is a hand jutting out from the earth. Send Help is his messiest such mess-around since Drag Me To Hell (which somehow squeaked by with a PG-13), and at times feels like a less supernatural companion piece to the most socially conscious of his pure horror films. Both movies' heroines are bedeviled by their desire to climb the corporate ladder, and the rigged demands placed upon them by their imposing male bosses. Bradley, son of the old boss who promised Linda a substantial promotion, is especially enervating in that regard; we see him behind closed doors (despite his “open-door policy”) blithely telling a subordinate that he'll instead hand Linda's promotion to one of his bros, and ship her out of the main office, to boot. Or, we can infer, women he's not attracted to.) To placate her, he offers more rigged gamesmanship: She can join a corporate trip overseas, help out with crunching numbers, and then wait to be told that, somehow, it simply wasn't enough. Instead, their plane crashes into the ocean, in a short sequence staged much as you might expect Sam Raimi to stage a plane crash where most of the victims have been painted as wholly unsympathetic: a slapstick midair torture chamber. Linda and Bradly wash ashore on an unknown island, Linda saves her injured boss's life, and the balance of power between them begins to shift. O'Brien plays him as a bro version of a Raimi boob complete with Looney Tunes grunts and growls of frustration that would make his spiritual (and, via one brief photograph, on-screen) father Bruce Campbell proud, and Bradley's first instinct is to keep treating Linda as an underling. As such, he continues issuing the kind of asinine non-suggestion directives (like explaining that Linda should build a larger fire) that anyone who has ever held a corporate office job will recognize as typical orders from on high. Linda, who happens to be obsessed with Survivor, lands on this island with surprisingly vast knowledge about obtaining water, food, and shelter. To explain further would risk spoiling the movie's give and take—though what's genuinely unpredictable about Send Help isn't the literal plotting, where several turns, however satisfying, are obviously telegraphed. No, Raimi and the screenwriters instead keep the audience off-balance by getting playfully coy about who or what we should be rooting for in this situation. Linda is the more obviously sympathetic party, but as fun as it is to see her take charge—to see McAdams literally go ham by hunting a fearsome wild boar—Raimi has thornier gender politics than will allow an uncomplicated dose of Good For Her cinema. Early on, he's unsparing about depicting Linda as an awkward dork, even going so far as to give her a barely-sublimated attraction to her handsome, younger boss. Yet there's a growing sense that the filmmakers don't entirely disagree, either. So alongside Linda's old-fashioned and thwarted idea that simply working with dedication and skill at her job will result in her ultimate reward, the movie plants an even-older-fashioned hint that she might well enjoy serving as some '60s-style combination of coworker, subordinate, and domestic partner. Drag Me To Hell saw fit to specifically and moralistically punish a young woman for giving in to the demands of capitalism, by unleashing a wronged hag upon her; in this case, the potentially compromised heroine threatens to turn into that classic blood-soaked, Raimi-approved shrieking hag herself. Both movies depict men behaving in a venal and immoral fashion, nonetheless overshadowed by (or at least in competition with) the unladylike transgressions of women's base designs. As with Drag, this doesn't ruin the fun. If anything, it gives the movie an exploitation-friendly edge that many contemporary thrillers are far too self-congratulatory to even consider. McAdams and O'Brien both give performances that could be described as interestingly caricatured while still managing to find a surprising emotional range from scene to scene. That's especially true of McAdams, who locates genuine hurt and anguish whenever Linda seems ready to heel-turn, and also breaks bad with abandon when required. Linda becomes an indelible and complicated character in a way that the lead of Drag Me To Hell never quite achieves. Send Help doesn't merge Raimi's fever-pitch flourishes with human frailties, whether dramatic or comic, quite so well as Spider-Man 2 or Army Of Darkness. As only his second non-IP movie since the original Spider-Man, it's actually a reminder of how relatively few horror thrillers he's made with this kind of semi-realistic grounding (that nonetheless doesn't prevent the camera from careening around the sometimes soundstage-like environment when called upon).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Laura Lancaster and Nick Pepper are leaving the studio, while Netflix alum Blair Fetter joins as head of genre series. A few months into his time as head of global television for Amazon MGM Studios, Peter Friedlander is undertaking a significant reorganization of the TV team. Under former head Vernon Sanders, Amazon MGM's TV division had been structured around wholly owned series and co-productions. 'Red, White & Royal Wedding': Uma Thurman, Sarah Shahi Among Returning Cast as Sequel Starts Filming Timothy Busfield Edited Out of Amazon MGM Rom-Com 'You Deserve Each Other' Amid Child Sex Abuse Allegations Laura Lancaster and Nick Pepper, who had headed the co-production and wholly owned teams previously, are departing their roles but are in talks to enter producing deals at Amazon MGM, Friedlander noted. Netflix alum Blair Fetter will join Amazon MGM on Feb. 2 as head of worldbuilding and genre series, reporting to Friedlander. Newly hired unscripted head Jenn Levy and animation head Melissa Wolfe will continue to lead those groups; Fetter, Levy and Wolfe will all report directly to Friedlander. “By organizing around these specialized genres with dedicated leadership, we will move faster, make sharper creative decisions, and continue to build groundbreaking series that define the future of television,” Friedlander wrote in his memo (read it in full, below). The reorg brings Amazon MGM's structure into line with many other studios whose development and current teams run along genre lines. Fetter was most recently head of spectacle series at Netflix and has worked on series including Stranger Things, Ozark and The Queen's Gambit, among others. All,I'm writing to announce a new organizational structure for the Scripted Series team at Amazon MGM Studios, designed to accelerate our mission of delivering exceptional original television that captivates audiences worldwide. In addition, Nick has built a bold and distinctive animation slate, including Secret Level, Hazbin Hotel, Helluva Boss, and two of Critical Role's premium campaigns, Vox Machina and Mighty Nein.With this transition, I'm pleased to announce that Blair Fetter is joining Amazon MGM Studios as Head of Worldbuilding & Genre Series, reporting to me starting February 2nd. Tom Lieber and Matt King will report to Blair, continuing to focus on our Worldbuilding genre programming.As previously announced, Jenn Levy has joined as Head of Unscripted and Documentary Television. Melissa Wolfe will continue as Head of Animation, now reporting directly to me. With these changes, Lauren O'Connor, Head of Global IP, will now report directly to me. Lindsay Sloane, who leads MGM Television, Scripted Series, will also continue to report to me.By organizing around these specialized genres with dedicated leadership, we will move faster, make sharper creative decisions, and continue to build groundbreaking series that define the future of television. I'm energized by the opportunities ahead and confident in this team's ability to deliver for our customers and the creative community in which we work.Thanks all, Peter Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

When Rob Reiner cast Kathy Bates in “Misery,” there was a sense that lightning had struck twice. Not just because Bates was unknown as an actor, but because Reiner truly understood how to use a performer's perceived softness as its own weapon of suspense. Rachel McAdams is not a secret waiting to be unearthed. Related Stories Paul Feig on Channeling His Inner Hitchcock and Sergio Leone for the Hit Thriller ‘The Housemaid' ‘Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass' Review: David Wain Delivers One of His Funniest Films Ever It's got the gruesome ingenuity from his breakout debut, “The Evil Dead,” fused with the pop-comic precision that made him a revolutionary force for Sony's original “Spider-Man.” Ghastly without being grim and morally queasy without being mean, “Send Help” delivers its biggest laughs and gasps through brilliantly managed physical suffering. That includes what may be Raimi's finest puke gag since “Drag Me to Hell,” and a vintage gross-out approach to black comedy that's executed with the confidence of someone who knows where to draw his line in the sand. Her new boss, Bradley Preston (O'Brien), is a passive-aggressive tyrant with “American Psycho” instincts. But boundless entitlement and a gift for micromanagement can't save him when their plane crashes in the Gulf of Thailand. The kind of boss who would crawl inside your abdomen instead of turning down the air-conditioning, Bradley suddenly can't function without Linda. Raimi and screenwriters Damian Shannon and Mark Swift (“Freddy vs. Jason,” “Friday the 13th,” “Baywatch”) waste no time turning the island into a pressure cooker. At first, the setting feels pulled from grounded survival dramas like “Cast Away” or “The Impossible.” But Linda, armed with decades of “Survivor” knowledge and the quiet competence of someone who's always cleaning up other people's messes, thrives with cartoonish joy. Shortly after washing ashore, she builds shelter, starts a fire, collects water, goes fishing, and adopts a breezy efficiency that borders on smug. Soon, she's carved her name into a cup and woven herself a backpack: territorial gestures that mirror the small ways she once claimed space in the office. His attempts at survival are so inept they feel like a self-own, and the jungle's creatures (rendered with goofy digital effects that are visually consistent enough to feel acceptable) seem to exist solely to punish him. Caught somewhere between “Office Space” and “I Spit on Your Grave,” it's a workplace nightmare stripped to its rawest, most relatable revenge components. As Linda Liddle (a name that even sounds cut from the same cloth as Annie Wilkes), she's still an impossibly luminous presence. Introduced trudging around her sad little apartment in an oversized robe, talking to a pet cockatiel, McAdams can't hide who audiences know her to be. Even after colliding with Bradley on his first day as CEO and promptly spitting a tuna fish sandwich on him, Linda remains quietly glamorous and adorable. But McAdams' performance is so rigorously committed that dissonance becomes the point and her oceanside glow-up steers the film's second half. Trapped but still killing it, Linda isn't just retaliating; she's recalibrating a balance that's been wrong for years. When Bradley and his C-suite cronies mock her “Survivor” audition tape on the flight over, hot tears stream down Linda's face. But by the time she's standing over Bradley's body on the beach, she's radiant with capability, embodying a reversal of audience expectations that's both satisfying and clever. In the end, McAdams' sexiness isn't incidental, but integral to how she's been misjudged. To his credit, O'Brien never overplays Bradley as the monster. He's the kind of man who thinks he's charming because his employees can't say no to him, and Raimi shows strong tonal control in how much he lets Linda punish him — allowing Bradley's torment to feel earned rather than sadistic, even as he blubbers, vomits, and otherwise pays dearly. The parable that follows him could be ripped straight from “Tales from the Crypt,” offering a bold outline to a campy grudge match that shines brightest in its ethically gray framing. Whether it's Linda's skin warming into a confident tan, or Bradley's expensive dress shoes growing thick with grime, Raimi almost seems to sit alongside us, gently suggesting whose side we're on and when. Conversations between Linda and Bradley play like a high-stakes battle of wits, but their director is never so far away as to make the match feel lawless. The result — labor satire that hits without feeling like a prestige think piece — is uncanny in its timeliness. Linda's isolated, bachelorette existence and the casual judgment she faces for it mirrors a world that's increasingly hostile to women who choose to be single (though her backstory proves more complex than that). If “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” proved Raimi could juggle infinite self-referential, superhero jokes, “Send Help” applies that same dexterity to a more universally funny concept. In an era where originality struggles to be rewarded, this feels like a genuine studio win for genre fans. Crescendoing into a perfect punchline (one that satisfies whether you see it coming or not), Raimi doesn't pull punches — but he doesn't swing aimlessly either. Still, these are quibbles, not cracks, and they're easy to ignore. Wickedly lovable with the potential to be timeless, “Send Help” is controlled delirium microwaved on high heat. At 66, Raimi reminds us who he was when he made horror-comedy history with “Evil Dead II,” and more importantly, why his voice still matters. Watching McAdams snarl and strategize, you can practically imagine how much fun Raimi would've had handing her a chainsaw in the '80s. He still splatters her with blood here, proving it's never too late for the right collaboration, and that neither he nor McAdams should ever be underestimated. From 20th Century Studios, “Send Help” is in theaters January 30.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Amazon MGM Studios‘ new Head of Global Television Peter Friedlander is putting his stamp by restructuring the studio's scripted series team and bringing in Blair Fetter who previously worked with him at Netflix. Leaving as part of the reorg are the two top scripted executives under previous Amazon MGM Studios TV head Vernon Sanders: Laura Lancaster as Head of US SVOD TV Development and Series – Co-Productions and Nick Pepper as Head of US SVOD TV Development and Series – Wholly Owned. Both are in talks for producing deals with the streaming studio. “Effective immediately, we are transitioning from our current structure — split between Wholly Owned and Co-Productions — to a streamlined, genre-based organization (drama & comedy, worldbuilding, animation, and unscripted),” Friedlander said in a memo announcing the changes, which you can read in full below. The realignment, which bears some resemblance to Netflix's scripted series executive structure, impacts both development and current. Trump White House Hosts Amazon MGM's 'Melania' Screening As Nationwide Furor Intensifies Over Federal Agent's Killing Of Minneapolis Man Fetter, who starts February 2, will be Head of Worldbuilding & Genre Series. That is right up his alley as Fetter most recently oversaw Spectacle Series at Netflix. Tom Lieber, Head, Co-Production Genre Development and Current Series under Lancaster, who has overseen The Boys universe, Fallout, and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, and Matt King, who was on Pepper's team, will continue to work on worldbuilding genre programming, now reporting to Fetter. A Head of Drama & Comedy Series will be named soon. Kara Smith, most recently Head, Co-Production Drama, Comedy Development and Current Series under Lancaster; Michael McDonald, Head of the Comedy and Drama Development – US SVOD TV Development and Series – Wholly Owned under Pepper; and Jen Chambers, Head of Creative Synergy & Development on Pepper's team, will be working across drama, comedy, and young adult programming under the new Head of Drama & Comedy. Smith has been involved in the development of some of Prime Video's biggest hits from outside studios, including The Summer I Turned Pretty and Reacher. Previously under Pepper, she will now be reporting directly to Friedlander. Also reporting to Friedlander is Jenn Levy, the Netflix alumna he recently brought in as the streamer's new Head of Unscripted and Documentary Television. The restructuring comes four months after former Netflix Head of UCAN (U.S. and Canada) Scripted Series Friedlander joined Amazon. He took time to familiarize himself with the TV studio's executive team and its development slate while plotting his strategy. While doing that, Friedlander has been keeping things largely close to the vest. Speculation about the pending reorg picked up momentum earlier this month as he is expected to present the new structure at a town hall that has been scheduled for later this week. Amazon MGM Studios' TV operations went through quite a few rounds of restructuring over the past several years with lines between programming areas drawn and redrawn to a point where many producers and agents felt confused whom to pitch a particular project. In doing so, he met with a number of executives – both internally and externally. “By organizing around these specialized genres with dedicated leadership, we will move faster, make sharper creative decisions, and continue to build groundbreaking series that define the future of television,” Friedlander said in the memo. “I'm energized by the opportunities ahead and confident in this team's ability to deliver for our customers and the creative community in which we work.” Pepper and Lancaster joined Amazon in 2021 and were named to their most recent roles in 2022 as part of a restructuring of the scripted team. Since then, Pepper has spearheaded the exploration of the MGM library of IP for television following Amazon's $8.5B acquisition of the 100-year-old studio, which has resulted in several greenlights to date, including Legally Blonde prequel Elle, Tomb Raider and Carrie. Lancaster was originally brought in to oversee the ongoing series for Prime Video. She and her team have shepherded several series that have gone to multiple seasons, with some growing season-to-season, most notably The Summer I Turned Pretty. Other shows under her purview included Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power, Fallout, Reacher, The Terminal List and We Were Liars. “Nick and Laura have been invaluable builders of our scripted series slate, and we are deeply grateful for their significant contributions to our success,” Friedlander said. During his Netflix tenure, Fetter worked on such series as Ozark, The Queen's Gambit, Stranger Things, BoJack Horseman, 3 Body Problem, Godless, Big Mouth, Haunting of Hill House and Death by Lightning. Fetter started as an assistant before being promoted to associate producer on the show. He made the move to Netflix six months after Friedlander had gotten there. Amazon MGM Studios' international originals, led by Nicole Clemens, falls under VP Kelly Day who reports to Mike Hopkins, Head of Prime Video & Amazon MGM, as does Friedlander. I'm writing to announce a new organizational structure for the Scripted Series team at Amazon MGM Studios, designed to accelerate our mission of delivering exceptional original television that captivates audiences worldwide. Effective immediately, we are transitioning from our current structure — split between Wholly Owned and Co-Productions — to a streamlined, genre-based organization (drama & comedy, worldbuilding, animation, and unscripted). Both Development and Current will reside in this new framework, which will provide greater clarity, specialized expertise, and clear ownership across our entire portfolio. Nick and Laura have been invaluable builders of our scripted series slate, and we are deeply grateful for their significant contributions to our success. Laura has made incredible contributions to Prime Video's programming successes as she and her team have led the creative oversight of The Summer I Turned Pretty, Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power, Fallout, Reacher, The Terminal List, The Better Sister, We Were Liars, amongst many others, as well as upcoming series such as Spider-Noir, Blade Runner 2099, Scarpetta, and God of War. In addition, Nick has built a bold and distinctive animation slate, including Secret Level, Hazbin Hotel, Helluva Boss, and two of Critical Role's premium campaigns, Vox Machina and Mighty Nein.With this transition, I'm pleased to announce that Blair Fetter is joining Amazon MGM Studios as Head of Worldbuilding & Genre Series, reporting to me starting February 2nd. Blair brings outstanding experience from Netflix, where he oversaw Spectacle Series and was essential to the success of shows such as Stranger Things, Ozark, The Queen's Gambit, Death by Lightning, BoJack Horseman, The Haunting of Hill House and 3 Body Problem. Melissa Wolfe will continue as Head of Animation, now reporting directly to me. For our Drama, Comedy, and Young Adult programming, Kara Smith, Michael McDonald, and Jen Chambers will report to me on an interim basis until we finalize the structure and put in place a new Head of Drama & Comedy Series. With these changes, Lauren O'Connor, Head of Global IP, will now report directly to me. By organizing around these specialized genres with dedicated leadership, we will move faster, make sharper creative decisions, and continue to build groundbreaking series that define the future of television. I'm energized by the opportunities ahead and confident in this team's ability to deliver for our customers and the creative community in which we work.Peter Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ye (formerly Kanye West) issued yet another apology, as Yeezy took out a full-page ad in the Jan. 26 edition of The Wall Street Journal, which saw him apologize to the Jewish community for his antisemitic hate speech in recent years. West also addressed the Black community, as well as “those I've hurt” due to his erratic behavior and outlandish declarations. “Twenty-five years ago, I was in a car accident that broke my jaw and caused injury to the right frontal lobe of my brain,” he wrote. West explained that the brain injury wasn't properly diagnosed and led to mental health issues such as bipolar disorder. (A 2023 case report titled “Bipolar Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury” published by the National Institutes of Health noted that “people with TBI are 1.28 times more likely to have bipolar disorder,” especially if the injury happened between the ages of 11 and 15. The report also noted that “it is believed that TBI causes brain inflammation, which can lead to mental health issues.”) “Bipolar disorder comes with its own defense system,” he added. You endured fear, confusion, humiliation and the exhaustion of trying to love someone who was, at times, unrecognizable. Looking back, I became detached from my true self.” Digging deeper, West addressed his use of the swastika, which he had put on Yeezy merchandise. “In that fractured state, I gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika, and even sold T-shirts bearing it,” he wrote. Ye noted in his ad that he's “committed to accountability,” and emphatically stated that he's “not a Nazi” and has “love for Jewish people.” “One of the difficult aspects of having bipolar type-1 are the disconnected moments — many of which I still cannot recall —  that led to poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body-experience. “It does not excuse what I did, though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. The Anti-Defamation League called Ye's apology “long overdue” in a statement shared with Billboard. We wish him well on the road to recovery.” “I am so sorry to have let you down. In early 2025, I fell into a four-month long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life,” he revealed. “As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn't want to be here anymore.” West added he has discovered a “newfound” clarity in life, along with an “effective” regimen of medication mixed with therapy and exercise to continue to make strides in his battle. “As I find my new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise, and clean living, I have newfound, much-needed clarity. I am pouring my energy into positive, meaningful art: music, clothing, design, and other new ideas to help the world,” he concluded. Ye's series of antisemitic remarks in 2022 led to companies such as Balenciaga, Universal Music Group, Adidas and Gap all cutting ties with him. He's slated to make his return to the stage as well later this month with a pair of shows (Jan. 30, Jan. 31) in Mexico City.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After years of inflammatory social-media posts and antisemitic invective, Kanye West has taken out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal that traces his erratic behavior to his 2002 car crash. West, who now goes by Ye, published the open letter, “To Those I've Hurt,” as he prepares to release a new album, Bully. He claims that various medical issues over the years—which share characteristics with bipolar 1 disorder and autism, he says—could be linked to right frontal lobe damage from the crash that inspired his breakout single “Through the Wire.” He also describes “disconnected moments” that have left him in a state akin to “an out-of-body experience,” adding, “It does not excuse what I did, though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite.” West blames his turn in mental health on a medical oversight after the crash. Comprehensive scans were not done, neurological exams were limited, and the possibility of a frontal-lobe injury was never raised. Soon after the platform's acquisition by Elon Musk later that year, West posted an image on X of a swastika inside the Star of David, leading to another temporary ban. Around the same time, he sold swastika T-shirts through a custom website and appeared on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' InfoWars alongside the white supremacist, antisemite, and Holocaust denier Nicholas J. Fuentes. West praised Hitler and the Nazis, echoing rhetoric he has reportedly espoused in private for many years. In February 2025, West returned to X and posted a series of comments that were homophobic, racist, misogynistic, and ableist, reiterating his pro-Nazi remarks. That May, he released “Heil Hitler” and the similarly themed “WW3,” songs that were removed by streaming services but widely shared on X. He writes now, “In early 2025, I fell into a four-month long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life. As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn't want to be here anymore.” In late 2024, two women sued West, one for sexual battery and the other for sexual assault, over alleged incidents earlier in his career. The woman who brought the former lawsuit, West's former assistant Lauren Pisciotta, said he had drugged her at a party thrown by Sean “Diddy” Combs, whom West defended in his February 2025 posts. In an updated filing, Pisciotta claimed last July that she had gone into hiding after a “swatting” campaign that she believes West initiated. West does not address allegations of sexual misconduct in his letter. As part of what he describes as a “newfound, much-needed clarity,” he tries to make amends for his undermining of the Black Lives Matter movement—presumably with regard to provocations such as wearing a M.A.G.A. I am so sorry to have let you down. West concludes, despite conflicting diagnoses, that bipolar disorder is the cause of his behavior. “I have found comfort in Reddit forums of all places,” he writes. “Different people speaking about manic depressive episodes of a similar nature. It's not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day and being told by the so-called best doctors in the world that I am not bipolar, but merely experiencing ‘symptoms of autism. He adds, “I'm not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness. I write today simply to ask for your patience and understanding as I find my way home.” Read the full ad, which is paid for by Yeezy and co-signed by company CFO Hussein Lalani, below. Twenty-five years ago, I was in a car accident that broke my jaw and caused injury to the right frontal lobe of my brain. Comprehensive scans were not done, neurological exams were limited, and the possibility of a frontal-lobe injury was never raised. Bipolar disorder comes with its own defense system. It's easy for people to joke and laugh it off when in fact this is a very serious debilitating disease you can die from. According to the World Health Organization and Cambridge University, people with bipolar disorder have a life expectancy that is shortened by ten to fifteen years on average, and a 2x–3x higher all-cause mortality rate than the general population. This is on par with severe heart disease, type-1 diabetes, HIV, and cancer—all lethal and fatal if left untreated. The scariest thing about this disorder is how persuasive it is when it tells you: You don't need help. You endured fear, confusion, humiliation, and the exhaustion of trying to love someone who was, at times, unrecognizable. Looking back, I became detached from my true self. In that fractured state, I gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika, and even sold t-shirts bearing it. One of the difficult aspects of having bipolar type-1 are the disconnected moments – many of which I still cannot recall—that lead to poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body experience. It does not excuse what I did, though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I am so sorry to have let you down. In early 2025, I fell into a four-month long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life. As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn't want to be here anymore. Having bipolar disorder is not a state of constant mental illness. Hitting rock bottom a few months ago, my wife encouraged me to finally get help. I have found comfort in Reddit forums of all places. It's not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day and being told by the so-called best doctors in the world that I am not bipolar, but merely experiencing “symptoms of autism.” In my mania, I lost complete sight of that. As I find my new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise and clean living, I have newfound, much-needed clarity. I am pouring my energy into positive, meaningful art: music, clothing, design, and other new ideas to help the world.

[Editor's note: This interview contains spoilers for “The Housemaid.”] One of the most delightful surprises of the holiday movie season last year was director Paul Feig‘s “The Housemaid,” a thrill ride based on the novel by Freida McFadden about a housekeeper (Sydney Sweeney) who gets more than she bargained for when she takes a live-in job with a dysfunctional wealthy couple (Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar). Feig has long expressed admiration for Alfred Hitchcock's work, and in screenwriter Rebecca Sonnenshine's adaptation of McFadden's bestseller, he discovered the perfect vehicle to, as Hitchcock was fond of saying, “play the audience like a piano.” Related Stories ‘Send Help' Review: Sam Raimi Manages the Hell Out of Rachel McAdams' Best Comedy Since ‘Mean Girls' ‘Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass' Review: David Wain Delivers One of His Funniest Films Ever “When I first read the script and then the book, I thought, this is so much fun to really make an audience root for everything they should not be rooting for in the first hour and get them really passionate about it,” Feig told IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “Obviously every filmmaker hopes to make things that you'll want to watch a few times, but knowing this has that twist, it's really fun to know that we're seeding things in the first half that, if you watch this a second time, you'll interpret in a completely different way,” Feig said, adding that the script's potential for manipulating the audience was a large part of its appeal. They were down on Spielberg because he was ‘manipulative.' And I was like, ‘Guys, that's what movies are. “I am very slavish to test screenings,” Feig said, noting that he tends to screen his films for audiences as early in the process as possible so he can gauge what's landing and what isn't. “I have 10 weeks [to put together] a director's cut where no one can mess with me. I'll do my first recruited screening at about five weeks, just to say, okay, I think this is working, it's all together now, but I don't want to fall in love with anything.” Feig not only records audio of the crowd reactions but also video via night vision goggles. “I find night vision to be incredibly helpful because you can see if people are watching passively versus when they start sitting forward and looking around at each other.” “But you can't shoot this movie out of a cannon. We tried [with an opening flash-forward to the crime scene], but we found with an audience that it took the fun out of them discovering this world.” Feig looked to “Once Upon a Time in the West” and its meticulously calibrated structure. “That movie's brilliant in its slow doling out of information,” Feig said. “It's the best way to do a movie where you're trying to pull people along.” If Leone was an inspiration in terms of pace, Hitchcock remained the big influence in terms of tone. “What I love about Hitchcock is he always lets you have fun. I've watched so many thrillers in my life that take themselves so seriously that I don't feel there's room for fun. We're treating the story seriously, but there's something wonderfully absurd about this dangerous situation.” Feig changed his approach when he worked on the TV show “Arrested Development” and was forced to fly by the seat of his pants. “They would get you the scripts so late,” he said. Input from his collaborators also led Feig to one of the best needle drops in “The Housemaid,” for Amanda Seyfried's dance of liberation to Kelly Clarkson's “Since You Been Gone.” Initially, Feig used Bob Seger's “Old Time Rock and Roll” as an homage to “Risky Business,” but when he screened the film, the cue didn't work. “No one in the young audience gives a shit about that.” Feig polled the women who worked on the movie to ask what they would put on to celebrate breaking up with somebody or getting out of a toxic relationship, and the Kelly Clarkson song won in a landslide. Relying not only on test audiences but his cast and crew is central to Feig's filmmaking philosophy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zach Braff is opening up about how the upcoming “Scrubs” revival is honoring the late Sam Lloyd while bringing fans back to Sacred Heart Hospital. In a new interview with Esquire, Braff revealed that the ABC revival includes a meaningful tribute to Lloyd, who portrayed Ted Buckland for nine seasons on the original series. “There's a new bar that we all go to, and we named it Lloyd's Tavern,” Braff shared. Braff added that the cast is also planning a dedicated tribute episode. It's hard to do this show without him,” he said. “And our plan is to most definitely have an episode that is a tribute to him.” Braff explained that it's still unclear whether that tribute will appear in the first revival season, which consists of nine episodes, or be saved for a potential second season. Lloyd died in 2020 due to complications from lung cancer. Judy Reyes reprises her role as Nurse Carla Espinosa, while John C. McGinley returns as Dr. Perry Cox in a recurring capacity. Two longtime fan favorites — Neil Flynn's Janitor and Ken Jenkins' Dr. Bob Kelso — are not currently confirmed for the revival's initial nine-episode order. Braff explained that their absence is tied to story logistics and timing, not interest. “The true answer is, if we're blessed to have a second season, absolutely,” Braff said. But do we have the bandwidth in the first nine episodes to get to it all and service a story that would be worthy of Ken and Neil?” The ABC revival also introduces a new group of Sacred Heart staff and interns. Vanessa Bayer joins as Sibby, who runs a wellness program for hospital faculty and staff, while Joel Kim Booster plays attending physician Dr. Eric Park. Additional recurring roles include Michael James Scott as co-charge nurse, Francois Dubois, and X Mayo as co-charge nurse, Pippa Raymond. “If I saw two guys in their late 40s or early 50s doing ‘World's Most Giant Doctor,' I'd go, ‘What the (expletive) is going on? “To see what that friendship looks like at their age, and take a comedic look at what medicine has become since those kids started out as interns — that's the goal.” Medicine has changed, interns have changed, but their bromance has stood the test of time.” Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, apologized for his years of antisemitic and other controversial comments in a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal. In the lengthy note, titled “To Those I've Hurt” (and paid for by Yeezy), West issued his apology alongside a discussion of his battle with bipolar disorder. Noting that he was not properly diagnosed until 2023, West linked his mental health struggles to undiagnosed and unexamined head trauma he might've suffered in the 2002 car crash that shattered his jaw (and inspired his debut solo hit, “Through the Wire”). You endured fear, confusion, humiliation, and the exhaustion of trying to love someone who was, at times, unrecognizable. Describing what it's like to be in a manic episode, West said, “You don't think you're sick,” and it feels like “everyone else is overreacting. West went on to admit that in this “fractured state I gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika, and even sold T-shirts bearing it.” (West started selling the swastika merch on his website last February, while a few months later he released a song called “Heil Hitler.” But even before that, there had been other public incidents involving praise for Adolf Hitler and the promotion of Nazi iconography, along with numerous antisemitic outbursts. Rolling Stone has also reported that West's fascination with Hitler and Nazis goes back several decades.) In his apology, West continued: “One of the difficult aspects of having biopolar type-1 are the disconnected moments — many of which I still cannot recall — that lead to poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body experience. West said he has been searching for a “new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise and clean living.” He also said he has found comfort in Reddit forums, where people share their own experiences of “being in manic or depressive episodes of a similar nature.” West said, “I read their stories and realized that I was not alone.” Kanye West Apologizes for Antisemitic Outbursts: ‘I Lost Touch With Reality' Hear Bob Weir's Final Rolling Stone Interview: ‘I Look Forward to Dying' Natasha Lyonne Reveals Relapse After Decades of Sobriety: ‘Recovery Is a Longlong Process' Kanye West Fails to Derail Lawsuit in Epic Saga Over $57 Million Malibu Mansion Suspected Shooter in Bondi Beach Attack Charged With 15 Counts of Murder In closing out his apology, West said he has found some “much-needed clarity” and is putting his “energy into positive, meaningful art: music, clothing, design, and other new ideas to help the world.” He concluded: “I'm not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness. This is not the first time West has apologized for his behavior and offensive comments. In December 2023, after several years' worth of antisemitic comments, he published a note on Instagram, written in Hebrew, that read, “I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community for any unintended outbursts, caused by my words or actions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“You've got Damon Albarn sat with Jonathan Glazer on one table. Those luminaries were all there to work on HELP(2), a compilation album supporting the charity organization War Child UK, where Clarke serves as head of music. Out March 6, it's a majorly star-studded affair, with new songs and covers by Olivia Rodrigo, Cameron Winter, Wet Leg, Sampha, Arlo Parks, Depeche Mode, Big Thief, and many others. Founded in the early Nineties by a pair of filmmakers who were horrified by the violence of the Bosnian Civil War, War Child provides services to children who are affected by global conflict — meaning not just the immediate needs of food, water, and shelter, but also longer-term support for mental health and education. “That had a huge effect for the charity,” Clarke says. “At that point, they were doing minor things, delivering supplies behind siege lines in Sarajevo. The idea for a new Help album had been percolating since around Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “Since that moment, we've seen escalation of violence in the Middle East. “There's been a real feeling from the artist community of wanting to do something.” The project gained speed in late 2024, when producer James Ford came on board, followed quickly by Arctic Monkeys, with whom he's worked closely for many years. “Anything James touches turns to gold,” drummer Matt Helders tells Rolling Stone. A live album from that concert, released two years later, yielded even more funds for children affected by war. When the band met up at Abbey Road toward the end of 2025, it was their first time together in a studio in a few years. They decided to revisit an unfinished song that Turner had been toying with for more than a decade; Helders estimates that it first surfaced “in Joshua Tree, when we used to record out there.” (Dedicated Monkeys scholars can deduce that it probably entered the picture during the sessions for 2009's Humbug or 2013's AM, both partially recorded in the California desert.) “He never got to scratch the itch of completing this song,” Helders says. “It was just one of those that wouldn't go away in his head, I think. Will 2026 Be the Year of Album Three for These Artists? Olivia Rodrigo Celebrates ‘Drivers License' Anniversary With David Byrne Cover, Exclusive Vinyl Now, they tried taking another run at “Opening Night” in the style they've evolved into on later albums like Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino and The Car. Back in 1996, when Pulp won the Mercury Prize for their era-defining album Different Class, they donated their winnings to War Child, feeling that The Help Album ought to have won instead. This time, Blur guitarist Graham Coxon dropped by Abbey Road to sit in with the indie band English Teacher, while Albarn teamed up with Chatten and rapper Kae Tempest to polish off a new song called “Flags.” “It was quite major chords, which is unusual for me,” the Blur/Gorillaz singer tells Rolling Stone. “So when conversation of War Child came, I thought it was quite a good thing to present as an idea.” Albarn is a fan of both Chatten and Tempest, calling them both “huge talents,” and he was delighted to form an impromptu trio with them in the studio. “Flags” wound up featuring guitar from Johnny Marr, Portishead's Adrian Utley, and Dave Okumu, as well as backing vocals from Cocker, Barât, Declan McKenna, Marika Hackman, the members of Black Country, New Road, and several other musicians who were around that day. “We did it all together, like a band,” Albarn says. “When you do music for charity, it can be a bit trite somehow. “At one point, they'd be sat next to Damon on the piano stool, or sticking a camera up Jarvis' nose in the vocal booth in Studio Three. So War Child brought in top producers including Marta Salogni and Catherine Marks to help out, and Ford continued to provide as much remote input as possible.

With “Opening Night” out now and the album arriving on streaming services soon, he's looking forward to seeing how fans respond to all the music that got made at Abbey Road for War Child. “The wonderful thing is, these rights are going to support children affected by conflict in perpetuity,” Clarke says.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The indecision at least showcases some consistency, though, in that each approach is equally dissatisfying. Directed by Ángel Manuel Soto (Blue Beetle) and written by Jonathan Tropper (showrunner of Momoa and Bautista's See), The Wrecking Crew pitches a familiar idea: Two burly boys of opposing temperament have to team up to solve a crime. The Wrecking Crew may initially insist that James is a straightlaced Navy SEAL hardass teaching recruits in Hawaii and that Jonny is a drunken biker cop in Oklahoma, but when their dad is murdered, they reunite to figure out what happened and merge into a single stunted Bad Boy living through two bodies. Here, Jonny and James are the exact same kind of vanilla badass, bumbling through a mystery clear to everyone but them and where each new character slots easily into a predetermined screenplay type. There's the local cop (Stephen Root), who serves as their surrogate Lethal Weapon captain. There's the shady businessman (Claes Bang with a weebish topknot) and family-friend politician (Temuera Morrison), obviously in cahoots. If this looks like a bullet list you scribble down the hour before a big presentation about your Momoa-Bautista team-up movie, that's representative of what it feels like watching The Wrecking Crew. The duo muscle through swaths of story with a tone that is clear only in its aggression, interlacing crime cliches and left-field emotional melodrama with dick-swinging stupidity—a cheese-grater moment out of Evil Dead Rise and a teeth-scattering pseudo-curbstomp are matched by wit like “Fuck you, fat Jackie Chan!” and “Oh look, it's fat John Cena.” It's The Nice Guys if the script got a Spike TV rewrite and the leads had been replaced by two big bags of gas station beef jerky. The butt-rock score from Bobby Krlic is, at least, fitting. Tropper's script gestures towards self-awareness, with every other side character commenting on the leads' undeniable dumb-jock aura. And yet, though they have every opportunity to rebel against this—and Bautista, at least, is ostensibly playing a by-the-book military man—they fall into the stereotype without over-embracing it. Soto's set pieces are similarly underwhelming—scenes of storming a compound and outrunning a helicopter are as derivative as yet another fight scene mimicking the Oldboy hallway. The Hawaiian setting, dueling-brother premise, and egoless charisma of its leads (both Bautista and Momoa made their superhero characters into enjoyably dense scene-stealers, not to mention their abilities to get silly in kids' movies) offered plenty to set The Wrecking Crew apart, both from its brainless-action contemporaries and its straight-to-streaming star vehicle peers. But outside of some local slang and sandy shooting locations, there's little that's memorable—even the rancid vibes and intangible action aren't especially notable for a two-hander like this. It's rarely the case where a film would actually be improved by leaning into its worst impulses, but if The Wrecking Crew had gone full tank-top cinema, it might have at least felt like its makers were having fun making a mess.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fans are swooning over the way longtime Hallmark actress Laura Vandervoort has started 2026 — with a fresh outlook, bold energy, and a hairdo to match. The “Melt My Heart This Christmas” star surprised fans with several new social media photos revealing that her signature long blonde hair is now a rich brunette. Although Vandervoort posted a couple of images earlier in the month with her dark hair, it wasn't quite clear if the new look was for a movie role. On January 14, however, she posted a cheeky video of herself in the car, looking deadly serious as Blur's “Song 2” played in the background. As the band sang the lyrics — “It's not my problem / Woo-hoo / It's not my problem” — Vandervoort slipped on a pair of shades and flipped off the camera. In the caption, she wrote, “Mantra for 2026… 🖕🏻🫶🏻” and added that her hair color was “By The Amazing” celebrity hairstylist Annastasia Cucullo, who commented, “Omg the hair looks great!! She captioned the photo, “Blondes may have ‘more' fun but brunette's get [expletive] done 😏” Fans flooded Vandervoort's posts with heart and fire emoji, as well as praise for her new look. Someone else called the “Supergirl” and “Smallville” alum a “SuperBrunette” and another exclaimed, “saaaxyyye! Vandervoort tested out a light brunette look in November, posting a brief video of her with color that she told was a “temporary change” that she was considering making “permanent.” The couple, who met on a dating app, married in September, two years after getting engaged, per People. The ceremony and reception, held at the Langdon Hall Country House, Hotel & Spa in Ontario, Canada, was held three months after the couple were legally married in a “little backyard celebration” with their family and dogs, they told the outlet. “Miracle in Bethlehem, PA” star captioned one of her wedding posts, “We didn't do a traditional ceremony. Adam's very close friend Gerry Price was our officiant and spoke from the heart, our big sisters (Sarah & Sarah) gave their speeches/words of advice before our vows. Don't think I want to watch her anymore either! Why on earth would Hallmark post a video of one of their “stars” flipping people off??!! Whoever is running the social media for Hallmark should actually look at their posts — and watch the videos they embed — before posting. I totally agree with the others. To all the previous posters, judgy much? I don't think she was personally flipping any of you off, yes maybe not the best choice of picture to add to the article, but to not watch an actor because of of this one gesture. Not that it would matter to any of you, but I did read an article recently where she is having major fertility issues and maybe that was a gesture in response to what she is going through.
