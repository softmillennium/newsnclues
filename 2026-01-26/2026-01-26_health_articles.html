                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The glycocalyx emerges as an active endothelial system whose structure, metabolism, and shear-dependent regulation integrate mechanical forces with vascular signaling. Disruption of this system provides a unifying mechanism linking endothelial dysfunction to inflammation, barrier failure, and cardiometabolic disease. More recent research has debunked this reductionist view by elucidating the endothelial glycocalyx (eGCX), a complex, gel-like "glycoscape" that coats the luminal surface of endothelial cells. This article synthesizes recent research to present a comprehensive overview of the glycocalyx, detailing its molecular architecture and non-template-driven biosynthesis and highlighting how these processes connect vascular health to cellular metabolism. Furthermore, it unravels how the pathological "shedding" of this layer drives sepsis, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, and evaluates emerging therapeutic strategies, from sulodexide to synthetic glycoscapes, that aim to restore this fragile yet vital barrier. Its integrity is the defining feature of a healthy vascular interface. At the same time, its degradation is increasingly recognized as a trigger for diverse pathologies ranging from acute inflammation to chronic vascular disease.1 Extending from these proteoglycan cores are long, negatively charged GAG chains, predominantly heparan sulfate (50–90 %) and chondroitin sulfate, which create a vast reservoir for binding plasma ligands.1 Interwoven within this mesh is hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid), an extremely long, non-sulfated polymer that does not bind covalently to core proteins but instead interacts with surface receptors (e.g., CD44) to provide hydration and structural volume.1,2 Recent research highlights that, unlike most structural proteins (which are encoded in the host's DNA), the glycocalyx is synthesized through a complex, non-template-driven metabolic process.3 Specifically, laminar shear stress activates the transcription factor KLF2, which upregulates HAS2 expression and redistributes endothelial glucose flux from glycolysis toward UDP-sugar biosynthesis, thereby supplying substrates required for glycocalyx regeneration. Mechanotransduction (conversion of physical environmental cues into biochemical signals).1,3,5 A growing body of evidence indicates that the eGCX is not uniform across the body, with significant thickness and compositional heterogeneity among organs.1,5 In the renal glomerulus, the highly anionic glycocalyx contributes substantially to charge-selective filtration, and its degradation has been directly linked to albuminuria in both experimental and clinical studies. A 2025 meta-analysis confirmed that elevated plasma levels of Syndecan-1 are significantly associated with increased mortality in sepsis patients (Odds Ratio = 2.04), validating glycocalyx degradation as a prognostic indicator of endothelial injury.7 Traditional electron microscopy (EM) often dehydrates samples, causing glycocalyx collapse and underestimation of thickness. To overcome this, cryo-electron microscopy and Sidestream Dark Field (SDF) imaging are now used to preserve the hydrated endothelial surface layer in vivo.8 Recently, super-resolution techniques such as Resolution Enhancement by Sequential Imaging (RESI) combined with metabolic labeling have achieved ångström-level resolution, enabling visualization of individual sugar residues within intact cell-surface glycans.2 While earlier work emphasized visualization, the field is now shifting toward intervention. Bioengineers are also developing synthetic glycoscapes, engineered nanomaterials designed to reconstitute endothelial surface layers, representing a promising frontier for acute vascular protection and precision therapeutics.2 Hugo Francisco de Souza is a scientific writer based in Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An expert editorial suggests that widely used diabetes and obesity drugs may help close the long-standing mortality gap faced by people with serious mental illnesses by tackling cardiovascular risk and metabolic disease head-on. Editorial: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have potential to transform health outcomes for persons with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and other serious mental illnesses by lengthening healthspan and reducing excess and premature mortality. A recent editorial published in the journal Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy discussed that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) may potentially transform health outcomes for individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMIs). The authors emphasized that these agents are most likely to improve outcomes by addressing the cardiometabolic drivers of excess morbidity and mortality rather than replacing established psychiatric treatments. Since then, several GLP-1 mono-agonists have been approved, along with tirzepatide, the first dual GLP-1 and glucose insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist. Beyond T2D and weight management in individuals with overweight or obesity, GLP-1 receptor agonists are approved for metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis in people with moderate or advanced fibrosis, obstructive sleep apnea in obese adults, reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and slowing progression of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular mortality in adults with both chronic kidney disease and T2D. These formulations may ease barriers related to manufacturing, supply chains, and access. There is a broad consensus that GLP-1 receptor agonists have transformed the management of T2D, obesity, and related morbidity and have been associated with reduced progression of renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in people with metabolic disorders. Individuals with SMIs experience premature and excess mortality, with years of life lost often estimated between 5 and 25 years, largely due to earlier onset and substantially higher rates of CVD. Affordable, scalable, and effective interventions are therefore essential to increase healthspan and reduce cardiovascular-related mortality among people with SMIs. Each condition for which GLP-1 receptor agonists are approved contributes differently to cardiometabolic risk and healthspan loss in this population. In addition, several agents are in mid- or late-stage development for chronic diseases such as peripheral artery disease and atherosclerotic heart disease, which disproportionately affect individuals with SMIs. GLP-1 receptor agonists are recommended for managing weight gain associated with psychotropic medications when discontinuation of psychiatric treatment is not feasible. Preliminary evidence also suggests a potential protective effect against lithium-induced nephrotoxicity, a condition for which no approved therapy currently exists. Additionally, several GLP-1 receptor agonists are being developed or repurposed for the treatment of alcohol, tobacco, and opioid use disorders. Preclinical studies, small controlled trials, and observational research further suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists may have beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of mood disorders and in psychopathology domains that substantially impair quality of life, including cognitive dysfunction and anhedonia. Several safety considerations are particularly relevant for individuals with SMIs. For example, the constipating effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists may interact with gastrointestinal motility disturbances caused by psychotropic medications. Clinicians should also consider the increased risks of pancreatitis and sarcopenia, conditions that disproportionately affect people with SMIs. Furthermore, GLP-1 receptor agonists that are renally eliminated, such as lixisenatide and exenatide, are contraindicated in severe renal disease, which is more prevalent in this population. Although early pharmacovigilance reports suggested a possible association with suicidality, larger subsequent studies have not demonstrated a causal link, though ongoing monitoring remains advisable. Overall, individuals with SMIs account for a disproportionate share of years of life lost and disability-adjusted life years. Despite decades of advances in psychopharmacology, the mortality gap between the general population and people with SMIs has not meaningfully narrowed. Therapeutic strategies that directly reduce mortality and extend healthspan are therefore urgently needed. In this context, GLP-1 receptor agonists represent one of the most promising pharmacological classes, particularly if challenges related to cost, equitable access, reimbursement policy, and supply constraints are addressed. Prioritizing individuals with SMIs within fair allocation frameworks may help reduce excess and premature mortality in this vulnerable population in the near term.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A massive nationwide study shows that lighting up before age 20 leaves a lasting cardiovascular imprint, intensifying the damage of smoking and raising the risk of heart attack, stroke, and early death well into adulthood. Study: Early age at smoking initiation is associated with elevated cardiovascular disease and mortality risk in a nationwide population-based cohort. In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers investigated whether the age at which people begin smoking is independently associated with future risks of myocardial infarction (MI), combined cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and stroke. Individuals who started smoking at younger ages, particularly before 20 years, had substantially higher risks of death, stroke, and MI compared with later starters, even at the same level of cumulative smoking exposure. This suggests an additional risk beyond total smoking dose as measured by pack-years, while acknowledging that initiation age and lifetime exposure remain closely related behaviors. Smoking is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide and remains a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, including MI and stroke. Extensive evidence shows that greater cumulative smoking exposure, measured in pack-years, increases cardiovascular risk. However, this dose-response relationship is not entirely linear, as even light smoking can substantially elevate risk, suggesting that using pack-years as an indicator may not fully capture smoking-related harm. Age at smoking initiation has emerged as a potential additional determinant of long-term health outcomes. Early initiation is associated with higher adult mortality and morbidity, possibly due to heightened biological vulnerability during development and long-lasting behavioral effects such as stronger nicotine dependence. Despite this, prior studies on the effects of age at initiation on cardiovascular outcomes have yielded inconsistent findings, often limited by small sample sizes or inadequate adjustment for confounding factors. Researchers investigated whether early smoking initiation independently increases mortality and cardiovascular risks and whether it modifies the effects of cumulative smoking exposure. The study included 9,295,979 adults above the age of 20 who were part of the National Health Screening Program in 2009 and had no prior history of stroke, MI, or end-stage kidney disease. Smoking information was self-reported and included age at initiation, current or former smoking status, and cumulative exposure in pack-years, defined as the product of packs of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked. Participants were categorized based on initiation age and smoking exposure. Additional analyses used alternative thresholds and a composite measure of pack-years divided by initiation age. Participants were followed until incident MI, stroke, death, or the end of 2018. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for each outcome, adjusting for major cardiovascular risk factors and testing interactions between age at initiation and cumulative smoking exposure. Over approximately nine years of follow-up, all smoker groups showed higher probabilities of cardiovascular events and mortality compared with nonsmokers. The highest risks were observed in individuals who both started smoking early and accumulated heavy exposure of 20 or more pack-years. Compared with nonsmokers, individuals who started smoking early and accumulated heavy exposure had more than double the risk of MI (HR 2.43), a markedly increased risk of stroke (HR 1.78), combined stroke or MI (HR 2.00), and elevated all-cause mortality (HR 1.82). These risks were significantly higher than those observed in smokers with similar pack-years who started smoking later in life. Earlier initiation was linked to progressively higher cardiovascular risk, even after adjusting for total pack-years. Significant interactions indicated that the harmful effects of greater smoking exposure were amplified when smoking began at younger ages. These patterns were consistent across subgroups defined by sex, metabolic health, smoking status, and different exposure thresholds. Associations with all-cause mortality were directionally similar but generally weaker than those observed for cardiovascular outcomes, particularly among younger participants. The authors note that this may reflect limited follow-up time for mortality endpoints. This nationwide study demonstrates that starting smoking at a younger age substantially increases the risk of MI and stroke after statistical adjustment for cumulative smoking exposure, and that early initiation intensifies the cardiovascular harm associated with heavier smoking. These findings suggest heightened vulnerability from adolescence into early adulthood, while remaining consistent with an observational, non-causal interpretation. Key strengths include the exceptionally large sample size, long follow-up, and detailed adjustment for clinical, behavioral, and socioeconomic confounders, allowing robust assessment of interactions between initiation age and smoking intensity. However, limitations include reliance on self-reported smoking data, potential recall bias, lack of information on smoking changes over time or duration of cessation, and unmeasured confounders such as diet, family history, and genetic risk. The cohort was predominantly male and Asian, which may limit generalizability. These findings indicate that preventing young people from starting smoking, particularly before the age of 20, could have substantial effects on reducing cardiovascular disease and premature death at the population level.
