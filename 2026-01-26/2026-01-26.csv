            Chris Madel, a Minneapolis lawyer who represented the immigration agent who fatally shot Renee Good, said Monday that he was ending his Republican campaign for governor of Minnesota after a second protester was killed by federal authorities.
    


            “I cannot support the national Republicans' stated retribution on the citizens of our state,” Madel said in a video message he posted on social media, “nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so.”
    


            Madel, who has never held elected office, launched his candidacy in December as a political outsider and a fierce defender of law enforcement. One of nearly a dozen candidates in the Republican primary for governor, Madel had been endorsed by the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis.
    


            He gained attention this month for providing legal representation to Jonathan Ross, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who shot Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis woman, on January 7.
    


            “Operation Metro Surge has expanded far beyond its stated focus on true public safety threat,” Madel said in his message. “United States citizens, particularly those of color, live in fear. United States citizens are carrying papers to prove their citizenship. That's wrong.”
    


            He said too many US citizens in Minnesota have been detained by ICE “due to the color of their skin.” He also assailed the Department of Homeland Security's move to enter homes without a criminal warrant, as revealed in a whistleblower complaint.
    


            “Driving while Hispanic is not a crime,” he said. “Neither is driving while Asian.”
    


            The decision from Madel comes after federal agents killed Alex Pretti, an intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center who was protesting immigration actions. A CNN video analysis appears to show a federal immigration officer removing a gun from Pretti just prior to officers fatally shooting him.
    


            “I have to look my daughters in the eye and tell them, ‘I believe I did what was right,'” Madel said. “And I am doing that today.”
    


            Madel's blistering critique of the Trump administration's actions are notable given his legal assistance for Ross. His comments come as some Republicans nationally are beginning to question the actions of federal agents.
    


            The escalating tensions in Minnesota have roiled the state's politics three weeks after Gov. Tim Walz ended his reelection bid in the wake of a deepening federal investigation into a scandal over social services programs in Minnesota.
    


            Sen. Amy Klobuchar filed paperwork last week to form a campaign committee to run for governor. She delayed a formal announcement after Pretti's killing, saying she was more focused on trying to get ICE agents out of Minnesota than launching a campaign.
    


            The remaining Republican candidates for governor include Lisa Demuth, the speaker of the Minnesota House, who is the highest-ranking Republican in the state. Demuth on Monday praised President Donald Trump's announcement that border czar Tom Homan would be traveling to Minnesota, calling it “an opportunity for a reset” between federal and state authorities.
    


            Madel appeared to be gaining ground, often finishing in the top share of Republican challengers in unofficial party straw polls.
    


            No Republican candidate has won a statewide election in Minnesota since 2006 – a fact Madel noted in his video message.
    


            “National Republicans have made it nearly impossible for a Republican to win a statewide election in Minnesota,” he said.

            The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group is now in the Indian Ocean, putting it closer to assist in any potential US operations targeting Iran, two sources told CNN.
    


            The group is within the area of responsibility of US Central Command, whose purview includes military operations in the Middle East.
    


            Still, the carrier is not necessarily in a final position for any potential operation. President Donald Trump continues to consider options for striking Iran, but there is no indication any decision has been made.
    


            A carrier strike group normally includes an aircraft carrier, guided missile cruisers, anti-aircraft warships and anti-submarine destroyers or frigates.
    


            CNN has previously reported the carrier was en route to the region.
    


            Allies have been urging the US to forestall any military action.
    


            In Iran, the death toll from the government's crackdown on protesters continues to climb. On Sunday, the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported that 5,520 protesters have been killed since demonstrations started late last month. It said that an additional 17,091 deaths were still being reviewed.
    


            Trump has warned Iran against killing protesters, repeatedly threatening to intervene in the country if it does so. Last week, however, he said that Iran “wants to talk,” suggesting that the US may enter discussions with Tehran.
    


            Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic is bracing for a potential US attack. In Tehran, a large mural was unveiled in Revolution Square on Sunday depicting a swarm of jet fighters flying over a warship bearing the US flag.
    


            During Friday prayers in the capital, the imam leading the sermon warned the US against launching any attacks.
    


            “The trillion dollars you invested in the region are under the watch of our missiles,” Mohammad Ali Akbari said.
    


            Iran has been escalating its rhetoric against the US over the past week, warning that any attack would be met with force capable of destabilizing the entire Middle East.
    


            Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei told journalists Monday that Tehran is “more than capable” of responding to any aggression from the US with a “regretful” response.
    


            “The arrival of one or several warships does not impact Iran's defensive determination,” he said. “Our armed forces are monitoring every development and are not wasting a single second to enhance their capabilities.”
    


            On Saturday, the Iranian military said its missile capabilities and efficiency have increased significantly since the 12-day war with Israel in June. Iran launched multiple waves of missile and drone attacks at Israeli targets during that conflict, which started after Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran last year, killing several top military commanders and nuclear scientists. The United States later joined, targeting key Iranian nuclear facilities.
    


            Iran possesses a large arsenal of medium- and long-range ballistic missiles, several types of which were fired at Israel during the conflict. Its drones, a pillar of its military power, have also been deployed beyond its borders, including in Russia's war in Ukraine.
    


            Maj. Gen. Ali Abdollahi, the commander of Iran's Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters, a key military operational command, said last week that any aggression against his country “will immediately turn all American interests, bases and centers of influence into legitimate, definite and accessible targets” for Iran.
    


            Iranian officials have also warned that a US attack would lead to strikes on Washington's allies in the region. US-allied Arab nations in the Persian Gulf have lobbied Trump against a strike, according to regional officials speaking to CNN this month.
    


            Iran also has a network of regional proxies that could potentially be mobilized in the event of a strike. While some of its surrogates, such as Hezbollah, have been significantly weakened by Israel over the past two years, others remain heavily armed.
    


            On Sunday, Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi, the commander of Kataeb Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian militia in Iraq, called on Iran's loyalists “across the globe … to prepare for all-out war in support of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”
    


            “We tell the enemies, the war against the (Islamic) Republic, will not be a walk in the park,” he said.

EU member states on Monday gave final approval to the bloc's plan to completely halt Russian gas imports by late 2027, allowing the widely debated bill to pass into law. The step comes despite opposition from some EU countries that say the plan will result in higher energy costs, as well as a recent shift in stance on Russia among others in the bloc.

A full ban on imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia will be followed by a prohibition on Russian pipeline gas deliveries starting on September 30, 2027, according to a statement by the EU Council.

Under the approved regulation, EU members must verify the origin of gas supplies before authorizing imports. Failure to comply may result in fines of €2.5 million ($2.96 million) for individuals and €40 million for companies, or penalties amounting to 3.5% of a company's total worldwide annual turnover, or up to 300% of the estimated value of the transaction.

The ban was designed to be approved by a reinforced majority of countries, allowing the bloc to overcome opposition from Hungary and Slovakia, which remain heavily reliant on Russian energy imports and reportedly voted against the move. In November, Budapest vowed to take the case to the European Court of Justice.

On Monday, Slovak Minister of Foreign and European Affairs said Bratislava will initiate proceedings to annul the regulation at the EU Court of Justice.

The EU has seen a surge in energy prices since it began phasing out Russian oil and gas following the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022. Supply disruptions have pushed up industrial costs. Moscow says Western nations are harming their own economies by opting for more expensive and less reliable alternatives.

The bloc's shift away from comparatively inexpensive Russian pipeline gas imports has gradually led to increased reliance on US-sourced LNG supplies, with several studies suggesting that Germany in particular is now almost entirely dependent on American gas.

The latest move also comes as several European leaders and officials have changed their rhetoric on Russia over the past months. Last week, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz hinted at a revival of contact. Earlier this month, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni supported the idea, saying it is time for the EU to talk to Russia. In December, French President Emmanuel Macron said it would be “useful” to reengage in talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

A ferry carrying 332 passengers and 27 crew members sank in the southern Philippines on Monday after capsizing en route from Zamboanga City on the island of Mindanao to Jolo island, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has said.

At least eight people were initially confirmed dead, according to Arsina Kahing-Nanoh, the mayor of Hadji Muhtamad municipality, where the incident occurred.

PCG Commander Romel Dua of Southern Mindanao District later told Reuters that 15 had died, 316 had been rescued and 28 remain missing.

An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the accident, and military aircraft and vessels have been deployed to assist in the rescue effort, Dua added.

Video from the scene shows multiple passengers floating in the water while clinging to emergency rafts, some of them wearing life vests.

President Denis Sassou Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo (Congo) and President Felix Tshisekedi of the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo) have held discussions on a solution to the conflict in eastern DR Congo, the Nguesso administration announced on Sunday.

Tshisekedi arrived in Oyo, located in the central Congo, on Saturday. The two leaders subsequently held a one-on-one meeting; the security crisis in eastern DR Congo was the central focus of their talks.

According to Brazzaville, Tshisekedi told reporters after the meeting that he sought the counsel of Denis Sassou Nguesso, whom he described as a “sage of Africa.” 

“He [Denis Sassou Nguesso] is an elder of the region, a head of state who is very influential in the region, so it was normal to come and brief him on the development of events in the DR Congo, which is quite normal,” Felix Tshisekedi told the press at the end of the meeting.

Tshisekedi said the situation in the east remains marked by what he described as an “unjust and barbaric war,” adding that although peace processes have been launched and commitments made by the parties involved, some of those commitments are not being respected.

In a separate statement posted on X, Kinshasa said the two heads also addressed issues related to strengthening bilateral cooperation. 

The talks come amid wider international attention to the conflict.

The DR Congo's mineral-rich east has been plagued by decades of violence, with dozens of armed groups, including M23, fighting Congolese forces for power and control of resources such as gold and coltan. Clashes escalated in early 2025, killing thousands and forcing large-scale displacement, according to UN agencies. The rebels seized Goma, the capital of North Kivu, in late January and later captured Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu.

Ceasefire efforts have repeatedly faltered, including Qatar-facilitated talks in Doha. Congolese authorities have long accused Rwanda of supporting the militants, allegations backed by a UN panel of experts. Kigali has denied the claims. The accusations have strained Rwanda's relations with Western partners, including Belgium. In March, Kigali severed diplomatic ties with Brussels, accusing it of harboring “neo-colonial delusions” and interfering in the conflict.

In December, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart, Paul Kagame, ratified a US-brokered agreement committing Kigali to withdraw its forces from the border and end alleged support for M23, while Kinshasa pledged to curb militias hostile to Rwanda. US President Donald Trump has said the pact, which includes calls for a joint security mechanism, gives Washington rights to local mineral wealth. The fighting has continued despite Trump's claims that he ended the decades-long conflict.

On January 20, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Moscow would welcome a swift resolution of tensions between DR Congo and Rwanda but currently sees no realistic prospects for a settlement.

Lavrov noted that Russia maintains good relations with both countries and would like to see the conflict end, but stressed that deep-rooted causes must be addressed before any agreement can be considered durable. 

He added that Russia remains open to a constructive role if asked and would assess how it could contribute should a request for mediation be made.

MOSCOW, January 26. /TASS/. Russia will be able to ensure its security even in the absence of the Treaty between Russia and the United States on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (the New START Treaty), TASS by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS in an interview.

The senior diplomat was asked what will come after New START. ""Nothing,"" he said. ""Nothing, in the sense that there will be nothing to replace it. And nothing, in the sense that our security will still be guaranteed,"" he responded to a clarifying question about whether Russia plans to take actions in connection with the treaty's expiration.

""Even in the absence of the treaty, which, by the way, we suspended due to the dramatic worsening of Washington's policy toward Russia,"" Ryabkov assured. ""As well as serious deviations by the US side from the treaty's requirements, which we have repeatedly spoken about even with the administration of [former US Democratic President Joe] Biden.""

The document expires on February 5, 2026.

Putin announced at a Russian Security Council meeting on September 22, 2025 that Moscow was ready to maintain compliance with the quantitative restrictions outlined in the treaty for another year after the document expires in February 2026. However, he stressed that the measure would be valid only if Washington did the same.

US President Donald Trump said in response to a TASS question on October 5, 2025 that the Russian leader's proposal was ""a good idea."" However, there has been no official reaction from Washington to Moscow's proposal as of yet.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

US senator warned that Republicans would lose elections if prices continue to rise, prompting president to respond ‘fuck you, Ted'

US politics live – latest updates

Ted Cruz warned Donald Trump, his fellow Republican, that he would face a “bloodbath” in the November midterm elections if prices continued to rise, prompting the president to respond, “fuck you, Ted,” the US senator told donors, according to a secret recording of the private conversation obtained by Axios.

Cruz reportedly delivered the reality check to the president in a phone conversation after Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs a few months after returning to the Oval Office in early 2025. The president was unhappy, Cruz said – and yelled and cursed in a conversation with Republican senators.

“Mr President, if we get to November of [2026] and people's 401(k)s are down 30% and prices are up 10–20% at the supermarket, we're going to go into election day, face a bloodbath,” Cruz said he told the president, according to Axios. “You're going to lose the House, you're going to lose the Senate, you're going to spend the next two years being impeached every single week.”

Only 34% approve of how Trump has handled the cost of living while 64% disapprove, according to a recent New York Times/Siena poll. There is also evidence the economy may be motivating those who voted for Trump in 2024 but now disapprove of him, according to the Times.

Cruz also reportedly attacked JD Vance in the recordings, tying the vice-president to conservative media figure Tucker Carlson, whom he has accused of trying to thwart the president's foreign policy agenda. Cruz had a heated interview with Carlson last year that exposed a significant divide on the right on foreign affairs.

“Tucker created JD. JD is Tucker's protégé, and they are one and the same,” Cruz reportedly said. He also accused the vice-president and Carlson of ousting Mike Waltz, the national security adviser, because Waltz supported bombing Iran.

A spokesperson for Cruz's office did not immediately return a request for comment.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Pardons come as president and Republicans seem intent on investigating fraud in Democratic-run states

Donald Trump's mass pardoning of those convicted in connection to the January 6 insurrection raised eyebrows last year, but more recently his pardons have appeared to have a particular focus: to grant clemency to those convicted of fraud.

Since taking office, Trump has pardoned dozens of people convicted of white-collar crimes, including several billionaires, with most of the 13 pardons he quietly issued this month granting clemency to people convicted of fraud.

Those include Wanda Vázquez Garced, the former governor of Puerto Rico who pleaded guilty last year to a campaign finance violation. The US Department of Justice said Vázquez took hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from a Venezuelan, Julio Herrera Velutini, and Mark Rossini in exchange for firing a federal official investigating a bank owned by Herrera Velutini.

Trump pardoned Herrera Velutini and Rossini, who were both convicted of wire fraud, along with Vázquez. Herrera Velutini's daughter, Isabel Herrera, donated $2.5m to the pro-Trump political action committee Maga Inc, and another $1m in July 2025, CBS News reported. A White House official told CBS News the pardons and donations were unrelated.

Another pardon this month was given to a woman to whom Trump had granted clemency during his first term. Adriana Camberos had a fraud-related sentence commuted by Trump in 2021 after being convicted as part of an elaborate fake 5-hour Energy Drink scheme. In 2024, she and her brother were convicted in a separate fraud case which involved the pair lying to manufacturers to buy groceries at discount prices, before selling them at a profit.

More than half of Trump's 88 individual pardons – the bulk of those pardoned for the January 6 insurrection were pardoned in a sweeping presidential proclamation – were for white-collar offenses, “with money laundering, bank fraud and wire fraud among the most frequent crimes the president has wiped clean”, NBC News reported.

The network found that Trump had also pardoned more offenders who owed large fines or restitutions, either to the government or to victims. An analysis by Democrats on the House judiciary committee found that Trump's pardons have deprived “victims and survivors of crime” of $1.3bn in restitution and fines.

“Our analysis shows that Trump's criminal pardon spree is, in addition to everything else, an astonishing giveaway to lawbreakers to keep the money they stole from their employees, their investors, and all the American taxpayers. Whoever said crime doesn't pay has certainly not studied the Trump administration,” said Democrat Jamie Raskin, the ranking member of the House judiciary committee.

The fraud pardons come at a time when Republicans are, theoretically, laser-focused on investigating fraud. Federal prosecutors allege as much as $9bn has been stolen across Minnesota in schemes allegedly linked to the state's Somali population, and Trump has accused other Democratic-run states of fraud.

In early January, Trump used unproven allegations of widespread fraud to cut more than $10bn in childcare and social services payments from California, Illinois, New York, Minnesota and Colorado, each of which is run by Democrats. The effort has been blocked by two federal judges, allowing funds to continue to flow to states.

Earlier this month, Trump claimed he had begun a “fraud investigation of California”, without offering further information.

Yet it is hard to tally this apparent effort to root out fraud with Trump's treatment of other corruption cases. In June, the president commuted the sentence of Lawrence Duran, who was sentenced to 50 years in prison in 2011 for his role in a $200m Medicare fraud scheme.

The White House said in a statement: “When it comes to pardons, the White House takes them with the utmost seriousness and the president understands the responsibility that he has as president to issue pardons to individuals who are seeking that.”

It added: “That's why we have a very thorough review process here that moves with the Department of Justice and the White House counsel's office. There's a whole team of qualified lawyers who look at every single pardon request that ultimately make their way up to the president of the United States. He's the ultimate, final decision maker. And he was very clear when he came into office that he was most interested in looking at pardoning individuals who were abused and used by the Biden Department of Justice, and were over prosecuted by a weaponized DoJ.”

The contradiction has not gone unnoticed in the Democratic party. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California and a key Trump antagonist, this week launched a section of the governor's website that Newsom said would track “President Trump's pattern of pardoning convicted fraudsters and corrupt insiders”.

“Donald Trump is the personification of fraud. His hypocrisy knows no bounds: he is pardoning people convicted of fraud, corruption, and abusing the public trust – while turning around and using ‘fraud' as a launching pad to go after political rivals,” Newsom said in a statement.

“While his administration hands out get-out-of-jail-free cards to real fraudsters, the federal government is now trying to intimidate and target California with baseless allegations of ‘massive fraud'. The rule of law isn't a political weapon – it's a promise, and we won't let it be twisted to settle scores.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Takaichi's popularity slips

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's sky-high poll numbers have slipped, as voters question how she intends to pay for her tax-cut pledge, media surveys released yesterday showed. Her approval rating fell to 67 percent from 75 percent last month, falling “below 70 percent for the first time since she took office last October,” a weekend survey by Nikkei Shimbun said. The dip came as Takaichi faced criticism for abruptly calling a snap election for Sunday next week. Among Takaichi's campaign pledges was to waive the consumption tax on food for two years, but she has not offered details of how to pay for it. “But 56 percent of respondents to the new Nikkei poll said they did not think a zero tax rate on food would be effective against rising prices,” the daily said. A similar weekend poll by the liberal Mainichi Shimbun also showed Takaichi's approval rating drop to 57 percent from 67 percent last month. The Mainichi said many people were frustrated over the abrupt election, as it slowed down legislative debates on a new government budget before the Japanese fiscal year ends in March.

104 political inmates freed

More than 100 political prisoners were freed on Sunday, as detainees are slowly being released under pressure from the US, the non-governmental organization (NGO) Foro Penal said. “At Foro Penal we have verified 104 releases of political prisoners in Venezuela today,” the NGO wrote on social media. Director Alfredo Romero said on X that the group was verifying the identities of those released from jails nationwide. Acting President Delcy Rodriguez, who took power after then-president Nicolas Maduro was captured by US special forces early this month, has promised to release a “large number” of the hundreds of Maduro opponents languishing in prison.

INDIA

EU leaders feted at parade

EU leaders yesterday joined India's Republic Day parade as guests of honor, a day before New Delhi and Brussels are expected to seal a long-awaited free trade agreement. Military bands and horse and camel cavalry units paraded through the capital, New Delhi, while fighter jets buzzed overhead and the latest military hardware was put on display. “The occasion inspires us in our collective resolve to build a developed India,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said before the parade. The fanfare also featured Indian air defense systems — including missiles and drones X— that were deployed in the four-day conflict with arch-enemy Pakistan last year. European Council President Antonio Costa and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were both in attendance, before an EU-India summit today, when the two sides are expected to announce a landmark free-trade deal and security partnership.

Lightning injures 89 at rally

Lightning struck near a rally of supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro in Brasilia on Sunday, injuring 89 people, the fire department said. Thousands gathered in the rain in the capital to support Bolsonaro, who was sentenced to 27 years in prison last year for leading a failed coup d'etat following his narrow re-election loss. Footage shared online shows crowds with colorful umbrellas and plastic ponchos stunned by a sudden flash of light and rumbling sound. The fire department said it treated 89 people at the scene, including 47 who were taken to hospital. Eleven people “required major medical care,” it added.


‘TERRORIST ATTACK':
                                        The convoy of Brigadier General Hamdi Shukri resulted in the ‘martyrdom of five of our armed forces,' the Presidential Leadership Council said                                        A blast targeting the convoy of a Saudi Arabian-backed armed group killed five in Yemen's southern city of Aden and injured the commander of the government-allied unit, officials said on Wednesday.
“The treacherous terrorist attack targeting the convoy of Brigadier General Hamdi Shukri, commander of the Second Giants Brigade, resulted in the martyrdom of five of our armed forces heroes and the injury of three others,” Yemen's Saudi Arabia-backed Presidential Leadership Council said in a statement published by Yemeni news agency Saba.

Fiery accusations of rights abuses and betrayal have circulated for weeks in state-run and social media after a brief conflict in Yemen, where Saudi airstrikes quelled an offensive by UAE-backed separatists. 
The United Arab Emirates is “investing in chaos and supporting secessionists” from Libya to Yemen and the Horn of Africa, Saudi Arabia's al-Ekhbariya TV charged in a report this week. 
Such invective has been unheard of

Vice Premier Yang Sung-ho was sacked “on the spot,” the state-run Korean Central News Agency said, in a speech in which Kim attacked “irresponsible, rude and incompetent leading officials.”
“Please, comrade vice premier, resign by yourself when you can do it on your own before it is too late,” Kim reportedly said.
“He is ineligible for an important duty. Put simply, it was                                    


SCAM CLAMPDOWN:
                                        About 130 South Korean scam suspects have been sent home since October last year, and 60 more are still waiting for repatriation                                        Dozens of South Koreans allegedly involved in online scams in Cambodia were yesterday returned to South Korea to face investigations in what was the largest group repatriation of Korean criminal suspects from abroad.
The 73 South Korean suspects allegedly scammed fellow Koreans out of 48.6 billion won (US$33 million), South Korea said.
Upon arrival in South Korea's Incheon International Airport aboard a chartered plane, the suspects — 65 men and eight women — were sent to police stations. Local TV footage showed the suspects, in handcuffs and wearing masks, being escorted by police officers and boarding buses.

US President Donald Trump last week stole the spotlight during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, before artificial intelligence (AI) took center stage. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on European allies over his ambitions to take Greenland triggered a sell-off in global equities. It was only after walking back the trade threats and ambitions to take Greenland by force that markets returned to calm and AI took over, with debate about the good and the bad the technology could unleash.

IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva at a panel on the global economic outlook said an “AI tsunami” was hitting the labor market, and it would wipe out many entry-level jobs, mostly affecting young people. 

As the technology becomes increasingly widespread, the demand for skills would undergo a significant transformation, she said, citing IMF data. 

AI is likely to affect about 60 percent of jobs in advanced economies and 40 percent globally, Georgieva said, adding that some people stand to benefit from the technology, but others face lower wages and fewer job opportunities.

Georgieva urged employers to discuss the role of AI tools with employees before adopting their use in the workplace, especially as the technology rapidly advances. 

Still, no one knows how to make it safe and inclusive, she said, adding that her biggest worry is the potential harm that unregulated, market-driven deployment of AI would create.

Dario Amodei — CEO of Anthropic, one of the world's most powerful AI creators — also expressed concern about high unemployment and underemployment brought on by widespread AI use. 

Nevertheless, he said he believes the good from the technology would outweigh the bad, Bloomberg News reported. 

Amodei has long warned about AI's effects on the job market. During an interview last year, he said the emerging technology could wipe out 50 percent of entry-level jobs across technology, finance, law, consulting and other clerical positions, leading to a “white-collar bloodbath.”

Yet, not every business executive speaking at Davos agreed that AI is destined to wreak havoc on the labor market. Nvidia Corp CEO Jensen Huang (黃仁勳) made a case for realistic optimism, based on the history of technological advancements. 

The massive build-out of AI infrastructure would create swaths of blue-collar jobs, Huang said, adding that he expected great demand for skilled vocational workers such as electricians, plumbers and construction workers, along with a substantial income. 

“You don't need to have a PhD in computer science to do so,” Bloomberg News quoted him as saying.

Just as people's responses to any developing technology in the past, there are mixed views on the impact of AI on the labor market. The emergence of new technologies generally has three effects on labor demand: displacement, productivity and reinstatement, academic studies have shown. 

The displacement effect means that the emergence of new technologies would replace the existing workforce, reducing labor demand. According to the productivity effect, new technologies would increase manufacturers' productivity and profit, prompting them to further expand their operations and thus increasing labor demand. Meanwhile, the reinstatement effect states that new technologies create new types of jobs and demands, and in those jobs, labor would have a comparative advantage over machines, which would boost labor demand.

For pessimists, the displacement effect of AI would be significant, while optimists believe that the productivity and reinstatement effects of the technology would be sufficient to offset the displacement effect. 

AI could be viewed as a form of creative destruction, which transforms jobs, rather than eliminating them. Regardless, as the technology is evolving rapidly, its long-term effects on economic growth and employment remain to be seen. 

Most importantly, policymakers and officials should start looking into the workforce changes AI could create, develop policies to address the issues, and inform and educate the public on how AI might change their lives, positively and negatively.

There have been many similar cases, but it is particularly troubling that some of the victims were excluded from the social welfare safety net because they did not meet eligibility criteria. 
According to media reports, the middle-aged daughter had sought help from the local borough warden. Although the warden did step in, many services were unavailable without out-of-pocket payments due to issues with eligibility, leaving the warden's hands

Although the snap election on Feb. 8 might appear to be a domestic affair, it would have real implications for Taiwan and regional security.
Whether the Takaichi-led coalition can advance a stronger security policy lies in not just gaining enough seats in parliament to pass legislation, but also in a public mandate to push forward reforms to upgrade the Japanese military. As one of Taiwan's closest neighbors, a boost in Japan's defense capabilities would serve as a strong deterrent to China in acting unilaterally in the

At the core of this effort was a significant expansion of the percentage of renewable energy generated to keep pace with growing domestic and global demands to reduce emissions. This effort met with broad bipartisan support as all three major parties placed expanding renewable energy at the center of their energy platforms. However, over the past several years partisanship has become a major headwind in realizing a set of energy goals that all three parties profess to want.

We urge all parties to exercise restraint, avoid unilateral actions and resolve issues peacefully without threat or use of force.”

President William Lai (賴清德) yesterday announced that this year's “Youth Overseas Dream Fund Program” is to be expanded, with more slots and a larger scale. 

Lai made the remarks during a meeting with the visiting groups of last year's “International Youth Ambassador Exchange” and the “Agricultural Youth Ambassador New Southbound Exchange” programs at the Presidential Office in Taipei. 

The Youth Overseas Dream Fund Program aims to help young people with ambition and expertise break through resource barriers, explore the world and broaden their horizons, Lai said.

“Last year, more than 1,400 young people participated in the program, and this year, we will expand it in scale and number of slots,” he said, adding that the program's growth would better address the needs of young people, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, rural areas, indigenous communities and special families. 

The expansion would provide them with greater opportunities to pursue their dreams abroad, he added. 

Lai said that last year marked the first time the Agricultural Youth Ambassador New Southbound Exchange combined indigenous diplomacy and agricultural diplomacy, offering young people with indigenous heritage and a background in agriculture a chance to visit Australia — an agricultural powerhouse with a rich indigenous cultural history. 

The president commended the participants for their dedication and involvement, pointing out that their efforts not only contribute expertise and engage in international diplomacy, but also help foster global friendships while showcasing Taiwan's strong agricultural soft power and technological prowess.

The service was first made available to Taiwanese travelers throughout the winter vacation of 2024 and during the Lunar New Year holiday.
In addition to flights to the Japanese cities of Hakodate, Asahikawa, Akita, Sendai, Niigata, Okayama, Takamatsu, Kumamoto and Kagoshima, the service would be available to travelers to Kobe and Oita.
The service can be accessed by passengers of 15 flight routes operated by

PokéPark KANTO's official opening is just around the corner on Feb. 5, and a media preview event on Monday showed off what there is to see. Visitors can meet more than 600 Pokémon at the facility located inside Yomiuriland, which straddles Inagi, Tokyo, and Kawasaki.

Covering about 2.6 hectares, PokéPark KANTO is divided into two main zones that make the most of its lush setting in the Tama Hills: Pokémon Forest, a wooded area built for exploration; and Sedge Town, a lively hub where visitors can shop, dine and enjoy attractions.

In Pokémon Forest, visitors can stroll along an around 500-meter route and find hordes of Pokémon. Among them, the slug-like dragon Goomy, with their beady little eyes, have massive smiles for all who approach.

Sedge Town is filled with shops and two permanent attractions: Vee Vee Voyage, a carousel that sends guests on a gentle journey alongside Eevee and friends; and Pika Pika Paradise, a ride powered by electric-type Pokémon including Pikachu and Emolga.

Pokémon danced to exciting music in the Pikachu and Eevee Bubble Carnival parade while bubbles filled with fog fluttered in every direction.

PokéPark KANTO also has a large shop called Pokémon Daisuki Shop, where visitors can pick up original merchandise including plush toys and other exclusives.

This is Kollen Post reporting from Kyiv on day 1,433 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story: Russia has yet to use Iranian missiles in its war on Ukraine

Iran gave hundreds of its missiles to Russia as a gift to help in its war on Ukraine. So far, they've been plagued by failure to launch. 

Ukrainian intelligence told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 26 that of the over 350 Fath-360 missiles that Iran has given Russia, none has come down on Ukraine. 

Those dormant Fath missiles contrast with Russia's use of North Korea ballistic missiles, widely seen as shoddy but reportedly improved thanks to Russian assistance. Russia's seeming disinterest in Iran-supplied Faths could be seen a passive indictment of a missile program that Iran has invested in heavily. 

Iranian-designed Shaheds have proved themselves a mainstay of the war in Ukraine, but these days Russia is producing the vast majority of its own supply rather than buying them from Iran, which is currently engaged in a brutal crackdown on protests against the current regime. 

The Council of Europe has a new plan to cut off its continuing dependence on Russian natural gas – next year. 

The EU just gave final approval to the new plan, with barring liquified natural gas by the beginning of 2027 and pipeline natural gas by autumn of the same year. 

The European bloc remains the largest buyer of both pipeline and liquified natural gas from Russia, despite widespread calls to pull away from economic contact with Moscow. 

Russia's Jan. 24 air attack damaged the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, a holy site in Eastern Orthodoxy and a UNESCO heritage location, an official said on Jan. 26. 

""For the first time since the days of the second world war, as a result of military activity the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra was struck,"" general director of the historical preserve Maksym Ostapenko, told Interfax-Ukraine. ""Each time, Moscow has been behind it, as happened in 1918; as happened when, by an order from Moscow, the Uspensk (Dormition) Cathedral was blown up in 1941, and, by an order from Moscow, Shaheds and missiles now fly throughout Kyiv, including those that now inflict damage on the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra.""

The blasts on Jan. 24 blew out windows and damaged plaster on two of the buildings of the Lavra, which includes extensive underground cave complexes and looks out along the Dnipro River. 

Ostapenko was re-appointed as the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra's general director earlier this month after a contentious firing last year. The Lavra itself has long been a zone of tensions due to alleged Russian influence through the orthodox church. 

General Oleksandr Syrsky, Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, issued a stark warning about Russia's renewed assaults on Pokrovsk, the long-embattled city in western Donbas. 

""The aggressor is not giving up attempts to break through; he is strengthening pressure and pulling up reserves,"" Syrsky wrote on Facebook on Jan. 26, reporting 400 clashes in the Pokrovsk and Ocheretyne areas. 

One of Ukraine's fortress cities in the west of Donetsk Oblast, Pokrovsk has been a hot spot for Russian attacks for over a year and a half. Russian forces have taken most of the city but fighting continues in the northern areas. 

Russian attacks killed at least three Ukrainians and injure 24 others over the past day, local authorities said on Jan. 26.

Russia launched 138 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight, Ukraine's Air Force reported, including roughly 90 Shahed-type drones. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 110, but 21 drones struck 11 locations across the country, and drone debris was recorded at one additional site.

In Donetsk Oblast, two died and 13 were injured in Russian attacks on Druzhkivka and Oleksiivo-Druzhkivka, the local military administration reported, recording a total of 18 attacks on civilian areas. 

Authorities evacuated 53 civilians from ares near the frontline, including 22 children.

In Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported one civilian dead in Russian attacks, which hit 29 municipalities including the city of Kherson itself.  

Two other civilians went to the hospital with injuries including concussions resulting from a Jan. 24 drone strike on their balcony, the oblast government said. 

In Sumy Oblast, which is facing renewed pressure from Russian attacks, authorities reported seven injuries among civilians, including a 59-year-old woman and her 8 and 11-year-old grandchildren.

The oblast fell under air alerts for all but 4.5 hours of the preceding day. 

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the local government reported continued attacks, particularly with FPV drones striking the Nikopol area. Russian attacks injured a 58-year-old man, but seemingly resulted in no deaths. 

In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian attacks including several dozen drones damaged eight homes and apartment buildings throughout the oblast and injured an 80-year-old woman in the city of Kharkiv, Governor Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram. 

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported 775 Russian strikes, which injured two civilians. 

Russia has lost around 1,235,060 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Jan. 26.

The number includes 1,020 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,608 tanks, 23,951 armored fighting vehicles, 75,906 vehicles and fuel tanks, 36,644 artillery systems, 1,626 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,286 air defense systems, 434 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 115б813 drones, 28 ships and boats, as well as two submarines.

Ukrainian drones struck an oil refinery in the town of Slavyansk-na-Kuban in Russia's Krasnodar Krai overnight on Jan. 26, Ukraine's military confirmed following reports on social media. 

Photos and videos recorded by residents and posted on social media on the morning of appear to show a glowing night sky from the direction of the oil refinery. 

The region's Operational Headquarters claimed that drone debris fell onto the territory of ""two enterprises,"" without specifying the type of facility. 

One person was hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries as a result of the attack, the report said.

Ukraine's General Staff later confirmed a strike on the Slavyansk Eko refinery, a major facility with a yearly refining capacity of over four million tonnes of oil.

According to the military, ""elements of the primary oil refining equipment were damaged.""

The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the reports.

No information was immediately available on the extent of the damage caused.

Ukraine routinely launches deep strikes against military and industrial facilities in Russia and Russian-occupied territories, primarily relying on domestically developed drones.

Located across the Kerch Strait from occupied Crimea, Krasnodar Krai has been a regular target of Ukrainian attacks. On Jan. 22, Ukrainian drones struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal in the region, General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces confirmed.

The reported attack comes as Kyiv continues to escalate its campaign against Russian oil and gas infrastructure, a key source of Moscow's revenues helping to fuel its all-out invasion of Ukraine.

Reuters reported on Jan. 19, citing its calculations, that the Russian federal budget's tax revenues from oil and gas are expected to decrease by 46% this month compared to January 2025.

Oil and gas revenues account for roughly one-quarter of Russia's federal budget, playing a key role in sustaining Moscow's all-out war against Ukraine.

According to Reuters, revenue will likely drop to roughly 420 billion rubles ($5.42 billion), the lowest level since August 2020.

Seapeak's share of Yamal LNG's trade in 2025 amounted to 37.3%, more than any other company, according to Urgewald's analysis based on Kpler data.

The reasons could be ""possible limitations of a technical or political character,"" Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent.

A full ban on Russian LNG will take effect in early 2027, followed by pipeline gas imports in the autumn of that year.

Despite the brutal conditions, Russia has still continued to push out north of the city of Pokrovsk, making occasional incremental gains according to open-source mapping projects.

Ukrainian drones reportedly struck an oil refinery in the town of Slovyansk-na-Kuban in Russia's Krasnodar Krai overnight on Jan. 26, Russian Telegram media channels reported. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky and exiled Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya held their first bilateral meeting on Jan. 25.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:kyivindependent.com","EU gives final approval to ban on Russian gas by 2027","https://kyivindependent.com/eu-gives-final-approval-to-ban-on-russian-gas-by-2027/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:46:55 GMT","

The Council of the EU gave a green light to a phased ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) and pipeline gas by next year, the Council's press service reported on Jan. 26.

The move is part of the EU's efforts to end reliance on Russian fossil fuels in response to an all-out invasion of Ukraine, ongoing since 2022.

The measures will begin to apply six weeks after the regulation enters into force, with a full ban on LNG imports taking effect in early 2027, followed by pipeline gas in the autumn of that year.

The bloc-wide move will mandate member states to verify the origin of imported gas and prepare national diversification plans by March 1, 2026.

Violators will face penalties: fines of at least 2.5 million euros ($3 million) for individuals; at least 40 million euros ($47 million) for companies; or up to 3.5% of a company's total worldwide annual turnover, or 300% of the estimated transaction value.

The announcement follows an October 2025 decision by the EU to phase out all Russian fossil fuels by the end of 2027, with the ban on LNG to take place even before that deadline.

Alexander Kirk, a sanctions campaigner at the NGO Urgewald, welcomed the move but said it was ""shameful"" to continue buying Russian gas into 2026.

""It will be a bitter pill to swallow for freezing families in Kyiv who will watch European allies heat their homes with Russian gas this winter,"" Kirk told the Kyiv Independent.

""Every shipment helps bankroll the missiles tearing apart Ukraine's power grid and leaving families without heat. Bring the ban forward.""

While the European bloc decreased imports of Russian gas by 75% between 2021 and 2025, it remains Moscow's leading buyer of both pipeline gas and LNG.

In particular, purchases of seaborne LNG from Russia have surged during the full-scale war as pipeline supplies dropped. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has backed calls to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian LNG, urging countries to switch to U.S. supplies.

""As of today, the EU energy market will be stronger, more resilient and more diversified,"" Cypriot Energy and Commerce Minister Michael Damianos said.

""We are breaking away from detrimental reliance on Russian gas and taking a major step, in a spirit of solidarity and cooperation, towards an autonomous Energy Union.""

Seapeak's share of Yamal LNG's trade in 2025 amounted to 37.3%, more than any other company, according to Urgewald's analysis based on Kpler data.

The reasons could be ""possible limitations of a technical or political character,"" Ukraine's military intelligence told the Kyiv Independent.

A full ban on Russian LNG will take effect in early 2027, followed by pipeline gas imports in the autumn of that year.

For nearly two months, Minnesota has been the target of the largest operation of U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, with 3,000 federal agents flooding the state and arresting at least 3,000 people for deportation.

Since Jan. 7, it has been the site of the most furious and sustained resistance to Mr. Trump of his second term so far, after Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross gunned down Renee Nicole Macklin Good, a mother of three, near a spontaneous anti-ICE protest on a snowy Minneapolis street.

And this weekend in the city, a Border Patrol agent shot to death Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse – like Ms. Good, a U.S. citizen – touching off a protest as angry crowds confronted federal officers, who opened fire with pepper balls and tear gas.

Now, both sides are digging in.

Kristi Noem, Mr. Trump's Secretary of Homeland Security, is accusing Mr. Pretti of “domestic terrorism,” despite video that shows him doing nothing more than recording officers on his phone before they tackled him. At the spot where he died, meanwhile, protesters said his death had only steeled their resolve to keep fighting until federal forces leave.

“It's a war zone here,” Nicole Wehr, a 50-year-old social worker, told The Globe and Mail on Sunday as she stood next to a sidewalk memorial for Mr. Pretti. “To President Trump and his three-ring circus: Stop killing us, get out, stay away from us.”

Federal officers shot and killed a man in Minneapolis amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, according to a hospital record obtained by the Associated Press. Minneapolis Gov. Tim Walz said in a social media post that he had been in contact with the White House after the shooting.

It all means that the clashes in this Midwestern state of 5.8 million may be about to intensify, even as the struggle extends to Washington, where Democratic legislators threatened to partially shut down the government to cut off funds to Mr. Trump's immigration sweeps.

Mr. Pretti was killed shortly after 9 a.m. Saturday on Nicollet Avenue, a commercial street south of downtown Minneapolis. Videos from the scene show people blaring car horns, shouting and blowing whistles, tactics employed to alert residents to the presence of federal officers in a neighbourhood.

Mr. Pretti, who worked in the intensive care unit of a hospital for war veterans, appeared to be videoing agents with his phone. When he intervened to help a woman who had been shoved to the ground by an agent, the agent pepper sprayed him, then at least six other agents rushed in and the group wrestled Mr. Pretti down.

After one agent emerged from the scrum with what appeared to be a gun, another agent shot Mr. Pretti and continued firing as he lay immobile on the ground.

In the hours that followed, thousands of people converged on the intersection. Officers used gas and batons in a bid to disperse them, while protesters dragged dumpsters, trash cans and pieces of plywood into the street to create a makeshift barricade.

Throughout the weekend, a parade of Trump administration officials characterized Mr. Pretti as violent without presenting any evidence. Officials released a photograph of a pistol they said was taken from Mr. Pretti, who had a licence to legally carry one. The videos do not show Mr. Pretti holding the gun when police took him down.

Ms. Noem said at a Washington news conference that Mr. Pretti was engaged in “domestic terrorism.” Stephen Miller, the immigration hard-liner and top adviser to Mr. Trump, called him “an assassin” on social media.

In cable news interviews on Sunday, Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino said his agents were “the victims” and FBI Director Kash Patel doubled down: “You do not get to attack law enforcement officials in this country without any repercussions.”

By Sunday morning, the scene was calm as hundreds of protesters came and went in -20C weather. An icy snowbank had become a shrine to Mr. Pretti, with pine boughs, flowers and votive candles surrounding a wooden cross.

Lucy Kail, 23, sank to her knees and cried in front of the tribute. “People need to see this. People need to know it's real. It's senseless and it's unneeded and we're begging for it to stop,” she said of the federal clampdown.

Ms. Wehr, the social worker, recounted her own experience with ICE. Shortly after Ms. Good's killing, she said, agents went from door to door in her northern Minneapolis neighbourhood, asking if they could come inside. 

The officers asked questions about Ms. Wehr's neighbours, she said, and appeared to be soliciting information about whether anyone in the area was undocumented. She sent them away. “We all deserve to be here. This country was founded on immigration,” she said.

Outside the Whipple Federal Building, a concrete fortress between the airport and an expressway, a group of protesters kept up a 24-hour vigil. The building houses detention facilities where people rounded up in immigration sweeps are held. It is also the base of operations for ICE and Border Patrol agents deployed to the city. 

As unmarked cars, pickup trucks and vans drove in and out, several dozen people behind a security fence jeered at them.

Kelly Callaway, a 56-year-old who works in the non-profit sector, said the weekend's violence would motivate people to redouble their efforts. “We have to stand up for each other. I will not stop so long as they're here,” she said, gesturing to federal agents across the street.

Ms. Callaway is among the networks of people who roam the city, looking for ICE patrols. On one occasion earlier this month, she said, she saw agents stop a man on the street in the suburb of Columbia Heights. About 25 neighbours came out of their houses and surrounded the officers, who left.

On Sunday, she said, she planned to surveil “hot spots” for agents. “If we don't stop this here, it's coming for everyone in the United States.” 

Later in the afternoon, thousands gathered for a march through the downtown business district. In the evening, a smaller group of demonstrators converged on a hotel in nearby Saint Paul, where they believed ICE agents were staying. The protesters barricaded the street with recycling bins and pallets, then banged pots and pans and turned on a siren, in a bid to disrupt officers' sleep. They were prevented from entering the lobby by security.

After about three hours, Border Patrol agents fired tear gas, made arrests and cleared the street.

Mr. Trump took aim at Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both Democrats, demanding they help him carry out his deportation campaign.

“Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to co-operate with ICE, and they are actually encouraging Leftwing Agitators to unlawfully obstruct their operations,” he wrote on Truth Social on Sunday.

Mr. Walz said it was Mr. Trump who was trying to provoke unrest.

“If fear, violence and chaos is what you wanted from us, then you clearly underestimated the people of this state and nation,” he told a news conference. “We are tired, but we're resolved. We're peaceful, but we'll never forget.”

The President ordered the Minnesota crackdown, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, after dozens of members of the city's Somali community were charged in connection with a welfare fraud scheme. Mr. Trump has long fixated on the state, particularly Somali-American Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a firebrand leftist, and Mr. Walz, the 2024 Democratic nominee for vice-president.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer threatened to block a funding bill that includes money for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a move that could partially shut down the federal government at the end of the month. “What's happening in Minnesota is appalling – and unacceptable in any American city,” he said in a statement.

Jacky Rosen, a moderate Democratic senator from swing-state Nevada, called for Ms. Noem's impeachment. “The abuses of power we're seeing from ICE are the latest proof that she has lost control over her own department and staff,” Ms. Rosen said in a statement.

Even Mr. Trump's own Republican caucus began to fracture, with senators Thom Tillis and Bill Cassidy calling for a full investigation of Mr. Pretti's shooting, with state involvement. So far, Minnesota officials have said federal authorities have blocked them from accessing evidence.

In a statement, Mr. Cassidy warned that the “credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake” absent an independent investigation.

Mr. Pretti's parents decried the “sickening lies” the Trump administration was telling about their son, pointing out that he was not holding a gun in the videos of his shooting.

“We are heartbroken but also very angry. Alex was a kind-hearted soul who cared deeply for his family and friends and also the American veterans whom he cared for,” Michael and Susan Pretti said in a statement. “Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man.”

The confrontation between the Trump administration and Minnesota's state government is shifting to a federal courtroom Monday in a case that could have significant legal and constitutional implications.

Minnesota's Attorney-General, Keith Ellison, is suing the Trump administration, arguing that its surge of immigration enforcement in the state has led to rights violations, including racial profiling. It will also argue that what it views as federal-government overreach violates constitutional limits on federal power.

David Schultz, a university professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University in Minnesota, said the case may eventually make its way to the Supreme Court.

Both sides dig in as Trump's ICE crackdown on Minnesota shows no signs of letting up

“If the state of Minnesota were to win on this one, the implications would be enormous in terms of curtailing ICE activities and the curtailment of national power,” Prof. Schultz said. 

“If the federal government were to win, I would say it puts states in a very precarious position, because they will be saying, ‘How do we protect ourselves?' Many would say it would render states somewhat powerless in these kinds of disputes.”

It's one of a number of political conflicts between the two levels of government playing out in Minnesota, a state that has become the focal point in the Trump administration's effort to crack down on undocumented migrants. 

On Saturday, a Border Patrol agent in Minneapolis shot and killed 37-year-old U.S. citizen Alex Pretti, an intensive-care nurse, in an altercation on the streets in Minneapolis. It's the second killing of a U.S. civilian by federal Department of Homeland Security agents this month, after the death of Renee Nicole Macklin Good on Jan. 7. 

In both cases, federal officials have asserted authority over the investigation of the killings, leaving local officials frustrated and unable to access evidence. The DHS is blocking Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension from investigating both deaths.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has called for ICE to leave the city and on Saturday he again asked President Donald Trump to withdraw the federal agents, who outnumber Minneapolis police by a ratio of about five to one.

The DHS has sent 3,000 immigration-enforcement officers to Minnesota, a deployment that has created chaos in Minneapolis as citizens have engaged in dozens of protests against the presence of masked, armed agents on their streets.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has also called for ICE to leave the state. On Sunday, Mr. Walz, in a public statement directed at Mr. Trump, asked, “What do we need to do to get these federal agents out of our state?”

The Trump administration has argued that the street-level conflicts involving citizens and DHS agents in Minnesota have been created by state and local officials who have been unable to maintain order. Federal agents have made more than 3,000 arrests in Minnesota since the start of Operation Metro Surge in December, according to the White House. 

Over the course of the recent upheaval, federal and state officials have both talked of involving the military for their purposes. On Saturday, Mr. Walz activated the state National Guard. Mr. Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, and troops have been placed on standby for deployment to Minnesota.

Prof. Schultz said the federal government has the authority to enforce immigration laws, even if the state doesn't want them there. The principle of federal supremacy in the Constitution means that when there is a conflict between federal and state law, the federal government will prevail. 

Left and right, Minnesotans look for a way out of chaos

However, the Tenth Amendment in the Bill of Rights says the federal government cannot coerce a state government into doing what it wants, Prof. Schultz said. 

He said the Minnesota lawsuit will likely argue that the ICE deployment is effectively an attempt to compel Minnesota's co-operation in a federal action, and that it makes it impossible for local officials to carry out basic law-enforcement functions, such as keeping the peace.

The state will be seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the current ICE mobilization, Prof. Schultz added. 

What's unusual, he said, is that typically the federal government is the branch that steps in to protect individual rights, as it did in the civil-rights era when Southern states tried, unsuccessfully, to assert a state-level right to resist desegregation.

“It's a political and constitutional battle over how far the national government can go to compel states to take a particular ideological line when it comes to federal policy,” Prof. Schultz said.

CoLab chief technology officer Jeremy Andres, left, and CEO Adam Keating. Venture Newfoundland and Labrador LP is one of North America's best-performing venture capital  funds of its age, in part from its early support in the company.Supplied

Expectations weren't high when the Newfoundland and Labrador government committed $10-million in 2014 to a new venture capital fund that would finance homegrown tech startups. St. John's barely registered as a tech hub. Other than the Business Development Bank of Canada, which kicked in another $2-million, just nine investors put up a further $2-million combined, despite the lure of a 30-per-cent tax credit.

One of them, Shopify angel investor, philanthropist and part-time Newfoundland resident John Phillips, saw his $1-million investment as more of a “social ecosystem support” effort to help “a small out-of-the-way place, with an expectation we were not going to make any money,” he said in an interview. 

St. John's has since emerged as one of the country's most fertile small-city startup centres – and the fund, Venture Newfoundland and Labrador LP (VNLI), is one of North America's best-performing venture capital investment vehicles of its vintage, due to its early support of two of Canada's hottest startups, CoLab AI Inc. and Spellbook.

Cash from away: CoLab raises $72-million as hot St. John's tech scene draws global investors

VNLI, managed by St. John's-based Pelorus Venture Capital Ltd., has already repaid investors $21-million – or $1.50 for every $1 they put into the fund. It sits on a further $40-million-plus worth of investments and has generated an average net internal rate of return of 24 per cent.

Its second, $26-million fund, anchored with $13-million from the province, launched at the 2021 tech market peak. It has generated an 11-per-cent average annual return to date, putting it in the top quartile of that year's funds.

Now, as St. John's companies attract global attention, Pelorus is doubling down. On Monday, Pelorus said it has secured $20-million for its third fund, VNLIII, with $15-million from the province and $5-million from Mr. Phillips' investment company, Klister Credit Corp. The goal is to reach $50-million and “we're quite confident that number will be achieved,” said Pelorus president Chris Moyer, who is based in Windsor, N.S.

“For more than a decade, Pelorus has shown how early investment can help local companies grow, create good jobs, and attract new investment to our province,” said Lin Paddock, Minister of Jobs, Growth and Rural Development, in a release. The new fund “marks an important step forward for our technology sector.”

Despite the larger target fund size, the mandate of Pelorus – named for a marine navigation instrument that helps vessels maintain their bearings – has not changed, said Mr. Moyer. The fund will aim to make 10 to 15 pre-seed-stage investments in fledgling companies in the province, providing $500,000 to $1-million apiece initially, with more set aside than in past funds for follow-on rounds.

And while the province has kicked in more with each fund, its share of the capital has gone down – assuming Pelorus hits its goal – to 30 per cent in Fund III from 71 per cent in VNLI.

St. John's benefits from a few favourable attributes for startups. The small, tight-knit city is home to Memorial University and locals have shown a desire to stay or come home to build their companies. That includes CoLab, which sells a cloud-based platform for engineers to help manage collaborative projects. Co-founders Adam Keating and Jeremy Andrews returned home to build CoLab after doing co-op placements with U.S. innovators including Tesla Inc.

There has been steady government support for startups, as well as investments from another prominent local financier – Mark Dobbin's Killick Capital. And due to the province's remoteness and small population size, startups must start out thinking globally .

St. John's has also produced a huge winner that inspired other local entrepreneurs: fraud detection software maker Verafin Inc., which was bought by Nasdaq Inc. in 2020 for US$2.75-billion. Investors from away in Spellbook and CoLab include Silicon Valley-based Khosla Ventures and Intrepid Growth Partners, co-founded by ex-Canada Pension Plan Investment Board CEO Mark Machin. 

Mr. Moyer compared the province to Estonia, the small, former Soviet republic that has produced 10 tech ventures valued at US$1-billion or more, including Skype.

Seven tech firms joined Canada's $100-million club in 2025 – and 2026 could bring even more

Pelorus was created at the behest of a provincial government bureaucrat who encouraged the principals of the labour-sponsored GrowthWorks Atlantic Venture Fund – including Mr. Moyer – to create a new fund. The timing was good; GrowthWorks Atlantic was beginning to liquidate its portfolio and later wound down.

Mr. Moyer said others cautioned him early on that Verafin was a one-off success. “Well, CoLab and Spellbook have proven that wrong,” he said, noting that two or three of the 16 companies Pelorus has backed are looking to raise follow-on capital this year. “The companies keep on coming” and Pelorus doesn't fund them just because they are local, he said. “We are going to fund companies like they're anywhere else, we're going to treat them like they're anywhere else, we'll treat valuations like they're anywhere else.

Mr. Phillips, who has co-invested in three Pelorus startups, agreed: “I wonder sometimes if deal flow will start to ebb,” he said. “But I don't see any signs of this.”

Other companies in the Pelorus portfolio include Mantle, a platform for managing revenue for Shopify app developers founded by ex-Shopify employees from Newfoundland, smart thermometer maker Mysa and Sparrow BioAcoustics, whose technology turns smartphones into stethoscope replacements.

Mr. Keating in an e-mail called Pelorus “one of our strongest supporters and a critical resource for us to lean on when making big decisions. They are almost like having another founder at the table.”

As with Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022, politics are dominating the buildup to North America's 2026 World Cup. Could discontent with Donald Trump in Europe see football heavyweights unite to boycott the tournament?

With relations between European governments and the United States strained, calls for European teams to boycott World Cup 2026 are beginning to gain traction in some quarters. Politicians, fans and football executives are among those who believe that the actions of Donald Trump's administration — particularly in relation to Greenland — make participating in the tournament problematic.

Though Trump said in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week that he won't use force to annex Greenland, he immediately preceded that by saying: ""We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force, where we would be, frankly, unstoppable.""

Given the US president's history of head-spinning U-turns on all sorts of issues, European governments must remain prepared for all eventualities, despite the later announcement that the framework of a Greenland deal had been agreed with NATO. So, too, must their football associations.

Mogens Jensen, spokesperson of the Danish Social Democrats for culture, media and sports, told DW that Denmark — of which Greenland is a semiautonomous constituent territory — is not yet calling for a boycott.

""For my party and for myself, our view on this is that it is one of the last tools in the toolbox that you should take up,"" he said.

But, he added, were Trump to decide an invasion was the way to achieve his aim after all, things would have to change.

""I will be honest and say, yes, if that should happen, then a boycott discussion is very, very relevant,"" Jensen said moments before Trump took to the Davos stage.

""It's likely to happen if it develops into a real conflict. I sincerely hope that it will not come to this,"" he added.

Reports from various outlets suggest European football's governors, UEFA, held a meeting featuring a number of heads of football associations on Monday, with the 10% tariffs Trump slapped on eight European countries over Greenland last week likely to have been a key topic. Trump said on Wednesday that he would revoke these should the NATO deal be ""consumated.""

Of those eight nations, Norway, the Netherlands, Germany, France and the UK (in the shape of England and Scotland) have already qualified for the tournament while Denmark, Sweden and Northern Ireland (also UK) are in the playoffs. The final country, Finland, did not qualify.

It isn't just Danish politicians who could be forced to consider their options. In Germany, a handful have spoken on the boycott issue. Roderich Kiesewetter of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrats sits on the Bundestag's foreign affairs committee and said military action may not even be required for a boycott.

""If Trump follows through on his announcements and threats regarding Greenland and starts a trade war with the EU, it's hard for me to imagine European countries participating in the World Cup,"" he told the Augsburg Allgemeine newspaper.

However, Chris­ti­ane Schen­de­r­lein, Germany's state min­is­ter for sports, has kicked the can to the country's football association, the DFB.

""Decisions on par­ti­cip­a­tion or boy­cotts at major sport­ing events lie solely with the com­pet­ent sports asso­ci­ations, not with politi­cians,"" she told news agency AFP.

The DFB has not responded to a request from DW for comment on the issue.

Teun van de Keuken became frustrated by what he sees as political inaction in the face of one NATO member threatening another, among other Trump policies, and began a petition in his native Netherlands which now stands at 135,000 signatures and climbing.

""Sports associations almost always say we don't want to mix politics and sports, but the problem is the politics are already there and you have to take a stand,"" van de Keuken told DW.

Van de Keuken is now looking for the best way to get the petition to a broader global audience and tap into what he believes is broad fan dissatisfaction with the tournament.

""This boycott idea is now popular amongst football fans, like me. I wouldn't like it if this happens as we won't have a World Cup, which is always a highlight in sports and I love it. But I think now the political situation is more important.""

In the eyes of van de Keuken and many others, FIFA President Gianni Infantino's very public cozying up to Trump has made FIFA's usual insistence on its politically neutral stance even harder to accept. Danish politician Jensen is also concerned that this will allow Trump to use the tournament for ""propaganda.""

""I have my fears when you see that FIFA suddenly thinks the president of the US should have a peace prize, which has never existed before. I don't know on what grounds FIFA suddenly needs to award a peace prize, but it could be a warning of what could await us when the tournament happens in the US.""

Jensen is not alone in his misgivings, even if most political parties and federations are sitting back and waiting to see which, if any, of Trump's announcements will come to pass. The new tariffs are to come into effect on February 1, if the NATO deal Trump refers to is not signed by then. That's 10 days before UEFA's Executive Committee (Exco) meets in Brussels.

That meeting could prove decisive in any efforts to form a European alliance to boycott the tournament. With 16 of the 48 teams at the World Cup and the world's most powerful club sides from Europe, any move by the continent's associations would likely see the rest of the footballing world take notice — with some possibly to follow.

While there have also been calls from politicians in the UK, France and elsewhere both for and against boycotts, European champion Spain may be one of the countries expected to lead any potential charge. The country's prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, was one of a handful of world leaders who called for Israel to be barred from international sports competitions last year while Spain, along with the Netherlands, was one of several countries that said it would boycott the Eurovision Song Contest over the war in Gaza.

Another country that has often stood up in human rights disputes, and would be impacted by the tariffs if they come into effect, is Norway. Lise Klaveness, the president of Norway's FA (NFF) — who is also on UEFA's Exco — was another to call for a boycott of Israel, while Norway's players wore protest T-shirts in support of Qatari migrant workers before the 2022 World Cup in the Middle Eastern country.

But Klaveness told reporters in Norway on Tuesday that, if there were to be a boycott, no country could or should go it alone.

 ""We do not believe that an isolated boycott on the part of NFF is an effective means of lasting change. In these times, it is particularly important that countries in Europe speak with one voice and stand united,"" she said.

European leaders are gathering in Hamburg to discuss energy and security cooperation. The summit comes on the heels of a fraught week that saw US President Trump continue pushing to acquire Greenland. DW has more.

Here are some of the biggest news headlines and updates from Germany on Monday, January 26:

Germany has joined other states on the North Sea in pledging to make big investments in expanding offshore wind power capacity.

The agreement signed by energy ministers at the third North Sea summit in Hamburg foresees that wind farms in the North Sea will feed power to multiple countries.

Berlin said that up to 100 gigawatts of production capacity are to be made available across the region under the new deal.

 ""Our goal is to develop the world's largest energy hub,"" German Economy Minister Katherina Reiche said.

""With the consistent expansion and intelligent networking of offshore energy, we are creating affordable, clean and secure energy, reducing strategic dependencies and increasing Europe's overall resilience,"" Reiche said.

The deal also envisages investment of €9.5 billion ($11.2 billion) in new production capacity in Europe by 2030, creating 91,000 additional jobs, as well as further offshore wind energy projects.

Ten European states are represented at the latest summit, including Germany, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, France and the United Kingdom. Ireland and Iceland are also involved, as is land-locked Luxembourg

The deal comes as Europe seeks to establish itself as a stable alternative for clean-energy investment amid the current opposition to green energy evinced by the US under President Donald Trump.  

Heavy snowfall and freezing rain impacted traffic links across much of Germany, with accidents reported in states including Saxony, Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

There have also been disruptions to rail transport with Deutsche Bahn warning travelers to expect delays and cancellations on long-distance services.

Parts of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg are still under severe warnings from the German Weather Service (DWD) due to black ice.

Some parts of southwestern Germany have also been impacted by snowfall of up to 25 centimetres (about 10 inches).

Conditions are expected to improve according to the country's meteorological service DWD.

A German government spokesman declined to comment on the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by US law enforcement in Minneapolis, except to say that Berlin expected an investigation into the death. 

Deputy government spokesman Sebastian Hille told reporters in Berlin that the government presumes that ""the case will be investigated and clarified swiftly in accordance with the rule of law."" 

Pretti, 37, was killed by multiple gunshots during raids by border and immigration officers in Minneapolis on Saturday. The death came just two weeks after the high-profile shooting of a woman in the same city that prompted demonstrations across the country. 

Sentiment across major German businesses held steady at 87.6 points, according to the January edition of the monthly Ifo index. 

Some analysts had predicted a slight rebound in the Munich-based foundation's survey of around 9,000 business leaders but the overall figure was ultimately unchanged.

Germany's Economy Minister Katherina Reiche highlighted the need to protect critical infrastructure at the start of the North Sea Summit in Hamburg.

""It is not only since Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine that we have seen increasing attacks on our critical infrastructure,"" Reiche said as the summit got underway.

Reiche said that power grids, pipelines and important data cables — crucial to the continent's digital sovereignty — are under attack, ""which is why NATO is represented at a high level here for the first time,"" she said.

The minister pointed out that large offshore wind operations were being built in the North Sea, as Europe seeks to make energy supply more resilient.

 ""We are expanding our infrastructure and securing it at the same time,"" Reiche said.

 ""When the world rattles at Europe's gates, the continent stands together.""

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has called for Trump to apologize for his comments on the deployment of NATO allies in Afghanistan.

“That would be a sign of decency and respect, and also of insight,” Pistorius told the ""Caren Misoga"" program broadcast by ARD television.

He was responding to a question as to whether Trump should apologize for his inflammatory remarks he made last week about allied contributions following the September 11 attacks.

“We've never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did — they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines,” Trump said in comments that have been roundly condemned.

Thousands of German troops took part in NATO's Operation Enduring Freedom and Resolute Support missions in Afghanistan and 59 were killed.

Pistorius' comments come after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Trump's remarks ""frankly appalling.""

British troops losses amounted to 457 in Afghanistan.

Many highly skilled Bulgarians are moving back to their home country, swayed by the major income boost for remote work.

DW takes a look at some of those who have opted to head back to Bulgaria where those returning are seeing higher net income, thanks to the country's lower taxes and social security deductions.

Bad weather has forced German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul to delay a visit to Latvia and Sweden at short notice.

""Due to extreme weather conditions, the departure point was moved from Berlin to Leipzig in order to organize the trip,"" the Foreign Office said.

Wadephul traveled from Berlin to Leipzig by train, a trip that normally takes a little more than one hour. It was not immediately clear that any of the appointments in Riga and Stockholm would be rescheduled.

Wadephul had been set to discuss the Baltic region's security situation, including hybrid attacks by Russia and Moscow's so-called shadow fleet, used to circumvent sanctions on oil sales.

A shortage of blood donations in Germany could have dramatic consequences. According to the German Red Cross (DRK), up to 15,000 donations are needed every day in Germany.

In order to be able to help whenever and wherever emergencies arise, supplies should cover at least four days. But time and again, there are shortages.

The situation was critical in mid-January.

DW's Marcel Fürstenau answered a call to donate blood and reported on his experience.

European leaders and industry representatives will meet to discuss North Sea energy and security cooperation in Hamburg.

The stated aim of the meeting will be to advance greater international cooperation on expanding wind energy and hydrogen infrastructure.

The Reuters news agency has reported that delegates will sign a clean energy pact, pledging to deliver 100 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind power through large-scale joint projects, citing the British government.

Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz says he wants the North Sea to become the ""largest reservoir of clean energy worldwide.""

It's the third such summit and takes place in the Northern German city of Hamburg for the first time, the previous two having taken place in Belgium's Ostend and Denmark, Esbjerg.

It was created as a result of the Russia's invasion Ukraine in order to help Europe reduce its dependence on fossil fuel imports, particularly from Russia.

Heads of state and energy ministers from Belgium, Denmark, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway and Iceland.

Representatives from the European Commission and NATO will also be there, along with more than 100 company representatives.

""Given the make-up of the meeting, I am certain that security in the High North will also be of interest to the participants,"" said Steffen Meyer, spokesman for Merz.

The Arctic island of Greenland has been a major talking point over the past few weeks because of US President Donald Trump's continued push to acquire the Danish territory.

Trump said a ""framework"" agreement with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte had been reached; however, no details have been disclosed as to what this might entail.

Guten Morgen from the newsroom here in Bonn.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will be hosting European leaders at the North Sea Summit, taking place in Hamburg for the first time.

They're focusing on expanding clean energy infrastructure, in particular wind power.

There are reports that a deal will be signed be signed by Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands ‍and Norway.

The talks come after an eventful World Economic Forum in Davos, an event that saw US President Donald Trump continue his push to annex Greenland, which is semi-autonomous Danish territory.

In what's been called a victory for free trade, the EU and India are set to agree on ""the mother of all deals"" and a defense pact that aims to lure India away from its close political and military ties to Russia.

At Khan Market in New Delhi, Atul Mehra was optimistic that a deal between the European Union, the world's single largest market, and India, the world's fastest growing major economy, will revive his gems and jewelry business. He lost a quarter of his earnings last year, after US President Donald Trump imposed 50% tariffs on his country. 

""We have suffered massive losses since the tariffs, people in the US were our major clients,"" he told DW. ""And we hope that a deal with the Europeans will help us, and everybody."" 

Vishnu Gupta, a garment shop owner on the same street who has business all over India, said the deal would allow him to expand his trade and find new markets.

While the US has said the high tariffs are meant to dissuade India from buying Russian crude oil, it appears the EU has adopted a different approach to lure India away from Moscow's orbit — more trade and stronger defense ties. 

At a high stakes summit in New Delhi this week, the EU and India are expected to finalize a free trade agreement and sign a new security and defense partnership, the third such agreement between the EU and an Asian country after Japan and South Korea. 

""Despite longstanding arguments in favor of a closer partnership, including shared competition with China and trade incentives for both parties, it was Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Trump's punitive tariffs that have brought momentum to the relationship,"" said Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group based in Delhi.

Before the summit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa will be the chief guests at India's Republic Day celebrations on Monday, when diverse floats from all over country will be on display alongside parading tanks and soldiers. They are the first top EU officials to be invited to take part in the event.

On Tuesday, officials are set to conclude talks on the trade agreement that would create a market for nearly 2 billion people who account for a quarter of the world's GDP. Von der Leyen and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also attend the first EU–India Business Forum, alongside more than two dozen major industrialists from both sides. 

The EU and India are also expected to launch a new cooperation framework on labor mobility, under which the EU hopes to attract high-skilled and seasonal workers from India. ""Of course, in line with what the labor market in the European Union needs,"" an EU official said, on condition of anonymity to speak freely.

In addition, the EU hopes to explore a potential role for India in the EU's flagship research and innovation program, Horizon. 

""Leaders will also touch on connectivity,"" the official added. ""We are particularly focused on the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, IMEC, which would create new transport, digital and energy connections between India and Europe"" via Arab countries and Israel. 

""Europe wants to do business with the growth centers of today and the economic powerhouses of this century,"" von der Leyen said Wednesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, calling the trade agreement with India ""the mother of all deals.""

According to EU data, the EU is India's largest trading partner; trade in goods reached worth €120 billion in 2024, 11.5% of India's total trade. By 2030, India is projected to be the world's third-biggest economy after China and the US.

The EU is hoping India will drop its famously high tariffs on imported vehicles, currently more than 100%, and boost the European car industry in the face of competition from China. And, as Indians move up the ladder in economic mobility, the European alcohol industry stands ready to quench their thirst for fine wines and spirits. Under the trade deal, India is expected to scrap its staggeringly high tariffs on alcohol — as high as 150% on imported wines. 

Last year, under its free trade agreement with the United Kingdom, India agreed to drop tariffs on both cars and alcohol but in phases — to reduce the impact on domestic manufacturers.

For its part, India has demanded easier standards for its pharmaceutical exports, and the same duty-free access for textiles that the EU gives to Asian neighbors like Pakistan and Bangladesh. Delhi hopes this will offset the impact of the US tariffs, which have been especially damaging for India's garment sector. 

India is also hoping to send more professionals to the EU for employment opportunities, and is looking for commitments on joint production in the defense industry.

Lisa Musiol, head of EU affairs at the International Crisis Group in Brussels, said India is the first country with close political and military ties to Moscow to strike a key defense partnership with the EU. 

""Over time, this partnership could open the door for New Delhi to tap parts of the EU's SAFE loan facility for common defense procurement,"" she said, in reference to a €150 billion EU financial instrument called Security Action for Europe, or SAFE, that offers low-interest loans to obtain defense equipment and strengthen EU's defense industry.

Experts told DW that while India is still largely dependent on Russia for its military equipment, that dependence is gradually reducing as New Delhi diversifies its suppliers. France has emerged as a key partner, and India has stepped up talks with Germany on contracts for military transport aircraft and submarines. For its part, India hopes to supply the EU with ammunition, much needed in Ukraine, and could potentially free up European supplies to send across to Kyiv.



Overall, India aims to increase its exports to the bloc, which currently account for just 2.5% of the EU's total imports, and enhance its supply chain integration.

While there is a lot on the table, negotiations are expected to go down to the wire as several sticking points persist. 

As with the recent EU-Mercosur trade deal, agriculture has emerged as a top concern. Nearly half of India's workforce is employed in agriculture, and India is worried that European agricultural products might replace Indian products and threaten the livelihood of millions of people. That had made Delhi reluctant to grant the EU the kind of market access it seeks. 

The topic is also highly politically sensitive for New Delhi. In 2021, when massive farmer protests forced Prime Minister Modi to withdraw a series of agricultural reforms, it was seen as a rare and public political retreat for the powerful leader.

But the EU, battered with its own farmers' protests against the Mercosur deal with South America, is under immense pressure to seek new markets for Europe's agricultural produce.

Brussels is equally hesitant to grant certain Indian agricultural exports unimpeded access to EU markets. Last month, the bloc reportedly decided to limit rice imports from India and other Asian countries to protect domestic rice growers and millers. 

Steel is another major bone of contention, especially since the EU doubled tariffs on foreign steel in October and slashed the quota for duty free imports in half. The spike in tariffs was introduced on top of a new carbon tax that will make Indian steel exports less competitive.

The EU claims its carbon tax is intended to reduce its global carbon footprint, but Indian diplomatic sources say both measures are protectionist.

And yet, both sides agree the only way is forward. 

""We don't see eye and eye on everything, but we do share a set of core interests, "" the EU official said. ""Like stable international order, reduced [trade] dependencies, and diversified supply chains.""

			Alex Pretti's weapon may have been fired accidentally by immigration officer running from scene

The fatal shooting of a nurse by ICE agents may have been prompted by one of the officers “negligently” firing the victim's gun, it has emerged.

Video footage shows Alex Pretti's gun being taken from him by a border agent as he lies on the ground while being beaten by other officers.

As the agent runs away with Pretti's 9mm pistol in his right hand, a gunshot can be heard in the footage posted online.

That, in turn, may have “spooked” the other Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at the scene into firing a number of rounds at Pretti, 37, as he lay unarmed and defenceless on the ground.

The series of events raises serious questions about the training and discipline of the 3,000 federal agents who have been drafted into Minnesota by the Trump administration to round up illegal immigrants in the state.

Minneapolis police have already been blocked from the investigation into Pretti's death and senior figures within the administration have labelled the intensive care nurse a “terrorist”, claiming that the federal agents who shot him were the actual victims.

Amid growing alarm that any inquiry by the FBI and Justice Department would vindicate the ICE agents and place blame on Pretti for him causing his own death, analysis of the video footage has cast doubt on the White House's version of events.

Opponents say the footage shows Pretti, who was by then disarmed, being “executed” in the street.

Brian O'Hara, the police chief in Minneapolis, said on Sunday that the 37-year-old was lawfully entitled to have a handgun under the state's concealed carry laws.

Rob Doar, a lawyer and the president of the Minnesota Gun Owners Law Centre, said he believed that the initial shot was fired by the agent who had seized Pretti's gun.

“After analysing the videos, I believe it's highly likely the first shot was a negligent discharge from the agent in the grey jacket after he removed the Sig P320 from Pretti's holster while exiting the scene,” Mr Doar said.

The initial shot triggered a number of rounds being fired at Pretti, even though he was unarmed at the time.

A 2025 study showed that police officers were 11 times more likely to fire their weapons if they had already heard gunfire as part of a phenomenon called “contagious fire”.

Critics will argue that the number of shots fired at Pretti suggests that ICE agents deployed in Minneapolis were not trained to tackle crowd control in city environments.

Tim Walz, the state governor, has demanded that Donald Trump withdraw the “3,000 untrained agents” from Minnesota “before they kill another American in the street”.

In a telephone interview with The Wall Street Journal on Sunday night, Mr Trump avoided questions about whether the officer who shot Pretti had done the “right thing”.

“We're looking, we're reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,” the US president said.

He also signalled the potential withdrawal of ICE agents from Minneapolis, but did not offer a time frame for their departure.

“At some point we will leave. We've done, they've done a phenomenal job,” he said.

Pretti's death followed the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a mother of three, by an ICE agent just over two weeks ago.

The Sig Sauer 9mm pistol legally owned by Pretti has come under scrutiny in recent years over reports of an alleged defect that has allowed it to be fired “uncommanded”.

More than 100 lawsuits have been lodged against the manufacturers over claims of unintentional discharges.

According to reports, ICE banned its agents from using the weapon last summer, with the agency issuing an order to replace the Sig pistol with another made by Glock.

Sig Sauer denied any problems with the popular handgun. In a statement, the company accused “uninformed, agenda-driven parties” of launching “attacks against Sig Sauer's most tested, most reliable, and most durable product – the P320 pistol”.

It added: “This misinformation causes confusion and uncertainty among our valued customers.” The P320 cannot “under any circumstances discharge without a trigger pull”, it said.

Recommended

Pressure is mounting on the Trump administration to investigate Pretti's death properly amid fears it will be covered up.

Barack Obama, the former US president, said on Sunday that ICE and border patrol agents were “acting with impunity and engaging in tactics that seem designed to intimidate, harass, provoke and endanger the residents of a major American city”.

He accused Mr Trump of being “eager to escalate the situation” rather than “impose some semblance of discipline and accountability over the agents they've deployed”.

Trump's attorney general demanded records on Medicaid and food aid programs and that Walz repeal sanctuary policies.

As Minnesota residents and people across the U.S. were reeling from the killing of protester Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents on Saturday — the second fatal shooting by federal immigration agents in the city in less than three weeks — U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to Governor Tim Walz, telling him it is in his power to “restore the rule of law” in his state.

One suggestion the attorney general gave amounted to a “shakedown,” said US Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), and had nothing to do with the Trump administration's persistent claims that immigrants have caused a crisis in Minnesota. Bondi demanded the Democratic governor turn over voter rolls for the state, as she has called on all 50 states and Washington, D.C. to do, prompting legal challenges from voting rights groups and voters.

Bondi wrote that Walz must allow the Department of Justice (DOJ) to access voter rolls to “confirm that Minnesota's voter registration practices comply with federal law.”

“Fulfilling this commonsense request will better guarantee free and fair elections and boost confidence in the rule of law,” she wrote.

Gallego accused the DOJ of “using fear to get their hands on voter information.”

Pam Bondi sent a letter to Minnesota officials saying  hand over the voter rolls, or ICE won't back off. That's a shakedown. They're using fear to get their hands on voter information. In America, you don't get to strong-arm your way into our elections. pic.twitter.com/IbJc3ufl9k

The Trump administration filed a federal lawsuit last September against Minnesota and several other Democrat-governed states to demand personal information for all voters, including driver's license numbers and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers.

Considering President Donald Trump's persistent, debunked claims of so-called “voter fraud” in the 2020 election, including the baseless claim that noncitizens are permitted by Democratic governors to vote in federal elections, advocates have said the DOJ's demands for voter rolls are aimed at further spreading lies and misinformation.

In the letter, Bondi also denounced Minnesota officials for speaking out against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the wake of an ICE agent's fatal shooting of Renee Good earlier this month, saying a “national tragedy” has resulted from the “anti-law enforcement rhetoric.”

The “tragedy” the attorney general was referring to wasn't the killings of Good and Pretti, but a rise in “violence against ICE officers and agents” that the Trump administration has cited frequently. She didn't provide examples of violent attacks in the letter.

She also demanded that Walz turn over records on Medicaid and food assistance programs and “repeal sanctuary policies that have led to so much crime and violence in your state” — also providing no evidence of such a rise. According to data from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Minneapolis Police Department, crime has gone down in recent years.

Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes said Bondi's letter suggested that Minnesota can expect more violence from federal immigration officers unless Walz turns over his constituents' sensitive data.

This isn't leadership. This is blackmail. The Department of Justice has now told Minnesota officials that they will remove ICE if they hand over their voter rolls – this is not how the law works. pic.twitter.com/V9udMnJgPn

“They're not entitled to that data,” said Fontes. “This is blackmail. This is the way organized crime works. They move into your neighborhood, they start beating everybody up, and then they extort what they want. This is not how America is supposed to work, and I'm embarrassed that the administration is pushing in this direction.”

Melanie D'Arrigo, executive director of the Campaign for New York Health, noted that Bondi's demand came days after the DOJ acknowledged that a group aimed at challenging election results reached out to two Department of Government Efficiency Employees who were working at the Social Security Administration and requested they analyze state voter rolls.

“This is not a coincidence,” said D'Arrigo. “Authoritarians crave legitimacy, and manipulated election results can provide that.”

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

The immigrant jail, where many children are detained, has “horrible” conditions, including “putrid” drinking water.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

An uprising broke out at an immigrant jail in southern Texas on Saturday, with around 1,000 immigrants detained in the facility — many of them children — chanting “Libertad” and “Let us go,” according to an attorney who witnessed the event. 

The protest took place at South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, which closed in 2024 but was reopened by the Trump administration this year to detain immigrant families.

On Saturday, facility personnel abruptly ordered immigration attorneys who were present to leave, saying “an incident” had taken place. Michigan-based immigration attorney Eric Lee, who was among those forced to leave, said he could hear shouting that sounded “high-pitched” and “urgent,” indicating that he believed there were “hundreds of children” taking part in the uprising. 

Lee later said his clients told him the protest began in response to the treatment of Liam Conejo Ramos, the 5-year-old from Minnesota who was abducted, along with his father, by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents last week. The two were transferred to the jail, more than 1,300 miles from home, shortly after being detained. 

School officials familiar with the incident say that an adult living in Liam's home had begged for ICE agents to let Liam stay after his father was taken into custody. 

“There was ample opportunity to be able to safely hand that child off to adults,” Mary Granlund, chair of the Columbia Heights School Board, said during a press conference last week. 

School officials also said that Liam was used as “bait” by agents, in an attempt to get other people inside the house to exit willingly. 

Aerial photos of the Texas facility during the protest, taken by The Associated Press, show parents and children holding signs that read, “Libertad para los niños,” or “Freedom for the kids.” Participants in the uprising also reportedly chanted “Libertad,” and “Let us go.”

“The message we want to send is for them to treat us with dignity and according to the law,” said Maria Alejandra Montoya Sanchez, a 31-year-old who is being detained in the jail, speaking to The AP after the protest. “We're immigrants, with children, not criminals.”

Montoya Sanchez has been imprisoned at the facility with her 9-year-old daughter since October.

Lee posted several videos of the incident on social media. Within the videos, which were recorded outside the facility, shouting and chanting can be heard from inside the jail, seemingly from children.

In one video, Lee recorded what sounded like children screaming, after which a guard tells him he has to leave the area, despite being outside of the jail. 

“This demonstration presently comprises of about 80 percent of the detained population, over 1,000 people. … Guards are trying to physically block people from protesting,” Lee said in another post, noting that gates within the facility had been closed to prevent the uprising from spreading. 

According to Lee, demonstrators were moved to protest after hearing about Liam's story. They were also motivated to act after hearing about the size of the general strike on Friday against federal immigration agents' presence in Minnesota.

Lee described deplorable conditions at the facility, saying it is a “horrible, horrible place.” The drinking water is “putrid,” and the food served to families who are being detained contains “bugs,” dirt, and other contaminants, the lawyer said.

“The guards are just as tough as the guards at the adult facilities,” Lee said. “This is not a place that you would want to have your child be for even 15 minutes.”

“That children and their parents would risk retribution under these conditions to speak up is a testament both to how courageous they are and how abysmal the conditions of this place is,” Lee added.

The Trump administration is planning to use artificial intelligence to write federal transportation regulations, according to U.S. Department of Transportation records and interviews with six agency staffers.

The plan was presented to DOT staff last month at a demonstration of AI's “potential to revolutionize the way we draft rulemakings,” agency attorney Daniel Cohen wrote to colleagues. The demonstration, Cohen wrote, would showcase “exciting new AI tools available to DOT rule writers to help us do our job better and faster.”

Discussion of the plan continued among agency leadership last week, according to meeting notes reviewed by ProPublica. Gregory Zerzan, the agency's general counsel, said at that meeting that President Donald Trump is “very excited about this initiative.” Zerzan seemed to suggest that the DOT was at the vanguard of a broader federal effort, calling the department the “point of the spear” and “the first agency that is fully enabled to use AI to draft rules.”

Zerzan appeared interested mainly in the quantity of regulations that AI could produce, not their quality. “We don't need the perfect rule on XYZ. We don't even need a very good rule on XYZ,” he said, according to the meeting notes. “We want good enough.” Zerzan added, “We're flooding the zone.” 

These developments have alarmed some at DOT. The agency's rules touch virtually every facet of transportation safety, including regulations that keep airplanes in the sky, prevent gas pipelines from exploding and stop freight trains carrying toxic chemicals from skidding off the rails. Why, some staffers wondered, would the federal government outsource the writing of such critical standards to a nascent technology notorious for making mistakes?

The answer from the plan's boosters is simple: speed. Writing and revising complex federal regulations can take months, sometimes years. But, with DOT's version of Google Gemini, employees could generate a proposed rule in a matter of minutes or even seconds, two DOT staffers who attended the December demonstration remembered the presenter saying. In any case, most of what goes into the preambles of DOT regulatory documents is just “word salad,” one staffer recalled the presenter saying. Google Gemini can do word salad.

Zerzan reiterated the ambition to accelerate rulemaking with AI at the meeting last week. The goal is to dramatically compress the timeline in which transportation regulations are produced, such that they could go from idea to complete draft ready for review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in just 30 days, he said. That should be possible, he said, because “it shouldn't take you more than 20 minutes to get a draft rule out of Gemini.”

The DOT plan, which has not previously been reported, represents a new front in the Trump administration's campaign to incorporate artificial intelligence into the work of the federal government. This administration is not the first to use AI; federal agencies have been gradually stitching the technology into their work for years, including to translate documents, analyze data and categorize public comments, among other uses. But the current administration has been particularly enthusiastic about the technology. Trump released multiple executive orders in support of AI last year. In April, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought circulated a memo calling for the acceleration of its use by the federal government. Three months later, the administration released an “AI Action Plan” that contained a similar directive. None of those documents, however, called explicitly for using AI to write regulations, as DOT is now planning to do.

Those plans are already in motion. The department has used AI to draft a still-unpublished Federal Aviation Administration rule, according to a DOT staffer briefed on the matter.

Skeptics say that so-called large language models such as Gemini and ChatGPT shouldn't be trusted with the complicated and consequential responsibilities of governance, given that those models are prone to error and incapable of human reasoning. But proponents see AI as a way to automate mindless tasks and wring efficiencies out of a slow-moving federal bureaucracy.

Such optimism was on display in a windowless conference room in Northern Virginia earlier this month, where federal technology officials, convened at an AI summit, discussed adopting an “AI culture” in government and “upskilling” the federal workforce to use the technology. Those federal representatives included Justin Ubert, division chief for cybersecurity and operations at DOT's Federal Transit Administration, who spoke on a panel about the Transportation Department's plans for “fast adoption” of artificial intelligence. Many people see humans as a “choke point” that slows down AI, he noted. But eventually, Ubert predicted, humans will fall back into merely an oversight role, monitoring “AI-to-AI interactions.” Ubert declined to speak to ProPublica on the record.

A similarly sanguine attitude about the potential of AI permeated the presentation at DOT in December, which was attended by more than 100 DOT employees, including division heads, high-ranking attorneys and civil servants from rulemaking offices. Brimming with enthusiasm, the presenter told them that Gemini can handle 80% to 90% of the work of writing regulations, while DOT staffers could do the rest, one attendee recalled the presenter saying.

To illustrate this, the presenter asked for a suggestion from the audience of a topic on which DOT may have to write a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, a public filing that lays out an agency's plans to introduce a new regulation or change an existing one. He then plugged the topic keywords into Gemini, which produced a document resembling a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. It appeared, however, to be missing the actual text that goes into the Code of Federal Regulations, one staffer recalled.

The presenter expressed little concern that the regulatory documents produced by AI could contain so-called hallucinations — erroneous text that is frequently generated by large language models such as Gemini — according to three people present. In any case, that's where DOT's staff would come in, he said. “It seemed like his vision of the future of rulemaking at DOT is that our jobs would be to proofread this machine product,” one employee said. “He was very excited.” (Attendees could not clearly recall the name of the lead presenter, but three said they believed it was Brian Brotsos, the agency's acting chief AI officer. Brotsos declined to comment, referring questions to the DOT press office.)

A spokesperson for the DOT did not respond to a request for comment; Cohen and Zerzan also did not respond to messages seeking comment. A Google spokesperson did not provide a comment.

The December presentation left some DOT staffers deeply skeptical. Rulemaking is intricate work, they said, requiring expertise in the subject at hand as well as in existing statutes, regulations and case law. Mistakes or oversights in DOT regulations could lead to lawsuits or even injuries and deaths in the transportation system. Some rule writers have decades of experience. But all that seemed to go ignored by the presenter, attendees said. “It seems wildly irresponsible,” said one, who, like the others, requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. 

Mike Horton, DOT's former acting chief artificial intelligence officer, criticized the plan to use Gemini to write regulations, comparing it to “having a high school intern that's doing your rulemaking.” (He said the plan was not in the works when he left the agency in August.) Noting the life-or-death stakes of transportation safety regulations, Horton said the agency's leaders “want to go fast and break things, but going fast and breaking things means people are going to get hurt.”

Academics and researchers who track the use of AI in government expressed mixed opinions about the DOT plan. If agency rule writers use the technology as a sort of research assistant with plenty of supervision and transparency, it could be useful and save time. But if they cede too much responsibility to AI, that could lead to deficiencies in critical regulations and run afoul of a requirement that federal rules be built on reasoned decision-making.

“Just because these tools can produce a lot of words doesn't mean that those words add up to a high-quality government decision,” said Bridget Dooling, a professor at Ohio State University who studies administrative law. “It's so tempting to try to figure out how to use these tools, and I think it would make sense to try. But I think it should be done with a lot of skepticism.”

Ben Winters, the AI and privacy director at the Consumer Federation of America, said the plan was especially problematic given the exodus of subject-matter experts from government as a result of the administration's cuts to the federal workforce last year. DOT has had a net loss of nearly 4,000 of its 57,000 employees since Trump returned to the White House, including more than 100 attorneys, federal data shows.

Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency was a major proponent of AI adoption in government. In July, The Washington Post reported on a leaked DOGE presentation that called for using AI to eliminate half of all federal regulations, and to do so in part by having AI draft regulatory documents. “Writing is automated,” the presentation read. DOGE's AI program “automatically drafts all submission documents for attorneys to edit.” DOGE and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.

The White House did not answer a question about whether the administration is planning to use AI in rulemaking at other agencies as well. Four top technology officials in the administration said they were not aware of any such plan. As for DOT's “point of the spear” claim, two of those officials expressed skepticism. “There's a lot of posturing of, ‘We want to seem like a leader in federal AI adoption,'” one said. “I think it's very much a marketing thing.”

 How Trump's Vision Echoes America's Traditional Approach

 Peter E. Harrell

Over the course of a year, U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has become the most disruptive force in global trade since the 1930s. But the destruction of the post–Cold War trade order—a rules-based international trading system that sought to set economic principles for participating governments—provides a necessary opportunity to correct an overly rigid attitude toward trade.

Between the end of World War II and the early 1990s, U.S. presidents generally supported free trade and encouraged other countries to lower trade barriers with initiatives such as the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which encouraged countries mostly outside the Soviet bloc to mutually reduce their tariffs. But U.S. administrations balanced this preference with pragmatism, taking a flexible approach to policy that considered distinct challenges discretely. When necessary, U.S. presidents were willing to use tools such as tariffs, sector-specific deals for politically-sensitive products such as textiles, and hard-nosed negotiations to tackle discrete trade tensions. The idea that strictly governing international trade with a set of universal rules would deliver economic and geopolitical benefits to all countries is historically abnormal.

Moreover, comprehensive and universal trade rules make less and less sense as great-power competition accelerates and many countries, including the United States, reassess their domestic economic models. It is no accident that sharp debates have emerged within the United States about whether the rules-based system has truly benefited the American economy: dogmatism around the free trade rules that Washington established in the 1990s would crimp a president's ability to pursue policy initiatives such as subsidizing the green energy industry, as President Joe Biden did, or taking government equity stakes in U.S. companies, as Trump has sought to do. The United States is not in a position to set durable global trade rules when its own domestic economic model is the subject of sharp internal debates. And a level playing field of mutually agreed-on rules is not what the United States should pursue when it comes to China: in a geopolitical moment defined U.S. strategic competition with Beijing, Washington should work to tilt the playing field to its advantage over Beijing.

Trump's trade policy is too chaotic, given his long-standing fondness for tariffs and penchant for issuing wild threats, and the excessive rates of his tariffs are undermining U.S. economic goals. But the leaders who succeed him can and should build on those elements of his disruptive approach that do, in fact, represent steps back towards the more pragmatic, less rules-focused trade policymaking that reigned during most of the United States' history. They should expand the kinds of deals the Trump administration is striking with Japan, European countries, and other trading partners to refocus them on solving shared economic and national security challenges. They should take lessons from past presidents such as Ronald Reagan, who encouraged more “free and fair” trade by pursuing a wide variety of policies. And they should extend Trump's effort to integrate trade and national security and innovate new policy tools while discarding the worst excesses of his tariff regime.

The notion that the primary goal of U.S. trade policy is to support a universal set of binding rules is relatively new. The first time a high-level U.S. government document identified a rules-based trading order as Washington's overarching policy aim appears to be in 1991, when the Economic Report of the President—an annual review of the U.S. economy and the president's priorities—stated that the “primary thrust of U.S. trade policy is to use multilateral discussions and fora . . . to promote free, rules-based trade.” Of course, presidents prior to the 1990s pursued international trading orders such as the GATT or the short-lived International Trade Organization, an idea that President Harry Truman backed but that the Senate failed to adopt. But these efforts mainly sought to impose some discipline on specific aspects of global trade such as tariff rates and export-oriented subsidies. Generally, during the Cold War, U.S. trade policy was defined by pragmatism: Washington sought to solve discrete problems and ensured that the deals it entered into had flexibility. The GATT, for example, originally included a variety of exceptions to its rules that allowed countries wide latitude to manage currency issues, deal with import shocks, and implement domestic economic development programs. The dispute resolution mechanism in the GATT was also effectively non-binding, encouraging countries to work out trade disputes diplomatically rather than litigating over rules.

Reagan is perhaps the clearest recent example of a president who pursued a fundamentally pragmatic approach to trade. In 1982, he emphasized that “free and fair” global trade would serve “the cause of economic progress.” He cut tariffs when he could, signed the United States' first modern free-trade agreement (with Israel, in 1985), and supported the launch of the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations, which ultimately transformed the GATT into the World Trade Organization (WTO). But he also frequently used trade tools in a more protectionist way to open foreign markets to U.S. companies and protect them from competition.

When Reagan took office in 1981, U.S. car manufacturing was under stress: the government had bailed out Chrysler in 1979, and imports from Japan were beginning to flood U.S. markets. During his first few months in office, Reagan struck a deal with Japan in which Tokyo committed to “voluntarily” limit its auto exports to the United States in return for avoiding higher tariffs on its cars. This deal was not intended to set a long-term precedent for how countries could subsidize auto manufacturing. Nor did it try to increase the relative cost of Japanese cars by pushing for higher labor standards in Japanese factories. It merely sought to buy the U.S. auto sector time to become more competitive. These export quotas eventually contributed to decisions by Honda, Toyota, and other Japanese car companies to invest in U.S. manufacturing.



Reagan's approach to semiconductors was similarly specific and pragmatic. By the mid-1980s, the United States was facing a flood of semiconductor imports, also from Japan. In 1985, in response to a petition by the U.S. semiconductor industry, the Reagan administration launched an investigation into Japanese semiconductors under Section 301 of the 1974 U.S. Trade Act, which empowers the executive branch to retaliate against unfair trade practices, including by imposing tariffs. In 1986, the U.S. and Japanese governments struck a deal: Japan would reduce its exports and agree to allow U.S. semiconductor firms greater access to the Japanese market. When Reagan thought that the Japanese were not upholding their side of the bargain, he imposed a tariff of 100 percent on many Japanese semiconductor imports. Reagan's aim, again, was not to innovate broad rules for the global semiconductor industry but rather to ensure the continued viability of a specific U.S. commercial sector.

Reagan's strategy toward the dollar was likely his most economically important trade policy. In September 1985, concerns about the dollar's high value—which disadvantaged U.S. exports—prompted Treasury Secretary Donald Regan and his counterparts in France, Japan, West Germany, and the United Kingdom to agree to work collectively to reduce the relative value of the dollar, including by intervening in exchange markets, in return for a promise by the United States not to impose crippling tariffs. This so-called Plaza Accord wasn't an effort to set permanent rules for currency values but a pragmatic deal to increase the dollar's relative value in order to rebalance trade. And it was effective: over the course of the following two years, the dollar's value relative to the currencies of the other Plaza Accord countries declined by 40 percent, and by the late 1980s, the United States' trade deficit had fallen, too.

Reagan's way of approaching trade challenges discretely and with flexibility reflected the approach to trade taken by earlier U.S. administrations. After World War II, for instance, the United States—as well as many other countries—managed trade in textiles, a politically sensitive sector key to both developing and developed economies, not by setting broad rules but by crafting specific textile-sector agreements that used tariffs and quotas. (These agreements were sunsetted over the course of the decade following the WTO's establishment in 1994.) Even President Jimmy Carter, who is generally remembered as a free trade advocate, actually took a number of actions to protect footwear manufacturers and other American industries from foreign competition.

In the early 1990s, however, Washington shifted toward a more explicitly rules-based paradigm. This change in approach reflected a particular historical moment. In the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse, U.S. economists and politicians alike came to a consensus: most believed that privatization, deregulation, free markets, limits on subsidies, and strong intellectual property rights were the best economic policies. In previous decades, these ideas had been contested both domestically and abroad. In the 1970s, U.S. leaders and economists had argued about whether to continue pursuing Keynesian policies or embrace the free market ideas of thinkers such as Milton Friedman, and state-owned enterprises were still common in Europe. But by the late 1980s, as U.S. leaders and officials in key allied countries came to share a view of “correct” economics—what came to be called “neoliberalism” or the “Washington consensus”—U.S. policymakers could for the first time think of setting rules for a truly global trade order.

The United States' unipolar moment also gave American policymakers an unrivaled capability to convince foreign governments to agree to a system of rules. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was uncertain whether Washington had enough leverage to drive the Uruguay Round negotiations to a close. But the fall of the Berlin Wall, the U.S. victory in the 1991 Iraq war, and the United States' strong economic growth after 1992 confirmed American hegemony. Under President Bill Clinton, Washington succeeded in convincing countries around the world to sign on to the WTO, which included a far more extensive set of rules than the GATT did. And the United States used multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to encourage countries worldwide to adopt neoliberal policies at home.

Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama tried to build on Clinton's approach by expanding the scope of trade agreements to develop new global rules to address a host of perceived challenges. Obama, for example, touted the Trans-Pacific Partnership by arguing that it would establish new, global rules across a wide range of issues including investment, e-commerce, state-owned enterprises, and intellectual property rights, all backed by an independent mechanism for adjudicating disputes.

Trump has clearly broken with this paradigm. He does not seek to create new principles governing how countries can set tariffs. He does not try to set joint safety standards or cooperative rules to govern industries such as drugs or social media. Instead, he simply obliges countries such as Argentina and Guatemala to accept U.S. cars and pharmaceuticals and uses tariff threats to strong-arm Europe into dropping regulations on U.S. tech firms.

This antipathy toward a global trading order undoubtedly arises from Trump's personality. As a businessman and then as a politician, he has long relished breaking rules. But his instinct that a more pragmatic, less rules-based approach meets the current moment is sensible.

In truth, neither of the factors that led to the rise of the rules-based trade order exists anymore. American economists and policymakers are no longer united on which economic policies are best. The domestic discourse is roiled by heated debates about the role of the state in the economy and the extent to which the government should rein in corporate power. Disagreements simmer over how to regulate digital technology platforms, the ways in which intellectual property laws should change given the rise of artificial intelligence, and how aggressively antitrust officials should bring cases against alleged monopolistic practices.

Even if the United States could set trade rules worldwide, many of the major challenges in today's global economy—such as the structural imbalances created by China's enormous trade surpluses—are not ones that detailed rules are likely to solve. The problem of structural imbalance is acute: in November, China's trade surplus hit $1 trillion for the first time. That same month, Goldman Sachs estimated that the scale of China's trade imbalance may begin to dramatically reduce overall growth in industrialized economies such as Germany and Japan, as the damage to manufacturing from Chinese exports outweighs the economic advantages that low-cost goods formerly provided consumers.

U.S. and allied policymakers tried for years to convince China to play by the WTO's rules. Not only did those efforts fail, but the United States and its allies now also face a situation in which even if China abided by the rules, other economies would need to violate them to compete. Washington simply cannot diversify its critical mineral supply chain without deploying significant subsidies, tariffs, and other industrial policy tools. The United States also needs to avoid total dependence on China for critical technologies and manufactured goods for national security reasons. The same is true with respect to the products the United States sells to China. To protect U.S. national security, Washington would need to restrict sales of the country's best technology, such as leading-edge computer chips, to Beijing, whether or not both capitals could somehow agree on rules to manage the chip trade.

Policymakers in Washington and allied capitals must return to a more flexible approach to trade. Some of Trump's policies are not pragmatic, especially his tariffs. If trade officials were formerly too dogmatic about free trade, Trump is the opposite—excessively and ideologically attached to tariffs. It makes little sense to maintain the highest tariff rates the United States has imposed since the 1940s on products the country does not make, price-sensitive consumer goods such as clothing, and industrial inputs for which tariffs would shrink manufacturing.

Elements of Trump's second-term trade deals, however, show the benefits of a more pragmatic approach—and the Trump administration should expand on them. Press coverage of Trump's trade policy has tended to dwell on tariffs, but the deals he has made contain many other provisions beneficial to the United States and U.S. firms. Agreements the administration struck with Cambodia and Malaysia, for instance, commit the two countries to cooperating with the United States on certain tariffs, export controls, sanctions, and screening investments for risks to U.S. national security. But they do so in a pragmatic rather than a rules-based way. Washington's agreement with Kuala Lumpur, for instance, stipulates that if the United States adopts certain tariffs or other restrictive measures on China, it can ask that Malaysia “adopt or maintain a measure with equivalent restrictive effect,” affording flexibility in implementation. Other trade agreements Trump is seeking with countries such as Argentina and the United Kingdom are likely to include similar provisions. These types of provisions provide an important foundation for any future U.S. president to build on in deals with other countries around the world.

The United States should also pursue deals that secure U.S. interests in key sectors such as critical minerals. Trump has already included critical minerals provisions in several trade deals, including with Argentina and Indonesia. Given that the critical minerals supply chain spans many countries, he should expand such bilateral provisions into sectorial trade deals with multiple relevant jurisdictions.



Abandoning trade rules has also given Trump leeway to innovate new policy tools. For instance, the U.S. president has convinced Japan and South Korea to set up new state-backed investment funds to plow money into the United States. Trump has likely exaggerated the scale of these investments, but they could nonetheless boost growth in key U.S. sectors such as energy, manufacturing, and data centers.

China's trade surplus can be more effectively countered by approaching the issue specifically and directly. Trump's tariffs on China have already protected U.S. industry: Chinese exports to the United States fell significantly in 2025, even as they rose to record levels in Asian and European countries that remained more bound to trade rules. Convincing Japan, European countries, and other industrialized U.S. allies to simply impose their own limits on trade with China is far more likely to achieve the desired result, reducing China's surplus, than would those countries trying to negotiate a set of “new rules” to govern their trade with Beijing.

Addressing trade imbalances and other twenty-first-century problems such as climate change will demand agility from Trump and the presidents who succeed him. These leaders will have to wield a mix of tariffs, capital restrictions, threats, and interventions in currency markets. If Washington policymakers and U.S. trade partners recoil from the aspects of Trump's trade policy that reflect a well-considered and historically American pragmatism just because Trump pursued them—and insist on a return to a principle-bound trading order that cannot secure global prosperity—they will miss a valuable opportunity.

 When Individual Whims Drive Great-Power Policy

 Seva Gunitsky and Semuhi Sinanoglu

In the end, it may have been the dancing. “He gets up there and he tries to imitate my dance,” said U.S. President Donald Trump in a January 6 speech, explaining why he had ordered the American military to fly into Caracas in the dead of night, seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, and bring them to the United States to face criminal charges. Trump had other reasons, too. Maduro, he said, was a drug trafficker. He led a repressive authoritarian government. He was reluctant to give U.S. companies preferential access to Venezuelan oil. But few experts believe that Caracas plays a significant role in the drug trade, and Trump has left the remainder of Venezuela's violent regime nearly intact. And while the White House certainly wants Venezuelan oil, Maduro had already offered Trump nearly unlimited access to his country's crude after months of pressure.

But Maduro kept on dancing. At rallies in Caracas, he jerked his arms back and forth in a slightly more acrobatic version of Trump's own moves. And for the White House, that seems to have been too much. Maduro's “regular public dancing and other displays of nonchalance in recent weeks helped persuade some on the Trump team that the Venezuelan president was mocking them,” The New York Times reported the day after the extraction. “So the White House decided to follow through on its military threats.”

For scholars of American foreign policy, the idea that a U.S. president—even Trump—would decapitate a foreign government because he felt mocked may seem shocking. But Trump is a personalist leader: one that concentrates power around himself and his inner circle. Personalists differ from ordinary autocrats or dictators in that they hollow out the governing bodies and institutions—like political parties, militaries, and bureaucracies—that support the regime and would otherwise channel policy options through mechanisms of collective deliberation shaped by the authoritarian's vision. Personalists are instead driven purely by their own private fixations and incentives rather than coherent national interests. In Trump's case, those fixations include flattery, personal enrichment, gaining access to natural resources, and dominating the Western Hemisphere. And for a leader with these aims, attacking Venezuela and taking Maduro made sense. That it does not advance Washington's global position—the strike was roundly condemned by many U.S. allies and is likely to prompt Latin America to hedge against a more menacing Washington—does not matter at all. “My own morality. My own mind,” Trump told The New York Times when asked if there were limits on his global power. “It's the only thing that can stop me. I don't need international law.”

Trump is hardly the only personalist in power. For the first time since the 1930s, the world's most powerful countries—China, Russia, and the United States—are all governed by personalist leaders. They hoard authority and silo themselves in informational bubbles. Chinese leader Xi Jinping, for example, has centralized policymaking and repeatedly purged senior officials, discouraging deliberation among his advisers. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also concentrated power and retreated into a self-made echo chamber. Driven by a personal preoccupation with revisionist Russian history, he lectures the world on historical figures like Rurik of Novgorod and Yaroslav the Wise, who he claims justify Moscow's ownership of Ukraine.

The fact that personalist rulers are not bound by formal institutions or diplomatic norms may occasionally create space for surprise deals that resolve conflicts. But a world led by personalist great powers will not aid global stability. Studies of personalist regimes consistently show they are more reckless, aggressive, and conflict prone than other kinds of governments. They are more likely to break alliances, stumble into crises, and start dumb wars. These effects will be amplified now that the world's strongest states are controlled by isolated and unaccountable leaders. A personalist global order, in other words, is one of increasing corruption, volatility, and violence.

Personalist governments are hardly a new phenomenon. For centuries, absolutist monarchs around the world pursued foreign policy objectives based largely on their whims and familial grievances. They waged wars over personal slights and territorial claims rooted in family honor. Charles XII of Sweden, for instance, repeatedly refused reasonable peace offers during the Great Northern War because of a personal obsession with defeating Russia's Peter the Great, ultimately destroying his own country's great-power status.

But personalist systems declined over the course of the twentieth century as large parts of the world democratized and many autocracies professionalized, dispersing power among top officials or at least providing ways for regime officials to question the state's leader. The world still had its personalist one-man systems, such as the Kim dynasty in North Korea, but they became the exception. Many twentieth-century autocracies, however brutal, were not personalist because they still allowed deliberation in service of the ruler's vision. The Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev operated with a sclerotic but genuinely collective approach to leadership. After the death of Mao Zedong, China explicitly designed its political system to prevent one-man rule, instituting term limits and requiring consensus among top leaders. Even military juntas in Latin America typically governed through councils that rotated power or required agreement among service branches. These regimes were repressive, but they were not extensions of a single leader's psyche.

Yet personalism, with its distinctive fusion of unchecked authority and individual caprice, has made a comeback, with Russia leading the way. Since coming to power 27 years ago, Putin has neutered opposition parties and the Russian parliament, stacked the courts with judges willing to defend his desired policies, and packed the bureaucracy with favored underlings. And he has increasingly routed his policies through a shrinking inner circle selected for their fealty instead of their expertise, which distorts his perception of reality.

The personalist nature of Putin's rule helps explain his catastrophic decision to invade Ukraine. His historical musings, coupled with his physical isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, produced the flawed thinking that led him to conclude that conquest was necessary and easily achievable. As many analysts observed before Russia began its drive toward Kyiv in 2022, any attempt to conquer Ukraine was likely to be prolonged and extremely costly. But no one, it seemed, dared tell Putin. Even today, he has blind spots in his assessments about the Russian army's ability to fight and Ukraine's capacity to resist—illusions nurtured by his small cadre of yes men who tout Russian tactical gains, inflate the numbers of Ukrainian casualties, and emphasize Russia's material advantage.



As Russia has fallen ever deeper into personalism, so has its southern neighbor: China. The People's Republic of China has never been a democracy, but for a while its governing Communist Party adopted a relatively collaborative style of leadership. The party's leader had term limits. Other members of the Politburo had independent power and, behind closed doors, the freedom to debate and question decisions. But no more. Under Xi, China has become an increasingly tightly controlled system. Xi has, for example, abolished term limits and fired internal critics. Repeated purges of senior military officials reflect Xi's lack of trust in the loyalty and preparedness of the People's Liberation Army. His top advisers, like Putin's, also appear to be yes men. The result has been a series of high-profile errors. Xi's government, for instance, refused for months to abandon its “zero COVID” policy, which implemented extraordinarily severe social restrictions, even though it failed to contain the disease and resulted in immense economic damage. Beijing's aggressive “wolf warrior” diplomacy, which involved berating and insulting officials from other foreign governments, needlessly alienated potential partners but played well with Xi. China's economy has continued to expand, and Xi may thus far appear to be more rational than Putin to outside observers. But personalist systems tend to corrode rationality and promote overconfidence as leaders become entrenched over time.

And then there is Trump. The U.S. president leads an unusual type of personalist system. He still faces legal constraints and meaningful opposition, unlike Xi or Putin. But he is bypassing long-standing institutional checks in pursuit of personally motivated actions, such as his threats about Greenland and the lucrative real estate and crypto deals his family has secured abroad. Dragging Greenland into American custody would be wildly counterproductive to U.S. interests, eviscerating the NATO alliance that has helped the United States project power across much of the world for over 75 years. Existing treaties already allow Washington to set up multiple naval bases across the island. But that is no matter for Trump, who insists the United States should possess Greenland because he has been denied the Nobel Peace Prize, or because possession is what he personally desires. “That's what I feel is psychologically needed for success,” he said on January 8.

The United States, unlike China and Russia, has plenty of loud critics of its leader. But that does not mean the president is giving them any consideration. Trump has cultivated an inner circle that resembles Putin's in its capacity for subservience. The president has sidelined the normal interagency policymaking process and pushed out career officials. In doing so, he has eliminated channels for disciplined, professional advice in favor of courtiers and sycophants, like Steve Witkoff, real estate friend turned U.S. special envoy, and Pete Hegseth, Fox News host turned defense secretary. Meanwhile, he mistrusts and attacks traditional experts if their beliefs run contrary to his own, such as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has threatened to fire and prosecute for refusing to lower interest rates. Unlike in his first term, nobody close to Trump now has the desire or resolve to contradict him.

This system has weakened Trump's already tenuous relationship to reality. Consider, for example, the Trump-Putin summit last August. In the leadup to the event, Witkoff, acting as Trump's Russia envoy, assured Trump that Putin was ready to negotiate a fair cessation of hostilities based on mutual respect while simultaneously signaling to Moscow that Washington was prepared to force Ukrainian territorial concessions. It was a classic example of information filtering: a courtier telling his patron what he wanted to hear rather than the truth. The result was a disastrous meeting for the White House. Instead of jumpstarting peace talks, Trump endured another historical lecture from Russia's leader. The fighting in Ukraine, meanwhile, has continued.

The rise of personalism makes it difficult to speculate about the future of the global order. Many commentators, for instance, have pointed to Trump's apparent affinity for strongmen, including Xi and Putin, as evidence that the United States is preparing to form a kind of tripartite pact with the world's biggest authoritarians. There is something to this. Trump's actions in Venezuela and rhetoric on Greenland, his apparent willingness to concede Russian primacy in eastern Europe, and his transactional approach to Taiwan all suggest a world view amenable to spheres of influence. But personalist leaders make poor partners, even for one another. To really grant one another spheres of influence, Putin, Trump, and Xi would need to exercise mutual restraint, which personalist leaders lack. Other analysts continue to proclaim a return to great-power competition. But this framework, too, does not fit a personalist global system. Today's great-power leaders want the things they are fixated on—oil, Taiwan, Ukraine—and will compete over those. But they will not jockey to make their countries more prosperous and secure on the whole.

A personalist global system is one of uncertainty, corruption, and private bargains. Self-interested leaders are open to showy deals that discard or weaken alliances and entrenched commitments in exchange for immediate personal victories. The Trump administration's attempt to orchestrate a comprehensive land-for-peace deal between Russia and Ukraine is one example. So is Trump's effort to secure a grand bargain with China, in which Beijing would increase its purchases of U.S. goods and, if the past is any guide, offer commercial advantages to businesses that are connected to him. In exchange, Trump might consider reducing U.S. support for Taiwan—the president has vacillated on how much to back it—or lifting export restrictions. Trump has already loosened restrictions on computing chips, giving China a boost in its artificial intelligence rivalry with the United States. This decision prompted widespread dismay among Washington's foreign policy establishment but could prove extremely lucrative for Trump's allies in the tech world, who have been able to lobby the president directly thanks to Silicon Valley billionaire David Sacks, his crypto and AI adviser.

Such settlements may become more likely in a personalist global system. But they will also be fleeting. In institutionalized governments, international deals depend on bureaucratic machinery, but personalist arrangements are leader-to-leader productions marketed as a ruler's special genius. They are thinly institutionalized and therefore brittle, guided more by theatrical summits than enforceable provisions. Trump's first-term deals with North Korea offer a clear illustration. Trump's outreach to Pyongyang produced a flashy meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but pledges to denuclearize in exchange for sanctions relief and security guarantees went nowhere. After the cameras left, Pyongyang returned to building warheads even as Trump proclaimed victory. A future bargain between Trump and Xi over Taiwan could have the same fate.



Alliances, likewise, waver in a personalist world. Leaders might embrace a country one day only to abandon it the next. Trump's hostility to NATO, for example, stems directly from his personalist view of statecraft. He believes that foreign policy is a running ledger of payments and favors, and because other NATO states have spent less on defense than Washington, they all owe the United States money or other resources. The fact that the organization has a long-running history, with joint planning committees, a central organization, and intergovernmental relationships, is irrelevant. Personalist leaders dispense with these formalities. They loosen and tighten alliances according to private preferences or relationships. Trump is therefore uniquely able to offer Putin concessions on NATO, including, perhaps, a tacit acceptance of Russian primacy in the former Soviet states the Kremlin claims as its sphere of influence. But such personalist flexibility also makes Washington into a less reliable partner. U.S. allies will hedge more and spend greater amounts on their own militaries in the years to come, weakening American leverage. The same is true for China's and Russia's partners; neither Xi nor Putin can make credible commitments. The result is a fracturing global system with countries that strike out on their own.

The global system will also be less democratic. Personalist leaders may occasionally spring from liberal states—as did Trump—but their style of governance is extremely hard to square with electoral democracy, and they care little for it. Putin, Trump, and Xi all appear to agree that democracy is an outmoded way to manage a country, and this shared disdain suggests a future in which it continues to erode worldwide. Washington has effectively abandoned democracy promotion and is forging links with authoritarian leaders who provide benefits to Trump in exchange for their own protection. When illiberal Argentinian President Javier Milei was faltering, for example, Trump handed his government a $20 billion lifeline, allowing the country to right its finances just in time for its midterm elections. Milei's party then mounted a furious comeback. The bailout rescued the investments of a hedge fund manager with close personal ties to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who had lobbied for the deal.

The flexibility that personalist rulers afford themselves might make it easier to solve some conflicts. But it is just as likely to start others. Russia is so overstretched in Ukraine, for instance, that further confrontation now seems reckless and unlikely. But many experts thought that Putin wasn't rash enough to start a major war before the 2022 invasion, and he did so anyway because his insular system had become incapable of producing accurate risk assessments. If his yes men tell him the the Baltics will fold in a two-day operation, he might believe them.

In a fractured personalist world, there will be far fewer checks to stop these leaders from acting on their impulses. If personalist leaders wind up squaring off against each other during a crisis, they may be more likely to escalate than would normal leaders. Personalists, after all, are reassured by sycophantic advisers and thus have fewer reasons to stand down. This tendency is alarming given that China, Russia, and the United States possess the world's largest nuclear arsenals and that guardrails against further proliferation appear to be collapsing. (Research shows that personalist regimes are more likely to seek nuclear weapons.) The United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia in Trump's first term, and the president has recently floated a return to nuclear testing.

The potential flashpoints are already visible. In Europe, Putin's appetite for territorial expansion hasn't been sated by Ukraine, leaving the continent's east vulnerable to aggression. (According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Russian sabotage operations across Europe have already quadrupled over the past year.) In East Asia, Xi has implied that Taiwan's absorption is a matter of personal legacy, not merely national interest, and as Ukraine shows, personalist leaders are willing to pay high costs for legacy projects. Trump has outwardly pledged to dominate the Western Hemisphere. Meanwhile, the Middle East, already volatile, offers especially rich ground for personalist miscalculation, given that China, Russia, and the United States all have energy interests in the region

The emerging global system is one in which three nuclear-armed leaders, insulated from dissent, pursue risky gambits. The result will not be the relatively stable if tense competition that characterized the Cold War. It will be something more volatile: a world in which the most consequential decisions rest on the whims of men who have systematically discarded anyone willing to tell them no.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Katie Uhlaender: Winter Olympics skeleton controversy rolls on as US athlete looks to JD Vance for help","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/sport/olympics-2026-katie-uhlaender-seeking-spot-milan-cortina","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:51:01 GMT","


            Skeleton athlete Katie Uhlaender says she should have been going to the 2026 Olympics in Italy next month. As a veteran of five Winter Games from 2006 to 2022, sliding in Turin, Vancouver, Sochi, PyeongChang and Beijing, the American would have made history by competing in a sixth.
    


            What denied her entry to the Milan-Cortina Olympics was her final qualification event in the North American Cup earlier this month at Lake Placid, where several Canadian competitors were withdrawn at the last minute. Despite Uhlaender winning the race, the sudden reduction in the number of athletes competing had reduced the amount of qualification points available, leaving her just short.
    


            Uhlaender accused the Canadian team and its coach, Joe Cecchini, of intentionally withdrawing the athletes, deliberately manipulating the field to benefit one of their own sliders' bids for qualification.
    


            Bobsleigh Canada Skeleton denied anything untoward, telling CNN Sports in a statement, “BCS remains confident that its actions were appropriate, transparent, and aligned with both athlete welfare and the integrity of the sport.” Cecchini didn't respond to CNN Sports' request for comment.
    


            Skeleton's governing body also dismissed Uhlaender's complaint, but she wasn't the only athlete to have been negatively impacted at Lake Placid and, since then, an increasing number of national teams have rallied behind her.
    


            “The only thing that brings me warmth in my heart, and hope – and lit a fire under my butt that you could equate to the Olympic flame – is that my community is coming together,” Uhlaender told CNN Sports. “We're trying to be heard.”
    


            The Lake Placid incident has thrown skeleton into turmoil. The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) quickly dismissed Uhlaender's complaints after its Interim Integrity Unit ruled that Cecchini had not breached its rules, code of conduct or code of ethics. Uhlaender accuses the governing body of a flawed investigation and that evidence or testimony from the athletes competing in Lake Placid was never considered.
    


            “It saddens me that they didn't respond to my email with the evidence,” Uhlaender explained. “They didn't reach out to any of the affected parties, not even afterwards, to make sure anyone was okay, and it makes the community feel isolated from the governance. I think this is an opportunity for us to all come together.”
    


            The day after the judgment was posted, Elisabeth Vathje, Executive Committee Member and Co-Chairperson of the Athlete Council within IBSF, resigned her position over what she described in an Instagram post as “a misalignment of values.”
    


            Citing the “reputational harm” to their sport, at least a dozen competing nations have thrown their weight behind Uhlaender, and the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has asked the International Olympic Committee's new president Kirsty Coventry and the IBSF to grant Uhlaender a wild card place at the Olympics. At stake, they argue, are the values upon which the Olympic movement was founded.
    


            In the letter seen by CNN Sports, Rocky Harris, USOPC's Chief of Sport and Athlete Services, wrote, “‘Ms. Uhlaender is the epitome of what it means to be an Olympian and truly embodies the Olympic spirit. … Allowing her to compete in Milano Cortina will deter others from engaging in unsporting conduct and ensure fair competition.”
    


            In support of their athlete, USA Bobsled Skeleton made a similar plea. “Granting Katie Uhlaender the opportunity to compete in Milano Cortina,” wrote CEO Aron McGuire, “would send a powerful message that dedication, character, and lifelong commitment to the values of the Games matter.”
    


            If she had come up short in Lake Placid, Uhlaender says she would have retired immediately. She's been recovering from hip surgery and limping through the season, almost quitting after the World Championships last March. She says that many of her fellow athletes who were there, including Janine Flock and Kim Bos, told her to keep going. She's still training now, hoping in the next two weeks to somehow find a pathway to the Games, but she insists that she's motivated by more than just personal gain.
    


            “It was never about getting into the Olympics, it was about standing up for the integrity of the sport,” she said. “I have to emphasize that when I see the younger generation witnessing competition manipulation like some are trying to justify it, ‘through the rules,' it concerns me because, if we didn't speak out and show that people care about the integrity of the sport and ethics, they might just fall in line and behave that way.
    


            “I don't want Canada to have a bad reputation; I'm hoping that we don't treat any (athlete) in this situation like an enemy. We treat them like a part of our community and try to show them that the better way forward is sticking together and being transparent and honest.”
    


            Uhlaender is now hoping US Vice President JD Vance, who is leading the nation's delegation to Milan-Cortina, will take her case to the International Olympic Committee and persuade the organization of its merits.
    


            She says she feels it's important the US sets an example, particularly given that her country will host the 2028 Summer Olympics in LA and the 2029 World Championships and the 2034 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.
    


            It's not lost on Uhlaender that one of the first nations to support her cause was Denmark, whose government is currently at loggerheads with the US over the fate of Greenland.
    


            “At moments such as this, the Olympic Movement has an opportunity, and a responsibility, to reaffirm its core values,” wrote Carsten P. Wulf, President of Bob & Skeleton Denmark to the IOC. “Our sport needs this. Our athletes want this. And the Olympic Movement would be strengthened by it.”
    


            “I think that this is a great opportunity to show that we really do care about one another more than is portrayed in politics because we're all human,” Uhlaender said. “If people don't fight to uphold those values and keep them alive, then politics will eat us up. We want to support the ethics and integrity of sport; sometimes, the good guys can win.”

            Tax-filing season has officially begun and will run though April 15.
    


            Hassle though it may be to file your federal income tax return, if you are like a majority of US filers, you will get a refund soon after you do.
    


            But this year, that refund may be noticeably larger – assuming nothing significant has changed about your financial or family life since 2024.
    


            The average refund paid out last year was $3,167 through December 26, per IRS filing statistics. And the Treasury is now projecting tax refunds will increase by an average of $1,000 this year per household.
    


            Why is that? Two main reasons: 1) Congress made a number of new and expanded tax breaks effective for tax year 2025; and 2) most people did not adjust the tax withholding on their paychecks last year to account for the changes in their tax breaks.
    


            “For clients whose income, filing status, and dependents haven't changed much since 2024, the combination of expanded tax benefits for 2025 and unchanged withholding is clearly pushing refunds higher,” said Tom O'Saben, director of tax content for the National Association of Tax Professionals.
    


            Let's first take that point on withholding.
    


            Your tax liability for 2025 went down because of changes to the tax law, but your tax payments didn't, he explained. “As a result, the ‘extra' tax benefit shows up as a refund rather than increased take-home pay,” O'Saben said.
    


            Or, for those who don't usually get a refund, it may simply result in a lower overall tax bill.
    


            While Congress made a bevy of tax changes for 2025 – e.g., offering a new tax break on car loan interest, a portion of tips and overtime pay; and a $200 increase per child in the child tax credit, etc., – the expansion of two common tax breaks and the introduction of a new one for seniors may account for the biggest increases in the average refund this year.
    


A larger standard deduction: The standard deduction is taken by the vast majority of filers. Congress boosted it by $750, to $15,750 for single filers; and by $1,500, to $31,500 for married couples filing jointly
    


            “This is the most broadly impactful change because it affects millions of filers across income levels and filing statuses. Even modest increases in the standard deduction translate directly into lower taxable income,” O'Saben said.
    


An expanded SALT deduction: If you live in a high-tax state, you will be allowed to deduct up to $40,000 in state and local taxes (either your income or sales taxes plus property taxes). That is up from $10,000 last year.
    


            You can only claim the deduction if you itemize, rather than take the standard deduction. But the jump in how much you may deduct means it may make sense for more filers to itemize.
    


            “This change can be significant and often produces a noticeable refund increase, especially when withholding was not adjusted,” O'Saben said.
    


A new senior deduction: It's income restricted and limited to those filers who are 65 or older. But eligible senior citizens will be allowed to take a special $6,000 deduction ($12,000 for joint filers) on top of either their standard deduction or their itemized deductions.
    


            “It can materially reduce tax liability,” O'Saben said.
    


            The AARP estimates more than 30 million seniors will benefit.
    


            A refund can be viewed in one of two ways: As an interest-free loan you made to the government, which is just paying you back your principal. Or as forced savings – money you might not have been diligent about setting aside had you gotten it in small installments throughout the year.
    


            If you're not a consistent saver, then getting a lump sum of forced savings may be a good strategy for you.
    


            But if you think you want to do more with your money throughout the year – like letting it earn interest in an online high-yield savings account or using it to pay down your current debts more quickly – you might consider checking the tax withholding on your paycheck.
    


            You may be seeing a little more in your paychecks already, because the IRS income tax withholding tables for 2026 have been adjusted, according to the Treasury. And those tables should account for all the tax breaks in effect for this year.
    


            But if you work with a tax adviser, check with the adviser to see if the taxes currently being withheld from your paycheck are about right given your eligibility for the new and expanded tax breaks on offer.
    


            Unfortunately, if you do it yourself, it can get a little complicated. And the IRS hasn't yet updated its withholding estimator to incorporate all the tax changes that went into effect in 2025.
    


            If you do make a change to your withholding (which you would do by submitting to your employer a new W4 form), it probably shouldn't be drastic. “A modest adjustment rather than a large reduction [in taxes withheld] helps avoid underpayment issues while still improving cash flow during the year,” O'Saben recommended.
    


            By that, he means, you might want to reduce your withholding just enough so that you still may end up getting a very small refund for a near break-even outcome. Otherwise, if you reduce your withholding too much, you might end up owing more than you expect to Uncle Sam when you file your 2026 return a year from now.

            Republican lawmakers are privately expressing relief that border czar Tom Homan will be taking over leadership of the immigration operations in Minnesota, sources told CNN.
    


            “He knows what he's doing. He's gets it,” one Republican lawmaker told CNN, saying that Homan understood the system and how to do enforcement operations the “correct way.”
    


            Homan is longtime border official with decades of law enforcement experience. While Homan has pushed for some of the Trump administration's most controversial immigration-related policies, allies and advisers view him as being “a grown up,” one source said.
    


            Lawmakers have been stressing the importance of getting the messaging right on immigration to the White House for weeks, two sources told CNN. The sources stressed that they still support Trump's immigration crackdown and believe that the country does too, but they felt that the White House was not articulating a thought-out plan to the public.
    


            On the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota over the weekend, Republican allies and advisers told CNN that no one should be getting ahead of an investigation.
    


            “I think everyone wants a transparent and independent investigation,” one lawmaker said. “It seems the White House is getting that message, or at least I hope they are.”
    


            Gov. Tim Walz said President Donald Trump agreed to consider reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and pledged to talk to his Department of Homeland Security about ensuring state officials can investigate Saturday's fatal shooting.
    


            The two leaders spoke by phone Monday morning, with Trump also describing it as “a good call.” The comments marked a notable shift in tone from the president, who has repeatedly attacked Minnesota Democratic officials.
    


            In the full readout from Walz's office, the Minnesota governor said he argued to Trump that there needs to be “impartial investigations of the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, and that we need to reduce the number of federal agents in Minnesota.”
    


            Walz's office said the president agreed to talk to DHS “about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case.”
    


            Walz said Trump “also agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals.”
    


            Trump has called for more cooperation from Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, including that they “turn over” all undocumented immigrants incarcerated in the state to federal authorities.
    


            “The Governor reminded President Trump that the Minnesota Department of Corrections already honors federal detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody isn't a U.S. citizen,” Walz's office said.
    


            Members of the Minnesota National Guard handed out coffee, hot chocolate, donuts and hand warmers to protesters and others outside the Whipple Federal Building in frigid Minneapolis temperatures Sunday.
    


            A guardsman on the scene told CNN affiliate WCCO that the hospitality was their “demonstration of safety and security and that they're here to help.”
    


            The guardsmen in the video were wearing reflective yellow vests, which the Guard has said is “to help distinguish them from other agencies in similar uniforms.”
    


            “These Minnesota National Guardsmen live, work, and serve in our state, and are focused on protecting life, preserving property, and ensuring Minnesotans can safely exercise their First Amendment rights,” the Guard previously posted online.
    


            The Whipple Federal Building, where many people are temporarily detained after being taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, has become a site of steady crowds and demonstrations against the immigration enforcement blitz in Minnesota.
    


            Gov. Tim Walz activated the National Guard to assist Hennepin County law enforcement with crowd control and to provide backup to Minneapolis police.

            Facing a lawsuit requesting an end to Operation Metro Surge in the Twin Cities, a Trump administration attorney said the surge of federal agents is to enforce the law, not coerce the state to change its policies.
    


            “If you work with us, we will probably need less resources, less boots on the ground,” Department of Justice attorney Brantley Mayers said during a federal court hearing in Minnesota this morning.
    


            Today's hearing — which still is underway — relates to a lawsuit in which Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seek an end to Operation Metro Surge, the federal government's influx of immigration officers into the Minneapolis area.  The plaintiffs first want a temporary restraining order that would halt the operation while the suit plays out.
    


            Judge Katherine Menendez asked if there was any legal boundary to the number of federal officers that could be sent to the state.
    


            “Would 10,000 ICE agents on the ground in the Twin Cities cross the line?” Menendez asked. “I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcement of immigration law?”
    


            “I have a hard time (believing) there is a judicially administrable line as to when too many boots on the ground is too many,” Mayers responded.
    


            Menendez spoke skeptically about President Trump's online January 13 statement that the state would get a “day of reckoning & retribution,” but Mayers said the president's threats don't affect his power.
    


            “I don't think that would negate the fact that there is legitimate law enforcement activity going on in Minnesota that the federal government has the authority to do,” he said.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called him “with the request to work together with respect to Minnesota” and that he facilitated a call between Walz and border czar Tom Homan, who the president is sending to the state.
    


            “It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, striking a notably conciliatory tone, given how he and other administration officials have repeatedly attacked Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.
    


                    “I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession. The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future,” Trump said, adding that Walz is “happy” Homan is going to Minnesota.
                





            Trump emphasized “tremendous SUCCESS” with federal coordination in other cities, ending on an optimistic note: “Both Governor Walz and I want to make it better!”
    


            CNN has reached out to Walz's office for comment on the call.
    


            Just yesterday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Walz of spreading “malicious lies about federal law enforcement officers,” “placing targets” on their backs and encouraging chaos.
    


            Trump's request for cooperation was part of a list of demands he posted on social media Sunday night, calling on Walz, Frey and every Democratic governor and mayor to “to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence.”
    


            Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi is expressing regret for his vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security last week in the wake of the second fatal shooting by a federal agent in Minneapolis.
    


                    “I failed to view the DHS funding vote as a referendum on the illegal and immoral conduct of ICE in Minneapolis. I hear the anger from my constituents, and I take responsibility for that. I have long been critical of ICE's unlawful behavior and I must do a better job demonstrating that,” Suozzi said in a statement on Monday.
                





            Suozzi, who represents a swing district in New York, was one of seven Democrats who crossed party lines to back the bill last Thursday, sending it to the Senate – along with other bills to fund the government – for consideration.
    


            “The senseless and tragic murder of Alex Pretti underscores what happens when untrained federal agents operate without accountability. President Trump must immediately end ‘Operation Metro Surge' and ICE's occupation of Minneapolis that has sown chaos, led to tragedy, and undermined experienced local law enforcement,” Suozzi said.
    


For context: The violence has caused unease among Democrats, as well as several Republicans, as they face a January 30 deadline to fund DHS and other federal agencies.
    


            Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday evening that his caucus would not pass a bill to fund a large portion of the government, including DHS, unless restrictions are placed on immigration enforcement, increasing the likelihood of a partial government shutdown Friday at midnight.
    


            During an opening exchange with attorneys that lasted well over an hour, a federal judge said today she is reluctant to decide the merits of the Trump administration's immigration policy as the state of Minnesota asks her to roll back Operation Metro Surge.
    


            “The state has one set of values around immigration enforcement … the federal government has a different set of values captured in its enforcement,” Judge Katherine Menendez, a Biden appointee, said. “We're at risk of asking me to decide who's right here.”
    


            Today's hearing in Minnesota – which still is underway –  relates to a lawsuit in which the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seek a temporary restraining order halting Operation Metro Surge, the federal government's surge of immigration officers into the Minneapolis area.
    


            Noting state attorneys had raised a number of concerns from the stress on local law enforcement to warrantless entry of homes, Menendez said, “I can't be the global keeper of all the things here.”
    


            Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said he was not asking the judge to make a judgment on policy, but cited a Truth Social post from President Trump to assert the administration has clearly gone too far.
    


            “He said, ‘Minnesota, your day of retribution is here.' It's crazy!” Carter said, emphatically raising his hands in the air. “How can that not violate equal sovereignty?”
    


            When Menendez asked how the state wanted Operation Metro Surge to be changed, Carter replied, “Just end it. End the whole thing.”
    


            After a brief recess, the hearing has resumed with Trump administration attorneys beginning to present their side of the case.
    


            The White House border czar who President Donald Trump is deploying to Minnesota following the fatal shooting of two American citizens is a longtime border official who has pushed for some of the Trump administration's most controversial immigration-related policies.
    


            Trump said today he was sending Tom Homan to Minnesota this evening, following Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti. The incident has inflamed tensions and drawn bipartisan criticism for the Department of Homeland Security's portrayal — without evidence — of Pretti as a terrorist who wanted to massacre law enforcement.
    


            Homan has decades worth of law enforcement experience. As acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump's first term, Homan served as the public face and vocal defender of some of the administration's most contentious policies, including the separation of children and families who cross the border.
    


            He said at a public event in September 2017 that his agency would arrest undocumented people who came forward to care for the children, which previous administrations had avoided.
    


            He virulently opposes “sanctuary city” policies that restrict local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration efforts.
    


            The New York Times reported in September that Homan was recorded in 2024 accepting a bag that contained $50,000 in cash by undercover FBI agents in an investigation the Trump Justice Department later closed.
    


            A person familiar with the operation had told CNN that Homan accepted the cash as part of a sting operation, and that Homan was being investigated for potential bribery and other crimes after he agreed to help the undercover agents secure government contracts. Homan, meanwhile, has denied doing anything illegal.
    


            But the Department of Justice shut down the investigation after Trump began his second term last year, over doubts prosecutors could prove Homan had agreed to a specific act in exchange for the cash and because he was not in a government position at the time. The White House later called the investigation into Homan “blatantly political.”
    


CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Isabelle D'Antonio contributed.



            A White House official said Monday that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will remain in her role leading the department and retains the confidence and trust of President Donald Trump.
    


            The assertion came soon after Trump announced he was dispatching veteran ICE official Tom Homan to lead operations in Minnesota. The move suggested he was sidelining top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, whose heavy handed enforcement style had Noem's backing, even as it drew criticism.
    


            “Secretary Noem will continue to lead the Department of Homeland Security with the full trust and confidence of the President,” a White House official told CNN.
    


            “Tom Homan is uniquely positioned to drop everything and focus solely on Minnesota to solve the problems that have been created by a lack of cooperation from state and local officials,” the official added.
    


            Homan has generally sought to focus enforcement on public safety and national security threats, as well as so-called “collaterals,” meaning undocumented immigrants that may be in the vicinity of a targeted operation. That is slightly different from the broad sweeps that have been occurring in cities nationwide. And Homan and Noem have at time been at odds; the two have generally not spoken to each other in recent months, according to US officials.
    


            Senate Democrats and Republicans are weighing how to move forward on funding the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies, according to sources familiar with the matter, and the clock is ticking with a January 30 deadline to fund the government.
    


            Aides emphasized that the dynamics fundamentally shifted over the last 72 hours following the deadly shooting in Minneapolis. On Friday, no one was anticipating a government shutdown. By Saturday night, it became clear that there may be little way to avoid one.
    


            Republicans say they are exploring all options as it relates to Democratic demands to strip the DHS bill out of the House-passed six-bill appropriations package to fund the government. A top goal, they say, is to prevent a shutdown of what amounts to 75% of the government's spending.
    


            Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to coalesce around a single set of demands, but a source familiar with those talks said conversations about what kinds of reforms Democrats will seek as it pertains to DHS are still ongoing. Democratic leaders are still soliciting suggestions and ideas from their members.
    


            Nothing is at all finalized, however, and a quick compromise between the parties on changes to ICE would be difficult.

            Operation Metro Surge is not an effort to ensure the safety of people in Minnesota, the state attorney general's office argued in federal court this morning, but is rather an attempt to force the state into cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a way that courts have said the federal government can't require.
    


                    “This administration is not content with the rule of law,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said during the hearing, which still is underway. “They are not content with letting the courts work this stuff out. Instead, they put violence onto the streets of Minnesota to get what they want.”
                





            Today's hearing in Minnesota relates to a lawsuit, filed earlier this month by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, seeking a temporary restraining order halting Operation Metro Surge, the federal government's surge of immigration officers into the Minneapolis area.
    


            During legal arguments — which so far have lasted nearly an hour -— state attorneys said that a letter from US Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over the weekend that appears to set conditions on the end of the surge shows the operation is not primarily about law enforcement.
    


            “Moving the goalposts like that exhibits malice. That exhibits coercion; that exhibits a unilateral, ‘You're going to do what I want you to do, and that's the end of it. And you'd better pray I don't alter the bargain anymore,'” Carter said.
    


            Trump administration lawyers have not yet been given the opportunity to speak in the hearing.
    


            A group of federal government health care workers said in a letter to the US Senate that Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations pose “a clear threat to the health and safety of our communities,” and called on Congress to vote against funding for the Department of Homeland Security.
    


            The letter was sent by Save HHS, a grassroots group of current and former Health and Human Services workers. It comes two days after Alex Pretti, a Veterans Affairs nurse, was fatally shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis.
    


                    “As a Veterans Affairs nurse, Alex took the same oath we did: to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic,” the letter said. “Like Alex, we are compelled to speak out against threats to our nation.”
                





            Democrats have said they will reject a bill to fund DHS over the shooting, raising the possibility of a partial government shutdown. The workers wrote in the letter that they could be furloughed if the spending package fails to pass but say “ICE and CBP are a greater threat to the health of our nation than the lapse of HHS services.”
    


            It continues: “ICE now poses a clear threat to the health and safety of our communities. Families are skipping medical appointments, going without food, and keeping their children out of school for fear of abduction, deportation without due process, or violent assault. U.S. citizens also fear for their safety and well-being when ICE or CBP are present.”
    


            A federal judge said in court this morning she was “having a hard time” determining how she would have the authority to roll back Operation Metro Surge as requested by the state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities.
    


            Today's hearing in Minnesota relates to a lawsuit, filed earlier this month by the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, seeking a temporary restraining order stopping Operation Metro Surge, the federal government's surge of immigration officers into the Minneapolis area.
    


                    “I think it kind of goes without saying that we are in shockingly unusual times,” District Court Judge Katherine Menendez said during today's hearing. “I don't know that that gives me greater license to craft a remedy in the 10th Amendment.”
                





            Standing at a table alongside his boss, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter acknowledged it is difficult for the state to cite a legal precedent for the order they seek.
    


                    “The difficulty with the case law on this situation is that the situation is unprecedented in the 250-year history of our country,” Carter said. “We have never had a federal government amass what is essentially an army of 3,000 to 4,000 masked, heavily armed federal agents and sent them into a state and basically stir the pot.”
                





            An attorney for the state of Minnesota told a federal judge the state wants an immediate order bringing an end to Operation Metro Surge in an impassioned opening statement at a court hearing this morning.
    


            “Minnesota should not have to withstand another month, another week or another single day of the lawful and unchecked invasion and occupation by thousands of federal agents,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Linsdey Middlecamp said.
    


            “Since we filed (this lawsuit) on January 12, another person has been shot dead in broad daylight by DHS agents,” Middlecamp said, referring to Saturday's fatal shooting of protester Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.
    


            Today's hearing relates to a lawsuit, filed by the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, for a temporary restraining order stopping Operation Metro Surge, the federal government's surge of immigration officers into the Minneapolis area.
    


            Citing a letter sent to state leaders by US Attorney General Pam Bondi — which called on the state to repeal so-called sanctuary policies and to share Medicaid, food assistance and voter data with the federal government — Middlecamp accused the government of using Operation Metro Surge as a bargaining chip for political disputes.
    


            “Pam Bondi sent what can only be described as a random note setting out the terms on which the federal government is holding Minnesota's public safety, public health and public education hostage,” Middlecamp said.
    


            Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche claimed that no one is interpreting the Trump administration's labeling of Alex Pretti's actions as domestic terrorism by the legal definition, despite Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem saying exactly that.
    


            “I don't think anybody thinks that they were comparing what happened on Saturday to the legal definition of domestic terrorism. What we saw was a very violent altercation, and we — I am not going to prejudge the facts,” Blanche said on “Fox & Friends” on Monday morning.
    


            Yet on Saturday, Noem directly compared Pretti's actions to the legal definition of domestic terrorism.
    


            “When you perpetuate violence against a government because of ideological reasons and for reasons to resist and perpetuate violence, that is the definition of domestic terrorism. This individual, who came with weapons and ammunition to stop a law enforcement operation of federal law enforcement officers, committed an act of domestic terrorism. That's the facts,” Noem said.
    


            Just hours after the shooting, top White House aide Stephen Miller called Alex Pretti a “domestic terrorist” who “tried to assassinate federal law endorsement.”
    


            According to US code, domestic terrorism involves actions that are “dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State” and “appear to be intended to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.”
    


            Blanche's comments on Fox today also contradict what he said earlier in the interview, urging caution as an investigation plays out.
    


            “We always investigate any conduct like this, any shooting like this,” he said, “We'll get to the bottom of everything that happened. But it is extraordinarily important that we do not jump to conclusions about anything that happened on Saturday morning.”
    


            Immigration agents have opened fire in 19 incidents since the Trump administration began its immigration crackdown in June 2025, according to a newly updated analysis from The Trace, a nonprofit journalism organization that focuses on gun violence.
    


            The analysis, which used data from the Gun Violence Archive, encompasses the operations in Minneapolis as well as previous operations in Los Angeles; Washington, DC; Memphis; Charlotte, North Carolina; Portland, Oregon; and New Orleans.
    


            A federal court hearing in Minnesota on a lawsuit to end Operation Metro Surge, the federal government's surge of immigration officers into the Minneapolis area, has begun.
    


             Judge Katherine Menendez is hearing the request — filed earlier this month by the state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul — for a temporary restraining order. The judge had said she wanted to hear from both sides before making a decision on the request.
    


            The complaint argues the aggressive influx of federal immigration officers into the state “is driven by nothing more than the Trump Administration's desire to punish political opponents and score partisan points—at the direct expense of Plaintiffs' residents.”
    


            The Trump administration's response says the lawsuit has “not a shred of legal support,” adding the president has “broad authority” to enforce federal immigration law.
    


            They also want the judge to place several limits on federal officers who remain in the state, including prohibiting them from concealing their identities with masks and approaching suspects based only on “race, ethnicity, accented speech, or proximity to predominantly Immigrant-serving businesses or cultural centers.”
    


            President Donald Trump's announcement that Tom Homan, a veteran ICE official, is being dispatched to Minneapolis Monday suggests a potential sidelining of the heavy-handed tactics used by top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and underscores the ongoing internal dispute within the administration over executing the president's immigration agenda.
    


            The move has been met with relief from some Homeland Security officials who have been waiting for Homan, the White House border czar, to weigh in, given his vast experience in federal law enforcement.
    


            Bovino's enforcement style has been backed by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. But Homan has generally taken a more stringent approach to immigration enforcement — wanting to focus on public safety and national security threats, as well as so-called “collaterals,” meaning undocumented immigrants that may be in the vicinity of a targeted operation.
    


            That is slightly different from the broad sweeps that have been occurring in cities nationwide. While Homan's publicly been in line with the Trump administration, there has been infighting between factions who back him and those who back Noem. Homan and Noem have generally not spoken to each other in recent months, according to US officials.
    


            In a post on X Monday, Noem called Homan going to Minneapolis “good news,” saying: “I have worked closely with Tom over the last year and he has been a major asset to our team— his experience and insight will help us in our wide-scale fraud investigations, which have robbed Americans, and will help us to remove even more public safety threats and violent criminal illegal aliens off the of streets of Minneapolis.”
    


            Homan is expected to manage ICE operation in Minnesota, according to the White House. It was not immediately clear how Bovino's role would change going forward.
    


            President Donald Trump sending his Border Czar Tom Homan to Minnesota, “is just escalating tensions,” Minneapolis City Council member Soren Stevenson said.
    


            “They are losing the battle in people's minds,” Stevenson told CNN's Sara Sidner. “Because we're seeing the video. We're seeing what's happening. We're seeing that this is Minnesota.”
    


            “They're losing this narrative battle, and so he's sending in his top guard. And really, it's escalating, because we just want to be left alone,” he added. “The chaos in our community is coming from ICE. It's coming from this invasion that we're under … and it's got to stop.”
    


            Passing a bill to issue further government funding to the Department of Homeland Security after Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis is something American people “cannot stand for,” US Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-New York, said today.
    


            “We should not be passing any money to DHS so they can continue the kind of harassment and execution, as we saw, by ICE, of American citizens,” Meeks told John Berman on “CNN News Central.”
    


            “This is something that we cannot stand for, and it should not be who we are because it's not who we are as American people,” he added.
    


            Meeks previously voted against the bill when it was brought to the House of Representatives, but it passed with some Democratic support. The lawmaker urged Democrats in the Senate to vote it down.
    


            The congressman asserted that the administration's description of the incident that led to the death of Alex Pretti on Saturday conflicts with the footage captured and shared by civilians at the scene.
    


            “What we're hearing is the same kind of rhetoric that you hear from totalitarian governments, like when you hear the ayatollah tell peaceful protesters they can't protest,” he said.
    


            “Here, you have an individual with a camera … and he is now dead.Shot at 10 times. Hit several times. No investigation,” Meeks said. “And the Trump administration is saying that he was violently going after police officers, denying the American people what they can see with their own eyes.”

            Claims by Trump administration officials that the man fatally shot by a federal agent in Minneapolis lacked a right to possess a firearm and that his killing was justified are being dismissed by legal experts and assailed by gun rights groups ordinarily aligned with the president.
    


            The rhetoric from Trump law enforcement officials, including his FBI director and the top Border Patrol agent, goes against the decadeslong GOP effort to throttle gun control rules.
    


            “They've stood up in court and tried to push back against state laws that regulate firearms — access, use, carry — so it's pretty shocking to me to see them now use an example of a lawful gun owner as justification for force,” Megan Walsh, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who specializes in the Second Amendment, said of the Trump officials' comments.
    


            A federal immigration officer shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday after wrestling the lawful gun owner to the ground as he was recording agents with a phone. At least one officer can be heard shouting “he's got a gun” as one officer appears to reach into Pretti's waistband. An officer appears to step away holding Pretti's weapon, and then a shot rings out about a second later, followed by at least nine more, videos reviewed by CNN show.
    


            “We respect that Second Amendment right, but those rights don't count when you riot and assault, delay, obstruct and impede law enforcement officers and, most especially, when you mean to do that beforehand,” Border Patrol Commander-at-Large Gregory Bovino told CNN's Dana Bash on Sunday.
    


            Bovino, who has been leading the administration's immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis, did not cite evidence on his claims that Pretti committed violence or interfered with agents or that the protest was a “riot.”
    


            Minnesota has for years allowed the open and concealed carry of a handgun with a license issued after an applicant meets certain criteria, and state regulations do not restrict such individuals from having firearms at protests. The state's laws are so permissive that licensed firearm owners are even allowed to bring guns into Minnesota's Capitol building.
    


            Yet FBI Director Kash Patel, one of several administration officials who rushed to defend the shooting, said on Fox News:  “You cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest that you want. It's that simple.”
    


            “No one who wants to be peaceful shows up at a protest with a firearm that is loaded with two full magazines,” he added.
    


            Walsh said she sees “no gray in this situation.”
    


            “He was lawfully carrying a firearm, and that is not any license to kill someone,” Walsh said. “We have a Constitution that provides a Second Amendment individual right, and it is unlawful to kill a man for exercising his constitutional rights.”
    


            Walsh noted that the Trump administration's rhetoric toward Pretti is out of step with its opposition to state firearms regulations. Just last week, the Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to strike down a Hawaii law that bans people from carrying guns onto private property without the explicit approval of the property owner, arguing it trampled on Second Amendment rights.
    


            Amy Sweasy, a former longtime prosecutor in the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, which prosecutes cases in Minneapolis, agreed.
    


            “It is inconsistent to hear an administration that has been very, very vocal in protecting Second Amendment rights and things like concealed-carry laws and open-carry laws to then — in a victim-blaming sense — saying, ‘Our agents aren't responsible' or that that this young man lost his life because of choices he made that are actually guaranteed to him by the same laws that they purport to support,” she said.
    


            Patel's statements also drew immediate pushback from the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus, which on Sunday joined several other gun rights advocacy groups in sounding the alarm.
    


            Gun rights groups have long defended the right to openly carry firearms in public, a position that Trump and others on the right have championed over the years.
    


            “This is completely incorrect on Minnesota law. There is no prohibition on a permit holder carrying a firearm, loaded, with multiple magazines at a protest or rally in Minnesota,” the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus wrote on X in response to Patel's comments.
    


            A day earlier, Bill Essayli, a top prosecutor in the US Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, posted on X that “if you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you. Don't do it!”
    


            Those remarks drew swift condemnation from the National Rifle Association, the US' leading gun lobby, which called them “dangerous and wrong” and urged officials to resist “making generalizations and demonizing law-abiding citizens.”
    


            Another prominent group, the Gun Owners of America, described Essayli's comments as “untoward” and said the Second Amendment “protects Americans' right to bear arms while protesting — a right the federal government must not infringe upon.”
    


            Andrew Willinger, a professor at Georgia State University's College of Law and expert on the Second Amendment, said that while the groups may not be outright embracing Pretti, their rapid rejection of the officials' statements underscore a commitment to the gun rights they've worked to advance.
    


            “At the very least, I think it will put them in a tough position if they don't,” Willinger said. “It may be an instance where these gun rights groups are going to have to decide what to do when the victim is not your typical gun owner … and I think that might be the case here.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Analysis: Xi has absolute control over China's military. Now he wants more","https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/china/xi-jinping-zhang-youxia-military-probe-intl-hnk","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 09:25:07 GMT","


            Chinese leader Xi Jinping's decision to place the country's top-ranking general under investigation is a stunning move that leaves Xi virtually alone at the top of the military hierarchy – raising deep questions about the implications for the world's largest armed forces, as well as Beijing's ambitions to take control of Taiwan.
    


            But the purge also makes one thing clear: Xi sees no target as too big to be taken down as he remakes the military according to his vision – and prioritizes loyalty over all else.
    


            The investigations into Zhang Youxia, a battle-tested, seasoned military commander and longtime Xi ally, and Liu Zhenli, who heads People's Liberation Army (PLA) joint operations, were announced Saturday in a terse 30-second video released by the defense ministry.
    


            A subsequent editorial in the People's Liberation Army Daily accused Zhang and Liu of “seriously trampling on and undermining the system of ultimate responsibility resting with the Central Military Commission chairman” – jargon that suggests they were a threat to the thing that matters most in Xi's eyes: his authority.
    


            The allegations mark an apparent culmination in a ruthless, more than decade-long effort by Xi to oust opposition and clean up alleged graft. In recent years, that purge has depleted the military's upper echelon, with more than 20 senior military officials placed under investigation or ousted since 2023.
    


            Just how deep that effort runs is now made even clearer in the probe against Zhang.
    


            The general had long been seen as an unassailable, close, ally of Xi – another “princeling” son of revolutionaries, whose ties with the Chinese leader go back a generation to their fathers who fought together in China's Civil War.
    


            “This is potentially a seismic shift in Chinese politics under Xi, and how he governs – this really demonstrates nobody in that system is safe, truly,” said Jonathan Czin, a fellow at the Brooking Institution's China Center.
    


            The purge has “reached a crescendo now where it's hit the uppermost echelons of the party,” said Czin, also a former CIA analyst on China. That suggests Xi has concluded “the rot is so deep in the PLA and the mismanagement is so gross at the top that he needs to clean house within an entire generation of leaders.”
    


            And when it comes to Zhang, that downfall is “almost Shakespearean,” Czin said, coming within the broader arc of how Xi began by going after enemies profiting off their positions, moved on to target even those he appointed himself and is now taking down even those with whom he's had a long-standing relationship.
    


            “For Xi to get rid of a guy like this is really remarkable … because there's so little trust and because the politics are so vicious (in this system), those kind of relationships are even more of a precious commodity …they don't take years to build, they take decades, or in this instance, potentially a lifetime.”
    


            The circumstances around Zhang's investigation remain unclear likely not only to those outside but also within the black box of China's military, a massive and opaque entity even by China's usual standards.
    


            The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources familiar with a high-level briefing on the allegations, that Zhang had been accused of leaking “core technical data on China's nuclear weapons to the US” as well as accepting bribes for official acts “including the promotion of an officer to defense minister.” CNN has not verified those claims and has reached out to China's defense ministry for comment.
    


            But some experts wonder whether allegations of sharing secrets could merely be part of the party's effort to drum up explanations to ease concern within its ranks rather than legitimate concerns.
    


            And rumors have swirled in the vacuum of information.
    


            Those include speculation about Xi losing his grip on power, a theory experts largely reject. Others have focused on whether Xi is quashing rival factions within the military, which some observers say is plausible if the leader believed infighting was distracting top officials – or if Zhang was becoming a challenge his authority.
    


Roiled by purges and buffeted by US frictions, China's leadership meets to chart country's rise



            The official language used in the PLA Daily editorial “could suggest that Zhang was becoming too powerful for Xi's liking,” according to Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis.
    


            It could also mean “simply that he betrayed (Xi's) trust by helping corrupt the procurement bureaucracy and/or not doing his utmost to create a cleaner fighting force,” he said.
    


            Since coming to power in 2012, Xi has driven a sweeping effort to reshape the military, not just to make it into a modern force able to take on rivals like the United States and back China's territorial claims, but, more importantly, to defend the party – and its leader – no matter what.
    


            That's a goal that's widely seen as driven by Xi's shrewd look at history as he eyes autocratic regimes that have fallen when leaders lost control of the military. It's also one that is closely linked to the organization of China's military, which is controlled by the party, not the state.
    


            A massive reorganization and technological modernization have gone hand in hand with an anti-corruption drive. Dozens of high-ranking military officials and defense sector executives have been taken down in the latest wave of those efforts since 2023.
    


            But Xi's push to purge even his top brass more likely stands as testament to his power than weakness, experts say.
    


            “The fact that Xi Jinping has been able to cashier so many PLA elites since he assumed power … is a clear sign his position in the regime is unassailable,” said James Char, an assistant professor at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies' Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies in Singapore.
    


            The latest move now leaves Xi virtually alone at the top of China's military hierarchy.
    


            The powerful Central Military Commission he chairs had six uniformed members after a regular leadership reshuffle in 2022. The latest probe (though yet to result in formal expulsions), leaves just one of those members standing: Zhang Shengmin, the military's anti-corruption tsar.
    


            High-level ousters have left the PLA leadership “in a state of disarray right now,” said Thomas at the Asia Society.
    


            “There are barely any officers left at the rank of general. I'm sure there are capable people waiting in the wings, but they'd all be new to senior leadership positions,” he said, noting Xi may use the more than 18 months before the next leadership reshuffle to vet new leadership candidates and “weed out the influence of existing patronage relations.”
    


            But in the meantime, Xi has already been tapping second-line PLA officers to largely informally fill roles vacated by their disgraced predecessors across both Central Military Commission departments and branches of the military, according to Char in Singapore.
    


            “The PLA's daily operations have carried on as normal despite these purges since a younger – and perhaps more professional – officer corps is on hand to assume those responsibilities,” he said.
    


            But what that means for Beijing's broader ambitions – including its goal to take control of self-ruling Taiwan – is less clear. China's ruling Communist Party claims the island as its own territory, despite never having controlled it.
    


            At the heart of that question are the matters of whether there will be an impact to the immediate operability of the military, the morale of the rank and file, or any timelines that Beijing may have for preparedness to achieve that goal, including through the use of military force.
    


            The probe of Liu in particular underscores those questions, analysts say, given his role coordinating the PLA's top combat command institution.
    


            But that might not be an issue of too much concern for Xi at the moment, according to Brookings' Czin.
    


            Instead, he said, the Chinese leader is likely looking at a US administration that doesn't seem “particularly interested” in the issue of Taiwan and at the potential for a change of power in the Taiwan elections in 2028, and calculating: now is a “safe time to clean house.”

Thousands of anti-ICE protesters marched through Minneapolis on Sunday to voice their anger at the fatal shooting of a local man a day earlier. “Shut it down,” they chanted, as many waved signs calling for justice for 37-year-old Alex Pretti who was shoot and killed by a Border Patrol agent on Saturday morning. (AP video by Laura Bargfeld)

A federal judge is hearing arguments on whether she should at least temporarily halt the immigration crackdown in Minnesota that has led to the fatal shootings of two people by government officers.

The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. The shooting of Alex Pretti by a Border Patrol officer on Saturday has only added urgency to the case.

Since the original court filing, the state and cities have substantially added to their original request in an effort to restore the order that existed before the Trump administration launched Operation Metro Surge in Minnesota on Dec. 1. The lawsuit asks U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez to order a reduction in the number of federal law enforcement officers and agents in Minnesota back to the level before the surge and to limit the scope of the enforcement operation.

Here's what to know:








Monday's hearing in federal court on Minnesota and the Twin Cities' suit aiming to halt the Trump administration's surge of immigration law enforcement has ended without the judge ruling from the bench.

U.S. District Court Judge Katherine Menendez said if “there were a burner in front of the front burner” this issue would be on it for her and she plans to issue a written opinion, though didn't specify when.

A Monday morning call between President Donald Trump and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz about fatal shootings by immigration officers appears to have been well-received by both sides.

Walz' office said the call was “productive.”

“The Governor made the case that we need impartial investigations of the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, and that we need to reduce the number of federal agents in Minnesota,” his office wrote in a release. 

Renee Good and Alex Pretti, both Minnesota residents and U.S. citizens, were fatally shot and killed by federal immigration officers in separate incidents in Minneapolis.

Trump agreed to talk to the Department of Homeland Security about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, Walz' office said, and also agreed to look into either reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota or working with the state “in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals.”

Trump wrote in a social media post earlier Monday that the two “actually” seem to be on the same page in wanting to work together on immigration issues in Minnesota. He said the people the administration is seeking “are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession” and Walz “very respectfully, understood that.”

More than 3,000 federal immigration officers are part of the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, a Department of Justice attorney told a federal judge on Monday.

Brantley Mayers, counsel to the DOJ's assistant attorney general, told U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez that at least 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and at least 1,000 Customs and Border Patrol officers were part of the operation, and that he would provide her with an exact number later.

Minnesota state and Twin Cities officials have asked Menendez to halt the immigration crackdown, which has led to widespread unrest. Two Minnesota residents have been shot and killed by immigration officials since the crackdown began.

Menendez asked Mayers why so many officers were needed. Mayers said it had to do with complications surrounding how immigration officers typically stage for enforcement operations, gathering in parking lots.

Twin Cities officials have taken steps to prohibit city-owned parking lots and garages from being used in immigration enforcement operations. Chicago officials took similar steps after immigration crackdowns in that city last year.

“I failed to view the DHS funding vote as a referendum on the illegal and immoral conduct of ICE in Minneapolis,” Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., posted on social media. “I hear the anger from many of my constituents, and I take responsibility for that. I have long been critical of ICE's unlawful behavior and I must do a better job demonstrating that.”

Suozzi was one of the seven moderate Democrats who voted with Republicans last week to pass a tranche of funding for the Department of Homeland Security.

The congressman added that the “senseless and tragic murder of Alex Pretti underscores what happens when untrained federal agents operate without accountability” and called on President Donald Trump to end ICE's enhanced enforcement operation in Minnesota.

A federal judge asked a Justice Department attorney about the federal government's motivation behind the immigration crackdown in Minnesota during a hearing on the state's request for an emergency halt to the immigration enforcement.

“So the goal of the surge is not to get the state and cities to change sanctuary policies?” Menendez asked Brantley Mayers, counsel to the DOJ's assistant attorney general.

No, Mayers said — the goal is to enforce federal law.

The judge also expressed skepticism about a letter recently sent by Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz asking the state to allow the federal government to access state voter roles, turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and repeal sanctuary policies. All three requests are the subject of litigation, she noted.

“Would 10,000 ICE agents on the ground in the Twin Cities cross the line?” Menendez asked Mayers. “I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?”

Mayers said one lawful action shouldn't be used to discredit another lawful action.

“I don't see how the fact that we're also doing additional things that we are allowed to do, that the Constitution has vested us with doing, would in any way negate another piece of the same operation, the same surge.”

And the president said the two “actually” seem to be on the same page in wanting to work together as it relates to immigration issues in Minnesota.

Trump said the people the administration is seeking “are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession” and Walz “very respectfully, understood that.”

“He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!” Trump wrote in a social media post which was notable for its warm and collaborative tone toward Minnesota's governor, whom Trump frequently derides.

At issue is whether the federal court should at least temporarily halt the immigration crackdown in Minnesota that's led to the fatal shootings of two people by government officers.

In arguments before U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, lawyers for the state and Twin Cities argued the situation is so dire on the street as to require the court to halt the federal government's immigration enforcement actions.

“If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don't think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said.

The Justice Department's attorneys were set to speak later Monday.

Judge Menendez asked attorneys for the state and cities where she should draw the line between legitimate law enforcement response and one that violates the Constitution.

“The images of this incident are deeply troubling and a full and transparent investigation of this officer involved shooting must take place immediately,” the Republican who served during President Trump's first term wrote on X. He also said he was praying for Alex Pretti's family as well as Minnesota citizens and state and federal law enforcement officers.

“The American people deserve to have safe streets, our laws enforced and our constitutional rights of Freedom of Speech, peaceable assembly and the right to keep and bear Arms respected and preserved all at the same time,” Pence wrote. “That's how Law and Order and Freedom work together in America.”

Pence is one of a growing number of Republicans to press for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics in Minnesota.

The attorney representing the family of Renee Good, who was fatally shot by a federal immigration officer earlier this month in Minneapolis, said in a statement that it was “terrifying, deeply disturbing, and heartbreaking” that another person had died.

“It is time for a hard reset,” attorney Antonio Romanucci said in the statement released Sunday. “ICE agents can leave Minneapolis. The residents of Minnesota cannot. We call for a complete and immediate end to the ICE invasion of this beautiful American city.”

Minnesota gubernatorial candidate Chris Madel, a Minneapolis attorney who provided legal support to the ICE agent who shot and killed Renee Good, ended his GOP campaign in a surprise video announcement Monday.

Madel called the recent immigration enforcement operation in the Twin Cities an “unmitigated disaster.”

“I cannot support the national Republican's stated retribution on the citizens of our state,” Madel said. “Nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so.”

He was among a large group of candidates seeking to replace Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who dropped his reelection bid earlier this month. Madel described himself as a “pragmatist,” and said national Republicans “have made it nearly impossible for a Republican to win a statewide election in Minnesota.”

“I have read about and I have spoken to help countless United States citizens who have been detained in Minnesota due to the color of their skin,” Madel said.

That support from the Republican governor for the Department of Homeland Security's immigration enforcement efforts came Monday as tensions in Minnesota ratcheted up over the weekend following the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis protester by a federal agent.

DeSantis pointed to his administration's signing of cooperative agreements with Homeland Security agencies when it comes to detaining people in the U.S. illegally as a model for other states. As he has before, DeSantis noted that state and local law enforcement agencies had detained nearly 20,000 people in the U.S. illegally in the past year.

DeSantis made no mention of the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by a federal officer Saturday. Following the shooting, several Republican elected officials have questioned President Trump's hard-line immigration crackdown in Minnesota, but DeSantis was not among them.

Homan will report directly to Trump, the president said in a social media post, adding that Homan is “tough but fair.”

“He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there,” Trump said Monday morning.

A growing number of Republicans are pressing for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics in Minnesota after a U.S. Border Patrol agent fatally shot a man in Minneapolis, a sign the Trump administration's accounting of events may face bipartisan scrutiny.

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Andrew Garbarino sought testimony from leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, saying “my top priority remains keeping Americans safe.”

A host of other congressional Republicans, including Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas and Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, pressed for more information. Their statements, in addition to concern expressed from several Republican governors, reflected a party struggling with how to respond to Saturday's fatal shooting.

The shooting of Pretti prompted some fellow Republicans to question Trump's hard-line immigration crackdown, but the president on Sunday night continued to blame Democratic officials.

After remaining relatively quiet on Sunday, the Republican president in two lengthy social media posts said that Democrats had encouraged people to obstruct law enforcement operations. He also called on officials in Minnesota to work with immigration officers and “turn over” people who were in the U.S. illegally.

“Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social media network.

Trump's refusal to back away from his pledge to carry out the largest deportation program in history and the surge of immigration officers to heavily Democratic cities came as more Republicans began calling for a deeper investigation and expressing unease with some of the administration's tactics.

Video captures a confrontation between federal officers and a 37-year-old man leading up to a fatal shooting in Minneapolis. This shooting comes amid widespread protests after the shooting of Renee Good.

Leaders of law enforcement organizations expressed alarm Sunday over the latest deadly shooting by federal officers in Minneapolis while use-of-force experts criticized the Trump administration's justification of the killing, saying bystander footage contradicted its narrative of what prompted it.

The federal government also faced criticism over the lack of a civil rights inquiry by the U.S. Justice Department and its efforts to block Minnesota authorities from conducting their own review of the killing of Pretti.

In a bid to ease tensions, the International Association of Chiefs of Police called on the White House to convene discussions “as soon as practicable” among federal, state and local law enforcement.

While questions remained about the latest confrontation, use-of-force experts told The Associated Press that bystander video undermined federal authorities' claim that Pretti “approached” a group of lawmen with a firearm and that a Border Patrol officer opened fire “defensively.” There has been no evidence made public, they said, that supports a claim by Border Patrol senior official Greg Bovino that Pretti, who had a permit to carry a concealed handgun, intended to “massacre law enforcement.”

The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. Saturday's shooting by a Border Patrol officer of Alex Pretti has only added urgency to the case.

Since the original filing, the state and cities have substantially added to their original request. They're trying to restore the state of affairs that existed before the Trump administration launched Operation Metro Surge on Dec. 1.




The hearing is set for Monday morning in federal court in Minneapolis. Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said he plans to personally attend.

They're asking that U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez order federal law enforcement agencies to reduce the numbers of officers and agents in Minnesota to levels before the surge, while allowing them to continue to enforce immigration laws within a long list of proposed limits.

Democratic senators are vowing to oppose a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security following the shooting death of a 37-year-old Minnesota man, a stand that increases the prospect of a partial government shutdown by the end of the week.

Six of the 12 annual spending bills for the current budget year have been signed into law by President Donald Trump. Six more are awaiting action in the Senate, despite a revolt from House Democrats and mounting calls for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's impeachment.

If senators fail to act by midnight Friday, funding for Homeland Security and the other agencies covered under the six bills will lapse.

Republicans will need some Democratic support to pass the remaining spending bills in time to avoid a partial shutdown. That support was already in question after Renee Good, a mother of three, was fatally shot and killed earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis. But the fatal shooting Saturday of Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, quickly prompted Democrats to take a more forceful stand.

BEIJING (AP) — China made a major announcement over the weekend, saying it was investigating the army's top general for suspected serious violations of discipline and law. 

Gen. Zhang Youxia was the highest military member just below President Xi Jinping.

The Defense Ministry said Saturday that authorities were investigating Zhang, the senior of the two vice chairs of the powerful Central Military Commission, China's top military body, and Gen. Liu Zhenli, a lower member of the commission who was in charge of the military's Joint Staff Department.

The move shakes up virtually the entire commission, chaired by Xi, leaving only one of its six members intact.

“Xi Jinping has completed one of the biggest purges of China's military leadership in the history of the People's Republic,” said Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute's Center for China Analysis.

For the army and China in general, the full impact of the changes is still unknown. But some experts say the moves also might have repercussions on Beijing's next move on Taiwan, the self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own territory.

Here are some elements to understand why Gen. Zhang's removal is important.




The Defense Ministry announced the measures Saturday but provided no details on the alleged wrongdoing. The next day, the People's Liberation Army Daily published an editorial that fell short of explaining the specific reasons, saying only that it was “for suspected serious violations of discipline and law” and showed China's commitment to punish corruption. That is something Xi has pursued since the early days of his presidency. 

Rumors have circulated on social media and there have been some media reports about the changes, but nothing official.

“I do not believe any evidence publicly released or selectively leaked by Chinese authorities would necessarily reflect the core reason for Zhang's removal,” said K. Tristan Tang, nonresident Vasey Fellow at Pacific Forum. “The critical point is that Xi Jinping decided to move against Zhang; once an investigation is launched, problems are almost inevitably uncovered.”

Analysts have said the purges are designed to reform the military and ensure loyalty to Xi. They are part of a broader anti-corruption drive that has resulted in punishment for more than 200,000 officials since the Chinese leader came to power in 2012.

Before Zhang and Liu's dismissal, the Communist Party expelled the other vice chair of the commission, He Weidong, in October. He was replaced with Zhang Shengmin, who is now the only commission member.

Since 2012, at least 17 Generals from the People's Liberation Army, or PLA, have been removed from their military positions, among them eight who were former top commission members, according to a review of military statements and state media reports made by The Associated Press. 

Some think the removals could have repercussions for China's decisions on Taiwan, but it is far from clear.

China considers Taiwan its own territory and has threatened to take control of the island by force if necessary. China also has increased military pressure and, last month, launched large-scale military drills around Taiwan for two days after the U.S. government announced a major arms sales to Taiwan.

Thomas, from the Asia Society Policy Institute, said the latest purge “makes China's threat toward Taiwan weaker in the short term but stronger in the long term.”

It would make a military escalation against the island riskier in the immediate term because of “a high command in disarray,” but in the long term would mean the army has a more loyal and less corrupt leadership with more military capabilities, he said.

Asked if this might reinforce the idea that removing top military brass might show China is not ready for war, Tang from the Pacific Forum said it “does not fundamentally change that assessment”. 

“That said,” he added, “I also do not believe the PLA's combat readiness has been severely disrupted.”

With the recent changes, the military commission will operate with only one of six members active and Xi at the top as the chair. 

The PLA's Daily editorial said that after the actions against Zhang and Liu, the party is moving to “promote the rejuvenation of the People's Liberation Army, and inject powerful momentum into building a strong military force.”

But it's not clear if the five vacant positions will be replaced soon or if Xi will wait until 2027, when there will be a selection of a new Communist Party Central Committee, the body in charge of also appointing the new military commission members.

Tang, from the Pacific Forum, doesn't see any pressure on Xi to fill the positions in the short term. 

“Unless the objective is to create an internal counterweight to Zhang Shengmin,” the only current member in the commission, he said.

SEATTLE (AP) — Sam Darnold was cast aside by the New York Jets, who drafted him No. 3 overall in 2018. The Minnesota Vikings didn't bring him back after he led them to a 14-3 season but flopped in the playoffs.

Now, in his first season with the Seattle Seahawks, he's Super Bowl-bound.

Darnold threw for three touchdowns, the Seahawks' “Dark Side” defense came up with a critical fourth-down stop, and Seattle advanced to the Super Bowl, beating the Los Angeles Rams 31-27 in an electrifying NFC championship game on Sunday.

“You can't talk about the game without talking about our quarterback,” second-year coach Mike Macdonald said. “He shut a lot of people up tonight, so I'm happy for him.”

Led by Darnold — an eight-year veteran playing for his fifth team — the Seahawks (16-3) reached their fourth Super Bowl in franchise history and first in 11 years. Seattle lost that most recent appearance to New England, its opponent in two weeks at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.

Darnold, who was blown out in his playoff debut last year with the Vikings — by the Rams, no less — played through an oblique injury and completed 25 of 36 passes for 346 yards with no turnovers. Jaxon Smith-Njigba had 153 yards receiving — the second-most in a playoff game in franchise history — and a touchdown on 10 catches.

“Can't say enough about Sam, man,” Smith-Njigba said. “It's been a great first year. We got one more to go. But for him to overcome what he had to overcome, I'm riding with Sam all day.”




The Seahawks needed Darnold to keep pace with Matthew Stafford, who drove the Rams (14-6) into position to take the lead with 4:59 remaining. On fourth-and-4 at the Seattle 6, coach Sean McVay elected to go for it and Stafford's pass was broken up in the end zone by Devon Witherspoon. 

“He's just the heart of our defense,” safety Julian Love said of Witherspoon. “He just is the essence. 'Spoon is it. He plays with just such a raw energy. And we love him for it.”

The Rams didn't get the ball back until there were 25 seconds left, and Puka Nacua was tackled inbounds near midfield on the final play.

Stafford threw for 374 yards and three touchdowns, but the Rams were undone by critical errors, including a muffed punt by Xavier Smith in the third quarter. On the next play, Darnold connected with Jake Bobo for a 17-yard touchdown and a 24-13 lead.

“That was a tough one,” McVay said.

The Seahawks led 31-20 late in the third quarter on Darnold's 13-yard TD pass to Cooper Kupp, but the Rams got back into the game when Seahawks cornerback Riq Woolen was flagged for taunting after breaking up a pass to Nacua on third-and-12, giving Los Angeles a first down.

On the next play, Stafford threw at Woolen again, and Nacua beat him in the corner of the end zone for a 34-yard touchdown.

“Even though I made a great play, I wasn't great for my team,” Woolen said, “and I've got to be better with that and celebrate with the team.”

The Rams forced a punt on Seattle's next possession and went on a 14-play, 84-yard drive that came up empty thanks to Witherspoon's pass breakup.

Seattle stayed aggressive on its final possession, with Darnold throwing for three first downs to run out most of the clock.

Darnold set the tone with his first completion of the game, a 51-yarder to Rashid Shaheed. Four plays later, Walker ran 2 yards for a TD to make it 7-0.

Leading 13-10, Los Angeles forced a three-and-out late in the second quarter, but after two straight incompletions by Stafford, the Rams punted the ball back, and it took Darnold just 34 seconds to put the Seahawks ahead for good.

Smith-Njigba caught a deep pass from Darnold, absorbed a big hit by Kam Curl and held on for a 42-yard gain. Four plays later, Darnold and Smith-Njigba hooked up for a 14-yard TD that made it 17-13 heading into halftime.

“I told my team, I'm going to do whatever it takes. Whatever y'all ask of me, I'm gonna get it done, whatever that might be,” said Smith-Njigba, the NFL's leading receiver in the regular season. “And that's what you saw today. You just saw grit, determination, you saw passion out there and you saw a group, a collective, going out there and getting the job done.”

McVay bristled when asked if he expects Stafford to return next season. The 37-year-old is a finalist for his first MVP award after throwing for a league-leading 4,707 yards and a career-best 46 touchdown passes.

“I know that if he wants to, he's still playing at a pretty damn good clip,” McVay said. “I mean, he's the MVP of the league, and if he's not, respect for everybody else. But this guy played a level that's just different.” 

Bobo's touchdown catch was his first since Jan. 5, 2025, which also came against the Rams, and the fourth of his three-year career. He gave all the credit to Darnold.

“He's the best in the world,” Bobo said. “It didn't surprise anybody in here, I'll tell you that.”

Rams: WR Jordan Whittington (chest) left in the third quarter. Defensive end Kobie Turner (cramps) also exited in the third.

Seahawks: LB Drake Thomas (shoulder) left in the fourth quarter. FB Brady Russell (hand) was injured in the second half and did not return.

Rams: Stafford turns 38 next month and has to wonder if this was his last, best chance at a second Super Bowl title.

Seahawks: Seek their second Super Bowl title after winning it all in the 2013 season with coach Pete Carroll and the “Legion of Boom” defense.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic senators are vowing to oppose a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security following the shooting death of a 37-year-old Minnesota man, a stand that increases the prospect of a partial government shutdown by the end of the week. 

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, in a social media post hours after the Saturday shooting, said that what is happening in Minnesota is “appalling” and that Democrats “will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.”

Six of the 12 annual spending bills for the current budget year have been signed into law by President Donald Trump. Six more are awaiting action in the Senate, despite a revolt from House Democrats and mounting calls for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's impeachment. 

If senators fail to act by midnight Friday, funding for Homeland Security and the other agencies covered under the six bills will lapse.

“Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE,” said Schumer, D-N.Y. “I will vote no.” 

The White House reached out to Senate Democrats late Sunday, as have Republicans, according to a Senate Democratic leadership aide who insisted on anonymity to discuss the private talks.




But they have not yet raised any realistic solutions, the aide said.

Republicans will need some Democratic support to pass the remaining spending bills in time to avoid a partial shutdown. That support was already in question after Renee Good, a mother of three, was fatally shot and killed earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent in Minneapolis. But the fatal shooting Saturday of Alex Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, quickly prompted Democrats to take a more forceful stand.

On Sunday, House and Senate Democrats convened separate conference calls as they privately assess next steps and press to restrain the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations.

Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee and key negotiator on the funding package, had been pushing her colleagues to vote for the homeland security bill, arguing that Democrats had successfully fought off major increases to the ICE budget. 

But in the wake of the shooting, Murray said Sunday on X that “I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands.”

“Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,” Murray wrote.

Federal officials have defended the actions of the agents involved in the Good and Pretti shootings as justified. Democrats said video released of both shootings showed otherwise. Republicans are increasingly challenged, with some calling for thorough investigations while others stand with federal officials. 

“The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing,” Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., posted on X. “The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake. There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.” 

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., wants a “thorough and impartial investigation” into the shooting and said “any administration official who rushes to judgment and tries to shut down an investigation before it begins are doing an incredible disservice to the nation and to President Trump's legacy.” 

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. said Democrats should reconsider their threat to not support DHS funding and work with him to “end the mess created by sanctuary city policies.”

“Now is not the time to defund one of our major national security priorities: border protection,” Graham said on X. 

The growing backlash from Democrats puts Republican leaders in the Senate in a difficult position. 

Much of the government, including the Department of Defense, continues to operate on a short-term bill that provides funding only through Friday.

Republican leaders had hoped to avoid another shutdown after last fall's 43-day closure that revolved around Democrats' insistence on extending federal subsidies that make health coverage more affordable for those enrolled in the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 

Before Pretti's death, many Democrats felt the same way about a potential shutdown, lending support in the House to most of the remaining appropriations bills — with DHS the exception.

House Democrats largely rejected the homeland security portion last week with just a handful joining Republicans to ensure its passage. More than 100 House Democrats called for Noem's impeachment.

The House sent the six funding bills to the Senate as a package, and that makes it exceedingly difficult to strip out the homeland security portion which Democrats are demanding. 

Despite the procedural hurdles, Schumer said Sunday that Republicans should work with Democrats to advance the other five bills and rewrite the DHS bill. “This is the best course of action, and the American people are on our side,” Schumer said. 

The path ahead is uncertain. The Senate is not scheduled to return to session until Tuesday, due to the snowstorm. The House plans to be out of session this week and would have to pass the funding package again if it is changed.

Democrats are pushing for policy changes to be added to the homeland security spending bill that would force ICE agents to use warrants for immigration arrests, mandate strengthened training, require agents to identify themselves and have Border Patrol agents stay on the border rather than assisting ICE with immigration raids in the interior of the country.

Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that oversees homeland security funding, told CNN's “State of the Union” on Sunday that Congress cannot fund a department “that is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls across the country in violation of the law.” 

Democratic senators discussed the options on Sunday evening's call but without changes from Republicans, they appeared headed toward a shutdown. On the morning call with House Democrats, they heard from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and the state's attorney general, Keith Ellison, both former congressmen.

Several other Democratic senators announced they would vote “no” on homeland security money, including some who had helped Republicans end the record shutdown last year.

“The abuses of power we are seeing from ICE in Minneapolis and across the country are un-American and cannot be normalized,” Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said in a post on X. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., also said she opposes that portion of the package.

Minnesota's Democratic senators also indicated they will oppose the DHS funding bill. 

“For those asking where we go from here: Not voting to fund ICE is a great place for us to start,” Sen. Tina Smith wrote on X.

“We oppose the ICE funding bill. We call for a full and transparent investigation with state officials,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar said. ”And we call on our Republican colleagues to stand up. They know this is wrong.”

The progress that Congress has made so far on spending bills means that much of the federal government's work would continue even if lawmakers are unable to complete the job.

A bill that Trump signed Friday funds the departments of Justice, Commerce and the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers through the end of the budget year in September.

The Department of Agriculture was funded from a previous measure, which means a shutdown shouldn't stop food assistance this time.

But other critical operations of the government would be disrupted.

An Arkansas teenager is behind bars and another man is in the hospital with serious injuries after video of a brutal fight at a local gas station went viral last weekend. 

Officers with the Hot Springs Police Department responded to a Circle K gas station on Malvern Avenue in Hot Springs – located approximately 55 miles from Little Rock – around 11:30 p.m. on Saturday, Jan. 17, according to FOX 16. 

After arriving on scene, authorities located 20-year-old Noah Epperson unconscious and suffering from multiple injuries, the outlet reported. 

According to a police report obtained by FOX 16, a fight broke out between two groups at a party earlier that night. Friends of Epperson reportedly told police that their group subsequently left the party and arrived at a nearby Circle K gas station when the second group allegedly followed.

A second fight reportedly broke out, with viral video showing Epperson being punched in the face by multiple alleged assailants and having his head stomped on. 

Immediately following the brawl, bystanders began to leave, and local police were called to the scene by a concerned citizen who believed an individual had either been hurt or killed. 

Epperson was transported to a hospital, where he was admitted into intensive care with a brain bleed, skull fracture and jaw fracture, according to a GoFundMe created to cover his medical bills.

Two days after the alleged attack, 18-year-old Cooper Camferdam turned himself in to police in connection with the alleged attack, FOX 16 reported. 

Police reportedly said Camferdam is the individual seen in the now-viral video stomping on Epperson's head, which ultimately left him unconscious. 

""He has suffered a fracture to the skull, fracture to the jaw, and he has hearing loss on his left ear,"" Katie Epperson, Epperson's mother, told KARK. ""The front of his face, there isn't anything. But both sides, big, purple ears and bruises.""

""We'll kind of go from there to see if there will be any long-term effects,"" Katie Epperson said. ""We just really don't know right now.""

Camferdam is charged with felony first-degree battery and is being held in the Garland County Detention Center on $500,000 bond, according to arrest records obtained by Fox News Digital. 

Police reportedly said they have used the video to identify additional persons of interest, and they expect to make more arrests. 

The Hot Springs Police Department did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Epperson's mother reportedly added that her son does not have health insurance, and is asking for the public's help in covering his medical bills while hoping for her son's speedy recovery.

""We're looking into options to get these medical bills covered,"" Katie Epperson said, according to KARK. ""But I really feel strongly that the suspect should pay the medical bills.""

""I don't want anyone else to get hurt,"" she continued. ""Let the law enforcement do their job, and justice will be served.""

Matthew Stafford connects with Davante Adams for a Los Angeles Rams' two-yard TD vs. Seahawks.

Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay had no time for a question about Matthew Stafford's NFL future following a close NFC Championship loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday.

Stafford, 37, was 22-of-35 for 374 passing yards and three touchdown passes as Los Angeles fell to Seattle 31-27 and missed out on making Super Bowl LX against the New England Patriots.

In the postgame press conference, McVay was asked if he thought Stafford would be back for the 2026 season.

""If he still wants to play. What the hell kind of question is that?"" McVay snapped back. ""We've been totally present. I know if he wants to, he's still playing at a pretty damn good clip.

""I mean, he's the MVP of the league. If he's not, I mean I got respect for everybody else, but this guy played at a level that's just different.""

Stafford and McVay won a Super Bowl with the Rams to cap the 2021 season – his first with the Rams. The team acquired him from the Detroit Lions for Jared Goff with fans thinking he could be retiring soon.

However, he continued to play as one of the top quarterbacks in the league.

He led the NFL with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdown passes in 2025. It was the first time he's surpassed 4,000 passing yards and 40 touchdown passes since the 2021 season. He also earned his third Pro Bowl nod.

Once known for bottomless breadsticks and supersized meals, American chain restaurants are increasingly rethinking their portion sizes.

As GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic, Wegovy and Zepbound go mainstream, restaurants are responding to customers with smaller appetites — and a growing appetite for protein-packed meals.

""People on GLP-1s are prioritizing protein because it's the macronutrient that they need to preserve muscle mass,"" New Jersey-based registered dietitian Jenna Werner told NBC News, adding that restaurants are using ""this weight-loss cultural movement to hop on that train.""

FAST FOOD GOES GLP-1: SHAKE SHACK JOINS PROTEIN CRAZE WITH NEW OZEMPIC-FRIENDLY MENU

The rapid rise in GLP-1 drugs, which suppress appetite and slow digestion, has coincided with changes across chain menus, from scaled-down portions to snack-sized, high-protein options.

Fast-food chains like Shake Shack and Chipotle are among those that have rolled out high-protein, lower-carb menus, as Fox News Digital previously reported.

Meanwhile, Olive Garden introduced a ""lighter portion"" menu featuring smaller servings at lower prices, Chipotle rolled out a ""High Protein Cup,"" Subway added compact ""Protein Pockets,"" and Smoothie King launched a GLP-1 support menu, according to their websites. 

Many GLP-1 users report finding traditional restaurant portions too big. 

WHY OZEMPIC USERS 'CAN BARELY FINISH A THIRD' OF THEIR RESTAURANT ORDERS

""Patients consistently report that restaurant portions, which they once found normal-sized, now seem overwhelming,"" Florida obesity specialist Dr. Fernando Ovalle Jr. previously told Fox News Digital. 

""Many tell me they can barely finish a third of their usual order.""

Smaller appetites are leaving many diners unable to finish full-sized restaurant portions. (iStock)

New research suggests that when GLP-1 users do dine out, they aren't abandoning restaurants altogether — they're ordering differently.

A January study from Chicago-based research company Circana found that GLP-1 users decreased the average number of items ordered per visit by just 1%, while favoring main dishes over sides.

The research also showed growing demand for vegetables, fruit and nutrient-dense items like smoothies.

""With GLP-1 usage, the biggest change to restaurants won't be that consumers stop going out to eat, it will be how they go out to eat and what they order,"" David Portalatin, senior vice president at Circana, said in a statement.

Chipotle debuted a high-protein menu in December, with items ranging from 15 to 81 grams of protein. (Chipotle)

Some restaurateurs say flexibility — not smaller offerings — is the real trend.

""I don't think restaurants are simply 'shrinking' portions,"" Abraham Merchant, CEO of New York-based Merchants Hospitality, told Fox News Digital.

""What we're really seeing is more flexibility in how guests want to eat.""

Teneshia Murray, owner of Atlanta-based T's Brunch Bar, agreed, telling Fox News Digital customers want ""the same flavor but on healthier food items,"" with more high-protein and lower-carb options, even at soul food restaurants like hers.

Shake Shack's new menu includes bunless burgers that deliver up to 52 grams of protein. (Shake Shack)

Industry experts note that rising food costs, value concerns and broader health trends, including new federal dietary guidelines recommending higher protein intake, are all influencing menus, too.

But not everyone is on board. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay recently blasted the idea of GLP-1-friendly menus, calling them ""absolute bulls---"" in an interview and vowing not to offer smaller portions at his restaurants.

Yet many chains appear to be betting that lighter, protein-driven and customizable meals are here to stay. 

Diners are increasingly choosing vegetables, fruit and nutrient-dense options like smoothies, research shows. (iStock)

""Restaurants that win are the ones offering flexibility,"" Ovalle said.

Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, previously told Fox News Digital that it is ""humbling to see how Ozempic and Wegovy have already helped so many Americans.""

A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, the maker of Mounjaro and Zepbound, told NBC that the company values ""efforts to make healthy living easier for everyone.""

As the Goldwater Institute demands that Idaho's attorney general launch an investigation into a new anti-DEI law, an attorney for the group exposed how four universities in the state have allegedly schemed to sidestep the law's provisions.

As a watchdog demands that Idaho's attorney general launch an investigation into a new anti-DEI law, an attorney for the group exposed how four universities in the state have allegedly schemed to sidestep the law's provisions.

In April, Idaho enacted the Freedom of Inquiry in Higher Education Act, which took effect in July and prohibits institutions of higher learning from forcing students to enroll in mandatory DEI courses that are unrelated to their field of study. Schools are allowed to apply for exemptions for programs of study that are primarily focused on racial, ethnic or gender studies.

But the Goldwater Institute says schools are already attempting to skirt the new regulations. 

""The whole goal of this law is to make it so that no one is forced to take mandatory courses that indoctrinate students with these discriminatory ideologies as a condition of graduation in unrelated fields,"" Parker Jackson, a staff attorney at the Goldwater Institute, told Fox News Digital. ""So we're talking about degree programs like social work or counseling or psychology, things that you wouldn't normally think would involve things like critical theory, race and gender studies, ethnic studies.""

UNIVERSITY DROPS JOB POSTING AFTER DEI REQUIREMENT EXPOSED, PROFESSOR SAYS ‘I WOULD NOT BE HIRED' TODAY

The law is meant to ensure that unsuspecting students don't wind up being indoctrinated by DEI programs when they are simply trying to obtain a degree for which DEI is irrelevant.

But the University of Idaho, Boise State University, Idaho State University and Lewis-Clark State College are skirting this law and applying for exceptions for courses that should not be exempt, according to a Goldwater Institute letter sent to Attorney General Raul Labrador asking him to look into the matter.

The letter also questions a memorandum sent to the schools by the Idaho Board of Education just before the law took effect, explaining the new law to the universities. That memorandum misinterprets the law to allow for more exceptions than intended, according to the letter. 

""So, the statute specifically says that the exemptions can only be used for courses, the title of which indicates that they're targeted towards these racial or gender or ethnic studies,"" Jackson explained. ""And what the board has did is they've gone through, and they've essentially tried to delete that portion of the statute and say that if the degree program requirements have these DEI mandates in them, then they can get an exemption for the class.""

GOT A SCOOP ON CAMPUS? SEND US A TIP HERE

According to Jackson, that is a perversion of the law.

""Well, that's kind of circular. They can't just avoid the mandate against these requirements by creating the requirements,"" said Jackson. ""And so, what we're asking the attorney general to do is to take a look at all of these exemptions that the board has granted across the state at Boise State and Idaho State and University of Idaho — I think Lewis-Clarke College — Lewis-Clarke State College is the other one, and find that these are violations of the Freedom of Inquiry in Higher Education Act.""

The letter also says that the schools now require DEI-related courses in degree programs whose titles do not clearly indicate a primary focus on racial, ethnic or gender studies.

For example, a required course in the sociology program at the University of Idaho is called ""Introduction to Inequity and Justice."" The school has received a DEI exemption for the sociology program because of this course and several other elective courses, despite the fact that the degree program, sociology, is not explicitly a race, ethnic or gender studies program.

""Stated simply, DEI-related courses may not be mandated unless the title of the degree program (e.g., ethnic studies) clearly establishes that the degree program itself is primarily focused on racial, ethnic, or gender studies,"" the letter says. ""Only then may the institution require a DEI-related course for completion of the degree program. By omitting the title requirement, the guidance mischaracterizes which programs are eligible for an exemption under the Act, making exemptions available for a much broader category of degree programs.""

The letter ends with a call to action, asking Labrador to investigate the exceptions that have been made, and the memorandum sent by the Board of Education to the schools.

""Taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for funding left-wing activism and indoctrination,"" said Jackson. ""And that's part of the goal of these laws that are starting to be passed throughout the country is not only protecting students that are unsuspecting — they're just trying to go get a job and get qualified for their jobs — from this type of political indoctrination, but it's also protecting taxpayers.""

""Let students go and be social work students and become psychologists and counselors without having this radical, toxic political ideology shoved down their throats.""

The University of Idaho, Lewis-Clark State College and Idaho State University directed Fox News Digital to the Idaho Board of Education. 

""The Office of the Idaho State Board of Education will cooperate fully with the Idaho Attorney General's Office,"" a spokesperson for the board told Fox News Digital. ""The Office cannot comment further at this time.""

Boise State University did not return a request for comment.

More than half of all Democrats in the House of Representatives are now backing a resolution to impeach Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem in the wake of another federal law enforcement-involved shooting in Minneapolis.

The push to impeach Noem, led by Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., has 133 Democrats as co-sponsors endorsing the effort as of Monday morning, her office told Fox News Digital. That's out of 213 total lawmakers in the House Democratic Caucus.

It's gaining steam among both progressive and moderate Democrats, like Rep. Laura Gillen, D-N.Y., who announced on Sunday that she too would support impeaching Noem amid the chaos in Minneapolis.

""Another U.S. citizen has been killed at the hands of ICE and there must be accountability, which is why Secretary Noem must be impeached immediately,"" Gillen posted on X.

It's a notable expression of support; Gillen was one of only seven House Democrats to vote in favor of funding DHS last week as part of Congress' yearly federal appropriations process.

The surge of support comes after Alex Pretti, a nurse at Minneapolis' Veterans Affairs Medical Center, was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent over the weekend during a wider demonstration against President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in the Midwest city.

Noem said over the weekend that it appeared Pretti ""arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.""

""An individual approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. The officers attempted to disarm this individual, but the armed suspect reacted violently. Fearing for his life and for the lives of his fellow officers around him, an agent fired defensive shots,"" she said.

But various eyewitness accounts and critics of the Trump administration have disputed claims that Pretti was brandishing a weapon, though he was confirmed to be in possession of a handgun with a legal permit to carry.

Publicly circulated video of the incident shows him approaching federal officers holding what appeared to be his phone, filming as agents knocked a female agitator to the ground.

Pretti appeared to attempt to help the female agitator when he was knocked to the ground himself. One video angle appears to show an officer removing Pretti's weapon before he was shot.

The majority of Republicans have criticized Democratic leaders in Minnesota for fomenting anger toward federal officers among the population and for refusing to cooperate in Trump's offensive against illegal immigrants in the first place.

Meanwhile, Democrats have accused Trump officials of letting federal agents run amok with impunity and cause chaos in Minneapolis.

It's not clear if House Democratic leaders will support Kelly's push to impeach Noem now, but Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters to ""stay tuned"" last week when asked about the effort.

Any push to impeach Noem during this congressional term would likely be largely symbolic, however. It's highly unlikely that enough Republicans would vote with Democrats on the resolution to pass the House, or that it will get the 60 votes in the Senate needed for removal.

House Democrats' furor to boot Noem from her post has not quite made its way to the upper chamber, but it got support from one key moderate in the party.

NOEM SAYS 'ARRESTS COMING' AFTER ANTI-ICE MOB TARGETED MINNESOTA CHURCH

Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., echoed her colleagues in the lower chamber and demanded that the DHS head be impeached for being an ""abject failure"" at leading the agency.

Rosen, like several other congressional Democrats, reacted sharply to Pretti's killing and, so far, is the only Senate Democrat calling for Noem's impeachment.

The lawmaker argued that Noem's usage of ICE in Minnesota was the ""latest proof"" of her losing control over her own agency.

""Kristi Noem and her department's latest attempt to mislead the American public regarding the brutal and unjustified killing of Alex Pretti is deeply shameful, and she must be impeached and removed from office immediately,"" Rosen said.

Rosen's position carries weight, too, given that she is one of the more moderate members of the Senate Democratic caucus, and she was also one of a handful to cross the aisle to reopen the government during the longest closure in history last year.

Senate Democrats are now ready to block the DHS funding bill as the deadline to fund the government and prevent another shutdown fast approaches.

DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital of Democrats' efforts, ""DHS enforces the laws Congress passes, period. If certain members don't like those laws, changing them is literally their job.""

""While ICE officers are facing a staggering 1,300% spike in assaults, too many politicians would rather defend criminals and attack the men and women who are enforcing our laws and did nothing while Joe Biden facilitated an invasion of tens of millions of illegal aliens into our country,"" McLaughlin said. ""It's time they focus on protecting the American people, the work this Department is doing every day under Secretary Noem's leadership.""

Harvard University student Tejas Billa tells Fox News Digital that the university's alleged left-leaning bias in its academics isolates some students on campus.

Harvard isn't supposed to be chasing. It's supposed to be leading. 

Yet a new global ranking put out by Holland's Leiden University — a measure of the number and importance of research publications — has Harvard down to third place worldwide, and both institutions ahead of it are Chinese. It gets worse for America: in the top 20, Harvard and the University of Michigan are the only U.S. universities. China takes 16 of the top 20 slots. 

Unlike many such university lists, this ranking isn't a reputational beauty contest, but a statistical analysis based on publication data. In other words, it's one way of measuring what a research university is supposed to do: produce serious scholarship at scale. 

So, if the most famous university in the world is sliding — and if China is dominating the top of the table — we should stop handwaving about ""globalization"" and start asking what, exactly, has gone wrong in American academia. 

HARVARD STUDENT SAYS POLITICAL BIASES ON CAMPUS ARE 'SYSTEMATIC' AFTER ALAN GARBER ADMITS FACULTY 'WENT WRONG' BY PUSHING BELIEFS IN THE CLASSROOM

The answer is not that Americans suddenly got dumber. It's that our universities have become less serious. 

The center of gravity on many campuses has shifted in recent years from truth-seeking, merit and education to DEI, identity and activism. That dynamic shows up everywhere that matters for research production: hiring, teaching and the basic culture of inquiry. 

Hiring increasingly rewards ideological compliance rather than intellectual excellence. Diversity statements and ""commitment"" litmus tests have become routine. Whole searches are designed to narrow the acceptable range of viewpoints and methodologies. When a university hires activists who happen to hold PhDs instead of scholars who happen to hold opinions, it should not be surprised when scholarship suffers. 

HARVARD PRESIDENT CRITICIZES FACULTY ACTIVISM, CLAIMS UNIVERSITY BRINGING OBJECTIVITY BACK TO CLASSROOM

Teaching has been reduced, in too many places, to therapeutic affirmation and political mobilization. Students get more indoctrination than instruction, producing graduates who aren't equipped with the writing, numeracy and disciplinary rigor needed to power the next generation of research and innovation. 

Research culture has become timid and conformist. Entire categories of questions are treated as morally impermissible to even ask. But real research requires risk: contesting assumptions, poking sacred cows and following the evidence wherever it leads. A campus that punishes dissent will eventually punish discovery. 

And hovering over all of this is the growth of the diversicratic state: offices, trainings, compliance regimes, ""bias response"" systems and an endless paper trail that consumes money and time. Universities can call it ""inclusion"" all they want; functionally, it's overhead, which is the enemy of productivity. In a previous Fox News piece, I argued that elite American institutions won't just fix themselves because the incentives inside these places run toward ideology and away from excellence. 

Meanwhile, China has been building research capacity like a state project — because it is one. It funds labs, scales programs, recruits talent and measures success in outputs that translate into technological and geopolitical power.  

HARVARD DEAN REMOVED AFTER ANTI-WHITE, ANTI-POLICE SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS RESURFACED

Even 10 years ago, this contrast was stark. In the 2015 Leiden rankings, U.S. institutions dominated the top 20, with MIT, Harvard and Caltech at the top. That's not ancient history, but within the careers of almost all current university officials. 

Demonstrators take part in an ""Emergency Rally: Stand with Palestinians Under Siege in Gaza,"" amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the terrorist group Hamas, at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., Oct. 14, 2023. (Brian Snyder/REUTERS) 

At the same time, institutional leaders that lecture Americans about ""democracy"" have been disturbingly casual about foreign cash, which typically comes with strings. 

The federal government has repeatedly had to investigate universities for failures to disclose foreign gifts and contracts. In 2020, for example, the Department of Education investigated Harvard and Yale over potential failures to report large sums of foreign funding; Department of Education (DoE) records showed billions in foreign gifts from countries including Qatar and China. Last April, an executive order intended to remedy foreign influence noted that DoE investigations led universities to disclose $6.5 billion in previously undisclosed foreign funds.  

And it's not just money. U.S. law enforcement and congressional investigators have warned for years about programs designed to exploit America's open research environment. The FBI describes Chinese ""talent plans"" as often incentivizing one-way transfers of research and intellectual property, sometimes through undisclosed affiliations and contracts. A Senate investigation similarly detailed how China's talent recruitment programs were designed to extract research and expertise from the United States to advance China's national goals.  

The bottom line is simple: America's universities are being outcompeted abroad while being hollowed out at home. If we want to reclaim research leadership, we need to reclaim the university's purpose by doing at least four things: 

Research culture has become timid and conformist. Entire categories of questions are treated as morally impermissible to even ask.

Harvard's slip in the Leiden ranking isn't a quirky statistic, but a warning light. China is surging because it's focused on research, development and education. America is slipping because our universities have too often swapped those priorities for DEI bureaucracy, identity politics, and activism. 

We can reverse this. But first we have to admit we have a problem.

Dozens of CEOs have called for the lowering of tensions in Minneapolis, pleading for a return to normalcy in the aftermath of anti-ICE protester Alex Pretti being fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent.

The 60 business leaders called for cooperation between Mayor Jacob Frey, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), and the Trump administration. The letter was published by the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce and signed by the CEOs of companies and organizations such as Target, UnitedHealth Group, U.S. Bancorp, Minnesota's professional sports teams, the Mayo Clinic, and Land O'Lakes, among others. 

“The business community in Minnesota prides itself in providing leadership and solving problems to ensure a strong and vibrant state,” read the letter. “The recent challenges facing our state have created widespread disruption and tragic loss of life. For the past several weeks, representatives of Minnesota's business community have been working every day behind the scenes with federal, state, and local officials to advance real solutions.” 

“These efforts have included close communication with the Governor, the White House, the Vice President, and local mayors,” the CEOs wrote. “There are ways for us to come together to foster progress.”

The CEOs encouraged all parties to work together to find “real solutions” in the aftermath of the shooting. They each called for peace and expressed their desire to “build a bright and prosperous future.”

“With yesterday's tragic news, we are calling for an immediate deescalation of tensions and for state, local, and federal officials to work together to find real solutions,” read the letter. 

SCHIFF SAYS HE'S NOT GIVING ICE OR BORDER PATROL ‘ANOTHER DIME' AFTER PRETTI SHOOTING

“In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state, and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future,” noted the CEOs. 

Pretti was killed on Saturday during a confrontation with Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis who were conducting illegal immigration enforcement operations. He is the third person to be shot in Minneapolis this month by federal law enforcement officers during such an activity. Renee Good, a 37-year-old resident of Minneapolis, was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Jan. 7, as the agency was engaged in enforcement activities.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

It has recently been a bad stretch for President Donald Trump, perhaps the worst of his second term. But recent polls showing a bump in support from Hispanic voters might offer a path forward.

The latest Emerson College survey has Trump's approval rate surging among Hispanic voters. Emerson found that 43.3% of Hispanics approved of the president's performance, up 15 points from last month. Results from the latest New York Times/Siena poll show a similar movement, with Trump's standing among Hispanics rising by 13 points since December.

One explanation is that Hispanics enthusiastically support the Trump administration's recent capture of Venezuela's tyrant, Nicolas Maduro. A new Morning Consult poll found that 66% of Hispanics supported the move, the highest level of approval of any racial group. White people, for example, supported the president's decision at 64%. The triumphant military operation saw elite U.S. commandos dive into the heart of a foreign country and snatch a dictator and enemy of America without suffering a single loss. It's no surprise that such an exhibition of strength and competence would play well with voters.

The public has become increasingly skeptical of foreign interventions in recent years, but they like to win. Hispanic people are no exception.

Trump's efforts to secure the border and crack down on drug trafficking and violent crime have also received favorable support in this demographic group. Under the Biden administration, America's southern border became a playground for narcoterrorist organizations, with predictable results. Americans of all ethnicities became less safe as their communities deteriorated. 

Trump has restored sovereignty, worked to seal the border, and taken the fight to the doorstep of those who peddle the poison that kills thousands of Americans. The status quo was neither working nor sustainable, and the public knew it.

Unsurprisingly, a majority supports securing the border. So, too, do the Hispanic voters who have played a key role in Trump's political fortunes. 

In 2024, Trump received a record share of their votes at 43%. While not as high as his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, this is a higher percentage than any Republican candidate in modern history, and an 8-point increase from 2020. It could be the start of something big for Trump and the Republican Party, possibly giving both a needed boost as they look ahead to a difficult midterm.

For decades, the Republican Party has sought to attract Latinos and other minority voters who had long been part of the Democratic coalition. George W. Bush, for example, made a concerted effort to bring Hispanics into the tent, seeking to use immigration reform and other measures to do so. Trump's approach has been altogether different. 

WHITE HOUSE REPORT CARD: FOREIGN SUCCESSES AND SABER-RATTLING OVER GREENLAND

He has sought to remake the Republican Party as the champion of the working class, willing to address the “root cause” of illegal immigration. This has been key to winning over voters whom the Democratic Party took for granted. 

Bringing them into the GOP alone won't be enough to bring the party victoriously across the finish line. Its fate will hinge on the economy and prices, as voters will hold the ruling party accountable. But Trump's rebalancing of relations with Latin America, which includes toppling Maduro and deporting illegal immigrants who taint legal immigrants, can be an element in winning Hispanic votes next November. If Trump can lower the cost of living, he will likely hold his gains among Hispanics.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump dodged whether he supported federal agents' decision to shoot and kill 37-year-old Alex Pretti in Minneapolis on Saturday during an immigration operation.

Trump was pressed by Wall Street Journal reporter Josh Dawsey on whether Border Patrol agents responded appropriately when they killed Pretti, who briefly intervened when an agent pushed a woman to the ground during the operation. According to Dawsey, Trump did not answer the question twice before saying his administration was “reviewing everything.”

“We're looking, we're reviewing everything, and will come out with a determination,” the president responded.

Trump expressed displeasure with the shooting as a whole, while remaining critical of Pretti's decision to open-carry a handgun while protesting.

“I don't like any shooting. I don't like it,” he said. “But I don't like it when somebody goes into a protest, and he's got a very powerful, fully-loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn't play good either.”

The Department of Homeland Security said after the shooting that Pretti was armed with a “9 mm semi-automatic handgun” and likely “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” 

Trump appeared to stand by that account on Sunday, fixating on the gun itself and calling it “dangerous and unpredictable” and suggesting it could have fired unexpectedly.

Bystander footage, however, has largely called that characterization into question. Pretti is seen holding just his cellphone during the entire encounter and only briefly steps between the agent and the woman, before being pepper-sprayed and later dragged to the ground by at least five agents. While he was armed, an agent appears to remove the weapon from Pretti's waistband and away from the scene just before he is shot dead.

The shooting has led to backlash from both sides of the political spectrum, with multiple congressional Republicans calling for an investigation and the removal of federal immigration agents from Minneapolis.

BORDER PATROL AGENTS INVOLVED IN PRETTI SHOOTING REASSIGNED

Trump appeared open to that move in the Wall Street Journal interview, saying federal agents will leave the city “at some point.”

He did, however, maintain that some agents would be staying indefinitely to continue investigating the Minnesota fraud scandal, which he has attempted to tie to the shooting by alleging a “COVER UP” by state lawmakers.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) reiterated his promise to oppose funding the Department of Homeland Security and suggested to “rewrite” the appropriations bill instead, as another possible government shutdown looms large this week.

Schumer voiced his opposition to the DHS funding bill after 37-year-old Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a Border Patrol agent during an immigration operation on Saturday in Minneapolis. The fatal shooting is the second officer-involved incident in the city this month after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed Renee Good on Jan. 7.

“Senate Republicans have seen the same horrific footage that all Americans have watched of the blatant abuses of Americans by ICE in Minnesota,” Schumer said in a statement Sunday. “The appalling murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti on the streets of Minneapolis must lead Republicans to join Democrats in overhauling ICE and CBP to protect the public. Senate Republicans must work with Democrats to advance the other five funding bills while we work to rewrite the DHS bill. This is [the] best course of action, and the American people are on our side.”

Schumer echoed the proposals from Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and Jack Reed (D-RI), who suggested dropping the bill and instead passing the other five. Other Democratic senators have suggested reworking the current DHS bill that narrowly passed the House last week, though time is running out.

The deadline to fund the government is Friday, and the Senate is out of session on Monday due to the winter storm affecting the Northeast. Should the upper chamber not reach a consensus on the bill by the end of this week, there will be at least a partial government shutdown — and the second one in recent months.

Late last year, debate over expiring pandemic-era Obamacare subsidies led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, lasting 43 days.

SCHIFF SAYS HE'S NOT GIVING ICE OR BORDER PATROL ‘ANOTHER DIME' AFTER PRETTI SHOOTING

That shutdown fight ended with a bipartisan agreement to negotiate the subsidies, and the Senate will need another, given Democrats' stated opposition to DHS funding, the Senate GOP's narrow majority, and the 60-vote threshold needed to break the filibuster and pass appropriations bills.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Welcome to the American Winter","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/minneapolis-uprising/685755/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 01:42:00 GMT","

In the frozen streets of Minneapolis, something profound is happening.

The six-car ICE convoy came to a stop and instantly dozens of people swarmed it, cellphones in hand, while others ran out of nearby houses—I saw a woman in gym shorts in the 20-degree weather—and began surrounding the masked and heavily armed agents who had spilled out of their black SUVs. The fury in the crowd felt almost like a physical force, as real as the cacophony of whistles and honking cars and angry chants: “ICE out! Fuck you! Go home!”

The officers threw a protester to the slushy asphalt and piled on top of him, then cuffed him and dragged him away. The screaming only got louder. With their escape route blocked by protesters and their cars, the agents tossed out tear-gas canisters, the white clouds billowing up into the winter air. An injured man stumbled past me and vomited repeatedly into the snow.

From where I stood, a few yards back from the scrum last Wednesday afternoon, it looked, at best, to be a savage caricature of our national divide: On one side, militarized men demanded respect at the butt of a gun; on the other, angry protesters screamed for justice.

But behind the violence in Minneapolis—captured in so many chilling photographs in recent weeks—is a different reality: a meticulous urban choreography of civic protest. You could see traces of it in the identical whistles the protesters used, in their chants, in their tactics, in the way they followed ICE agents but never actually blocked them from detaining people. Thousands of Minnesotans have been trained over the past year as legal observers and have taken part in lengthy role-playing exercises where they rehearse scenes exactly like the one I witnessed. They patrol neighborhoods day and night on foot and stay connected on encrypted apps such as Signal, in networks that were first formed after the 2020 killing of George Floyd.

Again and again, I heard people say they were not protesters but protectors—of their communities, of their values, of the Constitution. Vice President Vance has decried the protests as “engineered chaos” produced by far-left activists working in tandem with local authorities. But the reality on the ground is both stranger and more interesting. The movement has grown much larger than the core of activists shown on TV newscasts, especially since the killing of Renee Good on January 7. And it lacks the sort of central direction that Vance and other administration officials seem to imagine.

At times, Minneapolis reminded me of what I saw during the Arab Spring in 2011, a series of street clashes between protesters and police that quickly swelled into a much larger struggle against autocracy. As in Cairo's Tahrir Square, Minneapolis has seen a layered civic uprising where a vanguard of protesters has gained strength as many others who don't share progressive convictions joined in feeling, if not always in person. I heard the same tones of outrage from parents, ministers, schoolteachers, and elderly residents of an affluent suburb. Some of the quarrels that divided Minneapolis city leaders only a few weeks ago, over policing or Gaza or the budget, have faded as people have come together to oppose ICE.

“Overall, this community has exercised enormous restraint,” Allison Sharkey, the executive director of the Lake Street Council, which represents many minority-owned businesses that have been hit hard by the ICE raids, told me. “But we have been pushed, probably intentionally, towards civil unrest.”

And as with the Arab uprisings, there is profound unease about where it is all leading—especially now that two people have been shot dead in scenes like the one I witnessed—alongside an undertow of hope that Minnesota can provide the rest of the country with a model of democratic resistance.



Over the past year, a three-story brick building in south Minneapolis has become a magnet for people who feel they—and their neighbors—need protection from their own government. The nonprofit that runs training sessions there asked me not to identify its location. When I visited, an ebullient labor organizer named Emilia Gonzalez Avalos was standing onstage in front of a packed auditorium, talking about the facial-recognition technology used by ICE agents, who routinely photograph protesters. “Everyone is at risk now,” she said. Behind her, a screen offered bullet points on how to legally observe ICE raids.

Avalos told me that 65,000 people have received the training, most of them since December. “We started in a very different tone; it was preventive,” she said. Now, after Good's death, “people are understanding the stakes in a different way.”

I went upstairs to see breakout sessions where people were being trained for direct confrontations with ICE. Inside a classroom, several dozen people ranging in age from 14 to about 70 faced off against three trainers playing ICE agents, in a loud fracas that lasted several minutes. Afterward, the trainers offered the volunteers a critique. One gray-haired lady said she had found the exercise difficult, “not being a ‘Fuck you' person.” Others got tips on how to brace themselves more effectively so that the agents could not easily knock them down.

Before I left, I watched the trainers put the group through two more simulations: an unexpected ICE raid on a neighbor's home and a planned demonstration at an airport that ICE is using to deport people. The second scenario appeared to come to life a few days later, when about 100 clergy members were arrested for protesting at the Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport.

The participants I spoke with did not seem like typical protest types. One of them, a driver's ed teacher who asked me to identify him only as Dave, told me, “I do not like confrontation at all, and that's another reason that it's weird I went to the training.” But in light of what is happening around him, he felt he needed what the trainers had to offer. His 14-year-old daughter, who attended the training with him, told me, “It was kind of overwhelming. But I don't think it could be too much, because they're just being realistic.”

The nonprofit groups that run these training sessions are not organizing or directing the anti-ICE protests taking place in the Twin Cities. No one is. This is a leaderless movement—like the Arab Spring protests—that has emerged in a spontaneous and hyperlocal way. The people who follow ICE convoys (they call themselves “commuters,” a verbal gesture that is part joke and part effort to elude government surveillance) have organized on a neighborhood basis, using Signal groups. The man who drove me to the ICE raids I witnessed—a lawyer, activist, and social-media figure named Will Stancil—had a cellphone fixed above the windshield of his car, and I could hear people tracking the location of the ICE convoy as it passed through their neighborhoods on a Signal audio chat. It was like being inside a police car that is getting updates by radio from a dispatcher.

You do not have to get tear-gassed to observe all of this self-organization; it is visible to anyone walking through Minneapolis. One bitterly cold morning, I approached a man standing across the street from an elementary school, a blue whistle around his neck. He told me his name was Daniel (he asked not to be identified further, because his wife is an immigrant) and that he stood watch every morning for an hour to make sure the kids got into school safely. Other local volunteers come by regularly to bring him coffee and baked goods, or to exchange news. These community watches take place outside schools throughout the Twin Cities, outside restaurants and day-care centers, outside any place where there are immigrants or people who might be mistaken for them.

“It's kind of unorganized-organized,” Daniel said, when I asked how the school monitoring worked. “George Floyd connected everybody.”

The local networks that formed after Floyd's killing were not just about fighting racism. During those febrile weeks in May and June of 2020, there were looters and provocateurs of all kinds on the streets, and so much anger had been directed at the police that they pulled back from parts of the city. Many neighborhoods began organizing local watches simply to defend themselves.



I had been talking with Daniel for only a few minutes when a tall man walked up, said he was a parent observer for the school we stood across from, and asked me to identify myself. When I showed him my press badge, he seemed friendlier, but still wary. He explained that he had heard reports of ICE agents impersonating journalists. I asked about the parent patrol, and he apologized, saying he couldn't give out any information.

Inside the schools, many administrators have been making their own preparations over the past year. Amanda Bauer, a teacher at a Minneapolis elementary school that has a large portion of immigrant students, told me that administrators informed parents last fall about their emergency plans for ICE raids by phone or in person, because they were already concerned about leaving email chains that could be mined by a hostile government.

Bauer, who is 49, struggled to maintain her composure as she described the day early this month when ICE showed up in force outside her school. Agents had been circling the school since December, seemingly learning its routines, and they arrested some parents just before the winter break. But this time, agents leapt out in riot gear and began entering the apartments just across from the school, where many students live.

“We had to lock down and keep the kids inside, and parents linked arms to block the school entrance,” Bauer said. “We had a student who was looking out the window and saw them break into his apartment and just sobbed, ‘That's my house. That's my home.' And we shut the blinds, but it was too late.”

Bauer has been a teacher for 25 years, a period that has included a rise of school shootings and the drills that have become common to protect against them. “But I never thought it would be our own government we had to protect the kids from,” she told me. “We kept them physically safe, but they saw what happened.”

As she spoke, Bauer's hands were trembling. She held them up and smiled weakly. “I don't think I've stopped shaking for two weeks,” she said.

Children were a moral fault line for many of the people I met in the Twin Cities—not just the children of immigrants, who are at risk of losing their parents or being deported themselves, but also their white peers in schools and day-care centers.

I met a couple in their 70s who told me they had never considered joining a political protest until ICE came to town, and they realized that their granddaughter was at risk of witnessing a violent immigration raid just by going to school. Dan and Jane (like many others, they asked that I shield their full names) live in a large house in a comfortable suburb, where they welcomed me with tea and cookies.

“When a child witnesses violence or crime, it's profoundly different from adults,” Dan said. “It leaves scars.”

Dan and Jane resisted the idea that they had become political. A better word, Jane said, was humanist. Their anger was unmistakable as they told me that the Trump administration was violating basic Christian principles. “It became clear very quickly that ICE is the Proud Boys, the Boogaloo boys. They've given them uniforms and let them run wild,” Dan said. He attended a legal-observer training—which happened to have been on the day Good was killed—and now the couple delivers groceries regularly to immigrant families in Minneapolis. This past Friday, Dan joined thousands of others at a protest in Minneapolis, where his fingers were frostbitten in the –9 degrees Fahrenheit weather.



I arrived in Minneapolis 11 days after an ICE agent shot Good in the face. Her picture was hanging like a religious icon on windows and walls all over the city. To many who had not already become involved, her death was a call to action.

One of those latecomers was a 46-year-old documentary filmmaker named Chad Knutson. On the morning after Good was killed, he was at home with his two hound dogs, watching a live feed from the Whipple Building, where ICE is based, a five-minute drive from his house. A protester had laid a rose on a makeshift memorial to Good. As Knutson watched, an ICE agent took the rose, put it in his lapel, and then mockingly gave it to a female ICE agent. They both laughed.

Knutson told me he had never been a protester. It seemed pointless, or just a way for people to expiate their sense of guilt. But when he saw those ICE agents laughing, something broke inside him.

“I grab my keys, I grab a coat, and drive over,” Knutson told me. “I barely park my car and I'm running out screaming and crying, ‘You stole a fucking flower from a dead woman. Like, are any of you human anymore?'”

His voice was so thick with emotion that it felt almost as if he were telling a story of religious conversion. It reminded me again of the Tahrir Square protests in 2011, when so many people seemed to have reached a moral and political turning point.

Knutson now goes to the Whipple Building almost daily, bringing thermoses of hot coffee for the people who hold up signs and bellow at the ICE agents and convoys as they drive in and out. He has been tear-gassed so many times, he said, his voice has gone hoarse. When I met him at his house in St. Paul, a row of megaphones was on the counter. He hands them out along with the coffee. He once brought an ice-fishing clam, a portable shelter, to the Whipple to help the protesters withstand the subzero temperatures.

Knutson mentioned in passing that his neighbor had “an adopted brown kid down there; they hid her in the basement yesterday.” This kind of thing no longer sounds weird in Minneapolis. Many people are hiding indoors—so many that, in a city with a substantial minority population, I hardly saw any Black or Latino faces on the street.

All this sheltering has created an economic crisis that has grown worse by the day. Many immigrant-owned businesses have seen their sales drop by as much as 80 percent, said Allison Sharkey, of the Lake Street Council. Large numbers have shut their doors entirely, fearing for themselves or their employees. Sharkey called it “an assault on our entire Main Street.”

The Karmel Mall, a maze-like shopping hub for tens of thousands of East African immigrants in the Twin Cities, is usually packed with people drawn to the aromas of stewed goat and coffee and sambusa pastries, but when I visited, the place was silent, and most of the stalls were empty. At the far end I found some businesses still open, with a handful of customers. Several people looked frightened when I tried to ask questions, saying they didn't speak English well or that the owner would be back in an hour.

One man willing to chat, a 42-year-old named Ziad who was sipping coffee by himself, quickly showed me his passport card, saying he had come to the United States from Somalia decades ago. He has a master's degree in public health and was working in a community center, he said, but now it's closed. “Nobody's being paid,” he said. “Everybody is scared.” His children are attending school online, as they did during the coronavirus pandemic, and his wife almost never leaves home. The visits to the mosque and to family members and friends that sustained their emotional lives are on hold.

But Donald Trump “will go and we will stay,” he said. “We Somalis know how to survive. We've been through a lot—civil war, refugee camps.”

The Somali refugees who began coming to the Twin Cities in the early 1990s did so with the help of religious organizations and churches, especially Lutheran and Catholic parishes, that have a history of welcoming people fleeing war and famine. Those groups have been at the forefront of the resistance to ICE, and some of their leaders have been asking difficult questions: When does protest cross the line into violence? When is it morally acceptable to break the law? How do you retain the trust of people who are uncomfortable defying the authorities?

“We're going to have to live with our discomfort in making other people uncomfortable,” Ingrid Rasmussen, the lead pastor at Holy Trinity Lutheran Church, who has been one of the most outspoken clergy members in the city, told me.

Last June, federal agents raided a taqueria near her church. She ran to the scene, she told me, and found a crowd of protesters facing off against heavily armed agents being protected by local police. Rasmussen was wearing her clerical robes and was thrown to the ground by a sheriff in plainclothes. Some in the crowd threw trash, bottles, and tires at the federal agents, according to a local news report. Video footage spread of Rasmussen shouting at the Minneapolis police chief: “You stand in my church … You promised me a better relationship.”

“It was like nothing I had ever seen before in Minneapolis,” Rasmussen told me.

That was a remarkable thing to hear, because Rasmussen's church was near the center of the riots that took place after the killing of George Floyd in 2020. “Everything to the west of our building burned,” she told me. During that period, her church became a medical site for injured people. She and her congregation worked for years to help rebuild the neighborhood.

The new round of ICE raids has struck even closer to home for the church, whose congregation includes a large number of immigrants. Rasmussen, who has young children, has continued to put herself in harm's way. She was among the 120 clergy members who took part in a sit-in at the corporate headquarters of Target on January 15, in an effort to get the company to take a stronger stand against the federal raids. And on January 23, she was among those arrested during the protest at the Minneapolis airport.

On the morning of January 24, Rasmussen got word that a man had been shot by ICE agents. She put on her warmest winter clothes and went to the scene, on Nicollet Avenue and West 26th Street, figuring she might be outside for hours.

By the time she got there, Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, was dead. The federal agents who had wrestled him to the ground and then shot and killed him were throwing tear gas and flash-bangs at a crowd of furious protesters chanting “Shame!”

Rasmussen attended another protest that afternoon. When we spoke hours later, her voice sounded weary, as if she wasn't sure what such gestures of defiance would accomplish. She found it “almost unbearable” to witness such brutality from her government day after day, she told me. And it was galling to hear people in power say that they were acting in defense of freedom. The streets still looked like a war zone, with flash-bangs detonating and clouds of tear gas in the air.

Before her murder made her a true-crime obsession, Elizabeth Short was a real person. A new book tries to separate truth from myth in the infamous case.

Elizabeth Short liked to wander. Sometimes this wandering was merely in her mind, watching movies and dreaming of a life far beyond her hometown of Medford, Massachusetts. Many times, it was physical; she'd land in a new city—Miami, Jacksonville, Chicago, Long Beach, San Diego, Los Angeles—and explore its streets on foot. Sometimes her travels revolved around family, as when she tracked down her long-lost father and lived with him for a time—until he cast her out. On January 9, 1947, Short, who was 22, told a gentleman friend to drop her off at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles, where her sister was supposedly waiting. She was never seen alive again.

A contemporary version of Elizabeth—dreamy, elusive, independent, and canny—might be called a flaneuse, someone curious about the world. But we'll never know what kind of life she would have led; by the time her bisected body was found in a vacant lot, six days after she left the Biltmore, Elizabeth had ceased to be a person. From then on, she became “The Black Dahlia,” an archetype, a myth, a riddle that countless people have attempted to solve in books, films, television shows, podcasts, websites, internet-message boards, and social-media posts.

“After we are dead, the pretense that we may be protected against the world's careless malice is abandoned,” Janet Malcolm wrote in her book The Silent Woman. She was referring to the poet and novelist Sylvia Plath, another beautiful young woman who died too soon, after which her life and words became grist for the biographical mill. But Malcolm's words apply equally, even eerily, to the afterlife of Short—one of America's most famous murder victims, and certainly among the most persistent subjects of the true-crime industrial complex.

From the moment Short's killing became headline news, sensation was the prime directive. With every new lead, confession, and suspect, the actual Elizabeth receded further. It didn't help that she was an enigmatic character in life, prone to embellishment and even lies. She recounted tales of woe to paramours only to ask them for money, exaggerated her prospects in missives to her mother, told friends about a dead husband and a child who probably didn't exist—all without letting on about her actual precarious straits. Short avoided the spotlight, but over the nearly 80 years since her death, it has wholly consumed her.

This kind of flattening happens all too often with murder victims, particularly young women and girls who die at the hands of a serial killer, usually male. (Never mind that more marginalized women, especially women of color, are less likely to merit any attention at all.) In Short's case, the flattening is particularly egregious, because the inchoate facts of her life are shoehorned into the obsessions of amateur sleuths who continue to get those facts wrong.

Read: A provocative argument about what creates serial killers

William J. Mann's new book, Black Dahlia: Murder, Monsters, and Madness in Midcentury Hollywood, attempts a different approach: to weave the fragments we have into a narrative whole that prioritizes Short, in all of her contradictions, and tries to debunk decades' worth of accumulated myths. Although Mann's effort stands apart from the overlong run of books about the case, it, too, is undercut by the need to name a likely suspect, playing into the true-crime imperative it aims to leave behind.

Mann begins Black Dahlia in late July 1946, several months before Short's murder and not long after her arrival in Long Beach, California. Over the ensuing period, Short befriends women and dates men; wears sophisticated clothing, ankle-strapped high heels, and flowers in her hair; and comes across as “a very modest girl who never cursed or acted sexy,” in the words of one friend. The reader comes to understand why fascination has proved more appealing than facts: We know very little about her life. Short defied norms and customs. She seemed innocent in the ways of men but savvy enough to keep her dates at a respectful distance. The two women who knew her best during this time, Marjorie Graham and Anne Toth, whom Mann renders more fully than any author before him, still had trouble understanding what made Short tick.

Mann starts the story, however, from the vantage point of Tod Faulkner, who says he first spotted Short in a two-piece bathing suit, walking alone toward the beach, and saw her again several more times that summer. Faulkner was 11 at the time, and says he never forgot her. Yet after growing up to become a journalist, he was the one who immortalized the erroneous middle name “Ann,” in a 1971 article for the Los Angeles Times. Faulkner's error would propagate in numerous articles, books, and films before being codified in the 1975 TV movie Who Is the Black Dahlia?, which starred Lucie Arnaz (the daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz) as Short. Already we have the conflict between truth and myth, and we're only on page four.

From there, Mann situates the known facts about the last few months of Short's life in postwar Los Angeles, whose rising murder rate led to an even sharper spike in fear. From 1945 to 1946, “while the homicide rate for men grew by 26.8 percent, the number of women murdered in that same period shot up by 52.9 percent,” Mann points out. Over the next few years, the increase in violent deaths of women, seemingly at the hands of strangers, was reflected in the growing genre of film noir and in novels including Dorothy B. Hughes's In a Lonely Place, which was published less than a year after Short's murder.

Fear also sold newspapers, as any tabloid journalist at the time could tell you. And tell people they did, particularly in the early days and weeks after Short's death, when the tiniest new detail about the “Black Dahlia” investigation—even, or especially, if that detail wasn't true—could boost circulation. Mann calls out many instances of “sexing up the news” (a phrase he uses multiple times): the description of the block where Short's body was discovered as a “lover's lane”; invented testimony from witnesses and family members (including Short's grieving mother, Phoebe); exaggerations in the memoirs of the L.A. newspaper editors Agness Underwood and Jimmy Richardson, early chroniclers—and shapers—of the murder narrative.

Read: Can a murderer earn redemption?

The errors and suppositions would multiply over the decades—most of them cataloged by the former L.A. Times reporter and historian Larry Harnisch. Was Short a sex worker? Blame John Gregory Dunne's otherwise terrific 1977 novel, True Confessions, which gave its Short stand-in the moniker “The Virgin Tramp” along with a past career in pornography. (Without True Confessions, James Ellroy probably wouldn't have written his own The Black Dahlia novel in 1987, which led to a 2006 film adaptation.) Did she have sexual dysfunction? That's an invention of a former Examiner reporter, Will Fowler, bolstered by John Gilmore in his supposedly nonfiction 1994 account, Severed, which includes information from a detective, “Herman Willis,” who doesn't seem to have existed.

False suspects also proliferated. Was George Hodel the killer? So his son Steve Hodel keeps insisting, first in his 2003 book, Black Dahlia Avenger, then in a later book that also puts George forward as the Zodiac Killer (oy). Janice Knowlton, too, believed that her father murdered Elizabeth: Read about it in Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer. Piu Eatwell's Black Dahlia, Red Rose initially convinced me that Leslie Dillon was the culprit, but Mann's account definitively rules Dillon out. Eli Frankel's Sisters in Death, published just last year, strains (and, to my mind, fails) to connect Short to an unsolved murder in Kansas City. And a new podcast hosted by Michael Connelly, Killer in the Code, also tries to connect the Black Dahlia and the Zodiac Killer, with the help of a “cold-case consultant” who bases his “smoking gun” on a deathbed sketch that better resembles fan art.

Shiftiness, con artistry, and even violence toward women don't add up to hard, incriminating evidence. Mann, too, succumbs to the temptation, perhaps reluctantly; he spends precious pages explaining why one of Elizabeth's Long Beach boyfriends, a military veteran named Marvin Margolis who died in 1993—the same suspect in Connelly's podcast—can't be ruled out as the killer. (The original detectives crossed him off the list early in the investigation.) Even Mann seems dissatisfied when he mulls the prospect that a stranger killed Short: “She was simply a vulnerable young woman who came face-to-face with someone with severe and violent psychopathology who decided, either on impulse or deliberation, to kill her, to use her body to express rage and resentment at the world.”

After so much time has passed, no one is likely to be satisfied with any identification of Short's killer. If the lead detective, Harry Hansen, is to be believed, the Los Angeles Police Department never once interviewed the actual killer despite interrogating scores of suspects—including all of those mentioned in prior books, and now Mann's. Any outcome would likely resemble the identification last September, via investigative genetic genealogy, of the man responsible for the 1991 quadruple homicide in Austin, Texas, known as the “Yogurt Shop Murders.” In that case, pinning down the murderer didn't erase the 34 years of anguish and damage sustained by the girls' families and the young men wrongfully convicted—including one who had been on death row. After decades of pain and exploitation, solving the case feels like an anticlimax.

“Solving” the Black Dahlia case, most likely through genetic genealogy, may bring an answer, but it would only generate many more questions. Harnisch, the historian, who knows more about the case than almost anybody (and has a credible theory relegated to a footnote in Mann's book), put it best in a 2020 interview: “This is a story that fades to conjecture. This is a story without an ending.”

Look past the need for narrative and there, out on the horizon, is Elizabeth Short, walking down a California boulevard, trying to create a better story for herself. She didn't have to remain forever a girl wounded by her father's rejection, too proud to admit the truth about her life to her mother and sisters, yet resourceful enough to survive, for a time, in a world that couldn't care less. Her luck ran out, and we don't know why, or who killed her. But the brutality of Short's death shouldn't supersede her life any more than myth should overshadow a larger truth: that her murder will never truly make any sense.

﻿Plaintiffs from the religious right are asking the Republican justices to seize control of public schools.

The Supreme Court is currently considering whether the Constitution requires public schools to out transgender students to their parents, even when those students inform the school that they do not want their family to be informed of their gender identity. The case, which is currently pending on the Court's shadow docket, is known as Mirabelli v. Bonta.

California law provides that public school employees “shall not be required to disclose any information related to a pupil's sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression to any other person without the pupil's consent unless otherwise required by state or federal law.” The plaintiffs in Mirabelli argue that this law is unconstitutional, and they ask the justices to embrace a trial judge's claim that “when gender incongruence is observed…parents have a right to be informed.”

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

The Mirabelli plaintiffs, in other words, claim that the Constitution requires the government to side with parents in an internal family dispute with their own children. When a public school student wants to keep their trans identity secret from their parents, these plaintiffs argue, government employees are constitutionally required to defy the child's wishes and inform the parents regardless.

Nor is Mirabelli an isolated case. While Mirabelli sits on the Court's shadow docket (a forum for expedited matters that the justices often decide without explaining why they ruled the way they did), the Court is also weighing whether to hear a nearly identical case, known as Foote v. Ludlow School Committee on its merits docket (unlike shadow docket cases, the justices typically release a published opinion explaining why they ruled the way they did in merits docket cases). Last year, Justice Samuel Alito complained in a third case that, in his view, too many lower courts are avoiding the question of “whether a school district violates parents' fundamental rights” when they permit a transgender student to socially transition.

Off the Court, the Federalist Society, the powerful legal group with close ties to the Republican justices, hosted a debate at its most recent national convention on whether “parents have a constitutional right to know and consent to public school facilitation of their children's gender-identity transition.”

This question, in other words, is clearly a matter of great importance to the conservative legal movement's religious wing. And the Supreme Court's Republican majority rarely breaks with the religious right on its high-priority issues.

It is inevitable that public school teachers, and the officials who write the curricula taught by public school teachers, will shape the moral beliefs of their students. Indeed, the Supreme Court historically viewed this reality as a good thing. As the Court said in 1979, one of the public school system's most important functions is to “inculcat[e] fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system.”

To the extent that Americans disagree about which values these schools should teach, the United States has historically managed these disagreements by giving the lion's share of control over public schools to state governments and local school boards. A school in rural Arkansas may teach different books than a school in Manhattan. And that's okay.

Lawsuits like Mirabelli and Foote, by contrast, seek to centralize control over public schools in a Supreme Court dominated by conservative Republicans. And those six Republicans recently showed that they are very eager to become superintendents of the entire nation's public schools.

Until very recently, federal courts firmly rejected the idea that courts should micromanage how public schools teach and relate to their students — largely due to concerns that schools would find it impossible to function if they were subject to such management. In a 1948 opinion, for example, Justice Robert Jackson wrote that there were “256 separate and substantial religious bodies” within the United States, and warned that “if we are to eliminate everything that is objectionable to any of these warring sects or inconsistent with any of their doctrines, we will leave public education in shreds.”

This hands-off era came to an abrupt halt last June, however, with the Supreme Court's decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor (2025).

In Mahmoud, the Court's Republican majority held that parents who object to books with LGBTQ+ characters or themes must be informed if those books will be used in their child's classroom, and given a chance to opt their child out of that lesson. But the opinion speaks in broad terms, suggesting that any parent who objects to any lesson on religious grounds must be given this right — even if the school district could not possibly have known about the parent's objection in advance.

Among other things, Mahmoud is likely to impose a “Don't Say Gay” regime on public schools throughout the country. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in dissent, many school districts “cannot afford to engage in costly litigation over opt-out rights or to divert resources to tracking and managing student absences.” And so their only practical option will be to “censor their curricula” to remove material that might trigger a religious objection from anyone.

Mahmoud, in other words, fundamentally reshaped the relationship between public schools and the judiciary, forcing judges to police schools for any lesson that might trouble any person's religious beliefs. And, as Mirabelli and similar cases show, advocates for the religious right are already demanding more from their allies on the Supreme Court.

Justice Jackson's warning about “leaving public education in shreds” was rooted in the Court's longstanding belief that public schools are an essential institution, and that the Constitution must be interpreted in a way that allows this institution to thrive.

As the Court said six years later in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), its most famous intervention in state education policy, “education is perhaps the most important function of state and local governments” — and not just because it prepares children to hold a job as adults, but also because it enables people to be good Americans who contribute to the collective project of the nation. Public schools, the Court explained in Brown, lay “the very foundation of good citizenship.” They enable citizens to perform “our most basic public responsibilities.” And they “awaken[] the child to cultural values” that schools seek to inculcate in all Americans.

This is why modern-day public schools typically teach texts like the Declaration of Independence, with its statement that “all men are created equal,” or Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s “I Have a Dream” speech. These texts are a kind of secular liturgy, taught to all Americans in the hope that we will all embrace liberal democratic values.

Indeed, before Mahmoud, the Court's conservative wing had historically been even more protective of public schools' role as evangelists of universal American values than more liberal justices. Consider, for example, Ambach v. Norwick (1979), where a 5-4 Court upheld a New York state law that prohibited noncitizens from being public school teachers unless they were actively trying to become citizens. The five most conservative justices who served at the time formed the majority.

Those five justices reasoned that, because training children to be good US citizens is one of the most important functions of public schools, the schools could refuse to hire teachers who are uninterested in US citizenship. Public schools, Justice Lewis Powell wrote for the Court, are an “‘assimilative force' by which diverse and conflicting elements in our society are brought together on a broad but common ground.” Hence Powell's conclusion that public schools “inculcat[e] fundamental values necessary to the maintenance of a democratic political system.”

Given the high regard the Supreme Court used to hold for public education, it used to avoid reading the Constitution in ways that would undermine public schools' ability to function. In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), for example, the Court famously declared that students do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.” Yet it also held that those rights must yield when they disrupt teachers' ability to educate.

Under Tinker, a public school student may not claim First Amendment protection when their speech “materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others.” The justices recognized that public schools could not function if students had a right to disrupt lessons, so they carefully crafted a rule that respects student free speech without undercutting the school's ability to teach math, history, or American values.

Mahmoud is incompatible with this more modest approach to judging. Much like a school that teaches the Declaration of Independence in order to foster American values like universal equality, the school district in Mahmoud said that it wanted its curriculum to include some books with LGBTQ+ characters in order to showcase American values such as “the richness of cultural pluralism and commonality.”

But it was this very effort to, in Ambach's words, inculcate children in “fundamental values” that the Republican justices found objectionable in Mahmoud. According to Justice Samuel Alito's majority opinion, the LGBTQ-themed books were unacceptable precisely because they were “designed to present certain values and beliefs as things to be celebrated.”

The holding of Mahmoud, moreover, was extraordinarily broad. It seems to say that all public schools must notify parents in advance if they plan to teach a lesson that those parents object to on religious grounds, and that the school must also allow the parents to opt their child out of that lesson.

But, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent, this rule will create “chaos” in public schools because it is not possible for schools to anticipate every objection that a parent might raise, and to warn them in advance. In previous court cases, parents raised religious objections to lessons touching on topics as varied as divorce, interfaith couples, “immodest dress,” evolution, pacifism, magic, women achieving things outside of the home, and “false views of death.” How is a school that wants to teach, say, a biography of President Ronald Reagan supposed to know, in advance, if one of its students' parents finds this book objectionable because Reagan was divorced?

In criticizing Mahmoud, I want to be clear that I do not object to the Court's conclusion that classroom instruction on sensitive topics like sexuality may sometimes violate the Constitution's religious protections. The problem with Mahmoud is that it imposes an impossible burden on public schools, requiring them to anticipate any religious view that might be held by any parent. What the Court should have done instead is the exact same thing it did in Tinker: craft a legal rule that respects constitutional rights without undermining public schools' ability to function.

But the kind of conservatism that respects institutions like public schools is no longer present on the Supreme Court. It's been replaced by a conservatism that fetishizes the interests of the religious right.

So what, then, does Mahmoud mean for Mirabelli, and for other cases where religious conservatives want to control public schools? The short answer is that Mahmoud is a very helpful case for the Mirabelli plaintiffs. If the Constitution requires teachers to tell parents if they plan to teach a book with a trans character, why wouldn't it also require them to tell a student's parents if the student says they are trans?

One possible answer, as the appeals court that heard Mirabelli concluded, is that Mahmoud applies only to “curricular requirements” and not to “general operational policies that involve no instruction.”

At the Federalist Society's debate on whether public schools must out trans children, University of Chicago law professor Mary Anne Case argued extending Mahmoud beyond a school's curriculum would be even more disruptive than Mahmoud itself.

“Many parents have extremely strong religious ethical views about the foods a child consumes,” Case pointed out. If a child's parent wants their family to only eat kosher or halal food, does that mean that the school must immediately inform the parents if their child is caught with a piece of bacon? If a parent wants their child to wear “religious garb,” is the school supposed to monitor that child to make sure that they do not remove a hijab or a yarmulke? Similarly, if a child holds different religious views than their parents, is the school required to warn the parents if that student wears a headscarf, a kippah, or a cross necklace at school?

If a parent believes, for religious reasons, that their child should not form romantic attachments prior to marriage, are teachers obligated to tell the child's parents if they are dating someone? What if the student is gay, and the parents object to homosexuality? Are schools required to reveal that information as well? And, what happens if teachers reasonably believe that the parents may be abusive? If a student tells their teacher that they are scared because their father will beat them or kick them out of the house if he discovers that they are trans, does the Constitution really require this teacher to out the student?

Unfortunately, it's unlikely that any of these arguments will persuade this Supreme Court — the Republican justices already revealed in Mahmoud that they do not care if their approach to religious liberty forces public schools to do the impossible. But there is another reason why Mirabelli is different from Mahmoud that could be more persuasive to this Court.

As the appeals court that ruled against the Mirabelli plaintiffs noted, “the challenged policies appear to apply only when a student makes the voluntary decision to share their gender nonconformity with the school.” The Mahmoud opinion has very little to say about the right of students to express themselves or form their own beliefs, possibly because that case primarily dealt with younger students who may not yet have formed opinions on gender or sexuality.

But when a child tells their teacher that they are transgender, and that they do not want their parents to know this fact about them, that child is asserting their own right to self-definition. They are also implicitly asserting a religious belief. A child who tells a teacher that they are trans, and that they do not want their parents to know because of their parents' anti-trans religious views, is exercising their constitutional right to hold religious beliefs that are different from their parents'.

The heart of the Mirabelli plaintiffs' claim is that a parent's right to exercise their religion trumps the right of the child to exercise theirs. But the Constitution provides that all people, parents and children alike, may freely exercise their faith.

Mirabelli is rooted in a fairly explicit vision of parents as domineering figures who control all aspects of their children's lives, even against the wishes of those very children. And the Mirabelli plaintiffs claim that the Constitution obligates the government to enforce parental domination. At one point, their brief even quotes a dissenting opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas, which argues that minors should be stripped of their First Amendment rights because “the concept of total parental control over children's lives extended into the schools.”

Accordingly, the plaintiffs' most radical legal argument is rooted in an old Supreme Court precedent that they read to say that parents have a “right of control” over their children.

It is true that, more than a century ago, the Supreme Court handed down two cases — Meyer v. Nebraska (1923) and Pierce v. Society of Sisters (1925) — that held that parents enjoy some amount of “liberty” to “direct the upbringing and education of children.” But those cases involved far more modest legal claims than the one in Mirabelli. In Meyer, the Court struck down a Nebraska law that forbade teachers at private schools from teaching foreign languages prior to the eighth grade. And in Pierce, the Court struck down an Oregon law that forbade most parents from sending their kids to a private school altogether.

If Meyer and Pierce were decided today, the Court most likely would reach the same result, but for very different reasons. A ban on teaching foreign languages obviously violates the First Amendment's free speech protections. And the Oregon law struck down in Pierce was almost certainly motivated by anti-Catholic sentiment and a desire to ban parochial schools, and thus violates the Constitution's guarantee that everyone may practice their faith.

But the Supreme Court's approach to individual rights was completely haphazard in the 1920s, and it paid no heed to the text of the Constitution. The Court frequently made up “rights” that do not appear in the Constitution, such as a “freedom of contract” that was frequently used to strike down laws protecting workers. Meanwhile, textually protected rights such as free speech more or less did not exist in the 1920s, at least according to the Supreme Court.

Yet, while the Supreme Court largely repudiated this anti-textual approach to constitutional interpretation in the 1930s, Meyer and Pierce remain good law. So the Mirabelli plaintiffs are correct that, under current law, parents do enjoy some amount of “liberty” to raise their children as they choose. But neither case — both of which merely said that parents may send their children to private schools which may teach different subjects or instill different values than public schools — has ever permitted parents to control how public schools operate.

Parents, of course, have a near-absolute right to decide which values they wish to teach their own children. But it is neither possible, nor desirable, for a family to completely insulate its children from other value systems and ideas. And the fundamental question presented by cases like Mirabelli is whether American society as a whole should also play a role in shaping public school students' values. If a family wishes to teach its children that pluralistic democratic values are wicked, are public schools forbidden from teaching an alternative viewpoint?

Before Mahmoud, the judiciary's answer to this question was an emphatic “no.” Disagreements about which values should be taught in public schools were dealt with democratically, through elections for state legislature or local school boards. But a family that wants to teach their children that, say, white people are inherently superior to Black people, couldn't sue their local school board because they don't want their child to read To Kill a Mockingbird.

Litigants like the Mirabelli plaintiffs reject this kind of federalized pluralism as well. The fundamental premise of their lawsuit is that control over public education should be transferred from state and local authorities to Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. They want a one-size-fits-all approach to education — just so long as the one size is selected by Republicans in the nation's capitol.

Technology is rotting our brains — but there are ways to stop it.

Brain rot is everywhere. Our feeds are filled with slop, misinformation is ubiquitous, and AI is increasingly doing our thinking for us.

And the crisis goes even deeper: Math and reading scores are falling, trust in science has been declining, and our attention spans are shrinking. Some even say we're in a Golden Age of Stupidity.

But all is not lost when it comes to matters of the mind — at least, according to Andrew Budson, a neurologist at Boston University who specializes in and researches memory disorders. He says there's definitely a way to reclaim our brains, and he talks all about it on the latest episode of Explain It to Me, Vox's weekly call-in podcast.

Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity. You can listen to the full episode on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get podcasts. If you'd like to submit a question, send an email to askvox@vox.com or call 1-800-618-8545.

How does our memory work?

Once we are able to pay attention to something, it then gets stored by a structure that's deep in our temporal lobe called the hippocampus. The hippocampus actually takes the separate sights and sounds and smells and thoughts and feelings that you're having at that instant, and it binds them all together into a coherent hole.

This bound representation is the representation of your memory. It then gets tagged with an index that will allow you to retrieve that information later.

Is it like a filing cabinet? 

Yeah, it's a little bit like a file cabinet, but the twist is that the files are just the blueprints or the schematic of the memory. What your brain needs to do is to take this blueprint and very actively recreate the memory. It needs to actively recreate all the details that are going on.

Another part of your brain called the frontal lobes get involved. The frontal lobes are right behind your forehead, and they are like the contractor that is in charge of this active construction. The frontal lobes are like, “Hey, we need more of this, and we got to put these things together, and I don't think that's quite right. Let's look for something else that's a better match.” The frontal lobes are your quality control in addition to your contractor to sort of get all of these pieces working together.

I want to zoom in closer on our brains and how we learn things. Biologically, what allows us to learn and retain new ideas?

It's one of the coolest things: neuroplasticity.

Neuroplasticity is essentially the concept that our brains are elastic, or that they're able to make new connections over time. Memories are a strengthening of existing connections in the brain between one neuron and another. They're also the creation of new connections between neurons in the brain.

What happens when we sleep is the brain figures out, “Okay, this strengthening of connections here, this is an important memory, so we're going to strengthen that even further,” or “We're going to grow new connections.” So those connections become permanent.

One of the really cool things about neuroplasticity is how it's something that people can use throughout their lives. When I went to medical school, I was told that it was really only babies and children that had this sort of neuroplasticity available to them. But we now know that neuroplasticity is going on throughout the lifespan, including in people as old as me and older.

It sounds like our brains are a muscle like any other. And so, is it one of those “use it or lose it” type situations?

That is very true. There have been studies that have looked at what happens when people get socially isolated. Our brains evolved for social interactions. Our math teachers might think it's to do arithmetic in our heads, but they're wrong. That's not what our brain is for. So when you're talking to your friend next to you in the math class, that is actually what our brains are for.

People who become socially isolated, their brains actually shrink, even if they don't have a disorder, and people who are socially isolated are at increased risk of developing dementia.

So, if your brain is a muscle, does that mean we can train it to be smarter?

Absolutely; we totally can. The key is to train with the most direct example as you possibly can. What I mean by that is there are a lot of companies that are out there, many of whom are working very hard with lots of scientists to try to develop brain training games that are going to really help us. But so far what the studies have proven is that if you spend a lot of time with these brain training games, you get better at the brain training games. It does not translate into everyday life.

If you want to get better at doing something like remembering French vocabulary words, you can get better by developing a routine or a program as to how you're going to work on studying the vocabulary words, and how you're going to incorporate it into your life. We all can improve on almost anything our brain does, but the trick is to work on practicing that.

“We all can improve on almost anything our brain does, but the trick is to work on practicing that.”

For example, a lot of people have trouble remembering names, and you can absolutely train yourself to have an easier time remembering someone's name when you first meet them at a cocktail party if you practice it.

There's all this talk about how we're not as smart as we used to be. You look at a lot of brains. How are we stacking up these days?

I do think that there are some reasons that we may not be as smart today as we used to be. I think the average person's ability, for example, to navigate from one place to another has been dramatically reduced by the use of Google Maps and other programs like that. The part of our brain that's involved in navigation does actually shrink for many people.

The one other thing I'd like to mention, because it was actually studied, is that people who spend more than an hour a day watching TV actually end up getting less smart over time. If you're watching mindless television, it's going to rot your brain. And what do I mean by that? It's going to make your brain smaller. You're not using it.

Don't forget, the thing that our brains evolve for is to have social interactions. So, I don't want people to go out and spend their time in a windowless room studying math texts. What I want people to do is to get out there in life, interact with people. That's how to use your brains the best.

Okay, so what I'm hearing is maybe don't binge all those episodes of The Traitors back to back; in between, maybe go hang out with some friends.

Absolutely. Or if you watch television with friends, and you really make it a social event, and you're interacting with people, I think it's different than if you're watching it by yourself.

The sport feels unstoppable — yet also doomed.

Football occupies a strange place in American life. It's the most popular sport in the country by an absurd margin, but it's also the most controversial. It's treated as a civic ritual in some places, a primitive distraction in others, and a kind of background noise almost everywhere.

For millions of people, football Sundays (and Saturdays) structure the week. For millions more, football represents everything that feels excessive, violent, or backward about American culture.

What makes football so hard to talk about is that none of these interpretations feels fully wrong or right. The game is violent, but also beautiful. It's deeply commercial, yet genuinely communal. It's hyper-engineered, obsessively optimized, ruthlessly controlled, while also delivering moments of genuine unpredictability that no scripted entertainment can match.

The writer Chuck Klosterman has spent much of his career thinking about how mass culture works, why certain things take hold, and what they reveal about the people who love them. In his new book, Football, he turns that lens on the most dominant cultural object in American life.

Klosterman is especially interested in football as a mediated experience. After all, it's a game that most fans have never played, can't meaningfully simulate, and only encounter through television. And yet we can't get enough of it. Why is that? And why is it that football, of all things, continues to function as one of the last true monocultural rituals in a fragmented media landscape?

I invited Klosterman onto The Gray Area to talk about all of this and why he thinks the sport may be both more powerful and more fragile than it looks. As always, there's much more in the full podcast, which drops every Monday, so listen to and follow us on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pandora, or wherever you find podcasts.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

You're a football fan, but this book isn't a love letter to the game. What were you trying to do?

I say it's not a love letter because I think when people write about something they love, especially something they've loved for a long time, there's an impulse to justify that love. To persuade the reader that this thing deserves the emotional weight the writer has given it. That's not really what I'm interested in doing.

I approach football the same way I approach music or movies or any other subject I write about. It's just criticism. I'm trying to understand what the thing is doing, how it works, and why it exists the way it does.

I've been thinking about football unconsciously for 40 years and more deliberately for at least 20. At some point it occurred to me that football is going to matter less in the future than it does now. That's not a judgment. That's just what happens to large cultural objects. Everything eventually recedes.

And when that happens, people are going to try to explain retroactively why football mattered so much. They'll tell neat stories about violence or capitalism or distraction or American decline. And I think those explanations will mostly be wrong, or at least incomplete.

So what I wanted to do was describe what football means while we're still living inside it. While it still feels normal and necessary rather than strange and historical. It's almost like writing an obituary before the subject has died.

Is that why you wrote it for people who aren't born yet?

That's a bit of rhetorical exaggeration, but the idea behind it is real. Books force you to commit in a way other media don't. Online writing gets overwritten constantly. Books make you stake a claim that's supposed to endure.

When this book comes out, it'll already be out of date in certain ways. And five or 10 years from now, it'll feel even more distant from the moment it describes. That's kind of the point.

What's your experience with football?

I grew up in a small town in North Dakota. We played nine-man football. Football was just part of life. If a game was on TV, it was on whether anyone was actively watching it or not.

I was a sports journalist early on, then became more of a culture writer, but football never really left my thinking. As I got older, it became more important in a different way. Not because I watched more games, but because it started to feel like one of the few remaining cultural objects that could still connect people across differences.

If someone asks me my favorite sport, I'll say basketball. But if you ask which sport matters most to how I understand American culture, football wins easily. It's not even close.

Why football, though? Why does it dominate culture so completely?

A lot of it comes down to historical timing and structural compatibility.

Football emerges in the late 19th century, right after the Civil War, and it carries a metaphorical relationship to organized conflict. It's a simulation of war, without all the death and geopolitical consequences. That metaphor is baked into the game at a very deep level.

Then television arrives, and football turns out to be perfectly suited for it. The stoppages, the structure, the anticipation between plays, the way action unfolds in short bursts, all translate beautifully to broadcast.

You describe the game as generating a sensation of chaotic freedom inside an environment of total control. How does that happen?

Football is one of the most engineered experiences people routinely engage with, even if they don't think about it that way. Every play is designed in advance. It's encoded into a language that only a small group of people fully understands. It's transmitted through headsets, wristbands, and signals. It's rehearsed endlessly during practice. And it has to be executed within very strict time constraints.

Behind every snap, there's all this hierarchy. Coaches, coordinators, analysts, trainers, medical staff, league officials, rules committees. It's a deeply bureaucratic system. In a lot of ways, it's almost corporate. Everything is planned, regulated, and optimized.

And then the ball is snapped, and all of that structure suddenly recedes. For a few seconds, what you see feels spontaneous. Twenty-two people collide, react, adjust, and improvise in real time. You don't know exactly what's going to happen, even though you know it's happening inside a very rigid framework.

That contrast is where the power comes from. You get unpredictability without existential risk. You get chaos that's bounded. The play might fail or succeed, but the system itself is stable. There's a beginning and an end. The whistle will blow. The next play will come.

I think that mirrors how a lot of people want to experience the world more generally. Most people don't actually want true chaos. They want the feeling of danger without real danger, the feeling of freedom without losing the structure that makes life manageable.

Would football be as entertaining if there wasn't this continual possibility that someone will get hurt? 

I don't think people want to see anyone get hurt. Football isn't a blood sport in that sense. But risk matters. Meaning requires stakes.

It's like climbing Everest. People don't climb it because they want to die. But the fact that death is possible gives the act significance. If football eliminated serious risk entirely, it would become something else.

That's why safety rule changes provoke such strong reactions. On the surface, those reactions sound crude. But they're pointing at a real tension between safety and meaning.

Why do you think football is such a fundamentally mediated experience, even when we're sitting in the stadium watching it?

I think most fans understand football through what you might call television grammar, whether they realize it or not. We've all been trained, over decades, to see the game from a very specific set of angles, with certain visual cues and rhythms that television provides.

So even when you're sitting in the stands, what you're actually doing most of the time is mentally translating what you're seeing into that television version of the game. You're imagining the sideline camera shot. You're thinking about the replay you just saw or the replay you know is coming. You're filling in information you can't physically see from your seat because you've learned how the broadcast usually explains it.

There are moments when being in the stadium gives you something television can't. If a play breaks right in front of you, or you see something develop before the cameras catch it, that can feel special. But most of the time, the stadium experience isn't about seeing the game clearly. It's about being part of something larger.

So what are we watching, really? Is it a sport on TV? A TV show about a sport? Or a sport that used to be a sport and then became a TV product? 

I think it's a real event that's experienced through mediation. The players are doing something real. The outcomes matter. The risks are real. But the way most of us encounter that reality is through a highly constructed medium that shapes how we understand what's happening.

What makes sports different from almost every other form of entertainment is that no one knows what's going to happen. There's no script. No writer has decided how it ends. Even the people most invested in the outcome can't control it once the game starts.

That kind of liveness is incredibly rare now. We're surrounded by entertainment that's optimized, focus-tested, and refined to minimize unpredictability. Even when we don't know exactly how a show or movie will end, we know that someone has designed that ending with a specific effect in mind.

Sports don't work that way. Anything can happen, and sometimes things happen that no one would ever write because they'd seem implausible or unsatisfying on the page. That unpredictability creates a different kind of engagement.

I think we really underestimate how valuable that is, especially in a culture where so much of what we consume is engineered to be smooth, coherent, and controlled. Football gives us a mediated experience of reality that still contains genuine uncertainty. And that combination is a big part of why it holds our attention the way it does.

The Damar Hamlin incident felt like a moment when all of this snapped into focus. It wasn't just another injury. That one felt different in real time.

I think almost everyone watching sensed that immediately. You didn't need an official announcement or medical confirmation. You could tell from the way the players reacted, the way the broadcast suddenly changed its tone, the way the commentators started speaking more slowly and carefully. It felt like the language people use when they think someone has died.

What was striking to me was how quickly football itself seemed to recede from view. The game stopped mattering almost instantly. Nobody was talking about standings or playoff implications. All of the usual narratives that surround a Monday night game just evaporated. For a brief window, it felt like the entire apparatus around football had been suspended.

There was also this strange liminal period afterward, where nobody quite knew what to say. It suddenly felt inappropriate to even ask the obvious questions about what this meant for the sport. When someone did raise those questions too quickly, the backlash was immediate. It was as if we collectively agreed that there was a moral pause button that had to be respected.

If Hamlin had died, there would have been a reckoning. I don't think there's any way around that.

The harder question is what kind of reckoning it would have been and how long it would have lasted. Football is enormous. It's not just too big to fail; it's almost too big to stop. The entire economic and cultural infrastructure around it is built on the assumption of continuity.

Covid showed us that.

Even in a moment of genuine global crisis, the overriding instinct was to find a way to keep the games going. Empty stadiums, revised schedules, altered protocols, but still football. That doesn't mean people are callous. It means the system is so large and so central that stopping it entirely feels almost unimaginable.

And in Hamlin's case, once it became clear that he was going to survive, and once the injury could be framed as a freak convergence of circumstances rather than a direct extension of the game's usual violence, there was a kind of collective exhale. The moral crisis didn't disappear, but it retreated. Football resumed its normal position in people's lives.

That moment revealed something important. It showed how close the sport always is to forcing a confrontation we'd rather avoid, and how quickly we move past that confrontation when circumstances allow us to. Football constantly brushes up against questions about risk, responsibility, and complicity, but most of the time it gives us just enough distance to keep watching.

So is football a good or bad thing for society? Ultimately you come down at 53 percent good, 47 percent troubling. That feels a little like hedging.

I don't think of that as hedging, even though it probably sounds like it. It's my way of being honest about the fact that once you really start pulling on the threads here, the question of whether football is “good” or “bad” is complicated.

You start asking yourself what it even means for something to be good. Is it good because it's entertaining? Is it good because it creates meaning in people's lives? Is it good because it brings communities together, even if it also causes real harm to a smaller number of people? Those are not easy questions to weigh against each other.

Football clearly does a lot of things that are socially positive. It creates shared rituals. It gives people a sense of belonging. It produces moments of beauty, excellence, and drama that feel meaningful to millions of people. At the same time, it exposes players to physical harm, and it reinforces certain cultural values that don't always sit comfortably with the way we like to think about ourselves now.

So the 53–47 split is really just my way of saying that I think the balance tips slightly in favor of football being socially positive, but only slightly. I wouldn't have written the book if I thought it was overwhelmingly negative. But I also couldn't write it honestly if I pretended the troubling parts were marginal or incidental.

Part of what makes football interesting is that it refuses to resolve itself morally. It doesn't let you land comfortably on one side or the other.

Given the dominance of the sport, and the TV product, it's hard to imagine an America where football isn't king, but you say it's doomed. Do you really believe that?

I understand why that sounds extreme, especially when you look at the current numbers. Football is not declining right now. In the near term, I think it's going to become even more dominant.

But size creates fragility. The bigger something gets, the more it depends on a web of conditions staying intact. Football relies on advertising economics, labor stability, broadcast deals, and cultural goodwill all lining up at once.

Right now, advertising is a huge part of why football works. It's one of the last places where advertisers can reliably reach a massive, captive audience. But that model depends on assumptions about how advertising works that may not hold forever. The costs keep rising, and it's not clear the value is rising at the same rate.

There's also a generational issue. Football's cultural power has always depended on people growing up around the game; playing it, watching it, or at least being adjacent to it. As that lived experience fades, the emotional connection changes. People may still watch, but it won't mean the same thing.

When football eventually recedes, it won't disappear overnight. It'll become something more niche, more historicized. And when that happens, future generations will misunderstand what it meant to the people who lived inside it. They'll moralize it, flatten it, and miss the texture of the experience.

That's part of why I wanted to write the book now. Not because football is about to end, but because this moment — when it still feels unavoidable and central — is the hardest moment to capture later.

A massive winter storm is battering the US, bringing heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain to millions of Americans.

The storm, which has stretched over 2,000 miles from New Mexico to Maine, hit the south-central US on Friday night and is now pummeling the Northeast. At least 18 people have died from weather-related causes, according to the Associated Press.

As snowfall picked up in New York City, Mayor Zohran Mamdani announced schools would operate remotely on Monday due to the weather.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul had previously announced that ""all state employees"" were also authorized to work remotely to start the week.

""I encourage other employers to do the same, just to keep people off the roads and think about this,"" she said.

Here's where else the storm is set to hit.

Heavy snow is continuing to fall across large parts of the northeastern US.

""The storm will produce heavy snow over the Northeast and patches of rain/freezing rain over parts of the Mid-Atlantic. Snow will also develop along the Appalachians on Monday,"" the National Weather Service said in a Monday morning update.

The Great Lakes region is also set for a fresh wave of snow, travelling south from Canada, the NWS said Monday.

As of around 11:30 a.m. ET on Monday, extreme cold weather warnings are in effect for parts of 18 of the contiguous states, including Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri.

In Arkansas, some areas recorded around seven inches of snowfall through Friday night into Saturday.

Much of the Northeast remains under Winter Storm Warnings, including parts of New York, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut.

The agency said power outages, tree damage, and dangerous travel conditions are also likely across parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic due to freezing rain and lingering icing.

Major cities in the weather system's path include Atlanta, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, DC, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston.

Roughly 800,000 customers from New Mexico to Virginia are without power as of late morning on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.

Moving forward, the NWS said heavy snowfall is likely to lead to ""widespread travel disruptions and closures"" that could last several days.

Travel was hit hard this weekend, with airlines canceling thousands of flights across Saturday and Sunday, and cancellations continuing into Monday.

On Monday, over 4,900 flights were canceled as of around 11:30 a.m. ET, with all three New York airports canceling more than 40% of flights. Boston Logan was the worst-affected airport on Monday, canceling 61% of flights.

Monday's disruption followed the worst single day of flight cancellations since the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 11,500 US flights canceled on Sunday, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightAware.

Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Texas and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International were the worst-affected airports on Sunday, per flight-tracking site FlightAware.

Washington DC's Ronald Reagan National Airport said airlines had cancelled all flights on Sunday.

In an update issued at 11 p.m. ET, the airport said that with precipitation ending, flight operations ""should gradually increase beginning on Monday.""

Many airlines are waiving rebooking fees for flights to and from affected regions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I moved to Thailand to recover from burnout. Living here has been harder — and better — than I expected.","https://www.businessinsider.com/moved-to-thailand-recover-from-burnout-loneliness-busy-bangkok-phuket-2026-1","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 00:14:00 GMT","

As a frequent traveler, I fell in love with Thailand's diverse landscapes, rich culture, and — best of all — the food. So when I experienced career burnout in 2024 after five years in Hong Kong and needed a soft landing, Thailand felt like an instant safe haven.

I knew it like the back of my hand (or so I thought), and with the introduction of the digital nomad DTV visa that same year, the leap felt like a no-brainer.

Living here has largely lived up to my expectations. Still, the shift from enthusiastic visitor to long-term resident came with challenges I hadn't anticipated.

I began my new life with a three-month immersion in Bangkok, my favorite city in the world. I wanted a familiar landing pad and the festive energy. I learned that even favorites have their downsides.

The city's relentless buzz — thrilling at first — slowly became overwhelming. The constant motion, traffic, and density fueled my anxiety. In a metropolis so vast, finding genuine silence or peace felt nearly impossible. I often wanted to switch it all off, but Bangkok doesn't come with an off switch.

As a remote freelancer, I had the freedom to chase a different dream by moving to Phuket. For anyone who's ever wondered what it's like to live there, it really does feel like paradise with a permanent holiday vibe. Even so, I realized how little I'd truly known it as a tourist. I keep discovering corners I'd never seen before.

Then high season arrived. My peaceful paradise transformed into an overtourism nightmare, especially in December and January. Secret beaches swarmed with festival-like crowds, and daily routines fell apart. Food deliveries took hours, shops ran out of staples, and transport apps like Grab and Bolt were overwhelmed.

On one recent beach day, I couldn't book a ride home for nearly three hours, leaving me stranded in a roadside meltdown. My Zen mood quickly gave way to frustration.

Ironically, on an island packed with people, making real connections has felt harder than in Bangkok. With tourists constantly coming and going, most interactions are fleeting. Expat communities exist, but they're scattered and often divided by nationality. Even amid the crowds, island life can feel surprisingly lonely.

Then there's the bureaucracy. Thailand operates with a certain fluidity that can be confusing. Laws around visas, business, and property don't change often, but their interpretation can vary wildly between offices, officers, and provinces.

Take the 90-day reporting rule. It requires expats to report to immigration every 90 days, an outdated system that often pushes people to do quick ""visa runs"" instead of spending a full day in line. Many newcomers don't learn about it until they're hit with a hefty fine.

I've since joined expat groups just to keep up with the ever-shifting rules.

Thailand's sex industry is impossible to ignore in heavy tourist zones. Living here, I've had to build a certain emotional distance from it. When I first arrived in Phuket, I stayed in a room next to a tourist who was clearly there for that purpose. For a week straight, I was an unwilling audience to noisy transactions — until I finally complained to management.

And as a foreigner, you're often placed in the ""tourist"" box by default. I thought Tinder might be a way to meet people. Instead, half my matches offered a ""massage"" rather than a conversation.

Thailand is known for its affordability, but a clear divide still exists between local and foreign pricing. You have to stay vigilant to avoid overpaying. The reward comes with time. As I've settled in and become a regular at local markets and shops, I'm now greeted with smiles — and the occasional ""special price.""

That, in the end, is what makes all the headaches fade.

For every moment of frustration, there are many more filled with beauty, incredible food, and genuine kindness. The trade-offs are real, and the challenges come with the territory.

But most days, when I look around at the place I now call home, the struggles feel like a small price to pay for living in a real-life paradise.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Amy Lovett, 54. After being laid off in July, Lovett began her job search with a résumé that included her photo and full work experience. Once she removed her photo, some dates, and shortened her work history, Lovett, who lives in the St. Louis area, said she started getting more attention from employers. The following has been edited for brevity and clarity.

At my last job as an account executive at a software company, we had downsized significantly. I was one of the last senior reps. From what I understand, it was a payroll decision. In July, I was laid off after 20 years.

At first, of course, you're a little panicked, but I wouldn't say I was too crazy. It was also a bit of relief, because there had been so much business change going on that everybody was kind of on edge.

I was in a position to take a step back and really figure out what I wanted to do. I didn't want to take too much time off, but I was able to take enough to be like, ""OK, what do I like about this? What don't I?""

I took probably a couple of weeks. After that, it was full focus on my résumé and talking with former colleagues. September is when I really started hitting the job search hard.

With my résumé, I changed keywords as needed. You've got to make them more specific to the role these days. Otherwise you you won't even get a call. You've definitely got to do more customization than you used to.

I got some responses, but I didn't get any interviews. Originally, I had my photo on my résumé. That résumé also included a lot of dates. I would say I'm a younger-looking 50. I wouldn't say I look like I'm 80 or anything.

I had a career advisor review my résumé. She said, ""Try taking your photo off of there. Remove a lot of the dates."" So I took my past experience, except for the last 20 years, off. For older jobs, I would give a bullet, but it was mainly the last 20 years-plus of my experience.

Once I made those changes, that's when I started getting pinged fairly often. It absolutely felt like night and day. I was having calls with companies two to three times a week.

I felt there was a bigger demand out there than I initially thought, which gave me more confidence — feeling like, ""OK, these companies are pinging me and showing interest.""

I think ageism was a factor, especially with a lot of SaaS companies that have a lot of younger people right out of college.

During my search, I didn't let up. I took it seriously. I was working on résumés and applications every weekday. It's hard to stay positive for that long, doing that day after day. For some reason, I was energized to try something new.

I had a spreadsheet. I had to keep track of everything because there was a lot of information. I didn't want to be out of work for long.

I would tweak my résumé. I would run it through AI. I don't like the AI-generated résumés. You can tell they're AI. The verbiage, a lot of times, doesn't sound like a person. I would never write like that. You've got to think: Does it sound like how you would communicate?

I did lean into AI because it helped me speed up the process, because there's so much involved, and I was really just trying to find something as quickly as possible.

I used AI when I would work on my cover letters. I would take my résumé and compare it to their job requirements, and then shorten it. I think those personalizations were super important.

Going forward, especially in the field that I'm in, you've got to embrace technology.

When I got the job offer, they called me. I missed the call because I wasn't by my phone. I was supposed to have another interview in two days, so I was like, ""This is either good or bad.""

I called back, and they said, ""Oh, we don't need you for that last interview. We'd like to offer you the job.""

The leader of Ukraine's special drone branch said his operators are striking advancing Russian infantry at extreme close range, providing rare insight into how some of the country's best pilots are fighting.

Maj. Robert ""Madyar"" Brovdi, the commander of the Unmanned Systems Forces, wrote in a statement on Sunday that his pilots have, over the last month, been engaging enemy troops at an average strike depth of 1.44 km, or 0.89 miles, from the line of contact.

That's a roughly 15-minute brisk walk for the average person.

""This figure fluctuates, but: We are literally working under our feet,"" Madyar wrote.

His remarks reflect how top Ukrainian commanders in some areas have been prioritizing their limited resources. Using elite strike crews for short-range suppression could also be a sign of heightened pressure on Ukrainian lines.

The Unmanned Systems Forces is a relatively new elite formation in Ukraine that focuses on providing strike or reconnaissance support with smaller drones. Madyar, a prominent drone unit commander appointed to lead the group in June 2025, said on Sunday that his branch comprises 12 combat crews who are present on 30% of the front line.

Russia relies on ground infantry assaults to gradually take territory in Ukraine, and has been aggressively attempting to advance along some key frontline areas in recent months.

Madyar wrote that his units are assigned to corps commanders, who have been deploying the operators to attack such advancing troops at closer range.

""Not a single Corps commander, who has many hundreds of crews from their own brigades and subordinate units within their area of responsibility, is ready to release SBS work to proper depth,"" Madyar wrote, referring to the Unmanned Systems Forces as the SBS.

He added that this was due to Ukrainian commanders wanting to protect their troops in the trenches.

For Ukrainian soldiers, being sent to hold a trench is one of the war's most high-casualty tasks. They're often outnumbered by waves of attacking Russian troops, and typically need the help of friendly drone pilots to thwart assaults before they can get close.

But ideally, these drone operators try to spot and engage enemy infantry farther away, roughly 6 to 10 miles from the line of contact, as these troops form up or begin to launch assaults.

""To systematically reach proper depth, it is necessary to manage to create new crews, at least three times more than the current number,"" Madyar wrote. ""The existing ones, for the most part, will remain in tactical depth.""

Madyar also said infantry strikes have recently accounted for a larger share of his units' time.

According to him, the SBS has a usual goal of targeting infantry in 30% of its strikes, but nearly 40% of its successful attacks in December were against infantry, involving roughly 12,000 Russian soldiers.

Still, the commander wrote that in the SBS' entire history, the majority of its engagements have been against Russian equipment and logistics routes, at ranges of roughly 2.3 miles to 9.2 miles, depending on the type of system targeted.

Madyar's branch has struck over 1,200 ""launch points"" for Russian drone pilots, at an average depth of 2.25 miles, he added.

Elite drone units typically make a name for themselves by using small, inexpensive drones to strike priority air defense systems, logistics routes, or command posts deep behind enemy lines. 

Indeed, Madyar had posted his statement on Sunday in response to what he said were recent criticisms that his units were focusing too much on strikes against Russian soldiers.

Madyar also wrote that not all SBS crews are equally contributing to these strike statistics.

""Only six to seven out of 12 SBS units are working at the desired pace; the others are catching up and need more time,"" his statement said.

Ask this interview question the next time you want a break from practiced answers.

In an episode of the ""Sourcery"" podcast released on Saturday, Snowflake CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy said he doesn't like typical questions, like what candidates did at work. He said interviewees respond with projects and chatbots that made their work more efficient — answers that don't reveal much about the person.

""So all practiced answers, I don't like them,"" he said. ""I'll ask them questions like, 'Tell me how you changed yourself.'""

Prior to becoming Snowflake's CEO in 2024, Ramaswamy was a partner at Greylock Ventures and cofounded AI search startup Neeva, which was acquired by Snowflake.

""To me, the combination of drive and malleability, those are the prized qualities that set the truly amazing people apart from everyone else, especially at a moment like this,"" he said on Saturday's podcast.

As tech execs race to hire top talent that can adapt and thrive with AI, they're getting creative with how they gauge the X-factor in interviews.

In a podcast published last week, Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke said he asks one question to easily identify employees who will adapt quickly and perform well in a crisis.

He said he asks them: ""Have you started a company before?""

He said that it was a way to gauge people with entrepreneurial skills who relate to his challenges as a founder.

Dayforce chief people officer Amy Cappellanti-Wolf told Business Insider that she asks about recent constructive feedback that a candidate is actively working on.

She said she's open to personal or professional responses and looks forward to hearing genuine answers. She said she finds it a ""problem"" if candidates say they don't get feedback or have nothing they're trying to fix.

Business Insider recently launched our Future of Capitalism series to examine shifting attitudes about capitalism, fairness, opportunity, hard work, and success in the US — everything from the federal government's role in the economy to the change in how capitalism is being taught in high schools.

We also wanted to hear directly from you, our readers, about how America's economic system has shaped your life.

Hundreds of you weighed in, and several people agreed to be interviewed to share more deeply their experiences, uncertainty, frustration, and cautious optimism — a revealing snapshot of how capitalism is being reassessed in real time, across generations.

An 81-year-old woman in California living on Social Security described spending her life climbing a hill that keeps getting steeper. A 54-year-old in Las Vegas says he's still waiting for boomers to pass his generation the baton. A 25-year-old from Tennessee who enlisted in the military to pay for college said the system isn't really working, while a 64-year-old New Jersey retiree called capitalism the ""greatest economic system in the world.""

Below, we highlight eight people's personal experiences of capitalism. Their words have been edited for length and clarity.

Alex English, 38, is based in Tampa, FL, and is currently unemployed after being laid off.

I've been unemployed for a year and a half. Before being laid off, I lived in LA and worked in marketing and communications at a startup. I was making almost $125,000 and still felt poor.

Capitalism makes us think we constantly need more: to shop more, to accumulate more, to keep up. I'm back in Tampa, where I grew up, because I didn't have the savings to sustain my life in LA.

I don't feel great about my ability to improve my situation through hard work alone. I've relentlessly networked to find a full-time job, taken on freelance work, and gotten a retail job. I'm working harder than I ever have and yet making significantly less money than before.

We're inheriting a system that feels ultimately outdated. Everything from private property and ownership to the climate crisis feels unsustainable. We're paying into Social Security, and that may not be there for us when we're retirement age.

Since my layoff, I've been reading a lot about economics and business. Is there another way that we could be doing things? My generation — millennials — is in favor of something kinder and more egalitarian than the policies we've seen since the Reagan era. Not because we're lazy or unwilling to work hard, but because we believe all people deserve basic rights and dignity, and that American exceptionalism is dead in the world.

Harish Bhandari, 64, Cape May, New Jersey. He retired from his job in the advertising industry at 59.

I'm happily retired. I spent my entire career in advertising and marketing — worked on Madison Avenue, then spent 23 or 24 years at an agency in Minneapolis, and 15 years at my last company.

Capitalism is the greatest economic system in the world. As long as you're willing to work hard over a long period of time, you're going to be rewarded, and success should follow.

I didn't grow up wealthy. I lived in Darien, Connecticut. My father was from India, and my mom was German. She grew up during the war and didn't go to college. My father passed away when I was 13. I'm not going to say we were poor, but we weren't wealthy. I'm thankful I've worked hard my whole life and made some good moves.

The obvious legacy my generation is leaving is that we're able to pass generational wealth to our kids. I'm an early baby boomer. Boomers get a hard time as far as having been lucky, but I think we've also worked very hard. Sometimes you create your own luck that way. We didn't have social media and cellphones, so we didn't have a lot of things bombarding us that would distract us from what we believed was important.

I currently have a very high level of trust in our economic institutions because it's about the free market. As long as the institutions provide security and stability, the market has always worked as far as this country has been around. When you try to start messing with that market, that's the problem.

Matthew Doutt, 25, Knoxville, Tennessee. He's an accountant.

In my senior year of high school, a military recruiter sat down with me and explained the average in-state college tuition. I didn't see any options to earn my degree that didn't involve the military or going into debt.

I knew college was expensive, and my parents were kind of pushing me toward the military for that reason. Once I enlisted, I realized many other people there were in the same boat, or very similar boats, as I was. I'm grateful for the benefits from the military, but my mental health was at an all-time low during my time in the Guard. It's a travesty that any American would need to sign a contract that could result in their death to pay for a degree without going into debt.

Even after I finished my bachelor's degree in 2022, the firm I started working at wasn't a good fit, so I left. I couldn't find work for four months. I was completely reliant on the Guard again, this time to pay my bills. That was another moment when I realized this system really isn't working as intended.

I now hold both my bachelor's and master's degrees, as well as a CPA license. I worked hard for them, but I wouldn't have been able to earn my bachelor's degree without the Guard, and I wouldn't have been able to get my CPA license without my firm paying for it.

I believe my generation has inherited difficult circumstances. Corporations are more concentrated, and the US DOJ has been less empowered than ever to break up monopolies.

I want to trust these major institutions and systems because they don't improve if you don't believe in them. At the same time, if what they're doing isn't good to begin with, it's kind of hard to trust them.

Jeremy Holmes, 40, lives in Denver. He is a senior developer in the furniture import industry.

My dad is what I'd call a bad capitalist, because he takes care of his employees. He owns an IT firm, and I worked for him until I was in my early 30s. He was a firm believer that hard work will get you far in life. And it did; he was a kid of immigrants, and he clawed his way out. My mom is Lakota, grew up on various reservations, and got out.

This story is part of Business Insider's series ""The Future of Capitalism,"" which looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth.

My parents have a very nice upper-middle-class life. They're not yacht-money people. My dad went from working as a 12 or 14-year-old in a print shop and has always had that ""work hard and you will be rewarded"" mentality. I was raised with that. Then I entered the workforce and started looking around. The hard workers aren't the ones who are getting paid the most.

I feel the people working in the factory are working much harder than the people on the other side of the office. I'm fortunate enough to be on that other side because I got a leg up from my parents. I don't see a way for people to claw their way into a comfortable living if they weren't born into it.

My main concern is being a programmer in the AI era. I've been doing this for most of my life. I can stay above it, but I'm more worried than I was before. I don't see how anyone can bring a child into this world and not be terrified for them. I have plenty of friends who are not doing as well, and I used to tell them to get into IT; I can't even tell them that anymore.

Jenni Abbott,71, lives in Antioch, IL. She works as a principal scientist.

I don't believe that hard work alone plays any significant role in an outcome. Not working hard can cost you your job. Working hard does not guarantee any sort of success.

I left the industry for about 20 years to be a stay-at-home mom of four kids. When I was 42, my husband died suddenly. I went into education. I was first a kindergarten aide for three years, and then a high school registrar for six. I was lucky enough to get a job as an associate toxicologist. We were literally running out of money at that point.

I've now been with the same company for over 20 years. While I'm not completely satisfied with how I was rewarded in my career, I also understand that I am doing better than a great number of people out there, and I'm relatively financially secure. One of the reasons I'm still working is that I don't want to be that poor.

I'm all for a mixed system. I believe capitalism is a good start, but I don't believe it's a good ending place. I believe that additional resources need to be there for it to be successful, and there needs to be support in place so everybody has the same chances at upward mobility.

I don't think we baby boomers lived up to our potential for what we should've left behind for the next generation. Social safety nets are important for a lot of people, and we could have done a much better job of preparing our country for that.

Kathy Curtis, 81, lives in California. She works part-time in customer service and data entry for a local water company.

I started out like everybody else with the expectation that you grow up, get married, have children, and live happily ever after, which is what we were taught. That didn't happen for me because within a year of following the plan, all of a sudden, I was a single parent. At one point, I was working four jobs.

I didn't have the strength to branch out into other fields of study or work to try to get ahead because I was so busy trying to just maintain everything. From my 20s to my 40s, I felt I could keep climbing up the hill. I think after my 40s, in general, that hill got steeper, and not as many people were able to climb it.

I'll struggle for the rest of my life. My main income at this point is Social Security, and I still work two days a week, earning $18 an hour in a customer service and data entry role for a local water company. I've learned how to not look like a poor person when I am one, and not live like one. So much of life is attitude.

Kirk Reynolds, 54, lives in Las Vegas. He is an architect.

I entered the workforce in 1997 and have spent the last 28 years working as an architect. I worry a lot about the future liquidity of Social Security because if we don't have Social Security in 10 years' time, I don't know what I'll do.

I'm fortunate to now own my home outright, but it took a lot of sacrifice over the years to get there. I didn't travel or spend a lot of extra money; it was a deliberate and challenging choice. However, wages have somewhat stalled out. I earn more now than I did when I started in the workforce, but after 28 years, I don't earn much more. I was around 28 when I started my 401(k), and I have less than $100,000 in it 20-some years later. I'll be lucky if there's $115,000 in there when I retire.

I think part of the problem is the boomer generation; they're among the oldest people in our society now, and a lot of them just haven't left the CEO roles, the managerial roles. I'm not sure if that's purely because they can't afford to retire, or if there's also an element of ego involved, but I'm 54, and I'm still waiting for them to finally pass the baton to the next generation.

I'm worried that my generation will be skipped because all of a sudden, when the leaders in their 70s and 80s finally retire, they'll give the roles to the 40-year-olds.

It's sad because I think Gen X would do a very good job of leading. We are the bridge generation, born at a time when we can recall how things were in the 1970s, and how things are now.

Gabrielle Benson, 29, lives in Chicago. She works in inclusion and experience at a tech company.

I'm on the cusp of millennial and Gen Z. There was so much transition, development, and growth that we came up through. Some people in my generation think capitalism is great and were able to benefit from that change, but a lot of us recognize its more negative impact.

We're coming from a background in the post-recession, post-Obama, post-social media era. We don't see the American dream as a gilded promise the way previous generations did.

I grew up Black and middle-class in Washington, DC. But I went to a private boarding school for high school, so I've had proximity to a lot of wealth. The experience of being at this school and then going home to my mom, who worked two jobs, compared to the other parents, who worked just as hard, but had institutional knowledge or advantages that we didn't, started opening my eyes. Hard work is not valued equally under this system.

Inequity is not a side effect of capitalism; it is a condition required for it to function. Instead of family stories about hard work granting stability or prosperity, we have stories about hard work being stolen or dismissed by the systems meant to reward it.

There are so many factors outside an average person's control that can determine their success: the job market, housing market, healthcare, race, sex, and gender. I have a corporate job, a degree, and retirement accounts, and it still feels like it can all be taken away by factors outside my control.

I think we have a lot of opportunities as millennials. We're still young; we can still make a lot of change, but I think it will require a lot of unlearning the knowledge we were passed down, like the idea that you just have to work hard.

I don't think that we're going to have a different system in our lifetime. Maybe that's something our grandkids might be able to experience. We're going to have to navigate and manage capitalism.Share your thoughts about capitalism in America by filling out our survey.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I've traveled to incredible destinations across 44 countries, but just one island in Southeast Asia has stolen my heart","https://www.businessinsider.com/bali-indonesia-favorite-place-to-visit-frequent-traveler-2026-1","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:23:00 GMT","

As an American who's traveled to 44 countries over the last 30 years, I've seen my fair share of unforgettable places. 

But if I had to choose one place to visit again and again, it would be Bali, an island and province in Indonesia that combines vibrant culture, natural beauty, and a pace of life that feels both energizing and restorative.

After spending a month on the island in 2023, I fell in love. Here's what made my trip to Bali so special.

One of my favorite meals during my time in Bali came from a street vendor. The Javanese meal, called Tahu Tek, featured fried tofu, bean sprouts, a thick peanut sauce, and a pile of crackers on top. It cost me less than $2 (USD), but it was packed with flavor.

Bali's food scene goes far beyond street food, though. Even dining at restaurants felt affordable, making it easy to try local specialties, including babi guling, a traditional whole roasted pig.

Plus, I could easily find international cuisine alongside local dishes.

I often went to Milk & Madu, which served American-style food like pizza and burgers. I also loved spending mornings at cafés in Canggu, sipping smoothies and enjoying breakfast bowls.

One of the main things that makes Bali truly special is its people. I've been to many destinations where the locals aren't always open to expats and travelers. But here, everyone I met was warm, welcoming, and genuinely kind.

For example, I used an app called Grab, similar to Uber, where drivers can pick up passengers on their motorbikes or in their cars.

I was wary about riding on the back of a stranger's bike, but the friendly drivers I had across several rides quickly made me feel at ease. Some would even check in with me during the ride to make sure everything was OK or to ask if I needed them to slow down.

Plus, I found an amazing community of digital nomads, creatives, and expats who decided to trade their office jobs for laptops in cafés. As an American living abroad, this made me feel at home.

It gave me a sense of familiarity in a new environment and made it easier to connect, since there was no language barrier. I felt more comfortable starting conversations and sharing experiences with other expats and long-term travelers.

During my time in Uluwatu, I met another nomad, and a simple conversation turned into spending the next few days together exploring. These kinds of moments felt much more natural and common in Bali than in other places I've visited, and I felt a strong sense of openness and connection.

Another thing I loved about Bali was the diverse range of activities available. Whether I was in the mood to visit temples or relax on the beach, there was always something to do.

For example, in Ubud, I wandered through the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, where ancient temples sit under jungle canopies. There were signs everywhere warning visitors to hold onto their belongings, and for good reason. The sanctuary is home to over 1,260 monkeys, who I saw climbing railings and jumping between statues.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, I also visited Alas Harum, a tourism destination in Tegallalang with lots of opportunities for adventure. Here, I flew out on a giant swing that went over rice fields. Taking in the view from way above the terraces was equal parts terrifying and fun.

And when I wanted to relax, I visited the beach clubs, where I lounged by the water with music playing and a drink in my hand.

After traveling to 44 countries, I can confidently say I'm no stranger to exploring new places.

Every destination I've visited has shown me new ways of living, but in Bali, I experienced a way of life that felt joyful, balanced, and connected. Plus, the tropical, warm, and consistent weather didn't hurt either.

Between the amazing food, the warm people, and the sense of adventure, I'm already dreaming of my next trip to this beautiful island.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","'Absolutely shameful': Business and tech leaders react to the latest fatal ICE shooting","https://www.businessinsider.com/ice-shooting-minneapolis-alex-pretti-business-tech-leaders-react-2026-1","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:17:00 GMT","

After a second fatality in confrontations with immigration officers in Minnesota on Saturday, business leaders took to social media to have their say.

Microsoft's chief scientific officer posted a screenshot of a statement from Alex Pretti's parents with the caption ""Anguish and pursuit of truth"" on X on Sunday.

Horvitz also wrote on X, ""Values, service, and character,"" in response to a video posted by CBS News of Pretti reading a final salute to a veteran.

Former Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun replied ""Murderers"" to footage of the shooting circulating on Saturday. He has since reposted anti-ICE tweets and pushed back against users who criticize his stance.

LeCun has regularly shared posts critical of the Trump administration on social media.

Paul Graham, cofounder of startup accelerator Y Combinator, wrote in a post on X on Saturday: ""If someone had predicted before the last election that if Trump won, federal officers would be shooting Americans in the streets, he'd have been dismissed as an alarmist.""

Anthropic cofounder Chris Olah wrote on X that he typically doesn't comment on politics, but recent events ""shock the conscience.""

""My deep loyalty is to the principles of classical liberal democracy: freedom of speech, the rule of law, the dignity of the human person. I immigrated to the United States — and eventually cofounded Anthropic here — believing it was a pillar of these principles,"" he wrote, adding: ""I feel very sad today.""

The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce distributed a letter on Sunday signed by more than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies, including professional sports teams.

Among the signatories were Target CEO Michael Fiddelke, 3M CEO William Brown, Allianz Life Insurance Company CEO Jasmine Jirele, Cargill CEO Brian Sikes, General Mills CEO Jeff Harmening, and UnitedHealth Group CEO Stephen Hemsley, among many others.

The letter called for an ""immediate de-escalation of tensions"" and for state, local, and federal officials to ""work together to find real solutions.""

""In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state, and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future,"" the letter says.

The shooting divided leaders even within the same VC firm. Khosla Ventures' Keith Rabois posted on X ""no law enforcement has shot an innocent person. illegals are committing violent crimes everyday."" Rabois is a self-proclaimed contrarian whose political opinions have courted controversy in recent years.

Two colleagues — Ethan Choi and Vinod Khosla — disagreed with Rabois on X. Khosla described the video of Pretti's death as ""macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration.""

Choi said Rabois' post did not represent the VC firm's view. ""What happened in Minnesota is plain wrong. Don't know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person's life taken unnecessarily,"" Choi wrote.

The hedge-fund billionaire, who supported Trump in the 2024 election, called for calm in an X post on Saturday. Ackman said that the United States had reached a point where ""there are only two sides to every issue and every incident.""

""Individuals are 'convicted' of serious crimes in the headlines, by politicians appealing to their base, and ultimately in the minds of the public, or they are exonerated, before all of the facts are in and a detailed investigation has been completed,"" he wrote. ""This is not good for America.""

Two hours later, in another post on X, Ackman laid the blame on Minnesota's governor, Tim Walz.

""It is almost as if the governor of Minnesota called for protesters to intervene in ICE enforcements in an incendiary manner,"" he said, tagging Walz. ""Inciting the people to rise up against law enforcement is guaranteed to end badly, and now we have seen the tragic consequences.""

Ackman later donated $10,000 to a GoFundMe set up for Pretti's family after being asked to do so in a post on X by Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.

Ackman wrote in a reply on X: ""Done. That said, I don't agree with the gofundme that he is an American hero, but his loss is tragic for him and his family.""

Like Ackman, billionaire LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman is perpetually online, posting frequently on social media. The Democratic donor has been largely quiet this weekend, though he has reposted comments from other people, including one that called ICE ""out of control.""

In another post that Hoffman amplified, an X user called out ""chronically online tech leaders"" for suddenly falling quiet. Another X user called on business and tech leaders to use their platform to stand up to the Trump administration and its immigration enforcement tactics, to which Hoffman replied, ""It's time for all Americans to do so.""

James Dyett, the head of global business at OpenAI, called on leaders in the tech and business communities to use their influence to criticize the Trump administration's immigration policies.

""There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets,"" Dyer wrote on X. ""Tells you what you need to know about the values of our industry.""

Jeff Dean, Google DeepMind's chief scientist, wrote in response to a video of the shooting circulating on X: ""This is absolutely shameful.""

""Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera,"" he wrote. ""Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this.""

Minneapolis police confirmed that Alex Pretti, who was filming federal agents when they wrestled him to the ground, was legally carrying a gun.

Border Patrol officials said Pretti had threatened them with the gun, but multiple videos of the incident show that agents had already disarmed and subdued Pretti when he was shot.

Jason Calacanis, a prominent investor and entrepreneur who is these days perhaps most known as one of the hosts of the popular ""All-In"" podcast, blamed the country's political leaders in a post on X on Sunday.

""Once again, I will remind everyone that our leaders are failing us,"" he wrote. ""True leadership would be to calm this situation down by telling these non-peaceful protesters to stay home while recalling these inadequately-trained agents.""

He later posted that ""all of this violence"" could be avoided by fining businesses that hire immigrants who are not in the country legally.

Cristina Cordova, the chief operating officer at Linear, a product management software company, called the incident ""indefensible"" in a post on X.

""The victim's legally owned handgun was removed from the scene, and then ICE agents shot him multiple times. It's far from law enforcement — it's just murder,"" she wrote.

""Those who defend this don't care about law or order. It's about money, power, and protecting an executive branch that's already been bought and paid for.""

David Marcus, cofounder and CEO of crypto payments company Lightspark, wrote on X in response to the incident: ""The number of people who can hold two thoughts at the same time is dwindling at a dangerous rate.""

""It's not because these anti-ICE protests are mostly inorganic and designed to generate this chaos, or that protesters show up with loaded guns that you can't also be totally appalled by citizens being shot dead on our streets,"" added Marcus, who is also a former president of PayPal.

""Let's just remember we're all Americans for a second.""

Kath Korevec, the director of product at Google Labs, has called on X users to support their local immigration organizations.

""I can't go to Minneapolis. And it's only a matter of time before they show up in force here in the Bay Area. So here's what I'm doing to help my neighbors prepare,"" Korevec wrote in a post on X on Sunday.

She said in the post that she is researching, donating, and offering help to organizations that support immigrants.

Korevec said that she is calling her ""congressmen and women and asking them not to approve ICE funding without major reform to how the organization is run.""

""And I'm paying attention. Not looking away, even when it's hard,"" she added. ""If you're able to do any of this where you live, now is the time.""

Josh Miller, the cofounder and CEO of The Browser Company, wrote on X that he has been hesitant to speak on politics — but that this moment was no longer political.

""It is about something more fundamental,"" he wrote. ""It is about what America stands for. Call it morals, call it decency, whatever word resonates most with you.""

Miller wrote that the government ""executed a man,"" and that he was ""deeply sad for his parents.""

Before The Browser Company, Miller sold his startup, Branch, to Facebook. He then left Facebook for the federal government, becoming the White House's first director of product under former President Barack Obama.

Google DeepMind's Dean thanked Miller for speaking up. Miller responded: ""10 shots in the back of an American citizen who worked as an ICU nurse at the veterans hospital in town. While they knew they were being filmed in broad daylight. And our Secretary of War cheers them on from Twitter. Something is not right.""

OpenAI's robotics head, Caitlin Kalinowski, responded on X, citing the Constitution.

1st Amendment — freedom of speech, assembly, and protest2nd Amendment — right to bear arms4th Amendment — protection against unreasonable searches and seizures5th Amendment — due process of law14th Amendment — equal protection under the law

The OpenAI staffer referenced the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th amendments, which include the right to protest and assembly, the right to bear arms, and the right to due process under the law.

Before working at OpenAI, Kalinowski was Meta's head of AR Glasses Hardware.

Anna Kendrick, 40, says watching her friends go to college made her second-guess her decision to pursue acting.

""I was really, really jealous of all my friends that were going to college. Number one, because I felt really insecure about not going to college. I have a whole, you know, complex about it,"" Kendrick said on Friday's episode of ""Call Her Daddy.""

Seeing her friends quickly build community through classes and sororities made her feel even more unsure as she tried to find her footing in Los Angeles.

""I was 17 or 18. It's really hard to make friends in LA because of, like, the way the city is laid out, but especially when you don't have a fake ID. Even if I did, I looked about 12, so that wasn't going to work anyway,"" Kendrick said. ""And I was just like absolutely terrified and really wondering if I was like, making a huge mistake.""

Her perspective began to change when her friends hit sophomore year and had to start figuring out their future paths.

""Even though the thing that I wanted felt like a total pipe dream, and like, 'What am I doing? This is a disaster. It's so hard to carve out a space for yourself in this industry,'"" Kendrick said.

""But on the other side of it, holy shit, I did not think like, what a blessing to just know what I want. I was like watching all my friends go, 'Oh my god, I don't know what I want, what to do,'"" she continued.

The ""Pitch Perfect"" star said her decision not to go to college felt especially difficult because it went against the path her family valued.

""I was like the first person to not go to college. And my dad was a teacher and everything, so it was like very black sheep behavior to not go to college,"" Kendrick said.

She added her parents weren't thrilled with her decision, but accepted that she was going to do what she wanted. At the same time, her parents saw college as something she could revisit if acting didn't work out.

""I think there was always that sense of like, well, if things maybe don't work out that first year, it's not too late to just, you know, so I think that was always like something that they had in mind,"" Kendrick said.

It also didn't help that questions about college kept coming up when she was in her early 20s, before her acting career had fully taken off.

""Like, oh my god, I have to say I didn't. And at that point, you know, like 21, 22, I didn't really have much to show for it yet,"" Kendrick said.

Kendrick isn't the only Hollywood celebrity who has spoken about not going to college.

""Harry Potter"" star Daniel Radcliffe told E! News in 2013 that he skipped college because he ""already knew"" what he wanted to do.

""I think a large part of why people go to college is to figure out what they want to do,"" he said. ""I very much knew what I wanted to do, so I kind of just figured I'd keep carrying on trying to do that.""

In 2024, Julia Roberts told British Vogue that she regrets not going to university.

""It wasn't in my cards,"" Roberts said, adding that her family didn't have the money and she ""had no scholarship potential.""

Gold has smashed past $5,000 per ounce — mere months after topping $4,000 — in a record-setting rally that analysts say reflects growing fears over high government debt.

""The rise in precious metals prices is breathtaking and profoundly scary,"" wrote Robin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, in a Substack post on Sunday.

Spot gold rushed above a record high around $5,093 per troy ounce late on Sunday before pulling back to $5,070 per ounce at 12:03 a.m. ET on Monday.

The yellow metal's record-setting blitz has little to do with central bank gold buying. International Monetary Fund data show that emerging-market central bank purchases of gold have been steady rather than explosive, with no acceleration following the wave of sanctions imposed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, wrote Brooks.

Instead, gold's rally coincides with growing pressure on government bond markets in high-debt countries. Investors are piling into hard assets in the so-called ""debasement trade,"" driven by fears that heavy government borrowing will steadily erode the value of money.

""We're at the start of a global debt crisis, with markets increasingly fearful governments will attempt to inflate away out-of-control debt,"" wrote Brooks, who is also a former chief FX strategist at Goldman Sachs.

He pointed to strains in heavily indebted countries such as Japan, alongside a flight to safety into low-debt countries such as Switzerland, Norway, and Sweden.

One striking feature of the move is that it's breaking long-standing market relationships. Historically, gold prices tend to fall when real interest rates rise, since gold is a non-yielding asset and holding it carries an opportunity cost in a high-rate environment.

That link has now broken down ""in spectacular fashion,"" Brooks said, as fears about fiscal sustainability overwhelm traditional valuation signals.

A weakening greenback could further fuel the move, as it makes it cheaper for non-dollar buyers to pile into dollar-denominated gold, he added.

The US Dollar Index is down 1.3% so far this year after holding broadly steady in the second half of 2025.

Broader geopolitical concerns during President Donald Trump's second term are also boosting both the precious and base metals complex, according to veteran market strategist Ed Yardeni.

Defense companies are ramping up production, boosting demand for metals, while an intensifying AI arms race is fueling capital spending across technology and infrastructure.

He pointed to the US fiscal outlook after President Donald Trump proposed boosting military spending to $1.5 trillion by 2027, up sharply from current levels.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has warned that the plan could add nearly $6 trillion to the national debt over the next decade — a concern that has coincided with rising Treasury yields.

""We are on alert for an attack on the US by the Bond Vigilantes,"" Yardeni wrote on Sunday, referring to investors demanding higher yields as government spending and debt climb.

Despite gold's dramatic run, Yardeni says the rally isn't over. He is targeting gold at $6,000 by the end of this year — and $10,000 by the end of 2029.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","I'm a seasoned cruiser, but I still booked the wrong room for my family of 4 on a recent sailing","https://www.businessinsider.com/bad-room-cruise-booking-mistake-princess-family-vacation-frequent-traveler-2026-1","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:49:00 GMT","

As our family's primary vacation planner, I've found we get the most mileage out of cruises. The ""most things included"" pricing is easy on our budget, and we like the wide range of activities and dining options.

My kids are in high school, and we've been cruising together since they were in first grade. Still, I managed to make a rookie mistake with our most recent seven-night Western Caribbean Princess cruise.

I had booked it while on a Princess Alaskan cruise with my husband and got a great rate. However, I had a moment of panic when we boarded the Regal Princess weeks later and got a first look at our stateroom.

Although I'd selected a ""cabin that sleeps four,"" I only saw two twin beds.

Despite the initial shock, we quickly realized our 222-square-foot cabin could indeed sleep four people. Our steward told us there were two additional beds stored in the ceiling that he would pull out every evening.

We asked if the two twin beds on the ground could be converted into a queen for my husband and me, and were told they could, but there would be no place to put the ladder for the upper bunks.

So, we left the arrangement as it was.

On the bright side, we had sufficient sleeping space, and my kids didn't have to share a bed. Our steward set up the beds each evening while we were at dinner and put them up again after breakfast.

Despite being small, the beds were comfortable, and we all got decent sleep.

The biggest issue was that there was no room to sit up and read or watch TV in bed — the upper bunk was that close to the ceiling. The ladders also made moving around the cabin a game of Tetris, especially at night.

Casualties included one head bump (me, the first night) and one kid stepping on my legs when he skipped the ladder. After that, we adjusted.

On the bright side, having a small balcony (albeit one with an obstructed view of the ocean) meant we had easy access to natural light, fresh air, and a bit of extra space, which made a difference.

In the end, we got a good enough discount on the room that I didn't mind a little extra inconvenience.

Though I would've liked a bigger bed and more room, our small stateroom didn't stop us from enjoying the cruise. We were only in the room to sleep and shower, and after a day or two, the bunks didn't feel like a big deal.

This was the first time my kids had sailed on Princess, and our postcard-sized digs didn't affect how we felt about the cruise overall.

We'd 1000% do this cruise with teenagers again — just not in this stateroom.

Looking back, I can see what led me to choose the wrong cabin for our family.

While booking with a sales rep on a previous cruise, I got caught up in the moment and the good deal. I didn't think to ask detailed questions, like the specifics of the bed arrangements.

My biggest mistake was assuming. On cruises I've been on with Disney and Carnival, cabins that sleep four are configured differently, with a queen bed and a couch that converts into bunks across the room.

I should've asked more questions and watched fellow cruisers' cabin tour videos online before booking anything. Had I done that, I likely would've chosen a different cabin or adjusted my reservation before our departure.

By the time we'd boarded, our cruise was full, and even if a larger cabin had been available, it would've cost more.

Next time, I'd be more prepared, or just book my cruise at home, where it'd be easier to review the details on my own.

A travel advisor familiar with cruising could also have steered us toward a better option for a family of four with teens. Though I recommend them to first-timers, I don't usually use one for cruises.

At the end of the day, even though I should have known better, I couldn't help but laugh at myself.

Business Insider Edition 

Kenya plans to borrow 125 billion shillings ($969 million) in short-term syndicated loans this year to fund ongoing road construction, with plans to refinance the debt later through longer-term bonds backed by a 25 shillings-per-litre fuel levy.


        Kenya plans to borrow 125 billion shillings ($969 million) in short-term syndicated loans this year to fund ongoing road construction, with plans to refinance the debt later through longer-term bonds backed by a 25 shillings-per-litre fuel levy. 
    


        This move will bring the total funds raised by securitising future fuel levy flows to 300 billion shillings, according to Bloomberg.
    


        Last year, Kenya raised 175 billion shillings in syndicated loans, which were used primarily to settle outstanding payments to road contractors. According to Martin Agumbi, acting director-general of the Kenya Roads Board, the new loans will support ongoing projects.
    


“These funds will be used to support ongoing works given that we have already settled pending bills and told contractors to restart works,” Agumbi said in an interview.

        Kenya will receive 60 billion shillings in bridge financing during the first half of the year, with the remainder arriving in the new fiscal year starting in July. The loans will be evenly split between local currency and dollars.
    


        Facing limited fiscal space after anti-government protests in June 2024, the government under President William Ruto has increasingly turned to alternative financing, including privatisation and securitisation of the fuel levy, to fund infrastructure. Outstanding road projects are estimated at 890 billion shillings, far exceeding the annual roads budget of 55 billion shillings.
    


        Under the plan, the new syndicated loans will be repaid by securitising five shillings per litre of the fuel levy. By law, Kenya can only securitise half of the 25 shillings-per-litre gasoline and diesel tax.

In this article

Michael Burry, the investor made famous by his bet against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis, disclosed that he has been buying shares of one-time meme darling GameStop.

""I own GME. I have been buying recently. I expect I am buying at what may soon be 1x tangible book value / 1x net asset value,"" Burry said in a Substack post published Monday. ""And getting a young [GameStop CEO] Ryan Cohen investing and deploying the company's capital and cash flows. Perhaps for the next 50 years.""

Shares of GameStop surged nearly 8% Monday following the news.

Burry, who recently closed his hedge fund Scion Asset Management, said his investment is a long-term value play rather than a wager on renewed meme-stock speculation. GameStop was at the center of a meme-stock frenzy that erupted roughly five years ago, when retail traders coordinating on online forums drove the shares to extraordinary heights and forced massive short-covering by hedge funds.

""I am not counting on a short squeeze to realize long-term value,"" he wrote. ""I believe in Ryan, I like the setup, the governance, the strategy as I see it. I am willing to hold long-term, and I am excited to see where this goes. I am fifteen years his senior, but not too old to be patient.""

The stock has since given back most of those gains as trading activity normalized and speculative interest waned. It last traded around $25 apiece.

Still, GameStop has taken advantage of periods of elevated investor interest to raise billions of dollars through equity offerings, leaving it with a substantial cash pile.  

""Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons,"" Burry wrote. ""He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.""

The video game retailer began buying bitcoin last year in a similar move made famous by MicroStrategy. Cohen said at the time that the decision to buy bitcoin is driven by macro concerns as the digital coin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, could serve as protection against certain risks.

""I do not know about this Bitcoin thing, but I cannot argue with what has been done so far,"" Burry said.

Burry isn't the only notable investor betting on the company as of late. Just last week, Cohen snapped up 1 million shares of GameStop, according to disclosures filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a Jan. 21 SEC filing, he noted that it's ""essential"" for the CEO of a public company to buy shares with his or her own personal funds ""in order to further strengthen alignment with stockholders.""

In this article

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said he had canceled all Treasury Department contracts with the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, one of whose employees leaked the tax records of President Donald Trump, and the billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, to media outlets.

Booz Allen Hamilton's stock price dropped by more than 10% on the heels of the Treasury Department's announcement.

The department said it currently has 31 separate contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, totaling $4.8 million in annual spending and $21 million in total obligations.

""President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans' trust in government,"" Bessent said in a statement.

""Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service,"" he said.

The department noted that between 2018 and 2020, Booz Allen employee Charles Edward Littlejohn ""stole and leaked the confidential tax returns and return information of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers.""

The data breach affected about 406,000 taxpayers, according to the IRS.

Littlejohn, 40, pleaded guilty in October 2023 to one count of disclosure of tax return information.

He admitted leaking Trump's tax records to The New York Times. He also admitted to leaking records about wealthy individuals to the news outlet ProPublica.

He was sentenced to the maximum term of five years in prison in January 2024.

CNBC has requested comment from Booz Allen.

In this article

Microsoft announced the next generation of its artificial intelligence chip, a potential alternative to leading processors from Nvidia and to offerings from cloud rivals Amazon and Google.

The Maia 200 comes two years after Microsoft said it had developed its first AI chip, the Maia 100, which was never made available for cloud clients to rent. Scott Guthrie, Microsoft's executive vice president for cloud and AI, said in a blog post Monday that, for the new chip, there will be ""wider customer availability in the future."" 

Guthrie called the Maia 200 ""the most efficient inference system Microsoft has ever deployed."" Developers, academics, AI labs and people contributing to open-source AI models can apply for a preview of a software development kit.

Microsoft said its superintelligence team, led by Mustafa Suleyman, will use the new chip. The Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on for commercial productivity software bundles and the Microsoft Foundry service, for building on top of AI models, will use it as well.

Cloud providers face surging demand from generative AI model developers such as Anthropic and OpenAI and from companies building AI agents and other products on top of the popular models. Data center operators and infrastructure providers are trying to increase their computing prowess while keeping power consumption in check. 

Microsoft is outfitting its U.S. Central region of data centers with Maia 200 chips, and they'll arrive at the U.S. West 3 region after that, with additional locations to follow. 

The chips use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s 3 nanometer process. Four are connected together inside each server. They rely on Ethernet cables, rather than the InfiniBand standard. Nvidia sells InfiniBand switches following its 2020 Mellanox acquisition.

The chip offers 30% higher performance than alternatives for the same price, Guthrie wrote. Microsoft said each Maia 200 packs more high-bandwidth memory than a third-generation Trainium AI chip from Amazon Web Services or from Google's seventh-generation tensor processing unit.

Microsoft can achieve high performance by wiring up to 6,144 of the Maia 200 chips together, reducing energy usage and total cost of ownership, Guthrie wrote.

In 2023, Microsoft demonstrated that its GitHub Copilot coding assistant could run on Maia 100 processors.

In this article

Shares of CoreWeave popped 12% on Monday after Nvidia announced it has invested $2 billion in the artificial intelligence infrastructure provider.

Nvidia purchased CoreWeave Class A common stock at $87.20 per share, according to a release, a discount from Friday's closing price of $92.98. The investment will help CoreWeave accelerate its buildout of ""5 gigawatts of AI factories by 2030,"" the companies said. 

""This deal allows us to accelerate our build, which will lead to continued diversification and reducing dependency on any particular client as we scale into this additional data center capacity,"" CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Monday.

A gigawatt is a measure of power that's becoming an increasingly common metric for describing AI data center capacity. Five gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 4 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration.

""The thing to remember is we've invested $2 billion into CoreWeave, but recognize that the amount of funding that needs to be raised yet to support that five gigawatts is really quite significant,"" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC during the interview. ""We're investing a small percentage of the amount that ultimately has to go and be provided.""

CoreWeave primarily generates revenue by building and renting out data centers that are full of Nvidia's graphics processing units, which are key for training models and running large AI workloads. The company, which some investors have classified as a ""neocloud,"" has become a crucial player in an increasingly interconnected web of AI infrastructure partners.

Prior to Monday's announcement, Nvidia was already a major CoreWeave backer. 

In September, CoreWeave disclosed an order worth at least $6.3 billion from Nvidia in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Nvidia has an obligation to buy the ""residual unsold capacity through April 2032, according to the agreement. 

CoreWeave went public on the Nasdaq in March, and the company raised billions of dollars in debt and equity, including from Nvidia.

""We're in the beginning of the AI infrastructure build-out, and the demand is just extraordinary,"" Huang said on Monday.

As AI startups race to build out their computing infrastructure, CoreWeave has been on a deal-making blitz. The company announced in September that it agreed to provide Meta with $14.2 billion of AI cloud infrastructure, just days after expanding its contract with OpenAI to $22.4 billion.

But CoreWeave's stock has been shaky in recent months as some investors worry that the company is taking on high levels of debt to finance those multibillion-dollar deals. 

Intrator told CNBC earlier this month that AI will eventually be embedded into ""absolutely everything we do"" and that the technology will ""continue to pay dividends over the next 100 years."" 

""What you're seeing is the base-load infrastructure being built right now at what has historically been a pace that wasn't even considered,"" he said. ""Companies like CoreWeave, and there are others, are out there building the infrastructure to be able to deliver that for these clients.""

Trump administration border czar Tom Homan will head to Minnesota to manage U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's on-the-ground operations there in the wake of Alex Pretti's killing by federal agents in Minneapolis, President Donald Trump and the White House said Monday.

""Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,"" Trump said in a Truth Social post.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a separate social media post that Homan will coordinate with officials leading ongoing investigations into fraud schemes in Minnesota.

Trump's post said Homan has not previously been involved in Minnesota, where thousands of federal agents have been deployed in recent weeks to carry out the Trump administration's aggressive deportation agenda.

Two U.S. citizens have been fatally shot in Minneapolis in less than a month in altercations with federal agents. The killings have stoked massive protests, heated denunciations of ICE from Democrats and pleas for de-escalation from business leaders.

Trump's decision to give Homan control in Minnesota comes as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other administration officials face mounting criticism, including from gun rights groups and some conservatives, over their leadership and rhetoric in Minneapolis.

Fox News reported Sunday that some senior officials involved in immigration enforcement have ""grown increasingly uneasy & frustrated [with] some of the claims & narratives DHS pushed"" following the latest shooting.

Axios reported last month that Noem and Homan have a tense and acrimonious working relationship. Trump has praised both officials.

Noem, in a statement on X, said Trump's decision to tap Homan for Minnesota is ""good news for peace, safety, and accountability in Minneapolis."" 

""I have worked closely with Tom over the last year and he has been a major asset to our team— his experience and insight will help us in our wide-scale fraud investigations, which have robbed Americans, and will help us to remove even more public safety threats and violent criminal illegal aliens off the of streets of Minneapolis,"" Noem said.

""We continue to call on the leadership in Minnesota to allow for state and local partnership in our public safety mission,"" she said.

The president's switch-up also comes as his polling numbers on immigration, and his overall approval rating, have declined, according to recent surveys from The New York Times and Siena University and others.

In another Truth Social post later Monday morning, Trump said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called him and asked to work together in the state.

""It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,"" Trump wrote. ""I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession.""

""The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future. He was happy that Tom Homan was going to Minnesota, and so am I!"" Trump added.

The positive words for Walz mark a jarring shift in tone from the Trump administration, which has regularly castigated the Democratic governor and even accused him of helping stoke the social strife in Minneapolis that led to the shootings.

The government has reportedly subpoenaed Walz and other Minnesota Democrats as part of an investigation into possible obstruction of federal law enforcement operations in the state.

Walz in previous statements has urged Trump to join him to restore calm to Minneapolis.

Tensions in Minnesota have boiled over after the two killings by federal agents in Minneapolis.

Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was fatally shot by ICE agent Jonathan Ross on Jan. 7 as she began to drive her SUV after another agent ordered her out of the car.

On Saturday, Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse in Minneapolis, was shot and killed by federal officers.

Both killings occurred in daylight in front of witnesses and were caught on video from multiple angles, massively ratcheting up the already-intense scrutiny over immigration agents' tactics and training.

In both cases, numerous Trump administration officials rushed to defend the agents' actions as justified, while making claims about the incidents that later analyses found were contradicted by the available video evidence.

On the same day that Pretti was killed, DHS claimed that he approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a handgun and, after they attempted to disarm him, ""violently resisted.""

Noem echoed that statement. Later, Greg Bovino, Border Patrol commander at large, claimed Pretti may have been intending to ""massacre law enforcement.""

But videos show Pretti holding up a phone as the confrontation begins. And the clips also appear to show one officer removing a weapon from Pretti's person prior to any shots being fired.

Pretti was believed to be a lawful gun owner with a permit to carry his weapon, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said at a news conference.

Trump, asked by The Wall Street Journal on Sunday if he believed shooting Pretti was the right thing to do, did not directly answer.

""We're looking, we're reviewing everything and will come out with a determination,"" Trump told the newspaper.

In this article

USA Rare Earth shares rallied Monday after the critical minerals startup announced that the Department of Commerce will take an equity stake. 

Commerce has issued a letter of intent that would provide USA Rare Earth with a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in federal funding. 

USA Rare Earth will issue Commerce 16.1 million shares of common stock and 17.6 million in warrants. The U.S. government will have an 8% to 16% stake in the company depending on whether the warrants are exercised, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

USA Rare Earth will also raise $1.5 billion from private investors. The proposed deal with Commerce is subject to the finalization of certain conditions.

CEO Barbara Humpton said the deal with the U.S. government will turn USA Rare Earth into an industry leader. Its stock soared more than 20% after the announcement Monday. 

""This is a watershed moment in our work to secure and grow a resilient and independent rare earth value chain based in this country,"" Humpton told analysts on a call Monday. 

""We have long said that meeting the urgent call to reassure the rare earth and critical minerals industry will require a multiplayer solution, and this establishes our company as one of the leaders,"" she said. 

USA Rare Earth is the latest in a series of mining companies that the Trump administration has taken equity stakes in as it builds a Western rare earth and critical minerals supply chain to reduce dependence on China. 

Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals that are crucial inputs in strategic industries like defense, robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing.

The capital infusion from the Trump administration will help USA Rare Earth advance its plan to build a magnet manufacturing plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and a mine at a rare earth deposit in Sierra Blanca, Texas, called Round Top. 

Commerce will disburse the funding from 2026 through 2028 based on milestones as USA Rare Earth implements its business plan, Chief Financial Officer Rob Steele told analysts on the call.

USA Rare Earth is on track to commission its magnet manufacturing plant in the first quarter of 2026, Steele said. It aims to start commercial mining operations at Round Top in late 2028, he said. 

The company needs about about $4.1 billion to execute its plan, Steele said. It will have about $3.5 billion between its current cash and the government financing as well as private funding announced Monday, he said. This leaves $600 million in additional capital that USA Rare Earth needs to raise. 

""We believe we can raise the remaining capital from attractive sources, and you should assume that's equity capital but that can come from strategic investments as well as institutional investors,"" Steele said. 

But USA Rare Earth has to satisfy several conditions before the agreement with Commerce is finalized. This includes raising at least $500 million from sources other than the federal government, which it will satisfy with the private funding announced Monday. 

It also has to secure two memorandums of understanding with semiconductor end or midstream users, obtain feedstock supply agreements through 2027, and define a power plan for its magnet facility among other conditions, according to its SEC filing. 

The planned investment in USA Rare Earth comes after the Defense Department struck a landmark deal last summer with rare earth miner MP Materials that included an equity stake, price floor and offtake agreement. The Trump administration also took stakes in Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals last year.

The agreement with USA Rare Earth does not include price floors or offtake agreements. 

The U.S. has been dependent on rare earth imports from China, which dominates the global supply chain. Beijing tried to cut off rare earth exports last year during trade disputes with the Trump administration.

""USA Rare Earth's heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. ""This investment ensures our supply chains are resilient and no longer reliant on foreign nations.""

In this article

Price rises and memory shortages are likely to continue through 2027, a top semiconductor industry CEO told CNBC, adding to the view that the crunch that's been caused by the AI infrastructure boom may last longer than expected.

Memory chips are a key component of consumer electronics devices like smartphones and laptops. They have also become a critical part of artificial intelligence data centers and the servers that are installed in these facilities. In particular, there is significant demand for high-bandwidth memory. 

As tens of billions of dollars continue to be spent on data center infrastructure, the demand for memory chips has gone through the roof, sparking an unprecedented price rise for the semiconductors, which is set to continue this year.

Sassine Ghazi, CEO of Synopsys, a key semiconductor design tool company, told CNBC in an interview last week that the chip ""crunch"" will continue through 2026 and 2027.

Ghazi said most of the memory from the top players ""is going directly to AI infrastructure, but many other products need memory, so those other markets are starved today because there is no capacity left for them.""

Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron are the biggest memory companies in the world. 

While these companies are aiming to expand manufacturing, it takes a ""minimum"" of two years before that comes online, which is one reason why the crunch is set to last, Ghazi said.

Memory prices have historically traded in cycles of short supply or oversupply, which have dictated the price of the components. However, some analysts have dubbed the current trend a ""super cycle."" 

""Now it's a golden time for the memory companies,"" Ghazi said.

Winston Cheng, chief financial officer of the world's biggest PC maker Lenovo, also said in an interview last week that ""we will see memory prices going up,"" noting there is high demand and not enough supply.

Memory price jumps mean that consumer electronics companies may have to consider price rises. 

Chinese electronics giant Xiaomi, one of the world's biggest smartphone firms, said last year that it expects price rises to happen in 2026 for mobile phones. However, Synopsys' Ghazi said price hikes are ""happening already."" 

Lenovo's Cheng said as there is high demand for memory chips, he is ""very confident that the cycle would be such that we could pass on the cost.""

Lenovo has a global ""diversified"" supply chain with 30 manufacturing plants across the world, which may help it mitigate some of the risks around the memory shortage, Cheng said. 

He noted however, that the consumer device segment is ""also hurting a little bit ... in terms of price demand."" He added that PC and laptop users are still upgrading to Windows 11, Microsoft's operating system that was released in 2021. 

""I think that replacement cycle is very real,"" Cheng said. Nevertheless, Price increases would ""start hitting the lower end"" of the electronics market first.

The European Commission on Monday said it opened an investigation into Elon Musk's X over the spreading of sexually explicit material by the AI chatbot Grok. 

The probe is being conducted under the European Union's sweeping Digital Services Act (DSA) regulation. 

""The new investigation will assess whether the company properly assessed and mitigated risks associated with the deployment of Grok's functionalities into X in the EU,"" the Commission, the EU's executive arm, said in a statement.

""This includes risks related to the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, such as manipulated sexually explicit images, including content that may amount to child sexual abuse material.""

The Commission said the risks ""seem to have materialised, exposing citizens in the EU to serious harm.""

""Deepfakes are a troubling, frontier issue that call for tailored, thoughtful responses,"" U.S. Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers told CNBC. 

""Erecting a 'Great Firewall' to ban X, or lobotomizing AI, is neither tailored nor thoughtful. We stand ready to work with the EU on better ideas.""

Grok came under fire this year after users were able to prompt the system to generate sexualized images of children and other individuals.

Earlier this month, Musk's company said it had ""implemented technological measures"" to prevent the Grok account on X ""from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis."" The company also limited image creation editing through Grok on X to paid subscribers. The standalone Grok app, which does not share images publicly, still allowed non-paying users to generate imagery of women and children.

European regulators have joined a growing list of authorities looking into Grok. The U.K., India, and Malaysia are among a number of other countries investigating the sexualized imagery generated by Grok.

X has been in the crosshairs of the European Commission under the DSA, which gives the regulator the ability to levy large fines on tech companies. The DSA is designed to regulate online platforms, their content, and behavior with consumers. 

On Monday, the Commission said it is extending an investigation that began in 2023 into X and its recommendation system. In December, the Commission fined X 120 million euros ($142.3 million) for breaching its transparency obligations under the DSA.

If you're planning to buy your first home in 2026, you may want to check out some medium-sized metros east of the Rocky Mountains, where affordability is king and economies are growing.

That's where Realtor.com identified the 10 best cities for first-time homebuyers to purchase this year.  These locations offer affordable home prices relative to income, robust amenities like quality shopping and daycare along with  a large percentage of young residents ages 25 to 34, according to Realtor.com — all things that first-time homebuyers may have on their wish list.

Most of these places — such as Rochester, New York; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and St. Louis Park, Minnesota — are located along the Rust Belt and known for their snowy, cold winters and idyllic summers. Other places on this list — like Little Rock, Arkansas — are southern capital cities and cultural centers. 

Most buyers in all these cities finance their home purchases with some type of mortgage, according to Realtor.com data. And many first-time homebuyers have unique needs when choosing a lender, including down payment assistance, exceptional customer service, and a robust loan selection. On top of that, regional lenders offer unique expertise in local markets and customer values. For example, Huntington Bank will pair you with a local expert to find the best product for you — including local down payment assistance and other financial resources. 

Below, CNBC Select compiled our picks for the best mortgage lenders for first-time homebuyers looking to move to the cities on this list (or similar areas), based on the needs of this specific cohort. 

Why we think it's best for a low-down-payment mortgage: Rocket Mortgage is one of the largest lenders of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans — government-backed mortgages that require a minimum down payment of 3.5%, much lower than most conventional mortgages, which typically require 5%. 

On top of that, Rocket also offers a proprietary low-down payment loan for first-time homebuyers called ONE+ by Rocket Mortgage. With this loan, qualifying first-time homebuyers (borrowers who meet credit and employment requirements and make less than 80% of the area median income) can put down as little as 1%. Rocket will provide these borrowers with an additional 2% up to $7,500.

Conventional loans, FHA loans, VA loans, Jumbo loans, low-down-payment mortgages

10-, 15- and 30-year fixed-term conventional loans, 30-year VA and FHA loans, custom mortgages with fixed-rate terms from 8 to 29 years.

620 for conventional loans

Other pros for Rocket Mortgage: Excellent customer service rankings from J.D. Power and Better Business Bureau; shares rate and term details on website for easy borrower evaluation; expansive customer service options, including extensive phone line hours and a chat feature; great loan variety.

Some downsides to consider: Rocket does not have branches, so if you're keen on doing your banking in person, Rocket may not be for you. 

Why we think it's best for Rust Belt Buyers: Huntington Bank, a Columbus, Ohio-based bank has a well-known presence and reputation in the Rust Belt. Each prospective homebuyer will be paired with a local expert who knows the ins-and-outs of the regional housing and mortgage landscape, according to Huntington's website. 

It also says these experts will determine whether the borrower qualifies for local first-time homebuyer programs, such as the State Bond Down Payment Assistance program. Huntington offers mortgages that require a minimum down payment of 3%. Additionally, in 2021, it began a five-year commitment to providing $24 billion in affordable mortgages for underserved communities. 

On top of that, it's the official partner bank of some Rust Belt institutions, including the Indiana Colts, the Cleveland Browns and various prominent universities across the Midwest.

 Other pros for Huntington Bank: It has 1,000 branches in 14 states, including Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Minnesota — a relatively large physical footprint, so you can walk in and talk to a loan expert. It is also rated well by J.D. Power and the Better Business Bureau for customer satisfaction. 

Some downsides to consider: Huntington doesn't post its rates and terms on its website, so it may be hard to compare them during your preliminary search. It also doesn't have branches in upstate New York, which is often considered part of the Rust Belt. But don't worry, New Yorkers, we have you covered below. 

Why we think it's best for buyers in New York State: Based in Albany, New York, Homestead is known for its strong customer service reviews and local expertise. It offers several programs geared toward first-time homebuyers, including HomeReach, which provides down payment assistance for borrowers taking out an FHA loan, allowing them to put 0% down. 

Apply online for personalized rates; fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are available.

Conventional loans, FHA loans, VA loans, USDA loans, HomeReady, investor loans, renovation loans, Jumbo loans, Energy Efficient Mortgage, refinance, reverse mortgage, HomeReach, Doctors+ loans

0% for VA and USDA, 0% for HomeReach, 3% for HomeReady, 3% for conventional, 3.5% for FHA, 10% to 15% for jumbo

Other pros for Homestead Funding Corp: Homestead offers a $5,000 on-time closing guarantee if it doesn't close your loan by the contracted date. It also has a wide variety of primary mortgage, renovation and reverse mortgage products. Plus, it has an excellent customer service record, including an average of 4.98 out of 5.0 stars across over 4,300 reviews on Zillow.  It also has an A+ rating from the BBB. 

Some downsides to consider: Homestead exclusively works in the mortgage space, so you'll have to do your other banking separately. 

Why we think it's best for buyers in the South: Jackson, Mississippi-based Hope Credit Union is a financial institution in the heart of the South. 

It offers several products for low- and moderate-income homebuyers. For example,  a special down payment assistance loan allows homebuyers to purchase with 0% down up to $350,000 and 3% down up to $425,000. Hope Credit was founded to serve the underserved, and so its products reflect that mission, according to its website. 

Apply online for personalized rates; fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are available.

Conventional loans, FHA loans, VA loans, USDA loans, Affordable Housing Program loans, ITIN loans

Apply online for terms

620 for conventional loans; 580 for FHA loans and Affordable Housing Program loans

0% for VA, USDA and Affordable Housing Program loans; 3.5% for FHA loans; 3% for conventional loans

Other pros to consider: Unlike many credit unions, it's pretty easy to join. People can sign up for a membership fee of  $10. 

Some downsides to consider: Membership is restricted to those in Mississippi, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Gold Hits Record $5K While Bitcoin Struggles To Keep Pace","https://www.tradingview.com/news/newsbtc:6e8a533c2094b:0-gold-hits-record-5k-while-bitcoin-struggles-to-keep-pace/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:00:41 GMT","

Gold shone brightly today, racing to a new high while crypto took the back seat, and the gap between the two assets opened wide.

On Monday, the precious metal moved past the $5,000 mark, registering a price point market sentinels had not witnessed before. Bitcoin, by contrast, failed to keep pace and traded well below its recent highs.

Gold Hits Record Levels

Safe-haven demand pushed gold sharply higher. Prices were up above $5k an ounce and inked roughly $5,110 at the peak. Silver, for its part, did not go unnoticed, jumping to fresh peaks near $107/ounce.



Traders pointed to simmering geopolitical friction and talk of tougher trade moves led by US President Donald Trump as fuel for the rally.

A weaker greenback made metals more attractive to customers overseas, and central bank buying provided steady backing. Liquidity in some corners were thin as investors rushed to shift cash into things that feel stable when risk elevates.

Bitcoin Falls Behind

Market numbers show Bitcoin hovering in the mid-$80,000s range, retreating from peaks seen late last year. Reports note the alpha crypto is roughly 30% below the highest level it hit reached in October 2025, leaving some holders quite jittery.

Volatility was another factor. Where bullion is being sought for safety, Bitcoin is viewed more as a growth or speculative play, and that difference in investor application becomes clear when markets tighten. Some funds slashed their crypto exposure, signaling a short reroute away from high-risk gambits. Why Investors Are Shifting 

Analysts and traders described a simple choice: shelter or swing for gains. When headlines push worry, money flows into assets that are widely trusted across markets and governments.

Metals fit that ticket. Based on market chatter, fears of a US government funding clash and fresh tariff announcements stacked pressure on stocks and added a sense of urgency to safe-haven acquisition.

Options and futures trading hinted at a more cautious perpective, with volatility indexes rising and bond yields behaving in ways that made the yellow metal look more appealing by comparison.What Traders Are Watching 

Market watchers said eyes will be glued on a few key metrics: The dollar's path, moves by major central banks, and any sign that US politics escalates could keep metals elevated.

For Bitcoin, network activity, large wallet flows, and regulatory headlines will likely set the tone. Some traders expect swings both ways. Others caution that when risk appetite is back, crypto may bounce hard, but that outcome is not a sure thing and will be dependent on a string of policy and macro moves.

Something went wrong

The stability of a major global currency is hanging in the balance, and the ripple effects are zeroing in on Bitcoin, at least in the short-term.

This shift revolves around the potential for a coordinated currency intervention by the Federal Reserve, according to a Bloomberg report. After the New York Fed conducted a rate check—a procedural move often preceding market action—the Japanese yen surged 3.39% from last Friday's low. It now trades at 153.95 yen to the dollar, a level not seen since early November 2025.

This matters because a stronger yen threatens to unwind one of the world's most pervasive investment strategies, directly impacting the liquidity that has buoyed risk assets like Bitcoin for years.

The move comes after a week of turmoil in Japan, where a sharp selloff pushed the nation's 40-year government bond yield to 4%, a level last seen at its 2007 debut.

In this fragile macro environment, Bitcoin's behavior is increasingly dictated by traditional finance flows. It has largely failed to rally amid shifting policies and geopolitics, posting a mere 0.14% gain year-to-date, according to CoinGecko data, while gold and silver climb to new highs.

For decades, Japan's near-zero interest rates have fueled the ""carry trade,"" where investors borrow cheap yen to buy higher-yielding assets abroad, including U.S. stocks and Bitcoin.

If the yen weakens, these trades become more profitable on paper. But a sudden, coordinated intervention to strengthen the yen—involving the Fed selling dollars to buy yen—forces a rapid reversal.

This dynamic hits Bitcoin directly, as its short-term price is primarily determined by leveraged capital, Tim Sun, senior researcher at HashKey Group, told Decrypt.

Investors must now sell those risk assets to buy back yen and close their loans, creating a wave of selling pressure.

“Rising expectations of intervention directly lifted the volatility premium, sharply increasing the cost of holding leveraged positions,” Sun said. “This, in turn, forced capital to exit Bitcoin.”

With reports about the NY Fed's rate checks, investors are worried about a joint intervention that could involve the printing of U.S. dollars to buyback Yen to backstop the Japanese currency decline.

This dynamic explains recent selling across crypto and equities as the yen has strengthened.

“Rising expectations of intervention directly lifted the volatility premium, sharply increasing the cost of holding leveraged positions,” Sun said. “This, in turn, forced capital to exit Bitcoin.”

The ripple effects could be severe.

A forced unwinding of these leveraged positions could further destabilize bond markets and global liquidity, echoing the August 2024 carry-trade blowup that sent Bitcoin below $50,000 and triggered over $1 billion in liquidations.

Sun noted, however, that the current impact is unlikely to exceed that event, as overall risk appetite among leveraged players is now lower than in 2024.

What Is a Carry Trade and What Does It Have to Do With the Bitcoin Crash?

While this deleveraging poses a clear short-term threat to Bitcoin's price, the longer-term monetary consequences could be powerfully bullish, experts told Decrypt.

If the Fed intervenes by selling dollars, it effectively expands dollar liquidity—a form of money printing. This weakens the U.S. dollar, which is already near multi-month lows, and boosts global liquidity.

For a new, sustained rally to take hold, Sun said the market would need to see “a decline in yen FX volatility, followed by USD weakening,” confirming a structural shift toward broader liquidity easing.

Such an environment historically acts as a tailwind for scarce, ""hard money"" assets like Bitcoin.

For a sustained rally, Sun said the market would need to see “a decline in yen FX volatility, followed by USD weakening,” confirming a structural shift toward broader liquidity easing.

Arthur Hayes, former CEO of BitMEX and a prominent macro commentator, has called this scenario ""extremely boolish,"" in a Saturday tweet.

“This assumes Fed prints dollars, creates banking reserves. dollars are then sold to buy yen. If the Fed is manipulating the yen, we will see its b/s grow via the Foreign currency denominated assets line item, which comes out weekly in the H.4.1 release.”

This view is gaining traction: the immediate pain of a carry-trade unwind may soon give way to a powerful rotation into Bitcoin as investors seek a hedge against a deliberately diluted dollar. Until that pivot, however, Sun expects pressure to persist.

“Until the yen stabilizes and intervention risks are fully priced out, global risk appetite will remain compressed, and Bitcoin prices will continue to face material downside pressure,” he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=bitcoin","Bitcoin Bears Strike Again","https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-drops-below-87000-as-bears-target-84000-support-break","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:26:42 GMT","

What a disastrous weekly close for Bitcoin, that about sums it up. After tapping $98,000 resistance the week prior, the bitcoin price just went straight down last week to close near the lows at $86,588. The bulls have been corralled back into their pens and will need a lot of help to break out once again. The bears will look to continue their momentum into this week to break down the $84,000 support level once and for all, and take the price down to the low $70,000 area. Bulls must defend $84,000 like never before to avoid a breakdown this week.

The bears are back in town. $87,000 support has been lost, and $84,000 may not hold another test. If the bears can manage to get a daily close or two below $84,000, the price should accelerate down to the $72,000 to $68,000 support zone. We likely see a bounce from down there, but if it eventually gives wa,y we will look to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $58,000.

After grinding above several resistance levels recently, the bulls are back where they started. Bulls must reclaim $88,000 first and foremost. From there, they will look to get above $91,400, then $94,000 once again. $98,000 has proven itself as strong resistance above here. In the unlikely event the bulls can push above $98,000, it should be a slow go up to $103,500.

This week is make-or-break for the bulls. Failure to defend $84,000 this week will likely send the price down to new lows. There is a large slate of big companies reporting earnings this week, so if the results are very strong, it could help buoy the bitcoin price to sustain major support levels. Although correlations to stocks have been weak lately, there are no guarantees that bitcoin will benefit from any upward market movement. Odds are in the bears' favor for a breakdown this week.

Market mood: Bearish – The bulls showed some strength in the prior week for a slight advantage, but the bears took full control last week, driving the price right back down to the lows.

The weekly chart was looking for a bounce recently, and it got one. The price action this past week, however, has put in a strong indication that this bounce may be over and new lows may be on the horizon as the price closed below the 100-week SMA. The MACD oscillator is firmly in bearish territory, and while it looked like it may see a bullish cross last week, the bears came out in force and prevented that bullish cross from taking place. The relative strength index has crossed back down below the 13 SMA and sits in a bearish posture once again.

Bulls/Bullish: Buyers or investors expecting the price to go higher.

Bears/Bearish: Sellers or investors expecting the price to go lower.

Support or support level: A level at which the price should hold for the asset, at least initially. The more touches on support, the weaker it gets and the more likely it is to fail to hold the price.

Resistance or resistance level: Opposite of support.  The level that is likely to reject the price, at least initially. The more touches at resistance, the weaker it gets and the more likely it is to fail to hold back the price.

SMA: Simple Moving Average. Average price based on closing prices over the specified period. In the case of RSI, it is the average strength index value over the specified period.

Oscillators: Technical indicators that vary over time, but typically remain within a band between set levels. Thus, they oscillate between a low level (typically representing oversold conditions) and a high level (typically representing overbought conditions). E.G., Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD).

RSI Oscillator: The Relative Strength Index is a momentum oscillator that moves between 0 and 100. It measures the speed of the price and changes in the speed of the price movements. When RSI is over 70, it is considered to be overbought. When RSI is below 30, it is considered to be oversold.

MACD Oscillator: Moving Average Convergence-Divergence is a momentum oscillator that subtracts the difference between 2 moving averages to indicate trend as well as momentum.

Fibonacci Retracements and Extensions: Ratios based on what is known as the golden ratio, a universal ratio pertaining to growth and decay cycles in nature. The golden ratio is based on the constants Phi (1.618) and phi (0.618).

Something went wrong

BitMine Immersion Technologies, a New York–listed company chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee, has quietly built one of the largest concentrated positions in Ethereum ever disclosed by a single entity.

In an update published on January 26, BitMine said it now holds 4,243,338 ether, giving the company control of roughly 3.52% of Ethereum's total circulating supply.

At the time of disclosure, the position was valued at roughly $12 billion, making BitMine the largest Ethereum treasury in the world and the second-largest crypto treasury overall, behind Strategy Inc., formerly Strategy, which holds more than 700,000 bitcoin.

The disclosure shows how quickly BitMine's balance sheet has expanded over the past six months.

Weekly purchase data shared by the company indicates steady accumulation since late October, 2025, with particularly large buying activity in December.

In the week ending January 26 alone, BitMine added just over 40,000 ETH, following purchases of more than 35,000 ETH the prior week and several six-figure ETH buys in December.

Last week the company bought the dip, purchasing $110M worth of Ethereum.

The pace of accumulation has continued even as ether prices softened, with ETH down double digits over the past month amid broader market volatility.

Ethereum is currently trading at $2,940.44, showing a 2.0% increase over the past hour, which suggests short-term buying pressure returning to the market.

Source: Cryptonews

On a 24-hour basis, ETH is up a modest 0.4%, indicating relatively stable price action despite broader market fluctuations.

However, over the past seven days, Ethereum has declined by 8.4%, reaching as low as $2,787.

Source: Bitmine 

BitMine's total crypto, cash, and equity holdings now stand at $12.8 billion, according to the company.

In addition to its Ethereum position, the firm holds 193 bitcoin, $682 million in cash, a $200 million stake in Beast Industries, and a smaller equity position in Eightco Holdings.

The company trades on the NYSE American under the ticker BMNR and was last priced around $28.50, down modestly on the day and slightly lower over the past week.

The Ethereum accumulation is central to BitMine's stated long-term strategy, as it has publicly set a goal of acquiring 5% of Ethereum's total supply, a target it refers to as the “alchemy of 5%.”

Based on current supply estimates, reaching that level would require roughly 6 million ETH.

At current market prices, closing that gap would require several billion dollars in additional capital.

Beyond holding ether on its balance sheet, BitMine is also expanding its staking operations. As of January 25, the company had staked 2,009,267 ETH, worth about $5.7 billion, representing nearly half of its total holdings.

Source: Bitmine 

Using the composite Ethereum staking rate of roughly 2.81%, BitMine estimates that a fully deployed staking strategy could generate about $374 million in annual fees, or more than $1 million per day.

For now, the company relies on external staking providers, but it plans to launch its infrastructure, known as the Made in America Validator Network, or MAVAN, in early 2026.

Chairman Tom Lee has framed the Ethereum strategy as a long-term bet on institutional adoption of blockchain technology.

Speaking after last week's World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Lee said discussions among policymakers and business leaders increasingly point to the convergence of traditional finance, crypto, and artificial intelligence.

He pointed to Ethereum's role in tokenization and financial infrastructure projects as evidence that Wall Street is already building on the network.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Konni Hackers Deploy AI-Generated PowerShell Backdoor Against Blockchain Developers","https://thehackernews.com/2026/01/konni-hackers-deploy-ai-generated.html","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:54:00 GMT","

The North Korean threat actor known as Konni has been observed using PowerShell malware generated using artificial intelligence (AI) tools to target developers and engineering teams in the blockchain sector.

The phishing campaign has targeted Japan, Australia, and India, highlighting the adversary's expansion of the targeting scope beyond South Korea, Russia, Ukraine, and European nations, Check Point Research said in a technical report published last week.

Active since at least 2014, Konni is primarily known for its targeting of organizations and individuals in South Korea. It's also tracked as Earth Imp, Opal Sleet, Osmium, TA406, and Vedalia.

In November 2025, the Genians Security Center (GSC) detailed the hacking group's targeting of Android devices by exploiting Google's asset tracking service, Find Hub, to remotely reset victim devices and erase personal data from them, signaling a new escalation of their tradecraft.

As recently as this month, Konni has been observed distributing spear-phishing emails containing malicious links that are disguised as harmless advertising URLs associated with Google and Naver's advertising platforms to bypass security filters and deliver a remote access trojan codenamed EndRAT.

The campaign has been codenamed Operation Poseidon by the GSC, with the attacks impersonating North Korean human rights organizations and financial institutions in South Korea. The attacks are also characterized by the use of improperly secured WordPress websites to distribute malware and for command-and-control (C2) infrastructure.

The email messages have been found to masquerade as financial notices, such as transaction confirmations or wire transfer requests, to trick recipients into downloading ZIP archives hosted on WordPress sites. The ZIP file comes with a Windows shortcut (LNK) that's designed to execute an AutoIt script disguised as a PDF document. The AutoIt script is a known Konni malware called EndRAT (aka EndClient RAT).

""This attack is analyzed as a case that effectively bypassed email security filtering and user vigilance through a spear-phishing attack vector that exploited the ad click redirection mechanism used within the Google advertising ecosystem,"" the South Korean security outfit said.

""It was confirmed that the attacker utilized the redirection URL structure of a domain used for legitimate ad click tracking (ad.doubleclick[.]net) to incrementally direct users to external infrastructure where actual malicious files were hosted.""

The latest campaign documented by Check Point leverages ZIP files mimicking project requirements-themed documents and hosted on Discord's content delivery network (CDN) to unleash a multi-stage attack chain that performs the following sequence of actions. The exact initial access vector used in the attacks is unknown.

The cybersecurity company said there are indications that the PowerShell backdoor was created with the assistance of an AI tool, citing its modular structure, human-readable documentation, and the presence of source code comments like ""# <– your permanent project UUID.""

""Instead of focusing on individual end-users, the campaign goal seems to be to establish a foothold in development environments, where compromise can provide broader downstream access across multiple projects and services,"" Check Point said. ""The introduction of AI-assisted tooling suggests an effort to accelerate development and standardize code while continuing to rely on proven delivery methods and social engineering.""

The findings coincide with the discovery of multiple North Korea-led campaigns that facilitate remote control and data theft -

According to Finnish cybersecurity company WithSecure, the ERP vendor's software has been the target of similar supply chain compromises twice in the past – in 2017 and again in 2024 – to deploy malware families like HotCroissant and Xctdoor.

While JelusRAT is written in C++ and supports capabilities to retrieve plugins from the C2 server, StarshellRAT is developed in C# and supports command execution, file upload/download, and screenshot capture. GopherRAT, on the other hand, is based on Golang and features the ability to run commands or binaries, exfiltrate files, and enumerate the file system.

""Their targeting and objectives have varied over time; some campaigns have pursued financial gain, while others have focused on stealing information aligned with the regime's priority intelligence needs,"" WithSecure researcher Mohammad Kazem Hassan Nejad said. ""This variability underscores the group's flexibility and its ability to support broader strategic goals as those priorities change over time.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Chiba University unveils algorithm to reduce blockchain delay in IoT networks","https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366637702/Chiba-University-unveils-algorithm-to-reduce-blockchain-delay-in-IoT-networks","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:10:20 GMT","

Researchers from Chiba University have developed a lightweight peer-selection algorithm that significantly reduces data propagation delays without increasing resource usage on internet of things (IoT) devices. 

The Japanese university's development team believe that the vision of a fully connected world is rapidly becoming a reality through IoT, including everything from small sensors to autonomous vehicles and industrial equipment.

And to ensure this data is secure and not tampered with, engineers are increasingly turning to blockchain as a promising solution being a decentralised, trustworthy means of communication and specifically a promising solution for secure data sharing in IoT networks. Blockchain systems are seen as a promising solution to the growing complexity of IoT networks that continue to grow in size, but often suffer from high latency that limits time-sensitive applications, with existing blockchain systems can be too slow for the split-second decisions required in real-world IoT environments.

The primary cause of this sluggishness was not the blockchain protocol itself, according to the university researchers, but the disorganised way the nodes within peer-to-peer networks communicate. They also noted that previous research has ignored how the overarching shape of these connections – referred to as the ‘network topology' – affects speed in IoT-blockchain systems.

To address this knowledge gap, a research team led by Kien Nguyen, associate professor at the Institute for Advanced Academic Research/Graduate School of Informatics at Chiba University in Japan, investigated how to streamline operations in IoT-blockchain networks. Their study, published in the journal IEEE transactions on network and service management, investigated how the structure of peer-to-peer blockchain networks affects IoT-blockchain performance, examining the impact of different network topologies on performance and introducing a new method to keep data moving efficiently.

“We aimed to bridge the gap between theoretical design and practical deployment of IoT-blockchain systems by identifying the fundamental causes of their high latency and proposing a decentralised solution that is both simple and effective,” said Nguyen.

To understand the root cause of the delays, the researchers implemented a method to generate different network topologies and connect simulated blockchain clients. After analysing various representative cases, they showed that the decentralised nature of IoT networks often leads to redundant data transmission.

Specifically, they found that the current protocols for sharing “transactions” – that is, the individual data entries – and “blocks” – the larger bundles of verified records – can cause an exponential increase in data copies. The researchers said this results in network congestion and queuing delays, particularly when nodes are connected in a way that creates too many overlapping paths.

In response to this problem, the researchers developed Dual Perigee, what the team called a “lightweight” and decentralised algorithm that allows each node to intelligently choose its preferred “neighbours” in the network. Instead of sticking with a series of random connections, a node using Dual Perigee assigns scores to its peers based on how quickly they deliver both individual transactions and full blocks. If a neighbour is consistently slow, the node automatically disconnects and tries new peers.

After testing in a simulated 50-node IoT environment, the Dual Perigee algorithm reduced block-related delays by 48.54% compared to the standard approach used in the widely known Ethereum blockchain. It was also said to have outperformed state-of-the-art methods, such as the original Perigee algorithm, by over 23%. The researchers said they achieved these gains without adding extra computational strain to the IoT devices themselves, as the algorithm relies on “passive” measurements of data that the devices were already receiving and requires only minimal calculations.

The key intended outcome is that the entire network self-organises into a high-speed configuration without needing a central controller. The researchers firmly believe that work has significant implications across many technological fields. By minimising the time it takes for a blockchain to confirm and share data, the system thus becomes responsive enough for time-sensitive tasks.

“The proposed decentralised latency-aware peer-selection mechanism can serve as a foundation for future blockchain platforms that support real-time, mission-critical IoT services, ultimately enabling more secure, responsive and trustworthy digital infrastructures,” added Nguyen. “Our approach can be applied to emerging IoT-based services that require fast and reliable data sharing, such as smart cities, smart homes, industrial monitoring, healthcare systems and supply-chain tracking.”

The North Korean threat group is using a new PowerShell backdoor to compromise development environments and target cryptocurrency holdings, according to researchers.

January 26, 2026

North Korean threat actors are once again targeting developers with an ongoing phishing campaign, this time with a specific focus that goes outside the usual geographic scope and demonstrates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to develop a novel backdoor.

The advanced persistent threat (APT) group Konni has been targeting developers with expertise in and access to blockchain-related resources and infrastructure across the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region, including Japan, Australia, and India, Check Point Research revealed in a recent blog post. In previous threat campaigns, Konni primarily focused on government and politically and academically affiliated targets in South Korea, which means the targeting extends ""beyond the group's usual focus areas,"" according to the post.

The activity — which use phishing lures that appear to be legitimate project documentation — also shows the group deviating from its usual tactics and targets, signaling a potential redirection of activity, Check Point said.

""The targeting reflects a notable shift in behavior,"" according to the post. ""Instead of focusing on individual end users, the campaign goal seems to be to establish a foothold in development environments, where compromise can provide broader downstream access across multiple projects and services.""

Indeed, threat actors tied to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) are notorious for targeting software developers, in particular through sweeping job-recruitment campaigns known as Contagious Interview and Wagemole. As mentioned, however, those campaigns were more individual-focused, while this one seems more aimed at long-term persistence.

Another notable aspect of the campaign is that it uses an AI-written PowerShell backdoor, reflecting the increasing adoption of AI tools by threat actors. Indeed, 2026 is already poised to be the year that AI-generated malware appears in earnest. For example, Check Point recently documented how a complex Linux malware framework, dubbed VoidLink, was built almost entirely with the AI-coding assistant TRAE SOLO.

The Konni backdoor used in this latest campaign has ""an unusually polished structure,"" with upfront documentation that Check Point researchers said is unusual for commodity or APT-authored PowerShell implants. That documentation describes the script's functionality — to ensure that only one instance of this UUID-based project runs at a time and to send system info via HTTP GET every 13 minutes — in clear and readable terms. It's also further divided into well-defined, logical sections that each handle a specific task, which reflects ""modern software engineering conventions rather than ad-hoc malware development,"" according to the blog post.

""Konni's introduction of AI-assisted tooling suggests an effort to accelerate development and standardize code while continuing to rely on proven delivery methods and social engineering,"" Check Point said.

The lure documents used in the campaign demonstrate its focus on blockchain developers and also are a departure for Konni, which typically uses weaponized documents with geopolitical themes focused on the Korean Peninsula.

In this case, the lures appear to be legitimate development-project materials and include technical details such as architecture, technology stacks, development timelines, and, in some cases, even budgets and delivery milestones, according to Check Point.

""This pattern suggests an intent to compromise development environments, thereby obtaining access to sensitive assets, including infrastructure, API credentials, wallet access, and ultimately cryptocurrency holdings,"" read the post.

While this blockchain and cryptocurrency focus is more commonly associated with other DPRK-linked actors, there are indications that Konni — a subset of the more formidable APT Kimsuky — also engaged in similar financially motivated targeting in the past, according to Check Point.

Related:Attackers Exploit Zero-Day in End-of-Life D-Link Routers

With APTs using new tools like AI and shifting tactics in campaigns that are evolving quickly, defenders also must be on high alert to the changing nature of these activities, according to Check Point.

""Combined with indicators suggesting activity beyond Konni's historically South Korean–centric footprint, this operation illustrates how a mature threat actor can maintain stable intrusion workflows while adapting both its targeting and tooling,"" read the post.

As always, anyone receiving unsolicited emails asking them to click on attached or embedded documents, no matter how legitimate those documents seem, should approach them suspiciously. To help organizations recognize specific signs of Konni's latest attacks on blockchain developers, Check Point included in its blog post a list of indicators of compromise (IoCs), including artifacts related to hashes, scripts, executables, and domains and IPs.

One tip led the police to the house in Axel, but the arrested individuals were eventually released after interrogation.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Four suspects were arrested by Zeeland police in the Netherlands after the authorities received a tip that they were involved in the theft of 169 NFTs. According to Dutch newspaper Politie [machine translated], the three individuals from Axel and one from the neighboring Terneuzen have been interrogated by detectives but have since been released. Nevertheless, the police action also included the seizure of various data carriers and money, as well as three vehicles and the house itself where the raid was conducted.

The stolen NFTs were estimated to be worth 1.4 million Euros (around $1.65 million), which is indeed a massive amount. However, this is a tiny drop in the Ocean of stolen Bitcoin and other crypto, estimated to be worth $17 billion in 2025 alone. We should note that NFTs are not exactly the same as cryptocurrencies, but they both run on blockchain technology and can even be stored on the same wallets that keep Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the like.

The relative novelty of cryptocurrencies and NFTs means that many people get scammed when using these technologies, especially older people who are often tricked into depositing large amounts of cash into Bitcoin ATMs. But even those who are used to the system can fall victim, either through phishing, social engineering, malware, or seed phrase theft, among others.

The large values tied to NFTs and Bitcoin make them lucrative targets for hackers, with just one well-targeted heist able to net millions of dollars in profit. There was even a true-crime story about a group of hackers who stole 4,100 Bitcoins and lived a high-roller lifestyle for a short time, before everything devolved into assault and kidnapping, eventually attracting the attention of federal agencies.

Since NFTs are tokens and are stored in wallets, the suspected thieves didn't perform a bank vault heist with guns blazing. Instead, it was done behind monitors and keyboards, where they likely targeted individuals using phishing websites, fake wallet apps, or even with compromised browser extensions. It also seems that the Zeeland authorities do not have enough evidence against the four individuals, as they were eventually released after their interrogation. Still, the seized items should hopefully assist the police in their investigation and eventually lead to the arrest and conviction of the real perps.

Key Takeaways

The non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem is collapsing to new lows amid dim demands and a lack of functionality.

Nifty Gateway, one of the earliest and most recognizable NFT marketplaces, is among the latest casualties.

The platform announced  it will shut down on Feb. 23, 2026, effective immediately, entering “withdrawal-only” mode.

Acquired by crypto exchange Gemini in 2019, Nifty Gateway was once a flagship name of the NFT era—now, it's another sign of how far the market has fallen.

Nifty Gateway's shutdown reflects a broader consolidation across the NFT market.

Large platforms like OpenSea have steadily absorbed market share—accounting for roughly 62% of NFT transactions in 2025—leaving smaller or more specialized marketplaces increasingly exposed.

Reaction across the NFT community has been mixed.

Some see the closure as confirmation that the speculative NFT era is over, arguing the sector must evolve toward real infrastructure and utility to survive.

Others expressed disappointment, but still framed the shutdown as a necessary reset rather than a failure.

Nifty Gateway's exit caps a turbulent year for NFTs.

In 2025, supply surged while demand collapsed, creating a widening gap between what was minted and what actually sold.

Minting accelerated as creators flocked to low-cost blockchains like Solana and newer networks such as Monad and Berachain, where launching collections became cheap and fast.

Yet sales volumes and revenues fell sharply, exposing a market unable to absorb the flood of new assets.

The industry continued shifting away from hype-driven speculation—dominant in 2021 and 2022—toward utility-focused use cases, including gaming, real-world asset tokenization, and AI-generated content.

Still, those efforts failed to offset what many now describe as an extended “NFT winter.”

Market fatigue, regulatory pressure, persistent scams, and growing competition from other crypto sectors like DeFi and memecoins all weighed heavily on the space.

Against that backdrop, Nifty Gateway's exit looks less like an isolated event and more like a symptom of a market still searching for its next act.

The NFT market's 2025 performance pales in comparison to its explosive highs in 2021-2022, when speculation drove unprecedented volumes. 

Celebrity endorsements, metaverse hype, and easy money in crypto bull markets fueled the peak. 

By 2025, the market had matured—but also contracted.

Total NFT supply ballooned to roughly 1.34 billion tokens, up about 25% year over year, as low-cost minting removed barriers to entry.

At the same time, total sales revenue fell roughly 37% to about $5.63 billion, down from $8.9 billion in 2024.

Average sale prices dropped sharply, often below $100, with the art segment suffering the steepest declines.

While the number of NFT holders grew to around 11.6 million, much of that activity shifted toward gaming NFTs, tokenized real-world assets, and AI-generated collectibles.

Compared to the boom years—when prices often reached hundreds or thousands of dollars, and annual volumes hit tens of billions—the contrast is stark.

By early 2026, sales remain down 70–80% from peak levels, speculation has largely faded, and the market feels smaller but more grounded.

Surviving projects now focus on utility, gaming, culture, and real-world integration rather than quick flips—suggesting NFTs may be settling into a quieter, more sustainable role after years of excess.

Chile's state-owned rail firm EFE signed a US$700 million (mn) financing deal with Latin American development bank CAF and Spain's official credit institute (ICO), which will benefit the company's ongoing infrastructure investments.

The operation involves US$500mn from CAF and US$200mn from ICO, EFE said via social media.

The funding will support the investment plans of EFE and its subsidiaries, such as sections 1 and 2 of the Santiago-Melipilla railway (US$1.9 billion), where works started in November. 

This operation complements a separate US$500mn financing deal signed between CAF and EFE in 2024.

The development bank is now the rail firm's largest individual creditor, with exposure reaching US$1bn. 

Other investments in EFE's portfolio include the Santiago-Batuco railway (US$950mn), the extension of Valparaíso's Metro system to Quillota and La Calera (US$680mn), and the reactivation of the Puerto Montt-Llanquihue commuter train.

A report indicates that alleged opportunities to become rich overnight are proliferating in WhatsApp groups where the Latino community predominates

One of the most popular scams in WhatsApp groups among the Latino community in the United States is the one that promises to make you rich overnight with cryptocurrencies and other investments, according to the third installment of the report WhatsApp weaponized: how scammers target U.S. latinos through public groups by the Digital Democracy Institute of the Americas (DDIA) published this week. The first part of the study focuses on unrealistic discounts, giveaways and fake stores; the second part focuses on the use of immigration status as bait.

“The illusion of affordable wealth is the lure used to drain the economic resources of potential targets,” the report highlights, adding that the information gathered reveals a worrying ecosystem in which unregulated investment platforms, cryptocurrency scams, and currency trading schemes proliferate unchecked. “The patterns uncovered here should sound alarms not only for Latino communities but also for U.S. regulators, law enforcement agencies, and financial institutions.” 

According to DDIA, more than 3,000 unique messages were analyzed with the help of Palver—a technology company that specializes in social trend analysis—and found that these are marked within WhatsApp with the caption “frequently forwarded,” a warning sign to be cautious. The Institute estimates that these fraudulent messages may have reached more than 192,000 users in 262 groups. “It's an issue that deserves more attention.”

The messages analyzed show that criminals pose as investors, mentors, or coaches who invite Latinos to join an exclusive group of “entrepreneurs” and earn extremely high profits. “How to earn money with your cell phone without leaving home,” says the content, highlighting the promise of a 1,000% return with a suspiciously low initial investment.

The advertisement for automated financial algorithms that promise unrealistic daily returns is one of the most prevalent tactics, according to the study. “Put your money to work for you. No experience necessary. Automatic profits in your wallet,” the messages say. In these cases, criminals request deposits in cryptocurrencies to avoid banking regulations. The digital currency USDT is the most requested for these scams (it is a cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar).

Some offers feature a “24-hour plan,” encouraging people to make small investments in USDT with the guarantee of exponential growth in a day. For example, “invest 50 USDT and earn 750 USDT.” In addition, scammers use fake testimonials to gain credibility. The DDIA also identified plans with 150% returns in 24 hours with a minimum 5,000 USDT deposit; and 200% returns in 48 hours with a 50,000 USDT deposit.

The Institute also found financial service “offers” promising loans ranging from $2,000 to $1 million. These are classic lures for what the report calls advance fee frauds: they convince the victim to pay a sum of money to unlock the loan, which never materializes, or which has high and hidden interest rates.

Financial fraud also relies on recruiting new members. “Join our Loom of Abundance. Gift and you will receive multiplied by eight.” DDIA investigators believe that these groups enable Ponzi schemes to go viral: a fraud that pays existing investors with funds raised from new investors.

Some potential scammers use legitimate names of financial institutions and offer personal assistance in opening a bank account, likely with the goal of obtaining sensitive personal information and identity documents from individuals. This investigation also found alleged online gambling promotions: some promise to “double your money” through a limited-time offer. 

In recent years, cryptocurrencies have taken on significant importance in the financial industry. So much so that they have reached the highest circles of power. According to Reuters, the Trump family, for example, earned some $800 million during the first half of 2025 thanks to World Liberty Financial, a company founded in 2024 by members of the family.

In light of some irregularities, there is currently an open war between the crypto industry and big banks in the United States. On Thursday, January 15, the Senate Banking Committee was scheduled to vote on the Clarity Act, a legislation that defines the rules of the digital asset market in the country, but on the eve of the debate, lawmakers backed down. Division among Republicans and doubts among some Democrats have stalled the bill passed by the House of Representatives in July 2025.

In contrast, the Genius Act is U.S. President Donald Trump's big promise to leave skepticism about digital currencies behind. The regulation seeks to regulate stablecoins, cryptocurrencies that are linked to an external asset such as the dollar, the euro, or gold to maintain a stable value.

I started noticing over the past year cryptocurrency ATMs popping up in gas stations and corner stores across New Hampshire. These are machines that convert cash into digital currency and send it to a crypto wallet in seconds. What you may not know is that these machines have become a goldmine for criminals who exploit them to scam people out of their life savings.

According to the Federal Trade Commission, fraud losses involving cryptocurrency ATMs jumped from about $12 million in 2020 to $114 million in 2023 — nearly a tenfold increase.

Here's how it works: A scammer calls or emails pretending to be from the IRS, law enforcement, some other trusted institution, or even a loved one in trouble. They create a sense of urgency — such as, “Pay now or you'll be arrested!” They then instruct the victim to deposit cash into a crypto ATM. Once the money is converted into cryptocurrency and sent to the scammer's wallet, it's nearly impossible to trace or recover. Victims often lose thousands of dollars in minutes.

Crypto ATMs are everywhere, more than 30,000 nationwide, and scammers know they're largely unregulated and fast. Unlike banks, there's no fraud department to call and no way to reverse a transaction. Once the money is gone, it's gone.

AARP works every day to educate people about scams and how to protect themselves and their loved ones. Through tools like the AARP Fraud Watch Network, along with public events and disseminating information, we do everything we can to help people spot warning signs before they become victims. But even with these efforts, it's impossible to reach everyone — and scammers know how to exploit any gaps they can find.

The good news is that we're not starting from scratch. Across the country, 24 states have already put commonsense protections in place to help keep consumers safe. These measures show that there are practical solutions that work, and New Hampshire can adopt them too.

Most crypto ATMs allow users to deposit thousands of dollars at once. Local police and the New Hampshire Department of Justice have already seen examples of New Hampshire residents losing tens of thousands of dollars in a single transaction, exactly the kind of high-value payout scammers are looking for. Scammers want fast access to big money. If they can only extract a small amount per day, many will move on to states with weaker protections.

These caps reduce both the harm to victims and the financial incentive for criminals.

Right now, when someone is tricked into using a crypto ATM, they have virtually no recourse. Once cash is converted to cryptocurrency, it is almost never recovered. Victims, many acting under fear or pressure, lose everything. Refund processes are essential. Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, and Rhode Island already require refunds for fraudulent transactions. Offering victims a path to recovery isn't just reasonable, it's common sense.

If New Hampshire does not establish consumer protections, we risk becoming a prime target for scammers. Criminals go where protections are weakest. With Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, and Rhode Island having already taken action, and 20 additional states nationwide implementing safeguards, New Hampshire risks becoming one of the easiest places for scammers to operate. Without similar protections, we could become a destination for fraud.

The best protection against scams is to follow a few rules. If anyone tells you to pay using a crypto ATM, gift cards, or a wire transfer — whether they claim it's to help a family member, fix a device, pay a fine, avoid a warrant, or prevent a utility shutoff — STOP. No government agency, utility company, or legitimate business will ever demand payment that way. Hang up, PAUSE, and never share personal information, account details, passwords, or login credentials with anyone. Never give remote access to your phone or computer, either. If you think you may have been scammed, report it right away and contact a trusted family member, friend, caregiver, or your local police for help.

Criminals look for the easiest path, but we don't have to give them one. By supporting common sense protections and staying vigilant, we can shield our residents from becoming targets.

If you or someone you know has been targeted by a scam, call the AARP Fraud Watch Network Helpline at 877-908-3360. It's free and confidential for everyone.

Amid a global rise in cryptocurrency‑related crime, Israeli start-up Lionsgate Network is drawing increased attention from both attackers and regulators as it positions itself as a central player in the race to trace and recover stolen digital assets. 

While the crypto world has long been associated with anonymity and untraceable transactions, Lionsgate Network specializes in blockchain forensics to expose even the most sophisticated criminal or terror networks.

“Crypto is an asset, an exchange, coded on blockchain. That means we can see it wherever it is. And when crime is involved, we can help,” Bezalel Raviv, CEO and founder of Lionsgate Network, told The Jerusalem Post ahead of Cybertech 2026. “There are no more blind spots, no more zero-accountability, no more ‘We don't know.'”

The company has built its reputation on rapid blockchain analysis and close cooperation with investigative authorities in the United States, including Homeland Security, the IRS, and other international agencies, to provide airtight evidence for seizure orders.

This emphasis on institutional collaboration has become a central part of Lionsgate Network's identity, particularly as governments and law enforcement agencies worldwide struggle to keep pace with the scale of crypto‑related crime.

“This is a huge tumor in the financial world,” Raviv said. “Cybercriminals are using artificial intelligence (AI) to attack individuals at the end of the tunnel, not the network.”

With losses totaling tens of billions of dollars each year from digital fraud, Lionsgate Network is part of a new wave of firms leveraging AI to track stolen assets in real time. Raviv told the Post that the company focuses on helping individuals rather than just large companies or institutions.

Lionsgate Network uses advanced monitoring systems that can determine whether a case is recoverable in under 10 seconds. If the case has a viable recovery path, law enforcement typically takes about a week to seize the hacked funds. If the case is not viable, Lionsgate Network will not take it.

One of Lionsgate Network's core innovations is NemesisAI, the fusion of blockchain forensics with real-time OSINT intelligence. And according to Raviv, every crypto transaction leaves two parallel trails.

“The blockchain trail, mapping precisely where funds originated and how they moved across wallets, protocols, and platforms, down to the smallest unit. And the OSINT trail, connecting wallets to real-world entities, infrastructure, and behavioral patterns behind the transactions. While OSINT data is not always immediately visible, our AI models continuously learn and improve detection exponentially, increasing attribution accuracy over time.”

The rise of Lionsgate Network comes at a moment of unprecedented vulnerability for crypto users. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center now receives thousands of fraud reports each day, many involving elaborate investment schemes that target victims across North America, Europe, and the Middle East.

The company found that “in the US alone, over $53 billion is embezzled annually through cyber-enabled financial fraud. The FBI's IC3 reports roughly 6,000 new cybercrime complaints per day, yet based on victim behavior, we estimate that only about one in 15 incidents is actually reported, suggesting the real numbers are significantly higher,” Raviv said.

Lionsgate Network is seeing similar growth curves across Europe and Latin America.

And, according to Raviv, “at the current trajectory, global digital fraud losses are projected to approach $1 trillion annually by 2029.”

Against this, Lionsgate Network has stepped into a vacuum left by traditional financial institutions, which often lack the tools or jurisdiction to intervene or dismiss victims by telling them that their funds cannot be recovered.

While most attacks are state-backed, the majority by Iran and North Korea, terror groups have also been highly involved in money laundering, including in cryptocurrency.  Lionsgate Network has been central in seizing terror funds from Hamas, Raviv told The Post.

“On October 10, 2023, I was in Switzerland when I got a call from the Prime Minister's Office requesting that Lionsgate Networks block cryptocurrency suspected of belonging to Hamas. It was the easiest campaign. The wallets belonged to Hamas operatives that were active on X, and we were able to help authorities seize over $100 million in cryptocurrency with our intelligence,” he said.

According to Raviv, the company found dozens of other Hamas wallets that had not been previously identified.

In November, some 300 American victims of Hamas' Oct. 7 slaughter of Israelis sued Binance and its founder for facilitating millions of dollars in payments to the group. According to reports, the complaint accused Binance of knowingly enabling Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), and Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) move over $1 billion through its platform.

After Binance pleaded guilty two years earlier, in November 2023, and paid a $4.32 billion penalty, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange continued to launder millions of dollars for the terror groups.

As digital assets become more deeply embedded in global finance, the need for specialized forensic expertise will only grow. As crypto scams grow and evolve, Lionsgate Network will continue to expose them.

DeFi Technologies (Nasdaq: DEFT) subsidiary Valour has received approval from the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the London Stock Exchange to offer select yield-bearing crypto ETPs to UK retail investors, effective January 26, 2026. Approved UK base prospectuses cover 1Valour Bitcoin Physical Staking (ISIN GB00BRBV3124) and 1Valour Ethereum Physical Staking (ISIN GB00BRBMZ190). These exchange-listed ETPs provide physically-backed BTC and ETH exposure with a staking yield component reflected in each ETP's NAV, and will be accessible through traditional UK brokerage and investment platforms via the LSE.

This expands prior professional-investor LSE launches to UK retail, aiming to broaden regulated retail access to digital asset exposure through familiar exchange-listed instruments.

DEFT is down 6.23% while key peers show mixed moves: HIVE up 4.89%, AMRK up 2.17%, OPY down 2.25%, BTBT down 0.94%, FUFU flat. This points to a stock-specific reaction rather than a broad sector move.

Same-tag crypto,offering news linked to capital raises has previously seen negative price reactions, suggesting sensitivity to financing-related announcements.

Over recent crypto,offering events, DeFi Technologies focused on sizable registered direct offerings. On Sep 25, 2025, it announced pricing of an oversubscribed US$100 million deal with shares and warrants, followed by closing the same US$100 million offering on Sep 26, 2025. Both updates centered on funding growth and ETP expansion and were met with negative single-day share reactions.

Past crypto,offering news for DEFT (2 events) averaged a 9.55% move with negative reactions to capital-raising updates, framing today's UK-focused product approval in a different risk context.

Historical same-tag events emphasized raising <b>US$100 million</b> via registered direct offerings, whereas the current update focuses on expanding distribution of existing crypto ETPs to UK retail investors.


      This announcement highlights UK FCA and LSE approvals that enabled Valour to begin offering Bitcoin and Ethereum staking ETPs to UK retail investors on January 26, 2026. It extends prior professional-only LSE access into the retail channel, adding a yield component via staking within regulated exchange-listed products. Investors may watch how assets, trading activity, and future geographic expansions evolve alongside these new UK listings.

When Reform UK announced it would accept cryptocurrency donations through a payment processor called Radom, the decision was presented by the party as a breakthrough in the modernisation of political fundraising. But a Byline Times investigation reveals that Radom's origins lie deep within the same Silicon Valley networks that have bankrolled and built the technological infrastructure for President Donald Trump's political movement in the United States.

The company's leadership emerged from corporations and venture capital firms deeply connected to some of Trump's most prominent tech-world supporters. They include Peter Thiel, the billionaire who became MAGA's chief evangelist in Silicon Valley with over a dozen allies in Trump's second administration, and Larry Ellison, Oracle's controlling shareholder described by a Trump advisor as a “shadow president” behind Trump himself. Byline Times can also confirm that Amazon, a major pro-Trump donor controlled by Jeff Bezos, provided seed-funding to Radom.

Radom had already exerted its influence in the UK Parliament years before Farage's announcement, through an All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) whose secretariat was run by an organisation advertising close relationships with pro-Trump tech giants including Oracle, Google and Microsoft.

Byline Times can reveal that the APPG's secretariat had not only received funding from Oracle, but at the time was dominated by Conservative Party politicians – including current Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch.

Radom's founder and chief executive, Christopher Wilson, cut his teeth as a software engineer at Oracle, the technology giant controlled by Larry Ellison. Wilson worked at Oracle's Greater Dublin office from 2015 to 2017. 

Oracle is not merely another Silicon Valley firm. Under Ellison's stewardship, it has become synonymous with a particular strain of pro-Trump, anti-regulatory conservatism rare among major tech companies. 

Ellison has hosted fundraisers for Trump, donated substantial sums to Republican Party causes, and positioned himself as one of the President's most prominent backers. A decade ago, senior Oracle executives were hobnobbing with people in Trump's orbit shortly before the 2016 election. Oracle CEO Safra Catz and chief lobbyist Ken Glueck went on to join the Trump administration's transition teams.

Wilson's tenure at Oracle does not necessarily mean he shares Ellison's politics. But it situates Radom's technical leadership within a corporate environment closely entangled with Trump-aligned networks and narratives throughout the MAGA era. 

The Reform UK leader received payment from David Bailey, who collaborated with the convicted fraudster behind the Trump-Russia influence scandal

The Trump network connections deepen when examining Radom's other co-founder. Mariel Yonnadam, the company's former chief technology officer from 2022 until 2025, previously worked as a front-end engineer from 2018 to 2019 at Faire, a San Francisco-based marketplace that has become one of Silicon Valley's most highly valued ‘unicorn' start-ups.

Faire's meteoric rise was powered by a roster of venture capital investors that reads like a who's who of Trump-aligned tech finance. Among the most significant are Founders Fund, co-founded by Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention, joined Trump's presidential transition team, and has since incubated numerous hard-right political projects whilst providing intellectual scaffolding for tech nationalism. Another is Sequoia Capital, which in recent years has become increasingly associated with powerful Trump-supporting partners including Douglas Leone, a major Trump campaign donor, and Shaun Maguire, who has gained national prominence for aggressive pro-Trump advocacy.

Yonnadam went on to work as a software engineer for Amazon Web Services (AWS), a subsidiary of Amazon founded by Jeff Bezos, from 2019 to 2021. Amazon donated $1 million in cash for Trump's inaugural fund in December 2024, and by August 2025 gave the Trump administration a $1 billion coupon to use their services for the federal government's digital transformation and artificial intelligence capacity.

That year, Radom received seed-funding directly from Amazon through the AWS Activate programme, which provides cloud computing credits to start-ups. The first tranche of at least $30,000 was received through the programme's exclusive ‘Portfolio tier', facilitated by its venture capital backer Tykhe Block Ventures. The Portfolio tier places Radom within a broader ecosystem that includes major Silicon Valley investors – AWS Activate providers listed alongside Tykhe Block include Andreessen Horowitz and NVIDIA, both of which donated to Donald Trump. 

This support from Amazon, one of the world's largest technology companies, provided Radom with subsidised cloud infrastructure during its critical growth phase.

Far-right activists were seen stabbing dinghies and releasing dogs to intimidate migrants and aid workers

Radom's presence in British politics predates its partnership with Reform UK by more than a year. In 2022, Wilson became an advisor to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Blockchain.

Though APPGs have no formal legislative power, they give sponsoring companies and organisations significant influence and access. They allow private actors to shape MPs' understanding of emerging sectors, often with minimal transparency about funding or commercial interests.

The Blockchain APPG's secretariat was run by the Big Innovation Centre, a private think tank that publicly advertises an elite client and partner portfolio including Oracle – Wilson's former employer – alongside other American Big Tech giants Google and Microsoft (both of which also donated $1 million each to Trump's inauguration committee). 

The centre does not publish descriptions of what these relationships entail, and did not respond to requests for information about its work. But it claims proximity to some of the world's most powerful technology companies.

In 2019, the APPG register confirms, the Big Innovation Centre received a sum of £84,001-85,500 from a consortium of companies to act as the APPG on Blockchain's group secretariat – one of the companies was Oracle. During this period, the APPG's parliamentary membership was dominated by Conservative politicians, who included current Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch as the group's Treasurer, as well as then MP Damien Moore, Lord James Bridges of Headley (former Brexit Minister under Theresa May), Lord Chris Holmes of Richmond, and the late MP David Warburton.Radom's CEO Chris Wilson would join as an advisor three years later. By then, the Conservatives in the group were then MP Stephen Metcalf and Lord Lindesay-Bethune. The APPG appears to have been wound up in 2024.

Major technology companies, via policy intermediaries like the Big Innovation Centre, enjoyed access and influence onw questions of blockchain, digital assets and regulation – access that helped shape the environment in which crypto firms could establish legitimacy.

Wilson's advisory position within this framework gave Radom credibility at a time when the cryptocurrency sector was struggling to establish itself in mainstream policymaking circles, along with direct access to MPs and peers engaging with blockchain regulation.

When Nigel Farage chose Radom as Reform UK's crypto gateway, he connected his party to a firm whose leadership link directly back to some of the most politically consequential Silicon Valley firms backing Trump's second term.

Crypto donations are not merely a technical innovation in political fundraising. They are also part of the structure of a political movement with deep roots in American right-wing networks – networks now extending their influence across the Atlantic.

Byline Times has previously exposed the foreign interests seemingly tied up with Reform UK's crypto push, including the fact that the party's biggest £9 million donor profits from ties to a pro-Kremlin platform that hosts a Russian intelligence-backed influence operation; and that Nigel Farage himself was paid by a Trump crypto advisor who collaborated with Trump's former campaign chair Paul Manafort, the convicted fraudster behind the Trump-Russia influence scandal. Manafort played a key role in crafting the American President's entire crypto agenda, which Farage is now exporting to Britain. 

The question facing British politics is not whether Radom or its founders hold particular political views. It is whether our regulatory and parliamentary systems are sufficiently transparent to scrutinise the activities and influence of foreign-aligned technology companies handed private access to our political institutions.

Radom, Reform UK, and the Big Innovation Centre did not respond to requests for comment.

KONNI is using AI-generated backdoors to target crypto bros


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Security researchers have found more malware being developed with the help of Gen AI, as the use of AI tools in cybercrime moves from theory into practice, and that defenders should also start integrating AI into their tech stack.

Security outfit Check Point Research (CPR) has detailed KONNI, a known North Korean state-sponsored threat actor that has been around for more than a decade.

According to CPR, KONNI is known for targeting South Korean politicians, diplomats, academics, and other similar targets. However, after more than a decade of chasing after political and diplomatic targets, KONNI shifted its attention towards software developers - specifically, blockchain and crypto developers.

CPR says that in the latest campaign, KONNI was mailing IT technicians with highly convincing phishing lures, attempting to access cloud infrastructure, source code repositories, APIs, and blockchain-related credentials.

Those that took the bait deployed an AI-generated PowerShell backdoor that granted the attackers access to their computers, and through it, to all of the secrets stored there.

“A defining aspect of this campaign is the deployment of an AI-generated PowerShell backdoor, demonstrating how artificial intelligence is accelerating malware development and deployment,” CPR said in its report.

“Rather than introducing entirely new attack techniques, AI enables faster iteration, easier customization, and greater flexibility.”

The report also stresses that this means cybersecurity professionals will have to change, or evolve, their approach, as well. AI-generated malware can change faster and to a greater extent, evading traditional, signature-based detection with ease.

“Organizations should treat development environments as high-value targets,” CPR concludes. To defend, they should first strengthen phishing prevention across collaboration and developer workflows. After that, they should protect development and cloud environments with strong access controls and finally, use AI-driven threat prevention to block unseen malware early in the attack chain.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","Bitcoin miners Cleanspark, IREN, and TeraWulf among those lower after NVDA/CRWV deal","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2026/01/26/here-are-the-winners-and-losers-from-nvidia-s-usd2b-coreweave-investment","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:09:09 GMT","

As if continuing declines in the bitcoin price weren't enough, shares of bitcoin miners who have shifted their business plan to focus on AI infrastructure were mostly sharply lower Monday following Nvidia's $2 billion investment in CoreWeave.

While the investment underscores growing demand for high-performance computing as AI applications expand, it also highlights the challenges for independent miners trying to reposition themselves as infrastructure providers in the space.

Cipher Mining (CIFR), CleanSpark (CLSK), IREN (IREN), and TeraWulf (WULF) were among names 5%-9% lower following the news.

The drop reflects investor concern that CoreWeave's growing lead in the AI infrastructure market could limit the upside for other players.

“The declines across the AI and HPC segment tied to bitcoin miners today signal a commitment between NVIDIA and CoreWeave, with GPU allocation increasingly prioritized toward that partnership,” said James Van Straten, senior bitcoin analyst at CoinDesk. “This could potentially diminish funding prospects for independent miners seeking to pivot into AI infrastructure. The $2 billion capital injection is set to materially expand AI compute capacity for CoreWeave, which would intensify competition and squeeze both margins and market share for smaller players.""

Van Straten also noted that CoreWeave's $53 billion market cap is already half the peak valuation of the entire bitcoin-AI mining sector in October.

""As with any maturing industry, consolidation now appears increasingly inevitable,” he said.In addition, Matthew Sigel, head of digital assets at VanEck says CLSK fell about 9% as markets priced in perceived outage risk tied to its Tennessee exposure after state level power headlines, despite its sites being in grid green zones. The drop was compounded by a proxy filing that quantified a roughly $45 million CEO pay package for 2025, raising governance concerns as the firm pivots toward AI, according to Sigel. 

The only name showing a sizable gain on Monday is Core Scientific (CORZ). Although CoreWeave tried and failed to acquire CORZ in 2025, the two still continue to have a multi-year data center deal. Shares are higher by just shy of 2% in late-morning trade.

Also outperforming is Hut 8 (HUT), another miner that has diversified into AI hosting and high-performance computing. Along with Core Scientific, HUT also offers infrastructure tailored to large-scale AI applications, giving it a competitive edge as demand for compute surges. HUT shares are higher by 0.2%.

The shift toward AI isn't new. Bitcoin miners, once singularly focused on validating blockchain transactions, have been repurposing their data centers for more profitable workloads, particularly as mining rewards shrink and power costs rise. 

Nvidia's latest move, however, suggests those resources may increasingly flow to larger, more tightly integrated players like CoreWeave, forcing smaller firms to adapt or consolidate.

If Congress fails to pass market structure legislation this year, the U.S. crypto market would not revert to the enforcement-heavy environment of 2022 and 2023, but it would remain structurally constrained at a moment when global adoption and institutional interest are accelerating, Wall Street broker Benchmark said. 

""The absence of legislation would cause a structural risk premium to persist across much of the digital asset ecosystem,"" wrote analyst Mark Palmer in the Monday report, adding that this would cap valuation expansion for U.S.-exposed platforms.

Palmer said failure to pass legislation would delay, not derail, crypto's maturation, leaving the U.S. market operating below its potential as investors favor bitcoin-centric exposure, strong balance sheets and cash-flowing infrastructure over regulatory-sensitive segments such as exchanges, decentralized finance (DeFi) and altcoins.

The bill is intended to define U.S. crypto market structure by defining how digital assets might be classified as commodities or securities and clarifying Securities and Exchange (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight. While House passage last year shifted the debate toward details like stablecoin yield and DeFi interfaces, Senate negotiations have been slower and more contentious, raising the risk that final approval slips into next year.

Palmer said markets are already pricing in that timing risk. Without a market structure bill, exchanges would face continued listing uncertainty, higher compliance costs and limits on expanding into higher-margin products, while stablecoin monetization could be delayed by unresolved rules around yield and distribution.

Bitcoin BTC$87,948.56 and bitcoin-focused treasury companies would be comparatively insulated, Palmer said, given the crypto's established commodity status, with miners and energy-backed infrastructure also less exposed. 

DeFi and smart-contract platforms remain the most vulnerable, as regulatory ambiguity continues to constrain U.S. participation, while custody and compliance providers would hold relatively defensive positions, the report added.

Despite delays, Palmer still views passage of a crypto market structure bill as more likely than not, even if diluted, arguing that any version of the legislation would reduce regulatory risk and unlock broader institutional participation.

NASA gears up for a historic lunar flyby, AI gives stroke patients hope, and researchers discover the oldest known cave art

What's on the road to the launch of NASA's Artemis II, how scientists are using artificial intelligence to help stroke patients speak, and what an Indonesian cave art discovery says about early human migration

By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Lee Billings, Sushmita Pathak, Kelso Harper & Alex Sugiura

Kendra Pierre-Louis: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Kendra Pierre-Louis, in for Rachel Feltman. You're listening to our weekly science news roundup.

First, we have an update on humans going back to the moon.

In the coming weeks the first launch window will open for NASA's Artemis II mission. The planned lunar flyby will be the first crewed mission to go beyond low-Earth orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972.

To learn more about it we chatted with Lee Billings, SciAm's senior desk editor for physical science. Here he is.

Lee Billings: Artemis is NASA's mission to send astronauts back to the moon. It's been in development in various forms, under various guises, for 20 years now. Artemis II is really where the rubber meets the road. There was, obviously, Artemis I, but Artemis I was uncrewed—there were no astronauts on board. It was just meant to show that the key hardware components work properly, that they can get into space and go to the moon and come back. And now we are doing that with humans on board, so it's much higher stakes.

Artemis II is not going to land on the moon. It's not even going to orbit the moon. Some people get confused about that. It's going to be on what's called a free-return trajectory, which means it's going to use the moon's gravity to loop around our natural satellite and then send the Orion capsule, the Orion spacecraft, back to Earth at very high speeds. And so that means there will be some interesting spaceflight records being broken. One would be that the crew of Artemis II will be the farthest humans from Earth ever. They'll also be the fastest humans in history 'cause when they return and they hit the atmosphere of the Earth, they're gonna be going about 25,000 miles per hour, quite fast, and let's hope that heat shield holds up.

In terms of things that it's going to be studying, it's a mix of a lot of human studies and space-medicine studies. The four astronauts that will be on board this mission, looping around the moon, will be instrumented and sensored all up. They'll have all kinds of biometrics coming off them. And we'll be doing that to have a better idea of how humans respond to the deep-space environment for notional future missions that will go to the surface of the moon, with Artemis III and onwards.

And, and so where we are now with Artemis II is that on January 17 it rolled out, in this very prestigious and ceremonial proceeding, rolled out from the Vehicle Assembly Building, this giant building that NASA has at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. And it was loaded on this giant diesel-electric tractor, essentially, to slowly, glacially go at about a pace of a mile an hour or so, from, the Vehicle Assembly Building to the actual launch pad where it will launch from.

The next big step is going to be something called the “wet dress rehearsal”; this is slated for February 2. And what that is, is when they pump cryogenic propellant fuel into the rocket so that they can see that it's able to withstand all the pressures of all that fuel going in, making sure there's no leaks or anything like that. And hopefully, we won't see any leaks because if we do see a bunch of leaks, then it'll probably delay what is supposed to be the onset of the launch window, which is February 6. And each month there's about five days that the moon and the Earth are aligned so that, you know, we can pull this launch off, so if they miss that kind of five-day window in early February, well, we're looking to March.

And why do we wanna go back to the moon? Well, a big part of it is geopolitics. We are no longer in this world of, like, the Cold War and the kind of golden age of the space race. It's a new way now. There's more players. India wants to go to the moon. China is going to the moon. And a big question now is whether or not we can beat them back to the moon, even though we already did it more than 50 years ago.

There are extremely interesting scientific questions as well. For instance, the places that people wanna go on the moon for this new generation of missions, it's largely concentrated around the lunar south pole, which is where we know there are deposits of water ice and other types of volatiles. This is a very special region that has near-constant illumination from the sun but also permanently shadowed craters. And that region of the moon also is important because it could tell us a lot about how the moon formed and its history and evolution over time.

And finally, a lot of the, the south pole and the regions of interest are actually on the lunar farside, the part that people don't see from Earth, and that's important because you can build various types of facilities there to do cutting-edge science, such as a giant radio telescope to peer back to, essentially, the beginning of time. And you can do that there and be totally shielded from the Earth-based radio interference you would otherwise receive that would scuttle all your measurements.

Coming back to Earth a team led by University of Cambridge researchers may have found a way to give some patients their voice back after having a stroke. The key, researchers say, is a new device called Revoice.

You see, roughly half of all patients who experience a stroke also develop dysarthria, which weakens the muscles used for speech and breath control. The condition can cause slurred, slow or strained speech. It's not that the patient doesn't know what they want to say; it's that they struggle to say it.

The good news is that with rehabilitation many patients regain their speech, but the process can take anywhere from months to years. Given that recovery is possible for patients, the scientists behind the new study wanted to help patients communicate faster than existing technologies that require letter-by-letter input.

The Revoice device the scientists developed consists of a soft collar embedded with sensors that track throat movement and heart rate and provide that information to two AI agents. Both of these agents process the data using a large language model. One of the agents reconstructs words from silently mouthed speech and vibrations in the throat. The other then expands those words into full sentences by using the wearer's pulse to analyze their emotional state and detecting broader ambient conditions, including the weather and time of day. Combined, the system can anticipate what the person is trying to say and, with just two nods of their head, speak for them.

There are some limitations to the research: the study, published last Monday in the journal Nature Communications, had a small sample size of just five patients. But the researchers plan on expanding the study to a clinical trial. If the results hold, Revoice could be a useful tool not only for stroke patients but also for those with other neurological conditions, including Parkinson's disease.

In other news about communication a study published on Wednesday in the journal Nature reveals the oldest cave art reportedly ever found. Previously, the oldest-known cave art were depictions of a pig and three humanlike figures thought to be over 51,000 years old. That art was found on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.

This new discovery was found on the same island but in a different cave. Ordinarily, it's hard to date cave paintings. But the limestone caves of Sulawesi are easier to work with. In fact the cave had been previously studied, but the new painting—a hand stencil on the ceiling—was overlooked. A chemical analysis found that the stencil dated back some 67,800 years at least, making it roughly 15,000 years older than the previously discovered cave art.

This discovery could help us pinpoint when humans first settled in Australia. Archaeologists suspect that humans migrated there through Indonesia but have been unable to determine the exact time frame.

Franco Viviani, a physical anthropologist who was not involved in the new study, told SciAm that the findings also offer new insight into ancient societies, saying, quote, “They confirm what is known today: that art is positively correlated to critical thinking and creative problem-solving skills.”

And speaking of creative problem solvers a new study on bats sheds some light on how these winged mammals get around. Every school-age kid at some point learns that bats are able to navigate in darkness using echolocation—that is, they send out a call and based on how the sound bounces back they can tell where an object is. But scientists have long wondered how bats navigate in object-rich environments.

A single bat call will send back echoes ricocheting off multiple objects from various directions and distances. In complex situations scientists figured it wasn't really possible for a bat to analyze each individual echo, so they must be relying on an alternative strategy. Finding out exactly how bats might be navigating these kinds of environments was the focus of a study published Wednesday in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

To study this the research team constructed what they called a “bat accelerator” machine lined with 8,000 movable acoustic reflectors, or fake leaves. The goal was to mimic the experience of a bat flying through a hedge covered in real leaves. Over the course of three nights 104 pipistrelle bats went through the full eight meters, or roughly 26 feet, of the test track.

The results suggested that bats are sensitive to the Doppler shift, the same phenomena you experience when an ambulance siren shifts in pitch as it drives past you. According to the study, by paying attention to sound changes based on their own movement the bats are able to assess their surroundings and control their speed. The researchers say their findings could be useful in advancing drone technology in the future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Found a Creature That's Breaking the Rules of Reproduction","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a70081203/walking-shark-reproduction/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:30:00 GMT","

Quite an advantage in today's world. 

Here's what you'll learn when reading this story:

The epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum), which lives off the coast of northern Australia and New Guinea, is a strange creature. For one, it's the youngest known shark in the world, with genetic evidence suggesting their emergence only nine million years ago. But its true claim to fame is found within its common moniker—this three-foot-long “walking shark” can not only use its thick, muscular fins to explore its coral ecosystem, but it can also traverse above water between coral heads at low tide. Some experts argue that this may suggest that sharks could one day evolve to walk on land. 

But a new study, published in the journal Biology Open, makes an even more puzzling discovery about this fascinating shallow-sea creature. Energy is king in the natural world, and a large driver of evolution is developing strategies to reduce energy expenditure by any means necessary. One of the biggest drains of that energy—as any human mother will tell you—is the physical act of reproduction, but even this immensely energy-intensive task has been remarkably streamlined in the epaulette shark. 

“Reproduction is the ultimate investment … you are literally building new life from scratch,”Jodie Rummer, the senior author of the study from  James Cook University (JCU), said in a press statement. “We expected that when sharks make this complex egg, their energy use would shoot up.”

The assumption is that the reproduction cycle of sharks—along with other chondrichthyan fishes such as rays, skates, and chimaeras—are energy-intensive due to small litter sizes and their long gestation periods. The frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus anguineus), for example, holds the record for the longest vertebrate gestation at 3.5 years. To get more data on the energy requirements for shark reproduction, Rummer and her team recorded metabolic and physiological changes in five epaulette sharks during oviparous (egg-laying) reproduction by tracking oxygen uptake and measuring reproductive hormones. The results were not what the scientists expected. 

“There was no uptick in energy use, it was completely flat,” Rummer said in a press statement. “These sharks appear to have adapted their physiology to be able to optimize their energy use. This work challenges the narrative that when things go wrong—such as warming oceans—that reproduction will be the first thing to go.”

This good news expands beyond just epaulette sharks themselves. When animals are under stress, reproduction is often impacted as a means to conserve energy—and there's no greater stressor than climate change. Luckily, the amazing “walking shark” doesn't require an immense energy spike for reproduction, suggesting that the shark could continue exploring Australia's coral reefs even as its waters warm. 

“Under environmental stress, many species will choose between survival and reproduction, but the epaulette shark might be able to continue to produce eggs, even under such stressors,” Carolyn Wheeler, the lead author and a recent JCU Ph.D. graduate, said in a press statement. “That's encouraging, because healthy sharks equal healthy reefs.”

With any luck, future descendants of the epaulette shark will survive long enough to walk on an Earth where the dangerous effects of anthropogenic climate change are far in the rearview.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Archaeologists Found a Legendary Set of Golden Armor Many Thought Didn't Exist","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a70095694/golden-armor-tang-dynasty/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:00:00 GMT","

The armor belonged to a Tuyuhun king and was only believed to be myth.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The ancient Chinese legend that Tang dynasty rulers donned gold-plated armor in battle had long been mere myth—until now. Researchers not only discovered a suit of gilded armor in a Tibetan plateau tomb of a Tuyuhun king, but they've now restored the find to digitally recreate what was likely its original look.

Archaeologists first discovered the roughly 1,200-year-old suspected suit of armor in a Qinghai Province tomb in 2018, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), but they didn't quite know just what they had discovered. The fragments of armor found within the Xuewei No. 1 Tomb in Dulan Country were first believed to be bronze armor plates, many rectangular with a semicircular lower edge. The fragments were often fragile to the touch, and many pieces were missing due to past looting.

The team then spent years working on the find and, after sifting through missing sections and badly damaged areas of the armor, realized it was actually gold, turning the Tang Dynasty legend into reality. 

“We adopted a strategy of disassembling the whole into parts and reassembling the parts into a whole, conducting layered cleaning, extraction, and protection while meticulously cataloging each armor plate,” Guo Zhengchen, a conservationist working on the armor, said during a press conference according to the South China Morning Post.  

China's Tang dynasty celebrated its illustrious golden armor in art and poetry. For example a notable work by Tang poet Wang Changling read: “We will not leave the desert till we beat the foe, although in war our golden armor be outworn 100 times,” according to the SCMP. 

Confirmed as the tomb of a Tuyuhun king, the armor of gold was likely a precious possession, helping bring to life another Tang dynasty line of poetry: “Like golden scale on water, sunrays strike our coats of mail.” The region was once home to a powerful kingdom on China's western frontier. The tomb site sat along the Silk Road, helping link the Tubo empire and the Tang dynasty to points both east and west.

The project embraced modern technology to bring new life to the legendary armor, using 3D scanning, microscopy technology, as well as virtual and augmented reality to help process the reconstruction. “These technologies have provided solutions to the challenges of artifact degradation, allowing for more accurate restoration, interactive displays, and global accessibility to cultural heritage,” archaeologists previously wrote about the process, according to CASS.  

CASS said in a statement that the “approach enabled the scientific restoration of several sets of precious cultural relics that were severely damaged and structurally complex,” including the only physical example of a Tang dynasty golden armor.

As evidenced by the unique coat of armor, the Tuyuhun king seemed to enjoy a little panache—he also had quite a fanciful covering for his horse. The team found a damaged lacquered horse armor—this one with gold adorning the edges—and restored it as well. Additionally found in the tomb was a lacquered tray designed to hold grapes featuring intricate Tang dynasty gold-and-silver inlay designs. All these finds help breathe new life into pieces of Chinese history once thought to only be the stuff of legend.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","These Ancient Roman Tablets Were Supposed to be Unreadable. Scholars Just Read Them.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a70062673/roman-tablets-well/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:00:00 GMT","

The tablets were purposefully thrown in a well to obscure what was written on them, but there were still impressions on the wood scholars painstakingly deciphered.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Roman officials in modern-day Belgium once tossed old wooden frames used for wax writing tablets into a well to make sure nobody could read what was written. Now, a group of scholars has figured out why. 

The millimeter-thick layer of wax used for writing is long gone from the wooden frames. But when the Romans used them for writing, the impressions made into the wax left enough pressure on the wooden backing to leave unintended remnants of their messages on the wood itself, messages that experts determined were written in the Roman settlement of Atuatuca Tungrorum, now known as Tongeren, Belgium.

The team published its findings online, showing off their discovery of traces of government documents and offering historical context that was previously unknown. “The tablets not only provide concrete information about religious, judicial, and administrative practices, but they also enhance our understanding of the complex processes of Romanization and Latinization in the northwestern civitates and municipia of the Roman Empire,” the team wrote.

In all, the team investigated 85 different fragment pieces, some of which were found in the 1930s, discarded in a well near the city's forum. These were likely official government documents purposefully throw in into the well to destroy them. Think of it as an ancient paper shredder. 

Another group of fragments was discovered in 2013 in a muddy hole. These appeared to have pupils' writing exercises on them. They also featured a draft inscription for a statue of the future Emperor Caracalla, dating 207 C.E.

“The wood, with its natural grain, was completely dried out,” Markus Scholz, a specialist in provincial Roman archaeology and ancient inscriptions who led the team in deciphering the writing, said in a translated statement from Goethe University Frankfurt. “Distinguishing between grooves that formed part of a letter and those caused by cracks, damage, or the drying process itself was extremely challenging.” 

About half of the 85 total fragments had preserved identifiable traces of writing. The remnants reveal evidence that high political offices were held in the Roman provinces, including mentions of a senior magistrate known as a decemvir. The remnants also provided evidence of lictores, bodyguards, or attendants of high-ranking officials. The team said these roles were not commonly found in the northern provinces. 

The texts also allude to some members living there following service in the Roman military, specifically veterans of the Rhine fleet. Names on the tablets show Celtic, Roman, and Germanic origins, including names not seen in other sources. 

Scholz called the deciphering process painstaking. It included paleography, philology, onomastics, wax analysis, wood species identification, and script visualization by multi-light reflectance imaging. Since the wood was designed for continual reuse, there was plenty of overlapping writing, further complicating the deciphering process. 

When discovered nearly 100 years ago, scholars thought the wood pieces were planks or boxes. It wasn't until much later that they were identified as wooden frames of Roman wax tablets. Now, messages intended to be lost to time have become legible once more, centuries later. So think about that the next time you're deleting a text or shredding some paperwork.

Key Highlights

 A New Way to Predict Cancer Evolution

Scientists at Moffitt Cancer Center have created a new method to forecast how cancer cells evolve as they gain or lose entire chromosomes. These large-scale genetic changes can give tumors an advantage, helping them grow faster, adapt to stress, and resist treatment.

The research, published in Nature Communications, introduces a computational tool called ALFA-K. It analyzes longitudinal, single-cell data to trace how cancer cells move through different chromosome combinations over time. By doing this, the method identifies which chromosome patterns are favored as tumors evolve.

The results challenge the idea that cancer evolution is driven by chance alone. Instead, the study shows that tumors follow measurable patterns shaped by chromosome makeup, evolutionary pressures, and treatment-related stress. This framework offers a new way to anticipate how cancers change and how they may respond to therapy.

Q&A with Noemi Andor, Ph.D., corresponding author and associate member in the Integrated Mathematical Oncology Program at Moffitt. 

What problem were you trying to solve with this research, and why does it matter for understanding cancer? 

Cancer evolves. As tumors grow, their cells constantly make mistakes when copying and dividing their DNA. Many of those mistakes involve gaining or losing whole chromosomes. This creates a mix of cancer cells with different chromosome combinations inside the same tumor.

The problem was that researchers had no reliable way to determine which of those combinations help cancer cells survive. The number of possible chromosome states is enormous, and most existing approaches could only capture snapshots in time or average behavior across many cells.

ALFA-K was developed to solve this problem by using longitudinal, single-cell data to reconstruct how cancer cells move through chromosome states over time and which states are favored by evolution. Without that understanding, cancer progression and treatment resistance can appear unpredictable. Our work shows they follow measurable rules.

Why are chromosome changes so important for tumor growth and treatment response? 

Chromosomes contain hundreds or thousands of genes. When a cancer cell gains or loses a chromosome, it changes the dosage of many genes at once. This can immediately alter how the cell grows, divides or responds to stress.

These changes allow cancer cells to make large evolutionary jumps rather than small adjustments. They also create diversity within a tumor, which increases the chances that some cells survive treatment.

Importantly, the effects of these changes depend on a cell's existing chromosome makeup. The same chromosome change can be helpful in one context and harmful in another. This context dependence helps explain why cancer evolution has been so difficult to predict.

How is ALFA-K different from previous tools, and what does it allow researchers to do? 

Before ALFA-K, chromosome changes were often assumed to have fixed effects. Researchers sometimes treated gaining or losing a chromosome as always beneficial or always harmful. Real cancer evolution is more complex.

ALFA-K tracks thousands of individual cells over time, accounting for ongoing chromosome instability and reconstructs local fitness landscapes. These landscapes describe how advantageous or harmful a chromosome change is given a cell's current chromosome configuration.

The tool also shows that the rate of chromosome errors matters. When chemotherapy increases chromosome mis-segregation, cancer cells move across these landscapes more quickly. Depending on the landscape's shape, this can push tumors toward chromosome states that are more tolerant of instability.

In this study, ALFA-K estimated the fitness of more than 270,000 distinct chromosome configurations. This made it possible to ask questions that were previously inaccessible.

What does whole-genome doubling mean, and why is it an important finding? 

Whole-genome doubling occurs when a cell copies all of its chromosomes. Previous research showed that this can help cancer cells survive, but there was no way to measure how much protection it provides.

ALFA-K allows researchers to quantify that buffering effect. The method measures how much more tolerant genome-doubled cells are to chromosome mistakes compared with non-doubled cells.

This matters because buffering is not all or nothing. There is a threshold at which genome doubling becomes advantageous. By quantifying that threshold, ALFA-K turns genome doubling from a descriptive observation into a predictable evolutionary event.

How could this research eventually help guide cancer treatment? 

ALFA-K shifts cancer research from describing what tumors look like to predicting how they will evolve.

In the future, this approach could help doctors interpret repeat biopsies, identify when a tumor is approaching a dangerous evolutionary transition and choose treatments that limit cancer's ability to explore harmful chromosome configurations.

The long-term goal is evolution-aware cancer therapy. This approach aims to anticipate how tumors will change rather than reacting after resistance has already emerged.

This study was supported by the National Cancer Institute (1R37CA266727-01A1, 1R21CA269415-01A1, 1R03CA259873-01A1).

In Lewis Carroll's ""Through the Looking-Glass,"" Alice runs endlessly alongside the Red Queen but never moves ahead. ""It takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place,"" the Queen explains.

That idea has long been used to describe evolutionary standoffs between species, such as hosts and the parasites or pathogens that attack them. But it also applies much closer to home. ""Though we typically use this metaphor to describe evolutionary arms races between hosts and parasites or hosts and pathogens, the 'Red Queen Hypothesis' also characterizes the ongoing battles within our genome,"" says Mia Levine, a biologist at the University of Pennsylvania.

When DNA Turns Against Itself

Not all DNA works quietly for the benefit of the cell. Some sequences behave selfishly, Levine explains. Mobile genetic elements can copy or cut themselves out of one location and insert into another, sometimes damaging genes or other critical stretches of DNA in the process. Cells have evolved molecular defenses to counter these elements, using systems that detect them, shut them down, or physically block their movement.

This constant internal conflict raises a long-standing mystery. How can some of the most essential and reliable processes in life depend on proteins that must change rapidly in order to keep up with genetic threats?

Telomeres and Their Shape-Shifting Protectors

Levine and her colleagues set out to answer this question by studying fruit flies known as Drosophila melanogaster. They focused on genes involved in building telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that Levine compares to the plastic tips on shoelaces.

Their results, published in Science, show that although the role of these proteins remains the same, protecting chromosome ends, the proteins themselves are constantly evolving to defend against selfish DNA.

Chromosome ends must be shielded from sticking together, a failure that can trigger genetic instability, fertility problems, and even cell or organismal death. To prevent this, six proteins come together to form an end-protection complex that binds to telomeric DNA.

Fast Evolution in Essential Proteins

Among these six proteins, two stand out. The HipHop protein and its partner HOAP evolve much more quickly than the others, yet both are absolutely required for telomere protection.

""We offer a first glimpse of the fascinating biology faithfully preserved by an essential multiprotein complex whose subunits are under potent evolutionary pressure to change,"" says Levine.

To see whether these proteins must evolve together, or (coevolve), the team used gene-editing tools to replace the HipHop protein in D. melanogaster with the version from a closely related species, D. yakuba.

The outcome was dramatic. When the flies produced the D. yakuba version of HipHop instead of their own, they did not survive. Their cells showed widespread chromosome ends fusing together.

Six Amino Acids Make the Difference

The researchers then reversed part of the change. By switching just six adaptively evolving amino acids -- the building blocks of proteins -- in D. yakuba HipHop back to the D. melanogaster version, or by adding the D. yakuba form of HOAP, they were able to restore proper protein recruitment, protect telomeres, and keep the flies alive.

Levine explains that as HOAP changes to suppress internal genetic threats, HipHop is forced to adapt alongside it in order to maintain the partnership.

Exactly how selfish DNA interferes with these proteins is still unclear. ""But similar evolutionary signatures in primates suggest this kind of compensatory evolution may be widespread and studying it could clarify how genomes retain ancient functions while adapting to ever-shifting threats,"" Levine says.

Alzheimer's disease is known for one devastating effect above all others. It steadily destroys brain cells and the connections between them, breaking down the neural networks that allow us to store and recall memories.

What remains far less certain is how this destruction begins. One leading explanation focuses on amyloid beta, a protein fragment that can accumulate in the brain and harm neurons. But scientists have also linked Alzheimer's to many other factors, including tau proteins, lysosomes, chronic inflammation, immune cells called microglia, and additional biological processes.

A Possible Link Between Two Major Theories

Researchers now believe they may have found a way to connect two of the most prominent ideas about how Alzheimer's develops. In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists report new evidence that amyloid beta and inflammation may act through the same molecular pathway. Both appear to converge on a specific receptor that signals neurons when to eliminate synapses, the contact points that allow brain cells to communicate.

The research was led by Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute affiliate Carla Shatz, the Sapp Family Provostial Professor, along with first author Barbara Brott, a research scientist in Shatz's laboratory. The work received partial support from a Catalyst Award from the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience, a program focused on reexamining the basic biology behind neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.

The Role of a Synapse Pruning Receptor

One major component of the study builds on earlier work involving a receptor known as LilrB2. Shatz has studied this molecule for years. In 2006, she and her colleagues discovered that the mouse version of LilrB2 plays an essential role in synaptic pruning, a normal process during brain development and learning in adulthood.

Later findings connected this same receptor to Alzheimer's. In 2013, Shatz's team showed that amyloid beta can bind to LilrB2. When this happens, neurons are triggered to remove synapses. Importantly, experiments also showed that removing the receptor genetically protected mice from memory loss in an Alzheimer's disease model.

Inflammation and the Complement Cascade

The second major line of research examined an immune process known as the complement cascade. Under healthy conditions, this system releases molecules that help the body eliminate viruses, bacteria, and damaged cells.

However, inflammation is a well known risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have increasingly tied the complement cascade to excessive synaptic pruning and to neurological disorders. These findings led Shatz to question whether molecules involved in inflammation might interact with LilrB2 in the same way amyloid beta does.

Testing a New Hypothesis

To explore this possibility, the research team screened complement cascade molecules to see whether any could bind to the LilrB2 receptor. Only one molecule fit the bill. The protein fragment C4d attached strongly enough to raise the possibility that it could contribute directly to synapse loss.

The researchers then tested this idea in living animals. They injected C4d into the brains of healthy mice to observe the effects. ""Lo and behold, it stripped synapses off neurons,"" Shatz said -- quite a surprise for a molecule researchers had previously thought had no function at all.

A Shared Pathway for Memory Loss

Taken together, the findings suggest that both amyloid beta and inflammation may drive synapse loss through the same biological mechanism. This raises the possibility that scientists may need to rethink how Alzheimer's disease causes memory to fade.

""There's an entire set of molecules and pathways that lead from inflammation to synapse loss that may not have received the attention they deserve,"" said Shatz, who is also a professor of biology in the School of Humanities and Sciences and of neurobiology in the School of Medicine.

Neurons as Active Participants

The results also challenge a widely held assumption in Alzheimer's research. Many scientists have believed that glial cells, the brain's immune cells, are primarily responsible for removing synapses in the disease. This study suggests neurons themselves play a more direct role.

""Neurons aren't innocent bystanders,"" Shatz said. ""They are active participants.""

Implications for Alzheimer's Treatment

This insight could have important implications for future therapies. Currently, the only FDA approved treatments for Alzheimer's aim to break apart amyloid plaques in the brain. According to Shatz, those drugs have produced limited benefits and significant risks.

""Busting up amyloid plaques hasn't worked that well, and there are a lot of side effects,"" such as headaches and brain bleeding, Shatz said. ""And even if they worked well, you're only going to solve part of the problem.""

A more effective approach may involve targeting receptors like LilrB2 that directly control synapse removal. By protecting synapses, Shatz said, it may be possible to preserve memory itself.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A strange in-between state of matter is finally observed","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260125083404.htm","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:13:02 GMT","

When ice turns into water, the change happens almost instantly. As soon as the temperature reaches the melting point, the rigid structure of ice collapses into liquid water. This rapid switch from solid to liquid is typical for familiar three-dimensional materials.

Extremely thin materials behave very differently. Instead of melting all at once, they can pass through an unusual intermediate state that sits between solid and liquid. This rare condition is known as the hexatic phase. Scientists at the University of Vienna have now directly observed this phase in an atomically thin crystal, something that had never been confirmed before.

By combining advanced electron microscopy with neural networks, the team recorded a silver iodide crystal as it melted while being protected by layers of graphene. These ultra-thin, two-dimensional materials allowed researchers to watch melting unfold at the level of individual atoms. The results greatly improve scientific understanding of how phase transitions work in two dimensions. The findings also contradict long-standing theoretical expectations, and they have now been published in Science.

Why Two-Dimensional Materials Melt Differently

In everyday materials, melting happens abruptly. Once the melting temperature is reached, an orderly solid structure quickly turns into a disordered liquid. This behavior is shared by metals, minerals, ice, and many other three-dimensional substances.

When a material is reduced to nearly two dimensions, however, melting follows a different path. Between the solid and liquid states, a distinct intermediate phase can appear. Known as the hexatic phase, this state was first proposed in the 1970s but remained difficult to confirm in real materials.

In this phase, the material shows mixed behavior. The spacing between particles becomes irregular, similar to a liquid, while the angles between them remain partially ordered, a trait usually associated with solids. This combination makes the hexatic phase a hybrid state with properties of both forms of matter.

Solving a Long-Standing Mystery in Real Materials

Until now, the hexatic phase had only been observed in simplified model systems such as tightly packed polystyrene spheres. Scientists were unsure whether the same behavior could exist in everyday materials held together by strong chemical bonds.

The international research team led by the University of Vienna has now answered that question. By studying atomically thin crystals of silver iodide (AgI), the researchers were able to observe the hexatic phase directly for the first time in a strongly bonded material. This achievement resolves a question that had remained open for decades.

The discovery confirms that this elusive phase can occur in real two-dimensional crystals and reveals new details about how melting works when materials are reduced to atomic thickness.

Melting Atoms Inside a Graphene Sandwich

To observe this fragile process, the researchers designed a specialized experimental setup. A single layer of silver iodide was placed between two sheets of graphene, forming a protective ""sandwich."" This structure prevented the delicate crystal from collapsing while still allowing it to melt naturally.

The team then used a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) equipped with a heating holder to gradually raise the temperature of the sample above 1100 °C. This setup made it possible to record the melting process in real time and at atomic resolution.

How AI Made Atomic-Scale Tracking Possible

Tracking the motion of individual atoms during melting produces an enormous amount of data. According to Kimmo Mustonen from the University of Vienna, senior author of the study, this task would not have been possible without artificial intelligence. ""Without the use of AI tools such as neural networks, it would have been impossible to track all these individual atoms,"" he explains.

The researchers trained their neural network using large sets of simulated data. Once trained, the system analyzed thousands of high-resolution microscope images generated during the experiment.

A Narrow Temperature Window Reveals the Hexatic Phase

The analysis uncovered a striking result. Within a small temperature range - approximately 25 °C below the melting point of AgI - the crystal entered a clearly defined hexatic phase. Additional electron diffraction measurements confirmed this behavior, providing strong evidence that this intermediate state exists in atomically thin, strongly bonded materials.

Rethinking How Melting Works in Two Dimensions

The study also revealed behavior that challenges existing theory. Earlier models suggested that both transitions, from solid to hexatic and from hexatic to liquid, should occur gradually. Instead, the researchers found that only the first transition followed this pattern.

While the shift from solid to hexatic unfolded smoothly, the change from hexatic to liquid happened suddenly, much like ice turning into water. ""This suggests that melting in covalent two-dimensional crystals is far more complex than previously thought,"" says David Lamprecht from the University of Vienna and the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), one of the main authors of the study alongside Thuy An Bui, also from the University of Vienna.

Opening New Paths in Materials Science

The discovery challenges decades of theoretical assumptions and opens new directions for studying matter at the smallest scales. Jani Kotakoski, head of the research group at the University of Vienna, highlights the importance of the work, saying, ""Kimmo and his colleagues have once again demonstrated how powerful atomic-resolution microscopy can be.""

Beyond improving our understanding of melting in two dimensions, the study also shows how advanced microscopy and artificial intelligence can work together to explore new frontiers in materials science.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The magnetic secret inside steel finally explained","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260125083427.htm","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:58:50 GMT","

Researchers at the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at The Grainger College of Engineering have identified the first physical mechanism explaining how magnetic fields slow the movement of carbon atoms through iron.

Published in Physical Review Letters, the work sheds new light on how carbon affects the internal grain structure of steel, a key factor in its strength and performance.

Why Steel Processing Uses So Much Energy

Steel, made by combining iron and carbon, is one of the most widely used construction materials in the world. Shaping its internal structure requires extremely high temperatures, which is why steel production consumes so much energy. Decades ago, scientists observed that some steels performed better when heat treated in the presence of a magnetic field, but the explanations at the time were largely theoretical. Without a clear physical understanding, engineers had no reliable way to predict or control the effect.

""The previous explanations for this behavior were phenomenological at best,"" said Dallas Trinkle, the Ivan Racheff Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and the senior author of the paper. ""When you're designing a material, you need to be able to say, 'If I add this element, this is how (the material) will change.' And we had no understanding of how this was happening; there was nothing predictive about it.""

To address this long-standing question, Trinkle applied his expertise in diffusion modeling as part of a research team supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy. In iron-carbon alloys such as steel, carbon atoms occupy small octahedral ""cages"" formed by surrounding iron atoms. By simulating how carbon atoms move from one cage to another, the team was able to pinpoint what causes magnetic fields to slow that motion.

Simulating Magnetism and Atomic Motion

Using a computational approach known as spin-space averaging, Trinkle ran simulations that accounted for both temperature and magnetic fields. These simulations tracked how the magnetic spins of iron atoms align under different conditions. When the north and south poles of an iron atom line up, the atom becomes ferromagnetic and strongly magnetized. When they do not align, the atom is paramagnetic and only weakly magnetized.

The results showed that aligned spins raise the energy barrier carbon atoms must overcome to move between cages. As magnetic order increases, carbon diffusion slows down, providing a clear physical explanation for the long-observed effect.

""It takes an extremely strong field to switch magnetic moments,"" Trinkle said. ""If you're near the Curie temperature, the magnetic field has a strong effect… When the spins are more random, the octahedron (cage) actually gets more isotropic: the whole thing kind of opens up and has more space to move.""

Implications for Cleaner and Smarter Steelmaking

Trinkle believes the findings could help reduce the energy needed to process steel, lowering production costs and cutting CO2 emissions. Beyond steel, the same principles could be applied to other materials, allowing scientists to quantitatively predict how magnetic fields influence atomic diffusion more broadly.

""We wanted to be able to do real calculations; to show not just qualitatively but quantitatively the effective field and temperature. Now that we have this information, we can start thinking more about engineering alloys. It may be choosing alloys that already exist or even thinking about alloy chemistries that we're not yet using that could be extremely advantageous.""

Dallas Trinkle is a professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Illinois Grainger Engineering and is affiliated with the Materials Research Laboratory. He holds the Ivan Racheff Professorship appointment.

Tools of the Scribe: How Writing Systems, Technology, and Human Factors Interact to Affect the Act of Writing Brian Roark et al. Springer (2025)

The world's oldest writing system still in use, that of Chinese characters, dates from about 1200 bc. It has survived almost as long as its even older predecessors. For instance, cuneiform — comprising wedge-shaped marks inscribed in clay tablets with a stylus — was used in ancient Mesopotamia until the first century ad and Egyptian hieroglyphs remained in use until the fourth century ad. Moreover, Chinese characters were central to the development of writing systems in several other cultures, notably those of Japan and Korea.

How the world's largest language family spread — and why others go extinct

How the world's largest language family spread — and why others go extinct

Yet today, millions of people who speak and read Chinese have forgotten how to compose many of the traditional characters by hand, relying instead on simpler phonetic and digital equivalents. This controversial trend in China, generally known as character amnesia, opens Tools of the Scribe, a stimulating and original, if technical, book by computational linguists Brian Roark, Richard Sproat and Su-Youn Yoon.

The book explores how “the implement, the medium, the writing system and the writer” interact to produce text. The authors analyse the linguistic structure of writing systems ranging from ancient cuneiform to modern alphabets; the technologies that have shaped writing in both the past and the present; and the processes underlying computer-based ‘scribes', including large language models. Although their main focus is on technology, the authors draw on research in many fields, including psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, ergonomics, anthropology and speech and language pathology.

Chinese characters illustrate this interaction between implement, medium, system and writer vividly. Their first incarnation was in ‘oracle bones' used for divination during the Shang dynasty (about 1600 bc to 1046 bc). Notches were drilled and chiselled into the surfaces of turtle shells and ox scapulae, such that when heat was applied, cracks would appear. These cracks were interpreted by a diviner to answer questions posed by the Shang king. The answers were often written on the bones using symbols — many of them recognizable antecedents of modern Chinese characters.

Subsequently, during the late Shang (about 1250 bc to 1046 bc) and Western Zhou (about 1046 bc to 771 bc) dynasties, inscriptions on bronze vessels were used to record ancestor worship, royal decrees, military victories, land grants, marriages and family histories. Then, during the latter half of the first millennium bc, the characters evolved into a more complex calligraphic form, painted in ink with a brush or pen on bamboo or paper: an art form still practised today. In ad 868, Chinese script was used to write the world's oldest extant printed book: a paper scroll known as The Diamond Sutra, which records a dialogue between the Buddha and a senior monk.

The script's complexity increased over time, from some 4,500 characters initially to roughly 47,000 by the eighteenth century. Today, almost 100,000 characters are listed in Unicode — the international character-encoding standard. However, around the start of the twentieth century, the system hit a technological barrier: the typewriter. The first commercial typewriter, designed for simple Western alphabets, was launched in 1874. By contrast, several attempts to commercialize a Chinese typewriter, beginning in 1919, were unsuccessful owing to the quantity and complexity of Chinese characters.

In 1936, Mao Zedong, leader of the Chinese Communist Party and a devoted calligrapher, announced in his first interview with a Western journalist that “sooner or later, we believe, we will have to abandon the Chinese character altogether if we are to create a new social culture in which the masses fully participate”. After Mao's government came to power in 1949, it began to simplify characters by eliminating some variants and reducing the number of strokes in many of those remaining. In 1958, officials introduced a romanized Chinese script (using Latin letters) called Pinyin (which translates as spelled sounds) as the modern system for writing the Chinese sounds — hence the modern spelling of Peking as Beijing.

Many people now rely on Pinyin to input Chinese characters into digital devices. What Chinese speakers have gained in ease of writing thanks to modern technology has come “at the cost of losing practice with the neuromotor infrastructure needed to maintain their complex script”, the authors write. Nevertheless, Chinese characters continue to dominate China's non-digital communication as a symbol of national identity.

The technology of writing has changed radically over the centuries — both in China and elsewhere. However, until the late twentieth century, the technologies used to input text were passive, the authors observe. Styluses, chisels, brushes, pens, woodblocks, movable type and typewriters gave the writer full control over what appeared on the writing surface. By contrast, computers can now suggest alternative spellings or synonyms, automatically correct errors and — with the advance of artificial intelligence — even write a whole text. As a result, “the notion of ‘writer' itself becomes unclear”, the authors note.

The book dives into the challenges surrounding the increasing use of AI systems by students. In a 2024 survey, 96% of US university students reported having used OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot for at least one project in that academic year, and 69% had done so for writing assignments (see go.nature.com/4pyzbyv). In another study, US secondary-school students used ChatGPT mainly to plan essays (S. Levine et al. J. Adolesc. Adult Lit. 68, 445–457; 2025). However, they tended to accept or reject the tool's suggested edits as a whole, instead of examining each suggestion separately “to learn from their mistakes”.

Advances in network neuroscience challenge the view that general intelligence (g) emerges from a primary brain region or network. Network Neuroscience Theory (NNT) proposes that g arises from coordinated activity across the brain's global network architecture. We tested predictions from NNT in 831 healthy young adults from the Human Connectome Project. We jointly modeled the brain's structural topology and intrinsic functional covariation patterns to capture its global topological organization. Our investigation provided evidence that g (1) engages multiple networks, supporting the principle of distributed processing; (2) relies on weak, long-range connections, emphasizing an efficient and globally coordinated network; (3) recruits regions that orchestrate network interactions, supporting the role of modal control in driving global activity; and (4) depends on a small-world architecture for system-wide communication. These results support a shift in perspective from prevailing localist models to a theory that grounds intelligence in the global topology of the human connectome.

Controlling the low energy spectrum at the nanoscale with an external physical parameter has become an important resource for quantum devices. The emergence of an energy gap is one such key feature, linked to the mitigation of decoherence needed for quantum information processing. Indeed, the detrimental effects of high-energy uncontrolled excitations can only be cured at some specific tuning points in general. Achieving an energy gap is a natural way to extend decoherence countermeasures over a finite region of parameter space. This would be particularly useful in view of the recent efforts to build superconducting topological chains in a top-down approach. In this work, we demonstrate a large energy gap by spatially modulating the local potential of a suspended carbon nanotube, exploiting an analogy with condensed matter systems. This gap is homogeneous on the nanotube and tunable by about two orders of magnitude, bringing the electronic system from an insulating state to a near-metallic state at low temperatures.

Time-invariant photonic structures amplify or absorb light on the basis of their intrinsic material gain or loss. The coherent interference of multiple beams in space, for example, in a resonator, can be exploited to tailor the wave interaction with material gain or loss, respectively maximizing lasing or coherent perfect absorption. By contrast, a time-varying system is not bound to conserve energy, even in the absence of material gain or loss, and can support amplification or absorption of a probe wave through parametric phenomena. Here we demonstrate theoretically and experimentally how a subwavelength film of indium tin oxide, whose bulk permittivity is homogeneously and periodically modulated via optical pumping, can be dynamically tuned to act both as a non-resonant amplifier and as a perfect absorber, by manipulating the relative phase of two counterpropagating probe beams. This extends the concept of coherent perfect absorption to the temporal domain. We interpret this result as selective switching between the gain and loss modes present in the momentum bandgap of a periodically modulated medium. By tailoring the relative intensity of the two probes, high-contrast modulation can be achieved with up to 80% absorption and 400% amplification. Our results demonstrate control of gain and loss in time-varying media at optical frequencies and pave the way towards coherent manipulation of light in Floquet-engineered complex photonic systems.

Carbon sequestration in shale gas operations represents a crucial pathway to achieve Geological Negative Emissions, which is essential for global 1.5 °C targets. However, the emissions reduction potential and economic viability of this approach in China's shale gas value chain remain unclear. This study quantifies the potential for transforming China's shale gas value chain from an emission source to a carbon sink, while revealing spatial heterogeneity in economic feasibility. Results demonstrate that synergistic deployment of CO2-based technologies can achieve Geological Negative Emissions across the value chain, with national carbon sink potential reaching 66 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalents and shale gas production increasing by 4,518 billion cubic meters. Multi-scenario economic assessments reveal that marine shale in the Sichuan Basin exhibits inherent profitability, whereas continental reservoirs require carbon credit integration or optimized production. Current Chinese carbon market prices provide insufficient incentives, implementing region-specific subsidies and enhancing carbon pricing frameworks could unlock this potential, thereby contributing to national carbon neutrality goals and multiple Sustainable Development Goals.

Emotional experiences involve more than bodily reactions and momentary feelings—they depend on knowledge about the world that spans contexts and time. Although it is well established that individuals conceptualize emotions using a low-dimensional space organized by valence and arousal, the neural mechanisms giving rise to this configuration remain unclear. Here, we examine whether hippocampal-prefrontal circuits—neural structures implicated in forming cognitive maps—also support the structural abstraction of emotional experiences. Using functional MRI data collected as participants viewed emotionally evocative film clips, we find that hippocampal activity represents emotion concepts in a structured hierarchy, whereas ventromedial prefrontal cortex more accurately tracks locations in a two-dimensional affective space. Computational modeling reveals that hippocampal-prefrontal responses to films can be predicted based on the statistical regularities of emotion transitions across multiple temporal scales. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal-prefrontal systems represent emotion concepts in a map-like way at multiple levels of abstraction, offering insight into how the brain organizes emotion knowledge.

The fMRI data are available on OpenNeuro111 (https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds004892.v1.0.0). The emotion rating data are available on OpenNeuro112 (https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds004872.v1.0.1).

Wild Arachis species exhibit abundant genetic diversity for peanut improvement. However, the evolutionary history of their genomes is unclear. Here, through comparative oligopainting, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between microscopically observed chromosomes and sequenced pseudomolecules of Arachis duranensis, A. ipaensis, and cultivated peanut, and determine the 10 homoeologous groups (Hgs) of the A, B, F, K, and H genomes. Analysis of the telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assembly of A. hoehnei reveals that its genome is a diverging form of the A genome and is designated as genome A'. In addition, the unique small chromosome A08 is originated from two inversions and a substantial contraction of A'08. We propose a genome evolution model of the Arachis genus, where A' bridges the A and B genomes. We further report an artificial hexaploid peanut derived from a hybrid of cultivated peanut and A. hoehnei, and identify differentially expressed genes against web blotch in A. hoehnei.

The raw data of genome sequencing of Arachis hoehnei (Zw61), genome resequencing data and transcriptome sequencing data were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information under accession PRJNA605106. The telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assembly, gene annotations, and chloroplast genomes of A. hoehnei (Zw61) were available at Zenodo [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18161068]. Additionally, data on chromosomes, agronomic traits data, and sequences of 10 chromosome-specific single copy oligonucleotide libraries (CSCOLs) can be accessed at Zenodo [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18168257].

Open the website of one explicit deepfake generator and you'll be presented with a menu of horrors. With just a couple of clicks, it offers you the ability to convert a single photo into an eight-second explicit videoclip, inserting women into realistic-looking graphic sexual situations. “Transform any photo into a nude version with our advanced AI technology,” text on the website says.

The options for potential abuse are extensive. Among the 65 video “templates” on the website are a range of “undressing” videos where the women being depicted will remove clothing—but there are also explicit video scenes named “fuck machine deepthroat” and various “semen” videos. Each video costs a small fee to be generated; adding AI-generated audio costs more.

The website, which WIRED is not naming to limit further exposure, includes warnings saying people should only upload photos they have consent to transform with AI. It's unclear if there are any checks to enforce this.

Grok, the chatbot created by Elon Musk's companies, has been used to created thousands of nonconsensual “undressing” or “nudify” bikini images—further industrializing and normalizing the process of digital sexual harassment. But it's only the most visible—and far from the most explicit. For years, a deepfake ecosystem, comprising dozens of websites, bots, and apps, has been growing, making it easier than ever before to automate image-based sexual abuse, including the creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). This “nudify” ecosystem, and the harm it causes to women and girls, is likely more sophisticated than many people understand.

“It's no longer a very crude synthetic strip,” says Henry Ajder, a deepfake expert who has tracked the technology for more than half a decade. “We're talking about a much higher degree of realism of what's actually generated, but also a much broader range of functionality.” Combined, the services are likely making millions of dollars per year. “It's a societal scourge, and it's one of the worst, darkest parts of this AI revolution and synthetic media revolution that we're seeing,” he says.

Over the past year, WIRED has tracked how multiple explicit deepfake services have introduced new functionality and rapidly expanded to offer harmful video creation. Image-to-video models typically now only need one photo to generate a short clip. A WIRED review of more than 50 “deepfake” websites, which likely receive millions of views per month, shows that nearly all of them now offer explicit, high-quality video generation and often list dozens of sexual scenarios women can be depicted into.

Meanwhile, on Telegram, dozens of sexual deepfake channels and bots have regularly released new features and software updates, such as different sexual poses and positions. For instance, in June last year, one deepfake service promoted a “sex-mode,” advertising it alongside the message: “Try different clothes, your favorite poses, age, and other settings.” Another posted that “more styles” of images and videos would be coming soon and users could “create exactly what you envision with your own descriptions” using custom prompts to AI systems.

“It's not just, 'You want to undress someone.' It's like, 'Here are all these different fantasy versions of it.' It's the different poses. It's the different sexual positions,” says independent analyst Santiago Lakatos, who along with media outlet Indicator has researched how “nudify” services often use big technology company infrastructure and likely made big money in the process. “There's versions where you can make someone [appear] pregnant,” Lakatos says.

A WIRED review found more than 1.4 million accounts were signed up to 39 deepfake creation bots and channels on Telegram. After WIRED asked Telegram about the services, the company removed at least 32 of the deepfake tools. “Nonconsensual pornography—including deepfakes and the tools used to create them—is strictly prohibited under Telegram's terms of service,” a Telegram spokesperson says, adding that it removes content when it is detected and has removed 44 million pieces of content that violated its policies last year.

Lakatos says, in recent years, multiple larger “deepfake” websites have solidified their market position and now offer APIs to other people creating nonconsensual image and video generators, allowing more services to mushroom up. “They're consolidating by buying up other different websites or nudify apps. They're adding features that allow them to become infrastructure providers.”

So-called sexual deepfakes first emerged toward the end of 2017 and, at the time, required a user to have technical knowledge to create sexual imagery or videos. The widespread advances in generative AI systems of the past three years, including the availability of sophisticated open source photo and video generators, have allowed the technology to become more accessible, more realistic, and easier to use.

General deepfake videos of politicians and of conflicts around the world have been created to spread misinformation and disinformation. However, sexual deepfakes have continuously created widespread harm to women and girls. At the same time, laws to protect people have been slow to be implemented or not introduced at all.

“This ecosystem is built on the back of open-source models,” says Stephen Casper, a researcher working on AI safeguards and governance at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has documented the rise in deepfake video abuse and its role in nonconsensual intimate imagery generation. “Oftentimes it's just an open-source model that has been used to develop an app that then a user uses,” Casper says.

The victims and survivors of nonconsensual intimate imagery (NCII), including deepfakes and other nonconsensually shared media, are nearly always women. False images and nonconsensual videos cause huge harm, including harassment, humiliation, and feeling “dehumanized.” Explicit deepfakes have been used to abuse politicians, celebrities, and social media influencers in recent years. But they have also been used by men to harass colleagues and friends, and by boys in schools to create nonconsensual intimate imagery of their classmates.

“Typically, the victims or the people who are affected by this are women and children or other types of gender or sexual minorities,” says Pani Farvid, associate professor of applied psychology and founder of The SexTech Lab at The New School. “We as a society globally do not take violence against women seriously, no matter what form it comes in.”

“There's a range of these different behaviors where some [perpetrators] are more opportunistic and do not see the harm that they're creating, and it is based on how an AI tool is also presented,” Farvid says, adding some AI companion services can target people with gendered services. “For others, this is because they are in abusive rings or child abuse rings, or they are folks who are already engaging in other forms of violence, gender-based violence, or sexual violence.”

One Australian study, led by the researcher Asher Flynn, interviewed 25 creators and victims of deepfake abuse. The study concluded that a trio of factors—increasingly easy-to-use deepfake tools, the normalization of creating nonconsensual sexual images, and the minimization of harms—could impact the prevention and response to the still growing problem. Unlike the widespread public sharing that happened with nonconsensual sexual images created using Grok on X, explicit deepfakes were more likely to be shared with victims or their friends and family privately, the study found. “I just simply used the personal WhatsApp groups,” one perpetrator told the researchers. “And some of these groups had up to 50 people.”

The academic research found four primary motivations for the deepfake abuse—of 10 perpetrators they interviewed, eight identified as men. These included sextortion, causing harm to others, getting reinforcement or bonding from their peers, and curiosity about the tools and what they could do with them.

Multiple experts WIRED spoke to said many of the communities developing deepfake tools have a “cavalier” or casual attitude to the harms they cause. “There's this tendency of a certain banality of the use of this tool to create NCII or even to have access to NCII that are concerning,” says Bruna Martins dos Santos, a policy and advocacy manager at Witness, a human rights group.

For some abusers creating deepfakes, the technology is about power and control. “You just want to see what's possible,” one abuser told Flynn and fellow researchers involved in the study. “Then you have a little godlike buzz of seeing that you're capable of creating something like that.”

Personal exoskeletons were everywhere at CES 2026. There were ambitious designs from newcomers WiRobotics, Sumbu, Ascentiz, and Dephy, while Skip Mo/Go was back promoting its long-overdue tech trousers. Dnsys (pronounced Deen-sis), a comparatively well established name, had some new launches to tease, Hypershell was back with its top model, and Ascentiz had us sprinting across the show floor.

An exoskeleton is a relatively new class of wearable device designed to enhance, support, or assist human movement, strength, posture, or even physical activity. The main piece goes around your waist like a belt, and from it, a pair of hinged, mechanized splints extend down over the hips to strap onto each thigh, where they provide some robotic assistance to normal movements like walking, running, or squatting.

Once only used in medical rehabilitation and in factory settings, exoskeletons are now being sold as mainstream consumer devices. It's a rapidly emerging market, too, with reports suggesting growth from more than half a billion dollars in 2025 to more than $2 billion by 2030.

Climb every mountain.

As of today, only Hypershell and Dnsys (both Chinese companies founded in 2021) have consumer exoskeletons you can buy. And, as promised, when we first reviewed the pre-launch prototype of the Dnsys X1 (5/10, WIRED Review), as soon as we could, we would race them. So, with the launch of the Hypershell X Ultra, that day has finally arrived.

Through a series of “athletic” pursuits at London's Lea Valley Athletics Center, we went head-to-head with the $1,999 Hypershell X Ultra and the $1,899 Dnsys X1 Carbon Pro. Both are flagship products, both are commercially available, and both caused people to stop and stare, although that could have just been our astounding athleticism.

Dnsys and Hypershell spend a lot of marketing budget promoting the physical benefits of their exoskeletons. Hypershell, for instance, claims its devices can lead to a 42 percent lower heart rate, 20 percent less exertion when walking, and a 63 percent increase in hip flexor endurance. Dnsys suggests wearing their devices will “decrease power demand by up to 50 percent.”

As we discovered with testing the Hypershell Pro X (6/10, WIRED Review), corroborating or refuting these claims is difficult at best, especially when the tech (and human) doesn't always play along. Despite tracking heart rate, pace, and distance using a smartwatch, some of our efforts suggested we used more energy with the exoskeleton than without.

The Hypershell design is sleeker than …

… the exposed wires of the Dnsys.

But there's no denying that the exoskeletons work. They put a robotic spring in your step and positively propel you along. How much tangible benefit you get from the assistance will greatly depend on you as an individual. Chris Haslam, one of WIRED's crack product reviewers enlisted for this test, has a 76-year-old father with one titanium hip. Chris's dad was able to use an exoskeleton to climb a hill without his usual breather at the halfway point. Chris, however—a healthy, active 48-year-old—found them more of a hindrance than a help.

Having two different exoskeletons allowed us to compare performance and discuss perceived effort. Yes, some of the sprint races were a little tongue-in-cheek, but the more time we spent wearing each device, the clearer picture we got as to what the exoskeleton is actually doing and how it felt while it's doing it.

We took the exoskeletons for a jog around the track. Jeremy is on the left, Chris is on the right.

Slow and Steady: We completed an unaided, exoskeleton-free baseline run of 400 meters before repeating the same tests in each exoskeleton. Pace and distance were kept the same, so the difference in exertion could be seen clearly through a drop in heart rate.

Max Effort: We also did a series of 60-meter sprints to test the impact each exoskeleton had on speed. There was a mere fraction of a second separating Jeremy White (being fastest) from Chris when running unaided. This negated the need for a timed handicap, which was our original intention, but the results and perceived effort make for interesting reading nonetheless.

Stair Climb: Finally, to test the ascending and descending benefits, we completed a series of 3-minute stair climbs to see how much impact each exoskeleton had on our heart rates and range of motion.

None of the results here are scientific, and Chris has also spent a good deal of time testing both models in real-world hiking and walking scenarios. But exercising with the two exoskeletons taught us a huge amount about what they're capable of and how well each works. And in that regard, there was one clear winner.

On paper, there's not much difference between the two exoskeletons, with the Hypershell being $100 more expensive, with 100 watts more power, and a marginally bigger battery. The Dnsys has a slight weight advantage, and both options come with two batteries. Each has a good range of power and assist settings and each uses a degree of AI to track your leg movements in real time.

Hypershell claims to use AI to recognize different terrains and activities (uphill, downhill, stairs, running) and then automatically adjust its power output in real time. Dnsys, which boasts about its AI being developed by former engineers from DJI, Segway, and Xiaomi, says its on-board AI learns gait patterns to adjust its motor output in mere milliseconds. Like the Hypershell, it also claims to recognize terrain and adjust accordingly.

As for the athletes, thankfully, our level of fitness and intelligence were not being tested.

Hypershell

Hypershell

First Impressions: Despite the unit initially not wanting to connect to the app, the setup was simple. The app is concise and provides detailed fitting instructions. The big waist buckle makes it easy to adjust, and the leg straps are equally straightforward to use. We both found the hip padding to be comfortable, and the positioning of the controls intuitive enough. The long-press-short-press one-button control takes a bit of getting used to, however.

Dnsys

Amazon

First Impressions: The Dnsys has a “Batman utility belt” look to it, which is (sort of) cool, until you realize that the battery pack is clipped on your right hip and connected to the unit via a messy cable. This does make it easier to swap out batteries without removing the unit, but it does nothing for the aesthetics.

Connecting to the app is very simple, instructions are quick and easy, too—but having the power-on button in the middle of the back of the hip belt is both annoying and frustrating. There's a good level of adjustability here, though, and the clasp is robust. But again, like the loose cable, the trailing part of the strap is untidy, even if you use the supplied small square of Velcro to stick it down. It just feels a bit of a mess and oddly unfinished compared to the Hypershell. It's almost like you're wearing a prototype, though you're most certainly not.

It's worth noting that with both exoskeletons, you need to power them down carefully before taking them off, or there's an outside chance you'll get kicked by a vicious robot femur. Yes, WIRED was forewarned by both apps, and yet, we still had to learn the hard way.

Jogging multiple laps of the 200 meter indoor circuit, both with and without exoskeletons, showed that the technology does indeed reduce the physical effort needed. For Jeremy—who wanted to make it perfectly clear that he “never runs”—the impact on his heart rate was significant. For the fit and aerobically active Chris, the benefits were marginal.

There's very little separating the exoskeletons here, with Hypershell just edging Dnsys, but we are talking the most marginal of marginal gains. What was blindingly obvious, however, was just how noisy the Dnsys X1 Carbon Pro was. Each step was met with a sound effect straight out of RoboCop, while the Hypershell remained almost silent. The difference was stark, and very quickly the X1 Carbon Pro's disconcerting whirring became tiresome.

Putting the X1's noise aside, both models did their jobs, but there was a gulf of difference between them. The Hypershell model was smooth throughout, even in the max-impact “Hyper” mode. The Dnsys has more power settings, and the difference between each is noticeable, but while Hypershell feels smooth and controlled, the Dnsys jerked our legs up, as Jeremy put it, “like Woody from Toy Story.”

Unaided bragging rights belong to Jeremy, but wearing the Hypershell, Chris was able to beat him in the noisy Dnsys, although admittedly, there was little in it. Neither of the two testers is a sprinter, and Chris admits he could have simply been trying harder on later sprints as a matter of pride, but Jeremy and Chris agreed that with both the Dnsys and Hypershell, they felt more supported while working hard. More importantly, times across the board were faster with WIRED's exoskeletons than without.

The Dnsys offered more feedback—in Boost+ mode, our legs were noticeably physically raised with each stride, but that felt quite uncontrolled and jerky compared to the smooth, flowing assistance of the Hypershell. The speeds were almost identical, but the experience, again, was quite different.

As with the first test, the exoskeletons did their job as advertised and gave our middle-aged hearts a little light relief. There was an issue with Jeremy's Hypershell Apple Watch heart-rate reading (107 bpm was clearly an error), but the trend remained the same, with exoskeletons taking the strain, albeit marginally.

Both of us noticed the weight of the units more while climbing stairs, though, and it's worth remembering they weigh around four pounds each. That weight is noticeable on the hips (even more so for the Dnsys, in particular when running), especially as you get tired, and we would really hate having to carry these home if the batteries died.

The Hypershell offered the most natural stride pattern on the stair climb—both up and down—and both Chris and Jeremy certainly felt a spring in their step. The power was also appreciated with the Dnsys, but as we've seen already, the motor just isn't as smooth, and the stride patterns had a tendency to feel cartoonish.

Chris noticed this issue with the first-generation Dnsys he tested, and thinks it has been improved a little since then, but it's still a disappointment—especially as the developers are quick to promote their DNNAS (Dynamic Neural Network Assist System) designed “to predict your next movement and adapt.”

Despite both exoskeletons performing the tasks they claim to, it is clear that the Hypershell X Ultra is better in almost every department. It's much more comfortable to wear; our stride pattern felt more natural when jogging, walking, sprinting, and climbing; and it's oh so quiet. The Dnsys is noisy—embarrassingly so.

Haslam with the win.

Both designs offer assistance, and if you are less able, we can definitely see the advantage in wearing them on a walk. The Dnsys X1 Carbon Pro feels more powerful than Hypershell, but in fact, it isn't. It's precisely because that power is unrefined that it is more noticeable and so tricks you into thinking there's more oomph than there is. It's funny watching someone's legs being pulled about like a puppet, but, in practice, this model works best at lower power. Stick to the Eco mode and enjoy a nice, long hike. Just remember the motor might scare off the wildlife.

On reflection, we'd prefer to take the muscular and cardiovascular hit and not wear an exoskeleton for running. And considering the marginal gains, we're not quite ready to strap one on for a hike either, but the potential assistive benefits on offer here to people looking to maintain an active lifestyle who may struggle without support are clear.

Watching the consumer exoskeleton industry develop will be fascinating, but please let that mean more representation of the people who will actually gain a significant advantage here, rather than depicting able-bodied models sprinting up mountains. For now, if you do have $2,000 to spend, and a personal trainer or physiotherapist won't help, the Hypershell X Ultra is, by leaps and bounds, the best exoskeleton available.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","People Are Protesting Data Centers—but Embracing the Factories That Supply Them","https://www.wired.com/story/data-center-criticism-factories-supply-us/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

Last month, Pamela Griffin and two other residents of Taylor, Texas, took to the lectern at a city council meeting to object to a data center project. But later, they sat back as council members discussed a proposed tech factory. Griffin didn't speak up against that development. No one did.

A similar contrast is repeating in communities across the US. Data centers are meeting unprecedented public resistance, with environmental costs a leading concern. More of them have been needed to power a growing appetite for AI, and they've become obvious flash points for communities worried about what automation could mean for them. However, many of the factories getting built to supply servers, electrical gear, and other parts to data centers are facing virtually no opposition.

Factories tend to create more jobs and drain fewer natural resources than data centers do, so with the exception of a few controversial chipmaking fabs in several states, they have been sailing through local hearings to get permits and tax breaks. But experts who follow supply chains say the minimal scrutiny on manufacturing projects highlights a potential new strategy for activists fighting data centers and a source of risk for communities who may be investing in a short-lived boom.

“At some point, people are going to figure out what the critical factory is that can bring all the data centers to their knees, and they will go after that,” says Andy Tsay, a Santa Clara University professor who studies global trade and reshoring.

Though targeting the supply chain could be a new way to slow data center construction, Griffin says organizers are spread too thin to take on more. So for now, the door is wide open to manufacturers to grow their US presence and feed the data center market without overwhelming resistance.

“We need to start at the bottom and get those guys that make those servers, but we first got to get people to understand what these data centers are,” Griffin says. “We need to pick our battles.”

Her focus at last month's council meeting was on opposing a proposal for a second data center in Taylor, following one being built near her home that she's suing to stop. That evening, Griffin and her fellow activists knew the council also would be considering a proposed factory for Taiwanese manufacturer Compal. But the site's potential role in supporting the data center industry wasn't obvious to them.

Griffin's case shows what communities protesting data centers are up against if they consider also challenging manufacturing projects: opacity, public perception, and the prospect of additional legal battles.

City records describe Compal's intentions as making “servers,” in addition to everything from smart home devices to automotive electronics.

It's a broad list, but Compal spokesperson Tina Chang tells WIRED the Taylor factory will be for the company's server business. The building is being leased by Compal USA Technology, a subsidiary that was established last year for the purpose of expanding Compal's server product operations in the US. Another site in nearby Georgetown, Texas, announced at the same time as the Taylor facility, will “establish a server service center supporting enterprise and cloud infrastructure needs,” according to the company.

Taylor, which is near Austin, spent over a year courting Compal, which considered alternatives globally before choosing the city. A prebuilt 366,000-square-foot facility won over the company, which said it is signing a nearly $66 million lease with plans to invest $200 million overall. “They fell in love with the openness,” Ben White, president of the Taylor Economic Development Corporation, told the city council at the December meeting. “It gave them the flexibility to do what needed to be done.”

White added that the 900 jobs Compal expects to create would make it the second to only Samsung as the largest employer in the city. Council members asked a couple of basic questions about the jobs and competing cities before unanimously approving nearly $4.4 million in tax breaks for the project. “Another home run,” mayor Dwayne Ariola said of the project.

Griffin, a retired teacher and learning center director who grew up in Taylor, says she and fellow residents deserved more transparency at the meeting about Compal's work with data centers. Even so, mounting a campaign to stop a factory would have been difficult because it could have painted her and fellow critics as anti-development.

“I don't want to be seen as trying to stop everything from coming into Taylor,” Griffin says. “I'm just trying to stop data centers from coming into city limits. If we stop the ones trying to get the jobs in, then people will turn against us and say we're trying to stop jobs.”

​Masheika Allgood, founder of AllAI Consulting, which has been advising community groups that are against data centers, notes that another challenge is that the data center industry is well funded to lobby politicians and run public relations campaigns to combat opponents. Factory developers are likely in a similar position, and critics don't have the resources to fight on multiple fronts. “These are difficult, exhausting fights,” Allgood says. “So, while it would be ideal to fight on all fronts, that's too much to ask of folks.”

New or expanded factories have been pitched as necessary to keep up with growing demand and alleviate the impacts of tariffs on imports to the US. It's sensible that servers factories would want to set up near their customers, and, in the US, Texas is second only to Virginia in terms of data centers.

Cities find having both data centers and factories valuable because they balance each other out in some ways. Data centers don't create many jobs, but they generate ample property tax revenue. Factories increase employment but also the demand on public services such as roads, schools, and benefit programs, adding more costs. “Both types of projects can be very beneficial to our community as we seek to attract more good-paying jobs close to home for our residents and … reduce our reliance on residential property taxes,” says Jerrod Kingery, a spokesperson for Taylor.

Other cities are making similar determinations. Last month, Georgetown's city council unanimously approved about $1.8 million each in public support for Compal and another Taiwanese manufacturer, Pegatron, to move into town. Compal plans to service servers at a nearly 213,000 square foot space. Pegatron expects to create about 100 jobs at a 169,000 square foot factory, its first in the US.

Similar to the Compal factory in Taylor, there's little public-facing information about what, specifically, Pegatron will produce. Industry insiders speculated to Taiwan's United Daily News that the factory will mainly produce servers. In an unsigned email, Pegatron declined to comment on specific plans but said its project has “proceeded as planned.”

No members of the public spoke up about either project in Georgetown during last month's council meeting . Earlier, when the city posted on Facebook to celebrate Pegatron's plans, a few commenters raised questions about how local water, electricity, and traffic could be affected, with some conflating the factory with a data center. But after the city posted a clarification saying that “facilities like these use minimal water” and “pay for their own electricity,” only a few more comments trickled in.

Cameron Goodman, director of economic development for Georgetown, says the city has been deliberate about locating factories “in locations with appropriate roadways, water, wastewater, and electrical infrastructure” and recruiting companies that “are well suited” for those spaces.

Fabs where computer chips are produced do use large amounts of water, and activists have protested plans for new fabs in Arizona, Indiana, and New York. But concerted opposition to other links in the data center supply chain, such as factories in Texas, California, and Colorado that make electrical equipment, has been limited.

Cities welcoming those suppliers could face economic challenges if the massive buildup in AI data centers is symptomatic of a bubble that will soon pop, as some skeptics believe, and demand for servers and other parts slows. Or if data center opponents such as Griffin start to have widespread success, that could also undermine the need for more production.

But the immediate prospect of more jobs and economic growth has put longer-term concerns far in the distance, and manufacturing for data centers continues to accelerate. Compal's head of US human resources, Rick Ortiz, told the Taylor city council that the company hopes to be “part of the community for many years to come.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Synaptics Has the Platforms. Now It Needs a Modern Megaphone","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/synaptics-has-the-platforms-now-it-needs-a-modern-megaphone-180123.html","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:01:50 GMT","

Synaptics enters 2026 with a problem it can live with. Many people still picture it as the company behind your laptop's touchpad. That legacy is real, and it paid the bills for a long time. But it also boxed the company in, because “touchpad supplier” does not sound like a platform player.

In the last year, Synaptics has worked hard to widen that box. It is now showing up as a company that can blend sensing, connectivity, and edge compute into a more complete device-level proposition.

The key question for 2026 is not whether Synaptics has credible technology. It does. The question is whether it can translate that credibility into broader mindshare, more design-ins, and more consistent outcomes in markets that reward narrative and execution equally.

Disclosure: I was employed by Synaptics as the Senior Vice President of the Human Interface Systems Division from 2007 to 2013.

A big part of that repositioning comes from connectivity. Synaptics has spent years building a wireless franchise based on Broadcom-related assets and agreements. In 2020, it acquired certain Broadcom wireless IoT assets and manufacturing rights, expanding its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth footprint across home automation, smart displays and speakers, media streamers, IP cameras, and automotive.

In early 2025, it added another Broadcom-driven expansion through a definitive licensing agreement that tied directly to its Edge AI strategy and extended its wireless roadmap. That matters because it shifts Synaptics from selling parts to influencing platform decisions. A touch controller is a component. Connectivity is a commitment that can endure for years in a product line. In 2026, Synaptics needs more of the second kind of conversation.

The other force reshaping perception is Astra. Astra is not a vanity brand. It is Synaptics placing compute at the center of its next act, doing so in a very “edge first” way.

The company introduced the Astra SL2600 series as a family of multimodal Edge AI processors designed for power-efficient intelligent devices at the far edge, positioning the family as a foundation for a cognitive IoT wave.

Synaptics made Astra feel less like a standalone chip and more like a development story. It anchored the platform to Torq, an Edge AI software stack built on open-source compilers, and to Google's RISC-V-based Coral NPU, supported by IREE and MLIR tooling. That is a very deliberate move, because developers and OEMs increasingly want portability and tooling, not just silicon.

Synaptics also made the Astra value proposition concrete, which is where 2026 becomes interesting. The SL2610 line targets a wide range of edge categories, from smart appliances and home automation to healthcare devices, retail scanners, autonomous robotics, and UAVs. It also integrates security and ties directly into Synaptics Veros connectivity across Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Thread, and UWB to create what it calls a unified developer experience and faster time to market.

This bundling approach is exactly how Synaptics increases content per device and reduces the “single socket” risk. It also aligns with the market's shifting dynamics. A lot of edge AI does not require data-center-class compute. It needs efficient multimodal processing close to the sensors, with predictable power and cost.

A recent investor conference interview with Synaptics CFO Ken Rizvi reinforced that story in plain language, and it revealed how Synaptics wants investors and OEMs to think about 2026. Rizvi described Astra as built from the ground up for AI at the edge, enabling it to run AI natively at the physical device level. He also acknowledged the perception hurdle, saying people do not necessarily think of Synaptics as a processor company, even though it has a history in processors.

Then Rizvi leaned into differentiation. He pointed to the embedded Coral RISC-V NPU, transformer capabilities at a cost point he called unique, and a low-power design that can eliminate the need for heatsinks or fans in some partner designs. That combination speaks directly to real OEM pain. Power and thermals drive industrial design. They also drive the bill of materials and reliability.

CES 2026 gave Synaptics another chance to show that it is no longer a single-product story. In its CES showcase messaging, the company emphasized a broad portfolio of AI-native processing, sensing, and connectivity. It framed the demos around how “intelligence at the edge” transforms real-world applications.

Synaptics also did something important. According to its press release, it focused on experiences rather than features. The company described local processing of voice, gesture, and motion to improve responsiveness and privacy while reducing cloud dependence, and it tied that to long-range, reliable connectivity.

That is the right direction for Synaptics' marketing, because it starts to sound like a device conversation rather than a component conversation. However, at CES 2026, I offered Synaptics' marketing team the opportunity to schedule interviews for this article, but I was told no executives would be made available. That kind of gatekeeping inhibits the candid feedback the company badly needs to amp up its messaging in a more compelling manner that OEMs will value, as well as evolve Synaptics' brand legacy as a touchpad supplier.

That brings us to the Qualcomm partnership, which could matter more in 2026 than it did as a headline in late 2025.

Synaptics and Qualcomm described an engagement to combine Synaptics AI-ready touch and fingerprint sensing with Qualcomm compute and biometric security capabilities, aiming to simplify integration for OEMs and improve performance, security, and usability across the AI PC ecosystem.

The press release also framed this as a way to promote secure and intuitive user experiences and reduce design complexity. If Synaptics executes here, it does two things at once:

The most compelling part of this partnership is not “fingerprint plus touch” in the abstract. It is what it enables when you think in usage models. AI PCs want fast, low-friction authentication that users trust, paired with touch experiences that feel natural across new form factors. The engagement explicitly calls out integration across mobile and compute platforms, including AI PCs, and aims to accelerate time-to-market for OEMs and panel makers.

If the industry keeps pushing OLEDs and new industrial designs, Synaptics can ride that wave as more than just a legacy touch supplier. It can show up as a partner that helps make biometric security and human interaction feel seamless.

While I'm a technology analyst and not a financial one, I think it's helpful to point out how the market may be weighing the story.

Simply Wall Street recently pegged Synaptics' fair value at $87.18, versus a share price of $91, and called it slightly overvalued, while still focusing on catalysts such as Edge AI partnerships and CES showcases.

The same update highlights the Edgecore collaboration on an AIoT (AI + IoT) Edge Hub built on the Astra SL1620 with Veros wireless and Wi-Fi HaLow, positioned as a CES 2026 showcase item.

That kind of “partner plus reference design plus public demo” pattern often precedes broader design activity. Although it does not guarantee revenue in the next quarter, it does build credibility in emerging categories where customers want proof.

Now, the strategic gap Synaptics should address in 2026 is not technical. It is marketing and broader messaging. Synaptics already does a solid job explaining what its solutions do. You can see it in the way it describes Torq, security, developer tooling, and how Astra and Veros work together. However, it can do more to position itself as a subject matter expert at the device category level. That is a different muscle.

This approach has big implications and would be a significant departure from the Synaptics of the 2010s. It means Synaptics must speak more assertively about routers, smart home hubs, cameras, automobiles, and industrial gateways as product experiences, not just as silicon sockets.

Device OEMs will not always agree with Synaptics' usage-model perspective. That is fine. OEMs will still value the dialogue because it helps them pressure-test their own assumptions and can surface new feature priorities that lead to more silicon content.

Qualcomm offers a useful model here. Qualcomm does not just sell parts. It sells a worldview. At CES, it hosted multiple analyst sessions that spent significant time on how product categories are evolving from a usage-model standpoint, and those conversations felt candid because they emphasized learnings, trade-offs, and ecosystem friction, not just glossy claims.

Synaptics can emulate the approach at a scale that fits its size. It can create clearer “category playbooks” that explain what an AI-native router experience looks like, how multimodal sensing changes smart home automation, and where biometric trust will matter most in premium PCs. That kind of thought leadership makes design conversations easier, because OEMs can map Synaptics silicon to a product narrative their own teams can rally around.

Synaptics has an excellent lever for doing this cost-effectively. It can use AI tools to generate high-quality video explainers, demos, and scenario-based content without needing a massive production budget — after all, it's 2026, not 2010.

The company already showcases application-focused demos at CES that tie together Astra, Veros, and sensing to real use cases such as smart home automation and robotics. The next step is to productize the storytelling. Short videos that explain usage models, long-form sessions that walk through reference designs, and crisp visuals that show where on-device AI improves privacy, latency, and reliability can materially widen the top of the funnel.

AI improves privacy, latency, and reliability, and can materially widen the top of the funnel. In a design-in business, that visibility compounds. It helps new customers understand the company's value over time, even when near-term revenue looks lumpy.

My balanced take for 2026 is simple. Synaptics looks stronger heading into this year than it has in quite some time, thanks to credible pillars in sensing, connectivity, and edge compute, and is aligning them into a coherent platform story.

The Astra roadmap and Torq tooling make the Edge AI thesis more believable. The Qualcomm engagement can refresh Synaptics' relevance in premium interaction and security across PCs and beyond.

The company has a non-trivial opportunity in front of it. Synaptics is also building a partner ecosystem that includes visible demos and collaborations, which helps establish legitimacy in crowded markets. It must modernize its marketing efforts. If Synaptics invests in being a category-level thought leader, not just a component provider, it can improve design-in pull and reduce the perception gap that still follows it around. That wouldn't just help 2026. It would reshape Synaptics' long-term position in categories that are still being defined.

                                What happens here matters everywhere

Microsoft on Monday announced Maia 200, the second generation of its custom AI chip, claiming it's the most powerful first-party silicon from any major cloud provider. 

The company says Maia 200 delivers three times the performance of Amazon's latest Trainium chip on certain benchmarks, and exceeds Google's most recent tensor processing unit (TPU) on others.

The chip is already running workloads at Microsoft's data center near Des Moines, Iowa. Microsoft says Maia 200 is powering OpenAI's GPT-5.2 models, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and internal projects from its Superintelligence team. A second deployment at a data center near Phoenix is planned next.

It's part of the larger trend among cloud giants to build their own custom silicon for AI rather than rely solely on Nvidia. Google has been refining its TPUs for nearly a decade, and Amazon's Trainium line is now in its third generation, with a fourth already announced. 

Microsoft first revealed its custom chip ambitions in late 2023, when it unveiled Maia 100 at its Ignite conference. Despite entering the race late, Microsoft makes the case that its tight integration between chips, AI models, and applications like Copilot gives it an edge. 

The company says Maia 200 offers 30% better performance-per-dollar than its current hardware. Maia 200 also builds on the first-generation chip with a more specific focus on inference, the process of running AI models after they've been trained.

The chip competition among the cloud giants has intensified as the cost of running AI models becomes a bigger concern. Training a model is a one-time expense, but serving it to millions of users is a big ongoing expense. All three companies are betting that custom chips tuned for their own workloads will be cheaper than buying solely from Nvidia.

Microsoft is also opening the door to outside developers. The company announced a software development kit that will let AI startups and researchers optimize their models for Maia 200. Developers and academics can sign up for an early preview starting today.



University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

Better treatments for cancer, autoimmune diseases, viruses and more are now on the horizon thanks to groundbreaking work with artificial intelligence from a team of scientists at the University of Washington's Institute for Protein Design. Led by Nobel Prize winner David Baker, this team of Huskies uses AI tools to create proteins — biology's building blocks — that lay the foundation for new medicines. Together, this international group of students, faculty and researchers acts as a “communal brain,” with each Husky contributing ideas and expertise from their fields. The institute's recent breakthroughs — including an antivenom for snakebites, and antibiotics that combat drug-resistant bacteria — show how this innovative science can save and change lives.

Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. SEE MORE

In perhaps a matter of weeks, Bill Gates-backed TerraPower expects to receive federal permits to begin building the nuclear components of its first-of-a-kind, next-generation power plant in Wyoming. 

The permits will put the company “a year ahead of anyone else,” predicted TerraPower CEO Chris Levesque. “We just keep proving that we're the leading nuclear project in the U.S.”

After being largely mothballed for decades, America's nuclear sector has kicked into hyper speed as tech giants scramble to power data centers nationwide and energy demands are spiking for commercial, residential and industrial uses.

TerraPower, which launched 20 years ago, aims to be the first in the U.S. to deliver on a new model of smaller, less expensive nuclear reactors that can be produced in three years from fabricated components — instead of the past approach of constructing giant, one-off structures that take a decade to erect.

The company is waiting for a green light from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to break ground on the crucial next phase of its demonstration plant, whose construction in Kemmerer, Wyo., began in 2024. The goal is to start splitting atoms there by the end of 2030.

TerraPower's Natrium technology features 345 megawatt nuclear devices that include a molten-salt thermal battery that increases output to 500 megawatts of power for limited periods. 

The Bellevue, Wash.-based company has announced a string of new partnerships supporting its operations:

“We plan to build hundreds of Natrium reactors,” Levesque told GeekWire. “We're very focused on delivering the first one on time,” he added, and then quickly begin scaling. 

TerraPower is competing against a slate of next-gen nuclear companies. Oklo was part of the announcement from Meta to support nuclear deployments, and could have a reactor operating as early as 2030 under the deal. Kairos Power is building a demonstration reactor in Tennessee in collaboration with Google that aims to come online that same year.

Last month, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded two grants supporting nuclear projects, one to the Tennessee Valley Authority to build a plant in that state and another to Holtec Government Services, which has a project in Michigan. Earlier this summer, X-energy and Amazon shared updates on a planned facility in Eastern Washington.

While TerraPower's leadership is bullish on its prospects, there are plenty of hurdles ahead. They include limited supplies of reactor fuel, ongoing concerns about nuclear reactor safety, and construction cost challenges as designs evolve and a supply chain takes shape.

Finding fuel sources: Russia was the world's only commercial producer of HALEU (high-assay, low-enriched uranium fuel, pronounced hay-lou), but that source was cut off after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the U.S. has restarted and been ramping up its domestic fuel production.

Levesque said the company will have what it needs for the Wyoming reactor, and is working with partners in South Africa and the U.S. to manufacture additional supplies.

Safety concerns: There are ongoing fears about the potential for a nuclear reactor to meltdown and release radioactive material, and concerns about the disposal and storage of spent fuel that remains radioactive for thousands of years. 

At a recent public hearing in Olympia, Wash., regarding the potential for new nuclear facilities in the state, multiple participants cited worries about nuclear safety and environmental contamination.

Cost concerns: Research from Boston University analyzed nuclear plant construction costs going back decades, finding they were on average double the expected price tag, running nearly $2 billion over.

Levesque acknowledged the poor record, but said that as TerraPower goes into production mode, lessons learned from the demonstration project and each additional reactor will be incorporated to cut costs. He pointed to the SpaceX aerospace company as a model for that iterative approach.

But even if costs are controlled, some utility customers have expressed worries about who will pay for the deployment of the facilities and whether the projects will drive up electric bills.

The Wyoming plant was estimated in 2021 to cost about $4 billion; no updated figures have been provided. Levesque said private investments and a $2 billion federal grant mean that “we're building that project without burdening the ratepayers.”   

And demand for nuclear has never been greater. “Almost any governor in the country now wants a nuclear plant,” Levesque said. 

While wind and solar installations have expanded across America, electricity demand is projected to soar over the next years and decades. And while these renewable power sources are increasingly being paired with energy storage solutions such as giant batteries, nuclear is attractive for its 24/7 production capabilities.

Levesque said the company is being cautious in signing future deals, recognizing that it will be mid-2030s until it can hit its initial target of producing six reactors a year.

“We're very careful not to over promise or over commit,” he said.

Microsoft has announced the launch of its latest chip, the Maia 200, which the company describes as a silicon workhorse designed for scaling AI inference.

The 200, which follows the company's Maia 100 released in 2023, has been technically outfitted to run powerful AI models at faster speeds and with more efficiency, the company has said. Maia comes equipped with over 100 billion transistors, delivering over 10 petaflops in 4-bit precision and approximately 5 petaflops of 8-bit performance — a substantial increase over its predecessor.

Inference refers to the computing process of running a model, in contrast with the compute required to train it. As AI companies mature, inference costs have become an increasingly important part of their overall operating cost, leading to renewed interest in ways to optimize the process.

Microsoft is hoping that the Maia 200 can be part of that optimization, making AI businesses run with less disruption and lower power use. “In practical terms, one Maia 200 node can effortlessly run today's largest models, with plenty of headroom for even bigger models in the future,” the company said.

Microsoft's new chip is also part of a growing trend of tech giants turning to self-designed chips as a way to lessen their dependence on Nvidia, whose cutting-edge GPUs have become increasingly pivotal to AI companies' success. Google, for instance, has its TPU, the tensor processing units — which aren't sold as chips but as compute power made accessible through its cloud. Then there's Amazon Trainium, the e-commerce giant's own AI accelerator chip, which just launched its latest version, the Trainium3, in December. In each case, the TPUs can be used to offload some of the compute that would otherwise be assigned to Nvidia GPUs, lessening the overall hardware cost.

With Maia, Microsoft is positioning itself to compete with those alternatives. In its press release Monday, the company noted that Maia delivers 3x the FP4 performance of third-generation Amazon Trainium chips, and FP8 performance above Google's seventh generation TPU.

Microsoft says that Maia is already hard at work fueling the company's AI models from its Superintelligence team. It has also been supporting the operations of Copilot, its chatbot. As of Monday, the company said it has invited a variety of parties — including developers, academics, and frontier AI labs — to use its Maia 200 software development kit in their workloads.

Apple on Monday introduced the next version of its AirTag, which will now feature a longer Bluetooth range, a louder speaker, and improved precision-finding capabilities. The latter is powered by Apple's second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, which is also found in the iPhone 17 devices, iPhone Air, Apple Watch Series 11, and Apple Watch Ultra 3.

With Precision Finding, the new AirTag can offer haptic, visual, and audio feedback to guide users to their lost items. Now, those finding capabilities extend up to 50% farther away with the prior generation, Apple claims. The upgraded Bluetooth chip, meanwhile, also helps extend the range at which items can be located. 

Notably, with this update, Precision Finding will be accessible from the Apple Watch Series 9 or later and Apple Watch Ultra 2 or later. 

The device's speaker is also 50% louder than the prior generation, which means you can hear the AirTag's beep from up to two times farther away than before.

The AirTag devices will also integrate with Share Item Location, an iOS feature that allows users to temporarily share the AirTag's location with third parties. Today, 50 airlines are partnered with Apple for luggage tracking. 

One thing that hasn't changed is the AirTag's price: It's still $29 for a single AirTag and $99 for a four-pack, including free personalized engraving.

First launched in 2021, AirTag quickly came to dominate the market for Bluetooth-connected lost item finders, essentially forcing previous market leaders like Tile to quickly find an exit. The company alleged that Apple was unfairly competing as its finding network was instantly as big as the iPhone install base, and Apple was pushing AirTag rivals to integrate with its own Find My app. Other companies, like Chipolo, accepted Apple's offer to work with Find My and competed against AirTag with products that work across iOS and Android, or that have different features, like rechargeable batteries.

Still, Apple's AirTag remains the one to beat, with third-party estimates suggesting that nearly 70% of trackers sold in the latter part of 2024 were AirTag devices. Apple does not disclose its AirTag sales.

More than 450 tech workers from companies like Google, Meta, OpenAI, Amazon, and Salesforce have signed a letter urging their CEOs to call the White House and demand that United States Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) leave U.S. cities. 

“For months now, Trump has sent federal agents to our cities to criminalize us, our neighbors, friends, colleagues, and family members,” reads the open letter from IceOut.Tech. “From Minneapolis to Los Angeles to Chicago, we've seen armed and masked thugs bring reckless violence, kidnapping, terror and cruelty with no end in sight.”

Minneapolis has become the focal point of a large-scale federal immigration operation, employing tactics so intense that many have characterized it as a military occupation. The operation has been marked by confrontations between federal agents and community members protesting the raids, with law enforcement indiscriminately deploying crowd control tactics, including pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound cannons. 

“This cannot continue, and we know the tech industry can make a difference,” the letter from tech industry workers continues. “When Trump threatened to send the National Guard to San Francisco in October, tech industry leaders called the White House. It worked: Trump backed down.”

The campaign among tech workers began after ICE agents shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis three weeks ago, and it grew over the weekend after Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital.

The organizers of the letter did not disclose their names, and many who signed the letter did so anonymously out of fear of retribution. TechCrunch has reached out for more information. 

A number of tech leaders have already spoken out against federal actions in Minneapolis. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman said the way ICE operates is “terrible for the people,” and Khosla Ventures founder Vinod Khosla called the current enforcement “macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration.” Google DeepMind's chief scientist Jeff Dean called for “every person regardless of political affiliation” to denounce the escalation of violence. OpenAI's head of global business, James Dyett, criticized the industry's silence, posting on X that “there is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities.”

Signal President Meredith Whittaker bemoaned that masked agents are “executing people in the streets and powerful leaders are openly lying to cover for them. To everyone in my industry who's ever claimed to value freedom — draw on the courage of your convictions and stand up.”

Still, many of the most powerful figures in tech leaders have not only largely stayed quiet about opposition to the Trump administration's directives, but they have actively attempted to curry favor with the president. Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg all attended during President Trump's inauguration and donated to the inauguration fund either personally or through their corporations. None have spoken out publicly about the ramping up of ICE raids.

OpenAI president Greg Brockman and his wife Anna are also prominent donors to causes and candidates associated with President Trump and have refrained from speaking out. In keeping with his anti-immigration views, Elon Musk has actively supported ICE operations, calling protestors “pure evil.” 

The letter also calls on tech CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE — potentially an expensive demand, as several tech firms currently hold contracts with ICE. Palantir is one of ICE's most significant tech partners. Last year the company was awarded a $30 million contract to build a new AI-driven surveillance platform called “ImmigrationOS.” Last year, facial recognition company Clearview AI signed a contract to provide ICE with facial-matching technology. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Oracle also provide cloud infrastructure to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, as well as IT services.

British startup Synthesia, whose AI platform helps companies create interactive training videos, has raised a $200 million Series E round of funding that brings its valuation to $4 billion — up from $2.1 billion just a year ago.

Unlike some other AI startups that are still a long way from turning a profit, Synthesia has found a lucrative business in transforming corporate training thanks to AI-generated avatars. With enterprise clients including Bosch, Merck, and SAP, the London-based company crossed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in April 2025.

This milestone explains why Synthesia's venture backers are literally doubling down. The Series E that nearly doubled its valuation was led by existing investor GV (Google Ventures), with participation from several other previous backers — including Series B lead Kleiner Perkins, Series C lead Accel, Series D lead New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Nvidia's venture capital arm NVentures, Air Street Capital, and PSP Growth. 

Aside from ongoing support, this round will bring both new and departing investors. On one hand, Matt Miller's VC firm Evantic and the secretive VC firm Hedosophia are joining the cap table as new entrants. On the other hand, Synthesia will facilitate an employee secondary sale in partnership with Nasdaq, TechCrunch has learned.

To be clear, Synthesia isn't going public just yet — Nasdaq isn't acting as a public exchange in this operation, but as a private markets facilitator that will help early team members turn their shares into cash. These employee stock sales often happen outside of this framework, but usually at prices either below or above the company's official valuation, and are sometimes frowned upon by other shareholders. With this process, all sales will be tied to the same $4 billion valuation as Synthesia's Series E, while the company keeps an element of control.

“This secondary is first and foremost about our employees,” Synthesia CFO Daniel Kim told TechCrunch. “It gives employees a meaningful opportunity to access liquidity and share in the value they've helped create, while we continue to operate as a private company focused on long-term growth.”

For Synthesia, this long-term growth involves going beyond expressive videos and embracing the AI agents trend. According to a press release, the company is developing AI agents that will let its clients' employees “interact with company knowledge in a more intuitive, human-like way by asking questions, exploring scenarios through role-play, and receiving tailored explanations.”

The company said early pilots have received positive feedback from customers, who reported higher engagement and faster knowledge transfer compared to traditional formats. This positive response explains why Synthesia now plans to make agents a “core strategic focus” to invest in, alongside further product improvements to its existing platform.

While it didn't disclose revenue forecasts, the company hopes its platform will offer a welcome answer to the struggles of enterprises in keeping their workforce adequately trained despite rapid changes. “We see a rare convergence of two major shifts: a technology shift with AI agents becoming more capable, and a market shift where upskilling and internal knowledge sharing have become board-level priorities,” Synthesia's co-founder and CEO Victor Riparbelli said in a statement.

Seeing boards care more about employees as a result of AI wasn't on anyone's bingo card, except perhaps Riparbelli. Together with his co-founder, Synthesia COO Steffen Tjerrild, Riparbelli took the initiative of conducting a secondary sale so that employees could share in the success of the unicorn company. Founded in 2017, Synthesia now has more than 500 team members, a 20,000-square-foot HQ in London, and additional offices in Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Munich, New York City, and Zurich.

While unusual for a British startup, this coordinated secondary sale isn't a first and likely not a last, Synthesia's head of corporate affairs and policy, Alexandru Voica told TechCrunch. “My guess is that as [U.K.-based] private companies stay private longer, this type of structured, cross-border employee liquidity may become increasingly common, so I wouldn't be surprised to see others do it, either with Nasdaq or others,” he predicted.

Leftists, with Western pro-Khomeini protests, not just in Iran, with the usual involvement from the KGB, and the CIA opposing, brought Khomeini to power with claims that he would bring a communist revolution. As per tradition in a communist revolution, first thing he did once in power is execute communist allies. Of course, Iran is still allied with the KGB (now FSB) and Moscow, currently delivering weapons and weapon designs for use in the war against Ukraine.You could also point out that Iran is kind-of socialist, in the sense that the state controls, at minimum, 70% of the economy, and all those ""companies"" are directly controlled by the government.So socialists are still at it, supporting the ayatollah, for example:https://marxist.com/iran-for-a-nationwide-uprising-down-with...Note: yes, I get what the title says, but read. IN the article you'll find an insane rant about how Israel and the US are really behind the revolution and how despite that the regime really held back, and this popular revolution, if it fails will bring back national Iranian pride, and the revolution failing will be the final push that ayatollah's need to actually bring the communist revolution to Iran

Note that this works both ways: ""Interesting that the same western media outlets which spent two years nonstop covering Gaza are totally fine not even having a single article about the massacre committed by the islamist iranian regime. And, no, before the trolls descend, of course I'm not questioning that lots of innocent people have been killed in Gaza."".And ""Interesting that the same protesters who spent months protesting on US and EU campuses for Gaza are not protesting to defend the protesters massacred en masse by the iranian regime. And, no, before the trolls descend, of course I'm not questioning that lots of innocent people have been killed in Gaza"".We don't know if the numbers are true but we're literally talking about half the death in two years in Gaza in a few days in Iran.

And ""Interesting that the same protesters who spent months protesting on US and EU campuses for Gaza are not protesting to defend the protesters massacred en masse by the iranian regime. And, no, before the trolls descend, of course I'm not questioning that lots of innocent people have been killed in Gaza"".We don't know if the numbers are true but we're literally talking about half the death in two years in Gaza in a few days in Iran. I don't know if people realize the level of horrors we're talking about here.

You can also protest to make sure the horrors aren't forgotten and to signal to those suffering in Iran that they aren't alone.

reply

I don't know that anyone thinks a state's violence against its citizens is less immoral. It's more that countries are more hesitant to get militarily involved in the domestic affairs of another country because it would mean essentially declaring war against that state. But in a conflict between states, an outsider can more easily support one side militarily without declaring war against the other side.

reply

Luckily we have largely moved past that view.I think as a purely practical matter, moral outrage is shaped by who controls the information space. If you are a country being invaded, you probably have an organized, well funded communication department to tell your side. If you are an Iranian protestor, not only do you not have that, you don't even have internet at all because the state cut off all means of communication.

As for the numbers:  Interior Ministry reports say security forces confronted demonstrators in more than 400 cities and towns, with more than 4,000 clash locations reported nationwide

it's on the order of 100 deaths at each of 400 locations (clearly not uniformly distributed, some locations would have had many more deaths).As to the how, the article suggests some deaths immediately occurred in crowds - firing, dispersing, funneling, crush injuries, etc. leading to many intakes to hospitals and treatment tents etc ... followed by execution of the injured.It's grim stuff.Some years past the waves of the Rwanda massacres saw almost a million people killed in bursts across 100 days, mostly with machetes and hand guns.The numbers reported here are absolutely feasible, the reporting is certainly questionable; bad things happened, but was it at the claimed scale?

If Palestine had full US backing they would push Israelis in to the ocean and claiming otherwise is dishonest.
UAE is the largest backer of Palestine, they have no qualms backing genocide in Sudan. So it's just as reasonable to claim jihadism has no respect for property or for life.This isn't whataboutism, if this money wasn't flowing you wouldn't hear about it.

The end of the regime was brought about by an incursion into the Vietnamese border town of Ba Chúc, resulting in the massacre of more than 3000 civilians.

This is not a comment of support of the Iranian regime, or against the people of Iran to have which ever government they see fit.But these numbers are simply not credible.

There is no guarantee a post-islamic Iran would step into line, and it would remain a regional power that would be much harder to justify continued sanctions against.A part of me suspects the incredibly conspicuous endorsement of the protestors by the US/Israel regime is an attempt to discredit them. A zombie regime under the Mullahs will likely to continue to implode economically, which means they are less able to defend themselves from US/Israeli attacks in the future.

It won't work: drivers usually require exact (or more-or-less the same) kernel module version. That's why you need to explicitly exclude graphics libraries from being packaged into AppImage.

But I'm always a bit sceptical about such approaches. They are not universal. You still need glibc/musl to be the same on the target system. Also, if you compile againt new glibc version, but try to run on old glibc version, it might not work.These are just strange and confusing from the end users' perspective.

You can change the rpath though, which is sort of like an LD_LIBRARY_PATH baked into the object, which makes it relatively easy to bundle everything but libc with your binary.edit: Mild correction, there is this: https://sourceforge.net/projects/statifier/ But the way this works is that it has the dynamic linker load everything (without ASLR / in a compact layout, presumably) and then dumps an image of the process.
Everything else is just increasingly fancy ways of copying shared objects around and making ld.so prefer the bundled libraries.

In practice, a statically linked system is often smaller than a meticulously dynamically linked one - while there are many copies of common routines, programs only contain tightly packed, specifically optimized and sometimes inlined versions of the symbols they use. The space and performance gain per program is quite significant.Modern apps and containers are another issue entirely - linking doesn't help if your issue is gigabytes of graphical assets or using a container base image that includes the entire world.

In decades of using and managing many kinds of computers I have seen only a handful of dynamic libraries for whom security updates have been useful, e.g. OpenSSL.On the other hands, I have seen countless problems caused by updates of dynamic libraries that have broken various applications, not only on Linux, but even on Windows and even for Microsoft products, such as Visual Studio.I have also seen a lot of space and time wasted by the necessity of having installed in the same system, by using various hacks, a great number of versions of the same dynamic library, in order to satisfy the conflicting requirements of various applications. I have also seen systems bricked by a faulty update of glibc, if they did not have any statically-linked rescue programs.On Windows such problems are much less frequent only because a great number of applications bundle with the them, in their own directory, the desired versions of various dynamic libraries, and Windows is happy to load those libraries. On UNIX derivatives, this usually does not work as the dynamic linker searches only standard places for libraries.Therefore, in my opinion static linking should always be the default, especially for something like the standard C library. Dynamic linking shall be reserved for some very special libraries, where there are strong arguments that this should be beneficial, i.e. that there really exists a need to upgrade the library without upgrading the main executable.Golang is probably an anomaly. C-based programs are rarely much bigger when statically linked than when dynamically linked. Only using ""printf"" is typically implemented in such a way that it links a lot into any statically-linked program, so the C standard libraries intended for embedded computers typically have some special lightweight ""printf"" versions, to avoid this overhead.

In the most security-forward roles I've worked in, the vast, vast majority of vulnerabilities identified in static binaries, Docker images, Flatpaks, Snaps, and VM appliance images fell into these categories:1. The vendor of a given piece of software based their container image on an outdated version of e.g. Debian, and the vulnerabilities were coming from that, not the software I cared about. This seems like it supports your point, but consider: the overwhelming majority of these required a distro upgrade, rather than a point dependency upgrade of e.g. libcurl or whatnot, to patch the vulnerabilities. Countless times, I took a normal long-lived Debian test VM and tried to upgrade it to the patched version and then install whatever piece of software I was running in a docker image, and had the upgrade fail in some way (everything from the less-common ""doesn't boot"" to the very-common ""software I wanted didn't have a distribution on its website for the very latest Debian yet, so I was back to hand-building it with all of the dependencies and accumulated cruft that entails"").2. Vulnerabilities that were unpatched or barely patched upstream (as in: a patch had merged but hadn't been baked into released artifacts yet--this applied equally to vulns in things I used directly, and vulns in their underlying OSes).3. Massive quantities of vulnerabilities reported in ""static"" languages' standard libraries. Golang is particularly bad here, both because they habitually over-weight the severity of their CVEs and because most of the stdlib is packaged with each Golang binary (at least as far as SBOM scanners are concerned).That puts me somewhat between a rock and a hard place. A dynamic-link-everything world with e.g. a ""libgolang"" versioned separately from apps would address the 3rd item in that list, but would make the 1st item worse. ""Updates are far quicker and easier"" is something of a fantasy in the realm of mainstream Linux distros (or copies of the userlands of those distros packaged into container images); it's certainly easier to mechanically perform an update of dependency components of a distro, but whether or not it actually works is another question.And I'm not coming at this from a pro-container-all-the-things background. I was a Linux sysadmin long before all this stuff got popular, and it used to be a little easier to do patch cycles and point updates before container/immutable-image-of-userland systems established the convention of depending on extremely specific characteristics of a specific revision of a distro. But it was never truly easy, and isn't easy today.

1. The vendor of a given piece of software based their container image on an outdated version of e.g. Debian, and the vulnerabilities were coming from that, not the software I cared about. This seems like it supports your point, but consider: the overwhelming majority of these required a distro upgrade, rather than a point dependency upgrade of e.g. libcurl or whatnot, to patch the vulnerabilities. Countless times, I took a normal long-lived Debian test VM and tried to upgrade it to the patched version and then install whatever piece of software I was running in a docker image, and had the upgrade fail in some way (everything from the less-common ""doesn't boot"" to the very-common ""software I wanted didn't have a distribution on its website for the very latest Debian yet, so I was back to hand-building it with all of the dependencies and accumulated cruft that entails"").2. Vulnerabilities that were unpatched or barely patched upstream (as in: a patch had merged but hadn't been baked into released artifacts yet--this applied equally to vulns in things I used directly, and vulns in their underlying OSes).3. Massive quantities of vulnerabilities reported in ""static"" languages' standard libraries. Golang is particularly bad here, both because they habitually over-weight the severity of their CVEs and because most of the stdlib is packaged with each Golang binary (at least as far as SBOM scanners are concerned).That puts me somewhat between a rock and a hard place. A dynamic-link-everything world with e.g. a ""libgolang"" versioned separately from apps would address the 3rd item in that list, but would make the 1st item worse. ""Updates are far quicker and easier"" is something of a fantasy in the realm of mainstream Linux distros (or copies of the userlands of those distros packaged into container images); it's certainly easier to mechanically perform an update of dependency components of a distro, but whether or not it actually works is another question.And I'm not coming at this from a pro-container-all-the-things background.

No idea why the glibc can't provide API+ABI stability, but on Linux it always comes down to glibc related ""DLL hell"" problems (e.g. not being able to run an executable that was created on a more recent Linux system on an older Linux system even when the program doesn't access any new glibc entry points - the usually adviced solution is to link with an older glibc version, but that's also not trivial, unless you use the Zig toolchain).TL;DR: It's not static vs dynamic linking, just glibc being a an exceptionally shitty solution as operating system interface.

Look at the hoops you sometimes have to jump through or hacks you have to apply to make something work on Nix, just because there is no standardization or build processes assume library locations etc. And if you then raise an issue with the software maintainer - the response is often ""but we don't support Nix"". And if they're not Nix/Nixos users, can you blame them?If you've ever had to compile a modern/recent software package for an old distro (I've had to do this for old RH distro's on servers which due to regulations could not be upgraded) - you're in a world of pain. And both distro and software maintainers will say ""not my problem, we don't support this"" - and I fully understand their stance on that, because it is far from straight forward, and only serves a limited audience.

reply

Even with multiple processes sharing the same DLL I would be surprised if the alternative of those processes only containing the code they actually need would increase RAM usage dramatically, especially since most processes that run in the background on a typical Linux system wouldn't event even need to go through glibc but could talk directly to the syscall interface.DLLs are fine as operating system interface as long as they are stable (e.g. Windows does it right, glibc doesn't). But apart from operating system interfaces and plugins, overusing dynamic linking just doesn't make a lot of sense (like on most Linux systems with their package managers).

It's interesting you focus on ""the west"" when we have solid proof about e.g. Russian interference in many an election and protest via social media. From paid propagandist (e.g. Tim Pool) to the Internet Research Agency. The only factual information we have about anything remotely similar from ""the west"" was that research about Facebook activity in the Central African Republic being roughly 40/40/20 split between Russians, French, and actual locals. And even that isn't comparable because the French online campaign was mostly combatting Russian disinformation propaganda, not trying to bring about a coup or stoking tensions to get to a civil war.> Showing the result of the western sponsored genocide in GazaThe genocide in Gaza is not ""sponsored"" by the ""west"". US, maybe.

The UK is doing some shitty stuff and a man was arrested for wearing a “Plasticine Action” t-shirt a few weeks ago, “Palestine Action” being a proscribed group in the UK, and showing support being an offence. When the mistake was realised he was released after a few hours with an apology.These things are objectively terrible, shouldn't be happening. The UK government is under popular and legal pressure to un-proscribe the group as hundreds (thousands?) have been arrested and charged.But it is not the same as someone being ‘disappeared' in South American dictatorships, where they would be taken and denied process for years if not killed outright. Yet people here drew that comparison. He was arrested for inconvenient speech! It's the same! And then I came under fire for defending the actions of the UK, having done nothing of the sort.It's really weird to watch.

About 2 decades ago I read an article about how bureucracies don't even allow for humor any more, e.g. even clearly joking about having a bomb in the airport is now taboo. Something about rigid inhumane inflexible rules, in my vague memory of that article.Where airport security has to examine babies for terrorist motives, because it's written in the rules, fuck human reasoning!Heh in my own estimation arresting supporters of Palestine Action for peacefully protesting is already too close to Iranian autocracy ideal and too far from a ""democratic country"" ideal which the UK used to be...

It's awful that they're arresting people with “Palestine Action” t-shirts too. It's just not the same thing as actually disappearing people.That's the point of this thread, no? Things can be bad in different ways and to different degrees.If I say I don't like the way you just spoke about my sister and punch you in the gut, that's a pretty shitty thing to do.If I say I don't like the way you just spoke about my sister and cut your throat then bury your body in the forest, I would like to think we can agree that's worse.

The important point is, if the erosion of civil liberties continues, these governments are losing their high ground. They must stop.As in the Cold War, I would give an allowance for the West to still be preferable (modulo strict rights record) if they actually muster some sort of power to confront tyranny. But if the rulers only want cheap rhetoric wins, no.

If South American dictatorships could have their way with less blood and less noise, don't you think they would prefer that?I'm reminded of a tragicomic recent admission from Nate Silver of 538 fame. He said Disney almost never interfered in their editorial process, as if that was a good thing. What that really meant, after all, was that Disney was perfectly willing to interfere in their editorial process, but almost never felt the need to. (As you would expect. I mean, why would Disney care about political polling?)Could it similarly be that the UK government is perfectly willing to engage in brutal political suppression, but rarely has a need to? In that case maybe people are right to sound the alarm even though we haven't reached South American dictatorship levels yet.

I think it's likely they will get still more scared that they won't, and ramp up the brutality accordingly.The path forward is clear: Reform gets into power, builds their own paramilitary ""immigration enforcement"" groups a la ICE, and you get the occasional summary execution in the streets, along with arrests based on UKs unmatched surveillance system.

And even if the man was wearing a proper ""Palestine Action"" shirt that'd still be pretty concerning. It is an insane stretch to say that wearing a shirt represents a matter for police action. How far the world has moved on from when the UK could be considered a forward-thinking bastion of liberalism.

If you're not aware of the history of people being disappeared by states such as Chile under Pinochet, or more broadly what it means for a state to disappear someone, that's kinda on you.Either way these are not equivalent actions.Yes, it's suppression of free speech in a chilling manner. I hate it. No, it's not the same as suppressing that speech by taking someone and holding them in a secret prison for years and/or killing them.

It's a mistake to take things like trial by jury, open justice ( not secret courts ), non-arbitrary detention, even regular elections for granted.I totally agree with you that the UK is not Iran and there is too much hyperbole - but at the same time the current government is trying to criminalise legitimate protest, cancelling elections and trying to remove trial by jury for a substantial set of things  ( the ultimate protection against an authoritarian state ).As an example, it's very telling that the government ensured that in all the Assange legal proceedings it never went before a jury.The current government creating all these precedents, in the shadow of the prospect of a potential Reform government is something I think we should all be concerned about.

The idea that the state can deprive you of your freedom for a sentence likely to be less than 3 years without the chance to be tried before you peers, is worrying.Note is was six months before Nov 2024, it's 12 months now and they are looking to extend to 3 years!

I can't do anything about iran, i don't live there, neither does anyone else commenting here it seems... but many of us do live in EU, and are bothered by EU doing the same thing as iran, even if it's on a smaller scale (for now). You can't support censorship at home and then act outraged when someone else just implements more of it... even though some do, as long as the censored things are the things they personally don't like.To be fair, i'm more worried about UK, since it's a ""test ground"" to see how things work before the bad thing are implemented elsewhere, but either way, in my small country we have a saying, that ""people should first sweep infront of their own doorways"", and yeah, EU and our censorship is my doorway in this case.TLDR: if we're bothered by internet censorship, we should first stop at 'at home'.

On the other hand, there are many people from EU here who need to hear it, that EU is doing the same as iran... censoring websites and more (IDs, chat control,...). Yes, maybe not at the same level, less sites are censored here, but censorship is still censorship, and the trend is going towards more control and more censorship.United states, israel (and palestine), etc. are different. Are we bothered by what israel is doing in palestine? Yes! (some of us). Can we actually do something about it? Sure... the germans can tell their government to stop selling weapons to israel [0], we can implement sanctions, tarrifs, etc. This is something that we can do ""at home"", something that can make some change. We did that for russia, we did that for iran, north korea etc (at various times and various levels), but we did something. We didn't really do that (at least not at scale) for isreal. US is doing that to us (EU) with tarrifs every two weeks, but we didn't really properly respond, even under the threat of an invasion on greenland.Yes, restricted internet in iran is bad, but we can't stop it.

Lets make this clear: ""Spain"" is not blocking, some ISP companies which have many users ask the judge for permission to block IP ranges because they are streaming football matches. The judge agrees (they don't seem to know how Cloudflare works), so the ISPs are the ones that are blocking their own users to access sites behind Cloudflare. As they have millions of users, the block feels huge, but it is not issued by the government.I am not a customer of those ISP, so my internet isn't disrupted at all during football matches. Some services, like annas-archive and torrent sites, are intermittently blocked, but you can easily avoid the blocks just by switching DNS server to 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8.

In ""normal"" filtering situations, we can connect to most VPNs and do our stuff.
When blackouts like these happen, EVERYTHING is blocked. It gets almost impossible to connect to a VPN. They have advanced tech that detects and blocks all VPNS and proxies. The internet speed is also now at crawling speed so you really can't upload download anything.Also, in each blackout, people find ways to work around the censorship. And each time, they detect them and patch them. We have almost ran out of ways to prevent the censorship now.

All other platforms (instant messengers, social media, news) are massively unpopular for being horrid to use at best, and government spyware at worst.To slow down the immediate damage the government has rolled back a few of the recent restrictions, hence why I can access HN. Among Google and a handful of other basic websites. But they are obviously experimenting and trying to figure out how much censorship they can get away with. There is talk of a planned ""whitelisting"" of the country's internet. Where almost all but a few big important services are blocked completely. This would have the bonus effect of making circumvention using VPNs and other methods even more difficult than it already is.

The way that I see it, its not just a technical problem anymore. It's about making the methods as diverse as possible and to some extent messing up the network for everyone. In other words, we should increase the cost and the collateral damage of widespread censorship. As an anecdotal data point, the network was quite tightly controlled / monitored around 2023 in Iran and nothing worked reliably. Eventually people (ab)used the network (for example the tls fragments method) to the extent that most of the useful and unrelated websites (e.g., anything behind cloudflare, most of the Hetzner IPv4 addresses, and more) stopped working or were blocked. This was an unacceptably high collateral damage for the censors (?), so they ""eased"" some of the restrictions. Vless and Trojan were the same at that time and didn't work or were blocked very quickly, but they started working ~reliably again until very recently.[1] https://www.petsymposium.org/foci/

Plus, the elites economic prosperity is also linked to their not being protests and for the toppling of govt to not occur and they might be willing to offset some losses to keep the average population in checkWhich sucks for the average iranian but we saw how their protests were cracked down with 20-30 THOUSAND people killed and Iran hiding bodies etc.I have heard that all shops are either shut down or running at the most minimum capacity. Economic prosperity just isn't a question now in Iran.

This can be overriden to use ""Starlink positioning"" where the terminal ignores GPS signals and dtermines its position based on Starlink satellite signals. I think this is what is used in Ukraine where GPS is mostly jammed/spoofed to hell even far from the front.The GPS positioning is the default as it is likely more user friendly/has quicker lock in normal circumstances.Another venue of attack could be the Starlink WiFi AP included in the terminals- you could track that down.So in general:* switch the terminal to Starlink positioning* disable the Starkink terminal WiFi AP and conect by ethernet or connect an AP via ethernet with a new SSID and different MAC addressAnd it should be good to go.

While that gives some ideas of how widespread the jamming is, it won't give accurate information about the range (air traffic avoids areas with jamming) of the interference or any information from places where there is no commercial air traffic (war zones, etc).

reply

Definitely much easier to jam. Much higher orbits for gnss satellites, much lower signal intensity.Also, starlink uses phased arrays with beamforming, effectively creating an electronically steerable directional antenna. It is harder to jam two directional antennas talking to each other, as your jammers are on the sides, where the lobes of the antenna radiation pattern are smaller.Still, we're talking about signals coming from space, so maybe it is just enough to sprinkle more jammers in an urban setting.. I'm curious as well.

The components needed to build jammers and EW systems have been heavily commodified for a decade now (hell, your phone's power brick, car, and TV all have dual use components for these kinds of applications), and most regional powers have been working on compound semiconductors and offensive electronic warfare for almost a generation now.

reply

Iran was reported to have mobile units with a fairly short range that constantly roamed around, only hitting 2 of the 3 bands (Ku/Ka). They're also reported to have received mobile Russian military units capable of jamming all 3 (X/Ku/Ka) over a much wider area. (I'm not actually clear the extent to which X band is associated with either Starlink or Starshield. Starshield also reportedly operates to at least some extent in parts of the S band. [0])So the technology clearly exists but it doesn't seem to be something you can trivially throw together in your basement. That's quite unlike (for example) a cell phone jammer which a hobbyist can cheaply and easily assemble at home. I assume the extreme directional specificity of the antennas plays a large part in that.[0] https://www.npr.org/2025/10/17/nx-s1-5575254/spacex-starshie...

The Scottish independence movement is a very strong, grass roots campaign that has been building for many decades ( pre-web never mind pre-twitter ), with the Scottish ambivalence to the Union having deep cultural roots.What keeps Gaza and the wider actions of the current Israel government in the news is the constant killings and injustices. If they didn't want to be in the news perhaps they could stop killing people.Next you will be telling me Minnesota is only in the news due to Russia bots - and nothing to do with the killing of civilians on the streets.

I am saying that there is evidence that the amount of media (and I am including X/Twitter and other social media) attention given to various causes around the world is actively manipulated. This is in response to a comment querying the perceived disparity in media coverage of events. Not that these events are or are not occurring or a more 'worthy' cause than one another.I very much understand the history around Scottish independence, but unfortunately it will take me a lot of convincing to genuinely believe that twitter accounts in Iran sharing news that Balmoral castle has been taken over by protestors [1] are well meaning.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20260117184736/https://www.teleg...

If you don't believe Iranian tweets are a major factor in Scottish independence - then why mention it?And while I agree there is a lot of media manipulation attempts out there - I'd argue, if you take your Iran/Israel issue as an example - do you truely believe that Iran is outgunning Israel in this regard??In terms of coverage - did this incident gget much coverage? https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20260125-israeli-forces-ki...In the 848 days since Oct 2023, 1109 people have been killed within the occupied terrorities by Israeli government forces or settlers.That's more than 1 a day. Are you arguing that has disproportionate coverage?I'd argue it hardly gets a mention.

This is factually incorrect.

Because software developers typically understand how to implement a solution to problem better than the client. If they don't have enough details to implement a solution, they will ask the client for details. If the developer decides to use an LLM to implement a solution, they have the ability to assess the end product.The problem is software developers cost money. A developer using an LLM may reduce the cost of development, but it is doubtful that the reduction in cost will be sufficient to justify personalized applications in many cases. Most of the cases where it would justify the cost would likely be in domains where custom software is in common use anyhow.Sure, you will see a few people using LLMs to develop personalized software for themselves. Yet these will be people who understand how to specify the problem they are trying to solve clearly, will have the patience to handle the quirks and bugs in the software they create, and may even enjoy the process. You may even have a few small and medium sized businesses hiring developers who use LLMs to create custom software. But I don't think you're going to see the wholesale adoption of personalized software.And that only considers the ability of people to specify the problem they are trying to solve. There are other considerations, such as interoperability. We live in a networked world after all, and interoperability was important even before everything was networked.

1) Your specific analogy is kinda missing something important: I don't want my tools working differently every time I use them, also it's work to use LLMs. A hammer is kind of a too-simple example, but going with it anyway: when I need a hammer, I don't want my ""LLM"" generating a plastic one, then having to iterate for 30 minutes to get it right. It takes me far less than 30 minutes to go to my shed. A better example is would be a UI, even if it was perfect, do you want all the buttons and menus to be different every time you use the tool? Because you generate a new one each time instead of ""going to the shed""?2) Then there's the question, can an LLM actually build, or does it just regurgitate? A hammer is an extremely we'll understood tool, that's been refined over centuries, so I think an LLM could do a pretty good job with one. There are lots of examples, but that also means the designs the LLM is referencing are probably better than the LLM's output. And then for things not like that, more unique, can the LLM even do it at all or with a reasonable amount of effort?I think there's a modern phenomenon where making things ""easier"" actually results in worse outcomes, a degraded typical state vs. the previous status quo, because it turns what was once a necessity into a question of personal discipline. And it turns out when you remove necessity, a lot of people have a real hard time doing the best thing on discipline alone. LLMs might just enable more of those degenerate outcomes: everyone's using ""custom"" LLM generated tools all the time, but they all actually suck and are worse than if we just put that effort into designing the tools manually.

There are lots of examples, but that also means the designs the LLM is referencing are probably better than the LLM's output. And then for things not like that, more unique, can the LLM even do it at all or with a reasonable amount of effort?I think there's a modern phenomenon where making things ""easier"" actually results in worse outcomes, a degraded typical state vs. the previous status quo, because it turns what was once a necessity into a question of personal discipline. And it turns out when you remove necessity, a lot of people have a real hard time doing the best thing on discipline alone. LLMs might just enable more of those degenerate outcomes: everyone's using ""custom"" LLM generated tools all the time, but they all actually suck and are worse than if we just put that effort into designing the tools manually.

Seriously though, you can tell AI what libraries and conventions you want to follow... that's been a lot of what I've done with it recently... I've been relatively pleased with the results.I've said several times that it's not perfect, but it is an overall force multiplier.  It's much like working disconnected with an overseas dev team, but you get turn around in minutes instead of the next morning in your email.  The better instructions/specs you give, the better the results.  On my best day, I got about 3 weeks of what would take me alone done, after about 3 hours of planning/designing and another 2-3 hours of iteration with Claude Code.  On my worst day, it was frustrating and it would have been about the same amount of time doing it myself.  On average, I'd say I get close to 5 days of work done in 5-6 hours of AI assisted coding.  Purely anecdotally.That said, I usually have a technical mind for how I want the solution structured as well as features and how those features work... often it clashes with the AI approach and sometimes it swims nicely.  I'll also say that not all AI coding is the same or even close in terms of usefulness.

IMO you only need to look at the 30+ year history of Linux to see how wrong this prediction is. There will be a small group of people who do as you say, but the other 95% will happily pay for someone else to take care of their problem. Convenience is the supreme king of the American market.

When (not if) software breaks in production, you need to be able to debug it effectively. Knowing that external libraries do their base job is really helpful in reducing the search space and in reducing the blast radius of patches.Note that this is not AI-specific. More generally, in-house implementations of software that is not your core business brings costs that are not limited to that of writing said implementation.

A good question but there's a good answer: Debugged and tested code.And by that, I mean the FULL spectrum of debugging and testing. Not just unit tests, not even just integration tests, but, is there a user that found this useful? At all? How many users? How many use cases? How hard has it been subjected to the blows of the real world?As AI makes some of the other issues less important, the ones that remain become more important. It is completely impossible to ask an LLM to produce a code base that has been used by millions of people for five years. Such things will still have value.The idea that the near-future is an AI powered wonderland of everyone getting custom bespoke code that does exactly what they want and everything is peachy is overlooking this problem. Even a (weakly) superhuman AI can't necessarily anticipate what the real world may do to a code base. Even if I can get an AI to make a bespoke photo editor, someone else's AI photo editor that has seen millions of person-years of usage is going to have advantages over my custom one that was just born.Of course not all code is like this. There is a lot of low-consequence, one-off code, with all the properties we're familiar with on that front, like, there are no security issues because only I will run this, bugs are of no consequence because it's only ever going to be run across this exact data set that never exposes them (e.g., the vast, vast array of bash scripts that will technically do something wrong with spaces in filenames but ran just fine because there weren't any). LLMs are great for that and unquestionably will get better.However there will still be great value in software that has been tested from top to bottom, for suitability, for solving the problem, not just raw basic unit tests but for surviving contact with the real world for millions/billions/trillions of hours. In fact the value of this may even go up in a world suddenly oversupplied with the little stuff. You can get a custom hammer but you can't get a custom hammer that has been tested in the fire of extensive real-world use, by definition.

It can be mitigated by PR submitters doing a review and edit pass prior to submitting a PR. But a lot of submitters don't currently do this, and in my experience the average quality of PRs generated by AI is definitely significantly lower than those not generated by AI.

I can't think of even a single example of OSS being monetized through direct user engagement.  The bulk of it just isn't monetized at all, and what is monetized (beyond like a tip jar situation where you get some coffee money every once in a while) is primarily sponsored by enterprise users, support license sales, or through grants, or something like that.  A few projects like Krita sell binaries on the steam store.

All of those examples are the ""direct user engagement"" in question. No one tips a tip jar that they don't see.

Now it reads (usually) only newly incoming text, I can feel around the screen  to read a line at a time, and cursor tracking works well enough. Then I got Emacs and Emacspeak working, having Gemini build DecTalk (TTS engine) for Termux and get the Emacspeak DecTalk speech server working with that. I'm still amazed that, with a Bluetooth keyboard, I have Linux, and Emacs, in my pocket. I can write Org and Markdown, read EPUB books in Emacs with Nov.el, look at an actual calendar not just a list of events, and even use Gemini CLI and Claude Code, all on my phone! This is proof that phones, with enough freedom, can be workstations. If I can get Orca working on a desktop environment in Termux-GUI. But even with just Emacs and the shell, I can do quite a bit.Then I decided to go wild and make an MUD client for Emacs/Emacspeak, since accessible ones for Android are limited, and I didn't trust my hacks to Termux to handle Tintin++ very well. So, Emacs with Emacspeak it was, and Elmud [2] was born.Elmud has a few cool features. First of all, since Emacspeak has voice-lock, like font-lock but for TTS, Ansi colors can be ""heard"", like red being a deeper voice. Also a few MUD clients have sound packs on Windows, which make them sound more like a modern video game, while still being text-based. I got a few of those working with Elmud. You just load one of the supported MUD's, and the sound pack is downloaded and installed for you. It's easy and simple. And honestly, that's what I want my tools to provide, something I, or anyone else who chooses to use them, that is easy to get the most out of.None of this would have been possible without AI. None of it would have been done. It would have remained a dream. And yes, it was all vibe-coded, mostly with Codex 5.2 on high thinking. And yes, the code may look awful.

However trying to get it to do anything other than optimise code or fix small issues it struggles. It struggles with high level abstract issues.For example I currently have an issue with ambiguity collisions e.g.Input: ""California""Output: ""California, Missouri""California is a state but also city in Missouri - https://github.com/tomaytotomato/location4j/issues/44I asked Claude several times to resolve this ambiguity and it suggested various prioritisation strategies etc. however the resulting changes broke other functionality in my library.In the end I am redesigning my library from scratch with minimal AI input. Why? because I started the project without the help of AI a few years back, I designed it to solve a problem but that problem and nuanced programming decisions seem to not be respected by LLMs (LLMs dont care about the story, they just care about the current state of the code)

The project, or your brain? I think this is what a lot of LLM coders run into - they have a lot of intrinsic knowledge that is difficult or takes a lot of time and effort to put into words and describe. Vibes, if you will, like ""I can't explain it but this code looks wrong""

reply

Essentially I ask an LLM to look at a project and it just sees the current state of the codebase, it doesn't see the iterations and hacks and refactors and reverts.It also doesn't see the first functionality I wrote for it at v1.This could indeed be solved by giving the LLM a git log and telling it a story, but that might not solve my issue?

Document, document, document: your architecture, best practices, preferences (both about code and how you want to work with the LLM and how do you expect it to behave it).It is time consuming, but it's the only way you can get it to assist you semi-successfully.Also try to understand that LLM's biggest power for a developer is not in authoring code as much as assistance into understanding it, connecting dots across features, etc.If your expectation is to launch it in a project and tell it ""do X, do Y"" without the very much needed scaffolding you'll very quickly start losing the plot and increasing the mess. Sure, it may complete tasks here and there, but at the price of increasing complexity from which it is difficult for both you and it to dig out.Most AI naysayers can't be bothered with the huge amount of work required to setup a project to be llm-friendly, they fail, and blame the tool.Even after the scaffolding, the best thing to do, at least for the projects you care (essentially anything that's not a prototype for quickly validating an idea) you should keep reading and following it line by line, and keep updating your scaffolding and documentation as you see it commit the same mistakes over and over. And part of scaffolding requires also to put the source code of your main dependencies. I have a _vendor directory with git subtrees for major dependencies. LLMs can check the code of the dependencies, the tests, and figure out what they are doing wrong much quicker.Last but not least, LLMs work better with certain patterns, such as TDD. So instead of ""implement X"", it's better to ""I need to implement X, but before we do so, let's setup a way for testing and tracking our progress against"". You can build an inspector for a virtual machine, you can setup e2es or other tests, or just dump line by line logs in some file. There's many approaches depending on the use case.In any case, getting real help for LLMs for authoring code (editing, patching, writing new features) is highly dependent on having good context, good setup (tests, making it write a plan for business requirements and one for implementation) and following and improving all these aspects as you progress.

My project is quite well documented and I created a Prompt a while back along with some mermaid diagramshttps://github.com/tomaytotomato/location4j/tree/master/docsI can't remember the exact prompt I gave to the LLM but I gave it a Github issue ticket and description.After several iterations it fixed the issue, but my unit tests failed in other areas. I decided to abort it because I think my opinionated code was clashing with the LLM's solution.The LLM's solution would probably be more technically correct, but because I don't do l33tcode or memorise how to implement Trie or BST my code does it my way. Maybe I just need to force the LLM to do it my way and ignore the other solutions?

It does not struggle, you struggle. It is a tool you are using, and it is doing exactly what you're telling it to do. Tools take time to learn, and that's fine. Blaming the tools is counterproductive.If the code is well documented, at a high level and with inline comments, and if your instructions are clear, it'll figure it out. If it makes a mistake, it's up to you to figure out where the communication broke down and figure out how to communicate more clearly and consistently.

Does this make sense at all? ZFS scrubs only reads the data you have, not the whole drive, and repairs data if possible. The more data you have, the more you have to validate regardless of the tools used. The BER is also just a terrible metric and is not reflective of how drives actually behave.

LLMs don't change that. They're just tools. The relevant question is whether a human exercised creative judgment in selecting, shaping, or editing the output. Which I most certainly did. Otherwise my month of work here would have just been a minute and a single prompt and then just grabbing a coffee.We already handle this with cameras, compilers, spell-checkers, and procedural generation. If you push a button and accept whatever falls out, you may not have authorship. If you meaningfully direct and curate the result, you almost certainly do.Responsibility still lands on the human, which is a good sanity check: there is no such thing as “LLM-authored but human-unaccountable” work. Pretending otherwise is just outsourcing epistemic responsibility to a stochastic tool. Similarly, you can't both assign blame to me when things go wrong, but credit to the LLM when things go right. Or vice versa.

The cost improvement for an LLM to emit a feature (with an engineer in the loop) is too much of an improvement. We'll look at engineers coding in C the same way we look at engineers today who code in assembly. LLM enabled development becomes the new abstraction; probably with a grammar and system for stronger specification formalization.

I've been a senior engineer doing large scale active-active, five nines distributed systems that process billions of dollars of transactions daily. These are well thought out systems with 20+ folks on design document reviews.Not all of the work falls into that category, though. There's so much plumbing and maintenance and wiring of new features and requirements.On that stuff, I'm getting ten times the amount of work done with AI than I was before. I could replace the juniors on my team with just myself if I needed to and still get all of our combined work done.Engineers using AI are going to replace anyone not using AI.In fact, now is the time to start a startup and ""fire"" all of these incumbent SaaS companies. You can make reasonable progress quickly and duplicate much of what many companies do without much effort.If you haven't tried this stuff, you need to. I'm not kidding. You will easily 10x your productivity.I'm not saying don't review your own code. Please do.But Claude emits reasonable Rust and Java and C++. It's not just for JavaScript toys anymore.- - - - - - - - - - - -Edit:Holy hell HN, downvoted to -4 in record time.  Y'all don't like what's happening, but it's really happening.I'm not lying about this.I provided my background so you'd understand the context of my claims. I have a solid background in tech.The same thing that happened to illustration and art is happening here, to us and to our career. And these models are quite usable for production code.I can point Claude to a Rust HTTP handler and say, ""using this example [file path], write a new endpoint that handles video file uploads, extracts the metadata, creates a thumbnail, uploads them to the cloud storage, and creates the relevant database records.""And it does it in a minute.I review the code. It's as if I had written it. Maybe a change here or there.Real production Rust code, 100 - 500 LOC, one shotted in one minute. It even installs the routes and understands the HTTP framework DSL. It even codegens Swagger API documentation and somehow understands the proc macro DSL that takes Rust five minutes to compile.This tech is wizardry. It's the sci fi stuff we dreamed of as kids.I don't get the sour opinions. The only thing to fear is big tech monopolozation.I suppose the other thing to worry about is what's going to happen to our cushy $400k salaries. But if you make yourself useful, I think it'll work out just fine.Perhaps more than fine if you're able to leverage this to get ahead and fire your employer. You might not need your employer anymore. If you can do sales and wear many hats, you'll do exceedingly well.I'm not saying non-engineers will be able to do this. I'm saying engineers are well positioned to leverage this.

There was a submission to a blog post discussing applications of AI but it got killed for some reason.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46750927I remain convinced that if you use AI to write code then your product will sooner or later turn into a buggy mess. I think this will remain the case until they figure out how to make a proper memory system. Until then, we still have to use our brains as the memory system.One strategy I've seen that I like is using AI to prototype, but then write actual code yourself. This is what the Ghostty guy does I believe.I agree that AI can write decent Rust code, but Rust is not a panacea. From what I heard, Cursor has a lot of vibe-coded Rust code, but it didn't save it from being, as I said, a buggy mess.

There are lots of people claiming this. Many of whom have a solid background. Every now and then I check out someone's claim (checking the code they've generated). I've yet to find an AI-generated codebase that passed that check so far.Perhaps yours is the one that does, but as we can't see the code for ourselves, there's no way for us to really know. And it's hard to take your word for it when there are so many people falsely making the same claims.I expect a lot of HNers have had this experience.

You claimed that it already happened to illustrators and artists, and while I am sure they use it one way or another, I don't think it transformed the industry. Now, I am not saying that it won't amount to anything in software, I just don't think it is ready as of right now outside of greenfield projects, mostly because the scope is limited.I am pretty positive that at some point we'll have a tool which will automate the generation -> code review -> fixing (multiple loops) -> releasing without people. Currently people are the bottleneck and imo a better way is to exclude people completely outside of initial problem statement and accepting the result. Otherwise it is just too janky, that 10x comes with a huge asterisk that can unironically slow you down after all said and done.

But IMO the primitives we need are also fundamentally different with AI coding.Commits kind of don't matter anymore. Maybe PR's don't matter either, except as labels. But CI/hard proof that the code works as advertised is gold, and this is something git doesn't store by default.Additionally, as most software moves to being built by agents, the ""real"" git history you want is the chat history with your agent, and its CoT. If you can keep that and your CI runs, you could even throw away your `git` and probably still have a functionally better AI coding system.If we get a new Github for AI coding I hope it's a bit of a departure from current git workflows. But git is definitely extensible enough that you could build this on git (which is what I think will ultimately happen).

Is anyone replacing firefox, chromium, postgres, nginx, git, linux, etc?  It would be idiotic to trade git for a vibe coded source control.  I can't even imagine the motivations, maybe ""merges the way I like it""?Not sure, but anyone who's saying this stuff hasn't even taken the basic first level glance at what it would entail.  By all means, stop paying $10 a month to ""JSON validator SaSS"", but also don't complain with the little niggling bugs, maintenance and organization that comes with it.  But please stop pretending you can just vibe code your own Kafka, Apache, Vulkan, or PostGRES.Yes, you can probably go faster (possibly not in the right direction if inexperienced), but ultimately, something like that would still require very senior, experienced person, using the tool in a very guided way with heavy review.  By why take on the maintenance, the bug hunting, and everything else, unless that is your main business objective?Even if you can 10x, if you use that to just take on 10x more maintenance, you haven't increased velocity.  To really go faster, that 10x must be focused on the right objective -- distinctive business value.  If you use that 10x to generate hundreds of small tools you now have to juggle and maintain, that have no docs or support, no searchable history of problems solved, you may have returned yourself to 1x (or worse).This is the old ""we'll write our own inhouse programming language"" but leaking out to apps.  Sure, java doesn't work _exactly_ the way you want it to, you probably have complaints.  But writing your own lang will be a huge hit to whatever it was you actually wanted to use the language for, and you lose all the docs, forums, LSP / debugging tools, ecosystem, etc.

This is also just untrue. There is a study showing that the productivity gain is -20%, developers (and especially managers) just assume it is +25%. And when they are told about this they still feel they are +20% faster. It's the dev equivalent of mounting a cool-looking spoiler to your car.There are productivity gains, but they're in the fuzzy tasks like generating documentation and breaking up a project into bite-sized tasks. Or finding the right regex or combination of command line flags, and that last one I would triple verify if it was anything difficult to reverse.

reply

If they don't exist, AND the author is comitted to maintaining them instead of just putting it online, sure. But one issue I see is that a lot of these tools you describe already exist, so creating another one (using code assist tools or otherwise) just adds noise IMO.The better choice is to research and plan (as you say in your first sentence) before comitting resources. The barrier to ""NIH"" is lowered through code assistants, which risks reducing collaboration in open source land in favor of ""I'll just write my own"".Granted, ""I'll write my own"" has always felt like it has a lower barrier to entry than ""I'm going to search for this tool and learn to use it"".

Maybe the best feature of vibe coding is that it makes the regret factor of poor early choices much lower. Its kind of magic to go ""you know what, I was wrong, let's try this approach instead"" and not having to spend huge amounts of time fixing things or rewriting 80% of the project.It's made it a lot more fun to try building big projects on my own, where I would go into decision paralysis or prematurely optimize and never start the meat or learning of the core project.Its also been nice to have agents review my projects for major issues, so I feel more confident sharing them.

Setting out to implement a feature only to immediately get bogged down in details that I could probably get away with glossing over. LLMs short circuit that by just spitting something out immediately. Of course it's of questionable quality, but once you get something working you can always come back and improve it.

It's not difficult to imagine little pockets of hyperreality were some peoples lives are only feed by generated content and their existence starts to behave more like a video game than having any grounding in the physical. It's going to be interesting what the fractured remains of society look like in that future.

AI agents can select and load the appropriate packages and libraries without the user even knowing the name of the library, let alone that of the developer. This reduces the visibility of developers among users, who are now less likely to give a star, sponsor, offer a job, recommend the library to others etc.Even as a business user, say an agency building websites, I could have been a fedn of certain js frameworks, hosting meetups, buying swags, sponsoring development. I am less likely to do that if I have no idea what framework is powering the websites I build.Our argument is that rewards fall faster with vibe coding than productivity increases. OSS developers lose motivation, they stop maintaining existing libraries, don't bother sharing new ones (even if they keep writing a lot of code for themselves).

                Reading time 6 minutes
      

In last week's A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, we saw how Dunk met Egg—and the moment the hedge knight reluctantly agreed to let the peculiar bald kid serve as his squire.

We also followed Dunk's increasingly desperate quest to find someone, anyone, to vouch for him—hoping the legacy of his master, Ser Arlan of Pennytree, would be enough to get him into the tourney at Ashford Meadow.

This week, in an episode entitled “Hard Salt Beef,” well… Dunk has to level up. Big time.



 

Your eyeballs won't soon forget the sight of Ser Arlan of Pennytree emerging from a shack (where he's clearly just had a tryst) and taking a relaxing whizz—stark naked, his dangling manhood on display. Last week's projectile poop has nothing on this explicit visual. Does anything in Game of Thrones-adjacent history? It's deadpan. In your face. Full of pee.

This memorable moment in the past is underscored by Dunk's narration in the present. Ser Manfred Dondarrion blew him off last week, but some knight or lord must remember Ser Arlan… right?

“He had a peaceful nature. Quiet and humble,” Dunk describes. “A veteran of a hundred wars but an enemy to none. He always knew what was expected of him.”

It's a glowing reminiscence that isn't entirely supported by a flashback montage, which shows Ser Arlan was frequently very drunk and fond of singing at the top of his lungs in that state. But Dunk is genuinely earnest, and when we pull away from his memories, we see the young hedge knight is making the rounds… in vain. None of the men—House Florent, House Hayford, House Tyrell—gathered at Ashford have any recollection of his late master.

We realize that Egg has been taking in the many rejections and feels sorry that Dunk is being humiliated over and over.

He doesn't understand why Dunk puts up with it. “Why do you treat these royal lapdogs like they're your betters?” he asks. Dunk's answer: “They are my betters.”

He's still got hope that someone will remember Ser Arlan. But his quest is interrupted when trumpets sound and a group of riders, dressed in black and holding banners festooned with that familiar three-headed dragon, gallop into Ashford.

We get a close-up of Egg looking concerned. He quickly offers to head back to their camp to keep an eye on things. Distracted, Dunk agrees and sets off after the new arrivals.

They are, of course, the Targaryen contingent, led by Baelor—Hand of the King and heir to the Iron Throne. Also along are his brother, Maekar, and Maekar's son, Aerion. Only the latter two have the ice-blonde hair the family is known for, as well as that trademark surly, superior attitude.

Aerion immediately mistakes the hovering Dunk for a stable boy. Nice first impression. But that doesn't deter Dunk from mustering up the gumption to follow the elder Targaryens into the castle.

He's intending to continue his hunt for a sponsor but overhears Baelor (polite, diplomatic), Maekar (rude and blustery), and Lord Ashford (obsequious) discussing the unpleasant fact that two of Maekar's sons, Daeron and Aegon, have gone missing while making their way to the tourney.

The even-tempered Baelor is certain they'll turn up. Maekar, talking about Daeron, who was supposed to enter the lists, mutters, “I do not need to be reminded of my son's failings. He can change; he will change, gods be damned.”

Dunk chooses that moment to make his presence known—interrupting the family tension—and explains his predicament.

Baelor is, again, polite; Maekar is rude as hell. Even Ashford is snooty. But Baelor remembers Ser Arlan! In great detail, in fact!

He's as kind as Dunk is awkward (even as Maekar snorts at the hedge knight's fumblings) and suggests to the Ashford steward—the phlegmy guy we met last week; he's in charge of running the tourney—that Dunk should be allowed to enter.

Dunk puts his foot in his mouth a few times during this chat, but Baelor lets it slide. He gently reminds Dunk he can't use the Pennytree sigil since he wasn't the old man's son. He'll need to change up Ser Arlan's shield and make it his own.

We're back at the puppet show. The pretty narrator from last week, now even taller on stilts, performs as Dunk looks at her through goo-goo eyes. After the show, Dunk and Egg (Egg is also delighted by the puppet show, for more childlike reasons) approach. After she mentions she helps create the puppets, Dunk asks her if he can hire her to paint a new design on his shield.

His shaky confidence runs out when he realizes he hasn't actually thought about the design, but Egg steps in to help shape the idea: an elm tree with a shooting star above. Dunk introduces himself as “Ser Duncan the Tall,” and she reveals her name is Tanselle, adding, “The boys used to call me Tanselle Too-Tall.”

Dunk, of course, turns this into a clumsy compliment. Moments later, he asks his tiny wingman, “Was that ill-handled?”

His mortification is eased when Ser Lyonel—the good-time guy we met last week, who took quite the shine to Dunk—appears and drafts the pair into a rowdy, spontaneous game of tug-of-war. Dunk, who is as enormous as Egg is small, helps lead their side to victory.

After, Dunk wanders the makeshift village until he finds an armorer, who says he can outfit him for 800 stags. It's steep. Too steep. But he can't fight without armor. The man—Steely Pate is his name—gives off very gruff vibes, but he's not without reason. He agrees to let Dunk trade in some old armor (Ser Arlan's, no doubt) and to lower the price a little.

He also accepts Dunk's two stags (that's all he has) as a deposit, but the generosity ends there. We see Dunk reluctantly selling one of his beloved horses to make up the rest.

“Is there any measure of a fool I fail to meet?” he murmurs sadly. He promises the pony he'll buy her back if he wins.

In a somber mood, he tells Egg that maybe if he becomes a champion at Ashford, some great house will want to take him into its service. Maybe even House Targaryen. Egg doesn't think much of that plan, but the moment is interrupted when the horn blows: time to watch some opening-night jousting!

What looks to be a Tully of Riverrun sets the tone by biting the head off a fish and yelling “For the new gods… and old!” to thunderous approval; his opponent is “Prince Valaar, Baelor's son. Second in line to the throne,” Egg explains.

Then, as the crowd hushes to await the start of the joust, some jokester in the crowd screams out, “LORD ASHFORD FUCKS HIS SHEEP,” which goes over even better than the fish stunt.

Dunk hoists Egg onto his shoulders so he can see above the masses. The action is boisterous, electric, and… terrifying, at least to Dunk. Egg is hooting like he's at a pro wrestling match. But Dunk's face as he watches riders get struck down and horses collapse betrays his realization that this is what he himself will be doing once he's called into the ring. He flashes back to burying Ser Arlan, and it's a sobering moment.

By the campfire after, Egg is still amped, but Dunk is reflective. We get a lovely, thoughtful monologue as he ponders what's happened so far—and what lies ahead.

“Do great knights live in the hedges and die by the side of a muddy road? I think not.”

Ser Arlan “was a hard man to know,” Dunk admits. “He had no friends either. He lived nigh on 60 years and never was a champion. What chance do I have, truly?”

But all is not lost. There's still hope for this young hedge knight. “But he was good to me. I wasn't his family. But he kept me like we were. He raised me to be an honorable man, and all these noble lords can't even remember his name. His name was Ser Arlan of Pennytree, and I am his legacy.”

“On the morrow, we will show them what his hand has wrought.”

There are few times I can honestly say I've been surprised in my job reviewing laptops. Fewer times I can come out and claim I know what I have been missing. My job requires me to use a lot of gear, and most of it is iterative, derivative, or too awkward and pricey to be good for all but the connoisseurs of funky gadgets. So when I came across the newly redesigned Asus Zenbook Duo with the Intel Core Ultra Series 3 flagship chip inside, I found myself amused at my own bemusement—and for once—for all the right reasons.

So let's get the obvious out of the way. The Zenbook Duo is a dual-screen laptop. There's an included kickstand that lets you prop up its two 14-inch screens in a vertical format. If you want to be the weirdest guy at Starbucks, the one who cannot turn off work even when they're sucking down their fifth venti frappuccino, this is the laptop for you. However, I can already tell the Zenbook Duo has spoiled me. This notebook will still run well and for a good long while, even with both screens showing off their pretty pictures.

Asus Zenbook Duo

The new Zenbook Duo has style, power, and uniqueness in equal measure. It's also got the exorbitant price to match.

Pros

Cons

The Zenbook Duo isn't a new idea. Asus showed off a previous dual-screen laptop back in 2024. The same Taiwan-based company is also making a new gaming-centric ROG Zephyrus Duo that adds even more ways to orient the screen. The new version of the Zenbook Duo has significantly reduced the size of the bezels around the twin screens so that you can treat the device as one seamless display—like a foldable, but better. The keyboard that magnetically attaches to the bottom screen feels comfortable whether it's on the laptop, on your desk, or sitting on your crossed legs. And thanks to the great performance, I don't feel like I'm sacrificing anything on the altar of novelty.

This laptop also comes with a solid setup of 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. For background, Intel shipped me the Zenbook Duo for review, not Asus. The chipmaker is pinning much of its hopes for consumer products on Panther Lake, the internal code name for the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 chips. This laptop houses the Intel Core Ultra X9 388H, the highest-end Panther Lake chip with the touted 12Xe3 GPU cores. This is Intel's answer to AMD's leading Strix Point APUs, aka accelerated processing units, with extra graphics capabilities. The one big difference between Intel and AMD is that “Team Blue” is promising you can get all the benefits of lightweight laptops—namely battery life—with additional GPU capabilities for graphics tasks. Hell, the Zenbook Duo is good for gaming, at least to an extent.

And if you want those extra graphics capabilities (admit it, you do), you'll need to spend $2,300 for the laptop with the added 12Xe3 cores. A model with the Core Ultra 9 386H CPU, Intel's top chip without the extra GPU power, costs $2,100. Asus told Gizmodo the company was still ” finalizing schedules” for the eventual release date. The Zenbook Duo is a pricey laptop, though we still don't know how it will compare to other laptops from this year. More screens will mean a higher price, but with memory prices getting worse every day, you shouldn't expect to see many cheap machines with any variety of punchy processing power in 2026.

I've become so used to laptops with slim frames that holding a thick-bodied notebook somehow feels anachronistic. The Zenbook Duo is just over 0.91 inches thick, which in the end isn't that much. The dual-screen laptop is heavier than most of Asus' other Zenbooks, especially its incredibly light Zenbook A14. At the same time, frisbee light machines don't have the kinds of amenities you get on the Zenbook Duo.

Sacrifices are a necessity to fit two screens in a single chassis. Instead of a laptop with little room between its screen and keyboard, the Zenbook Duo adds a little more tolerance, enough to fit the magnetic keyboard in between both OLED touchscreens.

Like all of Asus' 2026 Zenbooks, the Duo is covered in the company's “Ceraluminum” texture. Yes, it's a nonsense word used to describe the anodization process to make these laptops feel more like a piece of pottery than an aluminum behemoth. You'll feel this mostly on the laptop lid and the Bluetooth keyboard's palm rests. The individual keys also hold this texture, which has the added effect of making each letter and number feel slippery compared to most other keyboards I'm used to. It's not like the keyboard is an ice rink or that the keys are more difficult to type on. It's just a small detail that takes time to get used to.

That detachable keyboard is the linchpin of the entire Zenbook Duo design. It adheres via magnets housed in the bottom screen's bezels and charges by a set of pins found at the very base of the laptop. The keyboard has a small amount of give if you put enough pressure on either side, where it can shift slightly side to side. The magnets are strong enough; you shouldn't have an issue typing (I learned the hard way that these magnets tend to stick to any metal table you're working on). The main reason you get the Zenbook Duo is because the keyboard can come off, revealing the second screen. That's where this laptop comes into its own.

Having not one but two 14-inch OLED monitors on a laptop of this size feels luxurious once you compare it to existing options for mobile multi-screen setups. I've tried devices like the first-gen Xebec Snap, which includes smaller LCD screens that hook onto the laptop connects via one USB-C port. Portable monitors like the Auro Triple Aero Pro Max are far too cumbersome and ugly to boot.

The Zenbook Duo's screens are mirrors of each other, though only the bottom screen supports the magnetic keyboard attachment points. To prop the whole thing up for dual-screen mode, you pull out the square kickstand on the laptop's bottom, which can extend to around 90 degrees. Windows 11 automatically recognized the orientation of the dual screens, which made it seamless to move apps and icons between them. If you've never used a vertical screen setup, the experience is eye-opening. For the first time in a long time, you can reach more than one paragraph on screen at a time without an ad sandwiched between; it will make you realize how rough websites have become.

And better yet, that Bluetooth keyboard can sit on your desk or on your lap while you lean back and enjoy the larger screen layout. The Zenbook Duo comes with an HDMI port and two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports if you expect to plug in an additional monitor as well. There's also a headphone jack, which rounds off the total number of I/O at your disposal. The keyboard has a separate USB-C port for charging when it's not attached to the laptop. I know the size of the laptop means limited room for ports, but I'll always wish for more.

Asus promises the hinge is strong enough to survive 40,000 folds. In my two weeks of testing the Zenbook Duo, the hinge proved sturdy enough despite my incessant smushing and extending. There have been attempts at foldable laptops, like the Asus Zenbook 17 Fold or Lenovo ThinkPad X1 16 Fold. The better design for thinner, flexible displays is with devices like Lenovo's expensive ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable. Despite the novelty of flexible screens, stacking two independent screens on a hinge is an overall cleaner experience with less chance of long-term damage. There's still a small gap between the screens thanks to the bezels, though it's not all that distracting even when spreading a single window between the top and bottom. The bigger issue is due to Windows 11. By default, the operating system is desperate to snap your apps to various sizes, which can make dragging windows to your preferred size more difficult than not.

While those older foldable screens could double as a large, heavy, and terrible tablet, you can also hold up the Zenbook Duo like a book and treat it as an odd and awkwardly weighted e-reader. Holding this laptop aloft with outstretched arms is only useful for strengthening your core muscles.

Each screen is a full 3K display (2,880 x 1,800 pixel resolution) with a 48-144Hz refresh rate thanks to VRR (variable refresh rate). With that, you get all the benefits of OLED, namely some amazing contrast to help visuals pop.

As is typical with organic light-emitting diode screens, the Zenbook Duo is not the brightest laptop around. Whatever Asus may say about brightness in HDR, both screens will still look a little dim in direct light. The displays are also glossy, which will enhance visuals in perfect conditions but can lead to a mirror-like reflectivity in some environments. It's not so bad in direct light that text becomes illegible. In the end, I would prefer a glossy display to something with a more matte finish.

Having two displays on top of each other means you can set up your displays to have a game or movie running on one screen and Discord, a browser, or whatever else you want on the other. It's the kind of machine for killing two birds with one stone or—more likely—blowing off work while pretending you're getting stuff done. As for whether this will be your go-to as an entertainment console, it can't quite be everything to everyone. The laptop comes with a six-speaker system that includes two tweeters and four woofers. That setup will let content blare loud enough to wake your partner on the other side of your apartment. In my experience, the sound came out clear, though a little too flat to truly be called “immersive.” It's perfectly usable as its own speaker, though don't expect it to beat a solid pair of headphones or a soundbar.

When Intel first debuted its Panther Lake series of chips in October 2025, it promised us Lunar Lake efficiency and battery life with Arrow Lake performance. In my tests, the Intel Core Ultra X9 388H can meet and even beat the mid-range Arrow Lake CPUs. That's not to say the new Intel chip is underperforming. Far from it. Intel's Panther Lake flagship chip is the kind of beast that stalks the forests and pounces when you least expect it to. What's more, its GPU capabilities are that much more exciting, with this chip promising you have the potential for solid gaming performance without needing to sacrifice battery life when doing other tasks.

Luckily, just before diving into the Asus Zenbook Duo, I had the chance to work on the Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 8. That laptop used a previous-gen Intel Core Ultra 7 255H. It's one of Intel's mid-range Arrow Lake laptop chips, and it's where I can create a point of comparison for how well the Zenbook Duo's CPU performs. In my tests, the Core Ultra X9 388H overcomes that 16-core Arrow Lake chip with room to spare. In Geekbench 6 tests, the Core Ultra X9 388H hit 300 points more than the ThinkPad P1 Gen 8's Core Ultra 7 255 in single-core settings and close to 1,000 points better in multi-core settings.

That's not to say the latest Panther Lake chip is the cream of the crop for lightweight laptops. Apple, ever the king of benchmarks, still has the M5 chip in its latest 14-inch MacBook Pro. That 10-core chip marked a single-core score 1,200 points above the top-end Panther Lake, though it achieved a similar spec for multi-core tests. It's a similar story for Cinebench 2024 tests, where the Core Ultra X9 388H CPU can match Apple's smaller ARM-based chip but can't equal it core to core. Not like that should matter to you as a prospective laptop buyer. The dual-screen Zenbook Duo is snappy and fast for everyday tasks and then some.

For instance, in our Blender test, where we time how long the laptop takes to render a scene on both the CPU and GPU, the Zenbook Duo took nearly 20 seconds less than the MacBook Pro with M5 running on the CPU. It can't quite match the speed of a higher-end chip, like the Intel Core Ultra 200HX series you'll find in gaming laptops, but two minutes is not shabby. The GPU was on par with the time it took the ThinkPad P1 Gen 8's RTX Pro 2000 discrete GPU to do the same test.

Intel's top-end chipset includes the Arc B380 graphics with the touted 12 Xe3 GPU cores. There's an interesting bit of silicon running underneath the Zenbook Duo. This single chip uses a die-to-die bridge to communicate between the CPU and GPU portions of the chip. This means Intel could expand the size of the GPU without creating more latency between the two sections of the chip. The X9 and X7 chips all feature the same graphics with their touted 12 ray tracing units and 16MB L2 cache.

In some tests, the Intel Core Ultra's GPU can match up to some older-generation graphics cards. In my tests, it could beat the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 on an Asus TUF Gaming A14 from 2024 in 3DMark's “Time Spy” benchmarks. Just before you go over the moon, Intel's integrated GPU is nowhere close to beating a more modern GPU like the RTX 5070 in recent devices like the Framework 16 in 3DMark's more intensive benchmarks. It also won't beat AMD's more-powerful Ryzen AI Max chips when going toe-to-toe, especially when the Zenbook Duo is only running at a max 45W TDP (thermal design power). A device like the Asus ROG Flow Z13 with the AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 can manually clock up to more than 80W TDP.

What gets missed in the hunt for higher frame rates is the sense of whether a game is actually playable on any one system. The Zenbook Duo can hit some frame rates that are impressive for its size. In Cyberpunk 2077, the laptop can get to 50 fps with the high settings preset at 1080p. If you push that to the max resolution of 2,880 x 1,800, you can get 23 fps. Using Intel's upscaling technology, XeSS, you can make that around 45 fps. That's perfectly playable, though if you want to make use of Panther Lake's ray tracing cores, you can squeak out a playable 30 fps with ray tracing on low settings, plus the use of upscaling.

That's a similar story with games like Black Myth: Wukong, which can hit 37 fps with high graphics settings and ray tracing set to medium at 1200p. In Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, I managed to get 28 fps at high settings and the max resolution without relying on XeSS. With some considerations for upscaling, that makes the game playable and look good to boot.

In a game like Total War: Warhammer III—which is normally a CPU-dependent title—I could net around 30 fps on the ultra graphics settings preset. There won't be a lightweight laptop with an AMD or Intel chip that can stomach modern, AAA games without upscaling. That's fine. This GPU is good enough for light to medium gaming if you're willing to buy into what Intel is selling. Intel made a big deal out of its new multi-frame generation model available to the updated XeSS 3 software available in some games.

Multi-frame generation, also called frame interpolation, essentially sticks multiple AI-generated frames between rendered frames, artificially increasing the frame rate. This normally comes at the cost of occasional graphics glitches and higher latency. Intel promised that “most” XeSS 2 games will get updates to support XeSS 3 with multi-frame generation with a driver override capability.

Whether or not you want to use it is up to each player. My best advice is to only enable frame gen once you already can get at least 50 fps after upscaling. Even better would be 60 fps. You're not going to notice as many graphical artifacts on a smaller screen like the Zenbook Duo's 14-inch displays. Just don't let anybody, whether they're Intel or Asus, tell you this laptop can hit 60 fps with Cyberpunk 2077 on high settings without help.

The phrase “all-day battery life” is, in my experience, a complete misnomer. It doesn't describe how different kinds of on-device activity might drain longevity. So when I say the Asus Zenbook Duo has an “all-day battery,” what I mean is that I could get a full workday's worth of juice out of this laptop without needing to reach for a charger. That accounts for me and my usual workflow, where I'm mostly using browsers for accessing Gizmodo's content mangement system and the occasional photo editing app.

What was even more impressive was how long the Zenbook Duo lasted, even with both screens open at once. With both screens open, I managed to eke out nearly 7 hours of battery life before the laptop was begging for the outlet. Non-workaholics who take longer lunch breaks may manage to get the laptop home and away without needing to plug it in.

I won't stop dreaming of the “everything laptop.” One day, we'll have a mobile machine that's great for gaming, productivity, and longevity all at once. I don't think we've ever come closer thanwith the Asus Zenbook Duo. There's no major fault that I can find with it, except for that eye-watering price tag (and, if I were being honest, the fact that it's stuck with an ever-more AI-centric version of Windows).

The Zenbook Duo's graphics capabilities may not sound as exciting as the hype for Panther Lake led some folk to believe. There's only so much of a power envelope you can stuff inside a laptop chassis before you end up with a three-hour battery and a power adapter as large and heavy as a spoiled guinea pig. For a laptop of this size, the Zenbook Duo offers more than what I thought I needed. Sometimes, it's good to be surprised.

This story was originally published by ProPublica.

The Trump administration is planning to use artificial intelligence to write federal transportation regulations, according to U.S. Department of Transportation records and interviews with six agency staffers.

The plan was presented to DOT staff last month at a demonstration of AI's “potential to revolutionize the way we draft rulemakings,” agency attorney Daniel Cohen wrote to colleagues. The demonstration, Cohen wrote, would showcase “exciting new AI tools available to DOT rule writers to help us do our job better and faster.”

Discussion of the plan continued among agency leadership last week, according to meeting notes reviewed by ProPublica. Gregory Zerzan, the agency's general counsel, said at that meeting that President Donald Trump is “very excited about this initiative.” Zerzan seemed to suggest that the DOT was at the vanguard of a broader federal effort, calling the department the “point of the spear” and “the first agency that is fully enabled to use AI to draft rules.”

Zerzan appeared interested mainly in the quantity of regulations that AI could produce, not their quality. “We don't need the perfect rule on XYZ. We don't even need a very good rule on XYZ,” he said, according to the meeting notes. “We want good enough.” Zerzan added, “We're flooding the zone.”

These developments have alarmed some at DOT. The agency's rules touch virtually every facet of transportation safety, including regulations that keep airplanes in the sky, prevent gas pipelines from exploding and stop freight trains carrying toxic chemicals from skidding off the rails. Why, some staffers wondered, would the federal government outsource the writing of such critical standards to a nascent technology notorious for making mistakes?

The answer from the plan's boosters is simple: speed. Writing and revising complex federal regulations can take months, sometimes years. But, with DOT's version of Google Gemini, employees could generate a proposed rule in a matter of minutes or even seconds, two DOT staffers who attended the December demonstration remembered the presenter saying. In any case, most of what goes into the preambles of DOT regulatory documents is just “word salad,” one staffer recalled the presenter saying. Google Gemini can do word salad.

Zerzan reiterated the ambition to accelerate rulemaking with AI at the meeting last week. The goal is to dramatically compress the timeline in which transportation regulations are produced, such that they could go from idea to complete draft ready for review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in just 30 days, he said. That should be possible, he said, because “it shouldn't take you more than 20 minutes to get a draft rule out of Gemini.”

The DOT plan, which has not previously been reported, represents a new front in the Trump administration's campaign to incorporate artificial intelligence into the work of the federal government. This administration is not the first to use AI; federal agencies have been gradually stitching the technology into their work for years, including to translate documents, analyze data and categorize public comments, among other uses. But the current administration has been particularly enthusiastic about the technology. Trump released multiple executive orders in support of AI last year. In April, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought circulated a memo calling for the acceleration of its use by the federal government. Three months later, the administration released an “AI Action Plan” that contained a similar directive. None of those documents, however, called explicitly for using AI to write regulations, as DOT is now planning to do.

Those plans are already in motion. The department has used AI to draft a still-unpublished Federal Aviation Administration rule, according to a DOT staffer briefed on the matter.

Skeptics say that so-called large language models such as Gemini and ChatGPT shouldn't be trusted with the complicated and consequential responsibilities of governance, given that those models are prone to error and incapable of human reasoning. But proponents see AI as a way to automate mindless tasks and wring efficiencies out of a slow-moving federal bureaucracy.

Such optimism was on display in a windowless conference room in Northern Virginia earlier this month, where federal technology officials, convened at an AI summit, discussed adopting an “AI culture” in government and “upskilling” the federal workforce to use the technology. Those federal representatives included Justin Ubert, division chief for cybersecurity and operations at DOT's Federal Transit Administration, who spoke on a panel about the Transportation Department's plans for “fast adoption” of artificial intelligence. Many people see humans as a “choke point” that slows down AI, he noted. But eventually, Ubert predicted, humans will fall back into merely an oversight role, monitoring “AI-to-AI interactions.” Ubert declined to speak to ProPublica on the record.

A similarly sanguine attitude about the potential of AI permeated the presentation at DOT in December, which was attended by more than 100 DOT employees, including division heads, high-ranking attorneys and civil servants from rulemaking offices. Brimming with enthusiasm, the presenter told them that Gemini can handle 80% to 90% of the work of writing regulations, while DOT staffers could do the rest, one attendee recalled the presenter saying.

To illustrate this, the presenter asked for a suggestion from the audience of a topic on which DOT may have to write a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, a public filing that lays out an agency's plans to introduce a new regulation or change an existing one. He then plugged the topic keywords into Gemini, which produced a document resembling a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. It appeared, however, to be missing the actual text that goes into the Code of Federal Regulations, one staffer recalled.

The presenter expressed little concern that the regulatory documents produced by AI could contain so-called hallucinations — erroneous text that is frequently generated by large language models such as Gemini — according to three people present. In any case, that's where DOT's staff would come in, he said. “It seemed like his vision of the future of rulemaking at DOT is that our jobs would be to proofread this machine product,” one employee said. “He was very excited.” (Attendees could not clearly recall the name of the lead presenter, but three said they believed it was Brian Brotsos, the agency's acting chief AI officer. Brotsos declined to comment, referring questions to the DOT press office.)

A spokesperson for the DOT did not respond to a request for comment; Cohen and Zerzan also did not respond to messages seeking comment. A Google spokesperson did not provide a comment.

The December presentation left some DOT staffers deeply skeptical. Rulemaking is intricate work, they said, requiring expertise in the subject at hand as well as in existing statutes, regulations and case law. Mistakes or oversights in DOT regulations could lead to lawsuits or even injuries and deaths in the transportation system. Some rule writers have decades of experience. But all that seemed to go ignored by the presenter, attendees said. “It seems wildly irresponsible,” said one, who, like the others, requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.

Mike Horton, DOT's former acting chief artificial intelligence officer, criticized the plan to use Gemini to write regulations, comparing it to “having a high school intern that's doing your rulemaking.” (He said the plan was not in the works when he left the agency in August.) Noting the life-or-death stakes of transportation safety regulations, Horton said the agency's leaders “want to go fast and break things, but going fast and breaking things means people are going to get hurt.”

Academics and researchers who track the use of AI in government expressed mixed opinions about the DOT plan. If agency rule writers use the technology as a sort of research assistant with plenty of supervision and transparency, it could be useful and save time. But if they cede too much responsibility to AI, that could lead to deficiencies in critical regulations and run afoul of a requirement that federal rules be built on reasoned decision-making.

“Just because these tools can produce a lot of words doesn't mean that those words add up to a high-quality government decision,” said Bridget Dooling, a professor at Ohio State University who studies administrative law. “It's so tempting to try to figure out how to use these tools, and I think it would make sense to try. But I think it should be done with a lot of skepticism.”

Ben Winters, the AI and privacy director at the Consumer Federation of America, said the plan was especially problematic given the exodus of subject-matter experts from government as a result of the administration's cuts to the federal workforce last year. DOT has had a net loss of nearly 4,000 of its 57,000 employees since Trump returned to the White House, including more than 100 attorneys, federal data shows.

Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency was a major proponent of AI adoption in government. In July, The Washington Post reported on a leaked DOGE presentation that called for using AI to eliminate half of all federal regulations, and to do so in part by having AI draft regulatory documents. “Writing is automated,” the presentation read. DOGE's AI program “automatically drafts all submission documents for attorneys to edit.” DOGE and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.

The White House did not answer a question about whether the administration is planning to use AI in rulemaking at other agencies as well. Four top technology officials in the administration said they were not aware of any such plan. As for DOT's “point of the spear” claim, two of those officials expressed skepticism. “There's a lot of posturing of, ‘We want to seem like a leader in federal AI adoption,'” one said. “I think it's very much a marketing thing.”

Doesn't 8K sound better than 4K? Dreame, a company mostly known for smart home gadgets like its robot vacuums (even some with tank tread exoskeletons for climbing stairs), is coming at you with a miniaturized action camera with a touted 8K shooting ability. It's one way to make a statement in a crowded field, but you should be watching Dreame as it attempts to hit DJI where it hurts after the drone maker was mauled by U.S. regulators.

Dreame waited until after CES 2026 to offer the full details for its $440 Leaptic Cube, an action camera that borrows heavily from fellow Chinese brand DJI with its Osmo Nano and—to a lesser extent—the Insta360 Go Ultra. The Cube includes a main body with a screen plus a magnetic attachment point. Yes, that means this can turn into a fridge spy cam. That, or you can buy or craft your own custom mount for slapping the camera onto a bike helmet or your cat's collar to turn either you or your feline friend into an 8K action star.

DJI's and Insta360's mobile cameras both only support 4K at 60 fps recording. The Leaptic Cube can hit 8K at the same frame rate. However, the true highlight is how the camera claims to do 4K at 60 fps with HDR and even also record in 4K at 120 fps for slow-motion footage. Whether the resulting video will still look good will depend less on pixel counts and more on the camera specs. Dreame went with a 1/1.3-inch sensor, the same size as the Osmo Nano. It uses a 155-degree, f/2.8 wide-angle lens to capture more of your surroundings.

Having the ability to shoot in 8K will let you crop more of your surroundings when you take your footage into a video editor. The camera also supports 10-bit P-Log capture, which will help with color accuracy. The Leaptic Cube also has a handy 64GB of built-in storage, though if you spend $460, you can get it with 128GB. Either way, you'll likely want to get a microSD card, which is housed inside the screen mount portion.

Even though the Leaptic Cube promises to take shots at 50 megapixels, no action camera has proven it can capture the kinds of video a pro-level smartphone can. The benefit of an action camera is portability and a rugged chassis that can take a beating in harsh weather conditions. The standalone camera should be able to get 1.5 hours of runtime with the basic battery, though Dreame promises one of two expansion docks (there's one with a screen and another without) should improve longevity.

Dreame is yet another company that seems to be going all-out on—well—everything. It spent CES showing off its smart home products, including new refrigerators, washers, and air purifiers, plus a whole new series of Aura mini LED 4K TVs. DJI, on the other hand, is also getting into smart home tech with its own robot vacuum.

Dreame is also trying to promote an “AI Laundry Care Robot.” This device appears to be a large robovac with a massive, crane-like arm sticking out from the middle and a claw-like mandible it uses to pick up clothes. Dreame claims the robovac uses “AI and precision robotic arms” to organize fabrics in your washing machine. We didn't get to see this in person, though considering the poor state of affairs for home robots at CES, perhaps it's best the machine stays in the lab until it's fully cooked.

The China-based company is in a position to fill the hole left by DJI and other Chinese mega-brands like Xiaomi in the U.S. market. DJI has suffered from U.S. government sanctions. Specifically, the Federal Communications Commission has barred DJI and other Chinese drone makers from importing new drones to the U.S. That doesn't mean all the company's products are being denied entry. Any of the company's previous drone products are still available. However, all the consternation around drones has also barred the U.S. from accessing many other DJI products at launch. While the Osmo Nano wasn't around in the U.S. at launch, you can now find the device on Amazon for $300.

With custom firmware for managing thermals.

A budding enthusiast on Reddit has just built their own PS4 handheld by taking a PS4 Slim's motherboard and shrinking it down to be portable. They slapped a screen on top and 3D printed a custom shell that houses a battery, some controls, and even an ESP32 microcontroller running custom firmware to monitor/manage temps. The project was shared across a bunch of subreddits by u/wewillmakeitnow, including the r/handheld community:

As you can see above, the device looks like the child of a Nintendo DS and a PSP. The ergonomics leave a little to be desired, but it does look like a finished product. It features seemingly original PS4 controls ripped straight from a legit controller. There's a small screen in the bottom-right corner for monitoring power and temps, and all the controls also have LEDs embedded behind them.

This is not the first-ever PS4 handheld online, either, as YouTube is littered with project videos showcasing multiple attempts at shrinking down a PlayStation 4. One video by Restore Technique features a ""PS4T"" that even looks similarly boxy in its design to this one. Regardless, individual modding efforts are always worth highlighting, and this one includes a gorgeous 7-inch OLED screen, which is certainly something new.

The Reddit post is light on details, and there's no accompanying video to dissect and break down, but the OP has a somewhat rich post history. We can trace back the creation of this handheld to at least October 2025, when u/wewillmakeitnow first shared progress on the project. Even at the time, they said work on the device had started months ago, so it might've been a year-long operation at this point.

The portable PS4 Slim is inspired by Millomaker's portable Xbox 360, and just like that, this device also omits the disc drive to achieve a small footprint. The main challenge with building a handheld PS4 was cutting down the motherboard to be more compact while maintaining most of the essential features. Hence, there's an entirely new power delivery and cooling system inside.

The thermals are handled by a fan on the back, which has cut-off fuses wired to it, managed by an MCU that ensures safe temperatures. Whenever power reaches 10V, the controller will shut off power to protect the system and the battery. The OP says their goal was not just size reduction, but also ""better power efficiency and thermal behavior.""

 




The battery consists of 6x 21700 cells, each providing 6000mAh, totaling out to around 130Wh, which exceeds the 99Wh max allowed on airplanes — in case you were looking to travel with it. That translates to 2.7-3 hours of runtime under a moderate load playing lightweight games, consuming around 44W per hour. Jumping to demanding AAA titles will cut that endurance to just 1.3-1.5 hours.

In terms of connectivity, the handheld has an HDMI port to connect it to an external display, aided by a barrel jack to ensure full power when plugged in. You can use this thing as a normal PS4 when you don't need the portability. There are 3x USB-C ports on the device, with the original DualShock 4 antennae as well, for that seamless console-like pairing.

The hobbyist says this device was a ""personal engineering challenge"" rather than something designed for mass production. Its shell is 3D printed using a rather dark-looking ABS plastic with a glossy finish that rivals the original PS3. One of the older posts in OP's history shows off a much more comfortable shell, so clearly there's room for improvement even if the handheld is ready and stable for now.

This is one of the worst Windows security update bugs in recent memory.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A few Windows 11 users have been affected by a bug from the latest Windows 11 security update, which resulted in their PCs refusing to turn on. According to an AskWoody forum post, there were reports that some devices encountered an “UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME” error after installing the January 2026 Windows security update. The affected computers came up with a black screen and a message that says “Your device ran into a problem and needs a restart. You can restart.”\

This isn't the first issue that came out of Microsoft's latest Windows security update, with some PCs refusing to shut down or hibernate, and another bug resulting in Cloud-based apps, like Outlook, OneDrive, and Dropbox, not working, as reported by Windows Central. The company has since released emergency updates to address these problems, but it seems that there is no fix for the unbootable error just yet. This is also the most catastrophic error yet, and the only workaround for this is to enter the Windows Recovery Environment and uninstall the latest security patch.

These security updates are supposed to keep Windows users secure, but it seems that they're causing more harm than good at the moment. This also isn't the first time that an update wreaked havoc on the popular operating system, with the August 2025 security update breaking recovery tools on both Windows 10 and 11. Another security update in October brought another issue, with USB keyboards and mice not working in Windows Recovery Environment, meaning users cannot actually do anything to troubleshoot their PC.

It's unclear what caused the latest issue, and we're still waiting on Microsoft to release an emergency update that will fix the problem. However, this is probably easier said than done, especially given that millions of PCs with a nearly infinite number of different hardware configurations out there have Windows 11 installed. But even if only a small number of Windows 11 users are affected by this catastrophic error, it's still an issue that needs to be addressed quickly.

An official, boxed hardware bundle.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The latest entry in AMD's Ryzen 9000 lineup, the 9850X3D, is set to launch in just a few days worldwide, but it seems like China will be getting a little special treatment when it does. UNIKO's Hardware has spotted an official boxed bundle containing the new X3D chip, alongside a Cooler Master cooler and V-Color RAM. The set is likely aimed at offering customers a convenient all-in-one solution.

Hardware bundles are commonplace at many retailers, especially Micro Center, which once handed out free 32 GB DDR5 kits with the purchase of a Ryzen 7000 CPU. Such unfathomable times. Anyhow, these bundles usually focus on CPU, RAM, and motherboard combos instead of throwing in a cooler. They're also not ""official"" in the sense that it's just the vendor's due diligence to boost sales, instead of something coming directly from the companies involved.

That's not the case here, as you can see AMD, Cooler Master, and V-Color's logo on the box, signaling this is an official collab, at least in China. It was unveiled at Cooler Master's latest press event in the region. The included cooler, therefore, is Cooler Master's Hyper 612 Apex, which costs $79.99. The RAM is a 32 GB kit of V-Color's Manta XFinity RGB DDR5-6000 that's retailing for ~$500 right now.

It launched at around $200 at the time of our original coverage in September, 2025. We've since reviewed the 64 GB 6400 MT/s kit favorably just a few days ago. Lastly, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D CPU itself has an MSRP of $500, which totals out this package to $1,080 individually, but we don't know the actual bundle's cost.

A couple of days ago, AMD said the 9850X3D doesn't require high-speed DDR5. With kits running at bone stock 4800 MT/s JEDEC spec, versus overclocked 6000 MT/s units with EXPO profiles that offer less than a 1% difference in FPS. So, there's at least some sort of silver lining with this new processor launch. Just find the absolute cheapest DDR5 you can and enjoy the best PC gaming has to offer.

Chronic kidney disease, CKD or loss of kidney function, affects around 800 million adults worldwide, a number that has more than doubled since 1990.

A new study, conducted by researchers in China and published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, has found that a plant-forward diet is associated with a decreased risk of developing CKD.

“The findings reinforce that multiple plant-forward diets support kidney health, with the EAT–Lancet diet serving as a structured, biologically supported option within this broader dietary framework.”

— Thomas M. Holland, physician-scientist and assistant professor at the RUSH Institute for Healthy Aging, RUSH University, College of Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study.

Holland also pointed out that these findings suggest a healthy diet may help reduce some environmental risk factors for chronic kidney disease.

“A major strength of this study is its integration of dietary patterns with genetic, environmental, and molecular data, offering more insight into how diet influences CKD risk at a biological level. The finding that diet had a stronger protective impact among individuals with less access to green space suggests that healthy eating may partially offset environmental risk factors. Thus, when people lack supportive surroundings for health, what they eat becomes even more important,” he said.

The EAT-Lancet diet consists largely of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and unsaturated oils, with a low to moderate amount of seafood and poultry. The diet includes little or no red meat, processed meat, added sugar, refined grains, and starchy vegetables.

It was developed as a healthy reference diet that was also sustainable, staying within “safe planetary boundaries for six environmental processes that together regulate the state of the Earth system, and include climate change, land-system change, freshwater use, biodiversity loss, and interference with the global nitrogen and phosphorus cycles.”

The researchers used data from the UK Biobank, a database of more than half a million volunteers recruited between 2006 and 2010, when they were 40 to 69 years old, and followed up ever since to record who falls ill and why.

They used 24-hour dietary recall questionnaires to assess the diet of 179,508 participants without CKD at baseline. They then evaluated participants' adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet and analyzed any associations with CKD.

Researchers followed up participants for a median of 12.1 years, during which time 4,819 people (2.7%) developed CKD.

“Eating more plant foods is definitely beneficial for the kidneys. A new area of research that is emerging examines the diversity of plant foods—that is, how many different plant foods are consumed. Recent studies in CKD patients have shown this reduces renal acid load and constipation, both beneficial outcomes for these patients.”

– Matthew Snelson, Vice Chancellor's Research Fellow, Edith Cowan University, Perth, Australia, who was not involved in the study.

The higher the participants' adherence to the EAT-Lancet diet in each of the four analyses, the lower their risk of CKD.

Holland noted that other plant-forward diets had similar benefits:

“From a kidney health perspective, the EAT–Lancet diet does not appear categorically superior to DASH or Mediterranean diets in terms of overall risk reduction for CKD, as the magnitude of benefit was largely comparable across patterns.”

“However,” he told Medical News Today, “a potential advantage of the EAT–Lancet diet lies in its more explicit quantitative limits on red meat, saturated fat, and added sugars, (similar in theory to the MIND diet) which may confer additional benefit through tighter regulation of inflammatory and metabolic pathways linked to kidney damage.”

The study does have some limitations, though.

“There were notable limitations to the study, including self-reported diet, limited population diversity, and the observational design, which prevents causal conclusions. That being said, the findings reinforce that multiple plant-forward diets support kidney health, with the EAT–Lancet diet serving as a structured, biologically supported option within this broader dietary framework,” Holland told Medical News Today.

Holland explained that plant-forward diets reduce inflammation, improve lipid metabolism, and lower metabolic stress on the kidneys, telling MNT: 

“Diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and unsaturated fats are associated with higher levels of anti-inflammatory fatty acids and lower levels of inflammatory markers, both of which were shown in this study to partially explain the reduced CKD risk. Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress gradually damage kidney blood vessels and filtering units; this means ongoing low-level irritation slowly wears down the kidneys' ability to clean the blood.”

“Diets rich in whole plant foods typically lower sodium intake compared to animal-heavy patterns, helping control blood pressure—a key driver of CKD progression. It's worth nothing though that some highly processed plant-based meat alternatives can be quite high in sodium.”— Matthew Snelson, research fellow

Snelson explained further:

“Lower meat consumption in plant-forward diets reduces intake of amino acids like tyrosine and tryptophan, which gut microbiota ferment into p-cresol and indole precursors. The body processes these into p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate, which are uremic toxins that damage kidneys by promoting inflammation and fibrosis.”

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several factors increase a person's risk of developing CKD. These include:

The EAT-Lancet diet provides large amounts of fiber, which acts in multiple ways to help prevent CKD and help reduce other risk factors.

“Higher dietary fiber from plants fuels gut microbiota to produce anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate. Fiber also accelerates colonic transit, limiting uremic toxin production and enhancing clearance. Other analysis of UK Biobank data has shown that constipation significantly raises CKD risk.”

— Matthew Snelson, research fellow

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors remain foundational therapies for a wide range of cardiovascular and renal conditions; however, their use is often nuanced by clinical context. From perioperative decision-making to pregnancy, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and contemporary heart failure (HF) management, ACE inhibitors and related renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers continue to raise critical questions for clinicians.

In patients with HF undergoing noncardiac surgery, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend a tailored approach. Temporary discontinuation of ACE inhibitors might benefit patients undergoing high-risk surgery who are at risk for hemodynamic instability. ACE inhibitor use should resume promptly after surgery.

Stopping these medications can remove a critical stabilizing therapy for patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), potentially precipitating clinical decline. Increasing the dose can lead to excessive blood pressure reduction and compromise organ perfusion, making this strategy unsafe. Substituting other drugs offers no proven benefit and may introduce additional risks during a vulnerable period.

Learn more about heart failure.

RAAS inhibitors such as ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy because they interfere with the fetal renin-angiotensin system, which is essential for kidney development and amniotic fluid regulation. The disruption of fetal RAAS activity can lead to reduced renal perfusion, impaired urine production, and oligohydramnios, as well as structural kidney abnormalities and other malformations, making these drugs unsafe during gestation.

RAAS blockers do not raise fetal blood pressure; their effect is primarily inhibitory, leading to hypotension in the fetus rather than hypertension. These medications do not accelerate renal development; instead, they impair kidney function, causing low amniotic fluid levels, not excess. Although maternal aldosterone may be affected, the primary fetal risk stems from direct inhibition of the fetal RAAS, not maternal hormone changes.

Learn more about pregnancy.

In patients with HFrEF, adding an SGLT2 inhibitor to the backbone therapy of an ACE inhibitor, BB, and MRA produces the greatest reduction in all-cause mortality. This quadruple combination outperforms other regimens by providing incremental survival benefits beyond standard guideline-directed therapy.

Although the combination of ACE inhibitor, BB, MRA, and ivabradine helps reduce hospitalization for HF, it does not achieve the same magnitude of mortality reduction as when an SGLT2 inhibitor is added. The ACE inhibitor, BB, MRA, and vericiguat regimen shows benefits for cardiovascular death but is less effective than the SGLT2 inhibitor combination in lowering all-cause mortality.

Learn more about the treatment of heart failure.

Most current international guidance indicates that certain ACE inhibitors, specifically, enalapril, benazepril, and captopril, are compatible with breastfeeding, as their transfer to breast milk is minimal and not considered harmful to the infant. ARBs lack robust lactation safety data and are not routinely endorsed for breastfeeding.

Learn more about lactation.

Potassium binders are frequently paired with RAAS inhibitors, including ACE inhibitors, in CKD because they counteract the rise in serum potassium that can occur when these medications suppress aldosterone activity. By binding potassium within the gut and escorting it out of the body through the stool, agents such as patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate help maintain safe potassium levels, allowing patients to stay on RAAS blockade without heightened risk for dangerous hyperkalemia.

These binders have no meaningful influence on systemic blood pressure and do not amplify the antihypertensive action of ACE inhibitors. They do not interact with the RAAS pathway and have no effect on angiotensin II production or renal perfusion mechanisms. Proteinuria reduction is a benefit of RAAS inhibitors themselves, not of potassium binders, which do not alter glomerular arteriolar tone.

Although many are indolent in behavior, neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) can occur nearly anywhere in the body and have metastatic potential. The management of NETs typically requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates advanced imaging techniques, precise surgical strategies, targeted therapies, and biomarker evaluation.

Current guideline‑based initial evaluation recommends multiphasic high-resolution CT or contrast-enhanced MRI for many NETs, including GEP-NETs. Although these cross-sectional modalities are most commonly used in this setting, contrast-enhanced ultrasound has demonstrated efficacy in patients with GEP-NETs, particularly in early stages or to rule out other possibilities for the mass.

PET can be used following initial evaluation; for example, it can be used to identify unknown primary GEP-NETs, and somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-based PET can identify metastasis extent. Abdominal x-ray is not typically recommended in this setting.

Learn more about imaging for NETs.

Surgical management of G2 and G3 rectal NETs larger than 2 cm should involve partial or total mesorectal resection with regional lymph node dissection, as these tumors carry a higher risk of local invasion and distant metastasis. For G1 tumors measuring 1-2 cm, curative local excision (such as transanal endoscopic microsurgery) is typically sufficient, provided there are no high-risk features such as lymphovascular invasion or poor differentiation. In contrast, G1 tumors smaller than 1 cm in size have a low metastatic potential and are generally amenable to simple endoscopic resection or just being observed for disease progression.

For unresectable, poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasms, etoposide or platinum‑based chemotherapy remains a standard therapeutic approach. Radionuclide therapy is often used following chemotherapy. When tumors are resectable, oncologic resection (often preceded by neoadjuvant treatment) is preferred. Oral alkylators and mTOR inhibitors are not often used in this setting.

Carcinoid syndrome is a symptom complex caused by hormone-secreting NETs, most often presenting with flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing, and in advanced cases, carcinoid heart disease. The primary biomarker remains 5-HIAA, measured via 24-hour urine or, increasingly, plasma due to greater convenience and comparable accuracy.

Somatostatin receptor ligands (eg, octreotide, lanreotide) are initial therapy for symptom control, as well as tumor stabilization. Novel formulations are currently being explored to deliver improved bioavailability, convenience, and safety.

Other biomarkers such as neuron-specific enolase and pancreatic polypeptide may be measured but are not primary biomarkers for carcinoid syndrome due to limited sensitivity and specificity. Human chorionic gonadotropin is not typically used in this setting.

The NANETS guidelines emphasize a personalized approach to surveillance imaging following treatment for high-grade NETs, including grade 3 tumors and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas. Rather than endorsing a fixed timeline, NANETS recommends that imaging schedules be tailored to each patient's tumor grade, recurrence risk, and clinical condition.

Additional imaging modalities like FDG-PET or SSTR-PET may be used depending on tumor differentiation and receptor status. Brain MRI is not performed routinely but may be indicated if neurologic symptoms are present or central nervous system involvement is suspected.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to strengthen taxes on alcoholic and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) to safeguard public health.

Alcohol has become more affordable or has not changed in price in most countries since 2022, while many SSBs such as fruit juices and ready-to-drink coffees and teas have escaped taxation.

There is currently no single, European Union-wide tax level for SSB, meaning that taxes are imposed nationally. As of 2024, 14 EU member states had introduced taxes for SSBs, including Netherlands, France, Ireland, Hungary, and Romania. 

While the EU has a harmonized legal framework for minimum taxation on alcohol that allows countries to set higher rates at the national level, it has not changed since 1992. Furthermore, the EU taxes wine at a minimum rate of 0%, meaning that wine is left untaxed in 21 European countries. 

“We have no information on whether EU alcohol taxes will be raised,” Carina Ferreira-Borges, PhD, WHO/Europe Regional Advisor on Alcohol, Illicit Drugs, and Prison Health, told Medscape News Europe.

The European Commission (EC) will set up a database of taxes or levies already in force in member states and establish a network of authorities to coordinate efforts to tax unhealthy food, a spokesperson told Medscape News Europe. 

The EC neither seeks to penalize producers or consumers nor to tell people what to eat or drink, the spokesperson stressed. Rather, it intends to encourage healthier food choices. 

The WHO has dubbed alcohol and SSB taxes a “triple-win strategy” that improves public health while reducing healthcare costs, generating government revenue, and contributing to health equity. 

Research supports this assessment. A 2024 umbrella review that examined 50 reviews found that increases in alcohol, tobacco, unhealthy food, and SSB prices are consistently linked to lower demand for these products. These increases also can be expected to increase tax revenue. 

Ferreira-Borges added that the WHO/Europe has conducted in-depth case studies from Germany, Portugal, and Georgia to model the impact of higher taxes on alcohol under different policy scenarios. The case study of Germany “highlights that in countries where alcohol is highly affordable, taxation remains one of the fastest and most effective levers to reduce harm at population level,” she said. 

Portugal and Georgia, meanwhile, show how no region is too “low-risk” to benefit from stronger alcohol pricing policies and that taxation can be applied successfully in contexts beyond Western Europe, she added. 

To encourage increased taxation, the WHO has launched its 3 by 35 Initiative, which aims to raise the real prices of tobacco, alcohol, and sugary drinks by at least 50% by 2035 via tax increases. 

The main obstacles to increasing taxes on alcoholic and sugary beverages are often political and commercial, rather than technical, said Ferreira-Borges. “The most consistent barrier is industry opposition,” she said. Other observers fear that higher taxes will be undermined by cross-border trade or informal markets. 

“Modeling from Georgia demonstrates that taxation works even where alcohol is sometimes sold and consumed outside of official regulation. But this evidence is not limited to modeling,” she explained, “Lithuania provides real-world proof: Following substantial alcohol tax increases as part of a broader policy package, the country experienced rapid declines in alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributable mortality.” 

General financial concerns may also present obstacles to introducing higher taxes. On this topic, Medscape News Europe spoke with Petra Petrová, PhD, treasurer of the Department of Biomedical Technology at Czech Technical University in Prague. While the Czech Republic has had conversations about taxing SSBs, no legislation has been enacted yet, she said. 

Reasons for this, she explained, include “political sensitivity around introducing new targeted taxes, competing fiscal policy priorities, and the fact that health-motivated taxation has so far not been a dominant instrument in Czech public finance.” 

Attitudes toward taxing alcohol in the Czech Republic are cautious. “Policy discussions tend to focus on spirits, and to some extent beer, rather than wine. Wine is widely perceived as a culturally embedded product and is often viewed as less harmful compared to other alcoholic beverages, which reduces political willingness to reconsider its tax treatment,” Pavel Semerád, vice-rector and head of the Center for Accounting and Taxation at STING University in Brno, told Medscape News Europe. 

Some argue, however, that countries shouldn't wait to increase taxation on alcoholic and sugary beverages. “Voluntary industry pledges have repeatedly failed to produce comparable or sustained public health effects. There is, therefore, little empirical basis for continued policy hesitation,” Anna Leibinger, PhD candidate and research assistant team leader in public health and nutrition at Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, told Medscape News Europe. 

By itself, increasing taxes solves just one part of the problem, she added. The etiology of conditions such as obesity and diabetes “is complex and deeply embedded in broader dietary patterns, socioeconomic conditions, and the built and food environments, requiring more comprehensive and coordinated policy action,” she concluded. 

Petrová, Semerád, and Leibinger reported no financial conflicts of interest.

Age-adjusted rates of stroke-related mortality among adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the United States declined from 1.08 to 0.71 per 100,000 people from 1999 to 2020. However, men, non-Hispanic Black individuals, residents of certain regions and states, and individuals living in small metropolitan areas continued to experience disproportionately high mortality, revealing persistent sociodemographic and geographic disparities.

""The findings highlight the need for targeted public health efforts to address these persistent disparities. Future research should focus on identifying the underlying biological, structural, and systemic factors contributing to these differences and evaluating interventions aimed at reducing stroke mortality among CKD populations, "" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Muhammad Ibrahim, MD, Department of Nephrology, Faisalabad Medical University in Faisalabad, Pakistan. It was published online on December 25, 2025, in the World Journal of Nephrology.

The study's retrospective nature limited control over data accuracy and may have introduced bias associated with administrative records. The dependence on coding for identifying stroke and CKD could have resulted in misclassification or underreporting, while temporal changes in coding practices may have affected trend consistency. The lack of granular clinical information, such as CKD stage, duration, or treatment modalities, limited the depth of clinical interpretation. 

The authors report no relevant conflicts of interest.

The nation's largest pediatric medical society has released new vaccine guidelines that for the first time differ sharply from what the US government advises. 

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended immunization schedule, released January 26, is endorsed by 12 other medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Pharmacists Association. The AAP recommends children and adolescents be vaccinated against 18 diseases. All children should receive the COVID-19, rotavirus, hepatitis A and B, meningococcal serogroups A, C, W, Y, and B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines. 

Earlier this month, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) at the CDC recommended these vaccines just for high-risk groups, a pivot from the agency's previous universal recommendations. 

“We recognize what is happening in ACIP and more broadly across HHS is not in the interest of the American public,” said Sean O'Leary, MD, MPH, chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases. 

The AAP and six other medical and public health groups are suing the government in federal court to disband ACIP and invalidate its latest actions, claiming the panel now serves “as a megaphone for spreading misinformation about immunization and infectious diseases.” The American College of Physicians, American Public Health Association, and Infectious Diseases Society of America, among others, have joined the AAP in the lawsuit. 

Published in the AAP Red Book Online, the AAP's schedule is the same as what the organization published in August 2025. Those recommendations include universal COVID-19 immunization beginning at 6 months and the addition of clesrovimab (Enflonsia) — a RSV vaccine — to the list of options recommended for all infants under age 8 months during their first RSV season. 

“Medical consensus has not shifted even if federal policy has,” said Peter Chin-Hong, MD, 

an infectious disease doctor at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, who was not involved in the new recommendations. “The science hasn't changed and what the AAP is doing with this statement is making that emphatic.” 

The AAP first published formal vaccine recommendations in 1938, decades before the formation of ACIP in the 1960s. Since then, the groups have traditionally worked together with other professional medical organizations to create a “harmonized schedule” for childhood vaccines, O'Leary said. 

“We're going to continue to make recommendations based on what is in the best interest of children and what the science tells us,” O'Leary said. “Unfortunately what is happening at the federal government does not seem to be based in science.” 

Both O'Leary and Chin-Hong said that, for now, all 18 vaccines the AAP recommends should be covered by insurance for anyone who chooses to get them. 

“Under the Affordable Care Act, those should still be covered by insurance,” O'Leary said, adding that the larger effect of the CDC's updates is sowing confusion among clinicians. “We are getting questions about this a lot from physicians.” 

Chin-Hong said he expects confusion among parents about differences in the guidelines to affect rates of childhood vaccination. 

“What is going to change is the confusion and the time it takes for clinicians to explain the changes to parents, which will probably lead to less uptake of vaccines regardless of whether insurance covers them,” he said. 

O'Leary advises clinicians to continue to advise parents as they always have done. 

“I don't recommend, in general, changing how you talk about vaccines. The vast majority of parents still vaccinate their kids according to the national recommended schedule,” he said. 

O'Leary also cautions against clinicians approaching parents with the assumption that they are skeptical about vaccine safety. 

“You know they are the standard of care, so recommend them as you have, and then if parents have questions, understand that they aren't trying to argue with you, they are concerned about the well-being of their kids,” he said. 

Chin-Hong said he recommends focusing on what has not changed rather than what has. 

“The provider hasn't changed, the science hasn't changed, we still have a lot of confidence, and the vaccines are still safe, and these recommendations are based in science, just like the other recommendations I give in my practice,” he said. 

The AAP has created a parent-friendly immunization schedule at HealthyChildren.org.

A lung pathogen grows stronger in iron-rich environments, but at the cost of its own virulence, revealing a hidden trade-off behind chronic infection.

Study: Iron dictates the growth, biofilm formation, and virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in pulmonary infections. Image credit: Christoph Burgstedt/Shutterstock.com

By modeling different iron environments relevant to persistent pulmonary infection, a recent study in Frontiers in Microbiology found that pre-exposure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to iron-rich laboratory conditions promotes bacterial growth and biofilm formation in experimental lung infection models, while contradictingly reducing virulence and host tissue damage.

The findings highlight a trade-off in which iron availability supports pulmonary persistence but dampens the expression of key virulence factors, helping explain why chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections can be difficult to eradicate yet vary widely in disease severity.

In hospitals and healthcare facilities, P. aeruginosa emerges as a versatile opportunistic pathogen that causes infections across multiple body systems, including wounds, the urinary tract, and the respiratory system. Of all these infections, persistent lung infections prove particularly difficult to treat, primarily because of the bacterium's remarkable ability to form biofilms.

Bacterial cells in biofilms are surrounded by a self-produced protective matrix that adheres to surfaces. As a model organism for biofilm research, P. aeruginosa demonstrates how these structures enable bacteria to withstand hostile environments and resist treatment, making chronic pulmonary infections especially stubborn.

P. aeruginosa deploys a sophisticated range of virulence factors to establish and maintain infection. This includes siderophores for iron acquisition, motility structures such as flagella, toxic compounds such as pyocyanin and exotoxin A, tissue-degrading enzymes including elastase and various proteases, and hemolysins, phospholipase C, and rhamnolipids. Each factor serves a distinct purpose in overwhelming host defenses.

Iron plays a central role in P. aeruginosa biofilm development and virulence. Though the body isolates iron in proteins, P. aeruginosa produces siderophores, molecules that bind iron to support growth and survival. Local environmental conditions, particularly iron availability, can dramatically alter bacterial growth and virulence, potentially explaining why chronic infections are difficult to treat.

The lung environment is unique in that the body restricts iron overall, yet pulmonary disease states may expose bacteria to fluctuating iron levels that influence pathogenicity. While iron regulation has been widely studied, relatively few investigations have combined in vitro and in vivo models to examine how iron exposure shapes P. aeruginosa behavior specifically in persistent lung infection contexts, or how these changes translate to host pathology.

The current study investigates how varying iron concentrations affect P. aeruginosa growth, biofilm formation, and virulence using laboratory models that simulate iron-replete and iron-restricted conditions relevant to pulmonary infection. Clinical P. aeruginosa isolates from persistent lung infections, and the reference strain PAO1, were tested under varying iron conditions. Iron-deficient conditions were created by supplementing tryptic soy broth (TSB) with 0 to 500 µM dipyridyl (DP), an iron chelator. PAO1 growth slowed progressively with increasing DP, with minimal growth at 500 µM. TSB with 400 µM DP was selected as the optimal iron-deficient condition.

To confirm growth inhibition was iron-specific, FeCl₃ was used. P. aeruginosa was cultured under three distinct iron conditions. The iron-replete condition used TSB alone. The iron-deficient condition used TSB with 400 µM DP. The partially iron-restored condition used TSB with 400 µM DP plus 5 µM FeCl₃, which partially reverses chelation without fully restoring iron to baseline TSB levels.

All P. aeruginosa strains demonstrated optimal growth in iron-replete environments, with significantly greater growth than in either the iron-restricted or partially iron-restored conditions. All strains exhibited significantly enhanced biofilm formation in the iron-replete environment compared to both the partially iron-restored and iron-restricted conditions.

The study noted that all P. aeruginosa strains exhibited significantly reduced production of virulence determinants, including protease, pyocyanin, exotoxin A, phospholipase C, alkaline protease, elastase, siderophore, and hemolysin, in the iron-replete medium compared to both the partially iron-restored and iron-restricted conditions. Production of these virulence determinants was also significantly lower under the partially iron-restricted condition than under iron restriction.

Galleria mellonella larvae infected with P. aeruginosa pre-cultured in iron-replete medium demonstrated significantly higher survival rates than those infected with bacteria grown in iron-restricted conditions. Under iron-replete conditions, these bacterial strains also exhibited significantly greater adhesion to pulmonary epithelial cells.

Consistent with the in vitro observations, mice infected with P. aeruginosa pre-cultured in iron-replete medium exhibited significantly higher pulmonary bacterial loads than those infected with bacteria pre-cultured in iron-restricted medium. Despite this increased bacterial burden, mice infected with iron-replete cultured bacteria demonstrated significantly lower levels of pulmonary PCT, IL-6, and IL-10.

Histological analysis revealed striking differences. Mice infected with P. aeruginosa cultured in iron-replete medium showed minimal granulocyte infiltration of alveolar walls and mildly irregular bronchiolar epithelium. In contrast, those infected with bacteria grown under iron restriction exhibited extensive pathology, including alveolar narrowing and collapse, significant immune cell infiltration, bronchiolar irregularities, perivascular edema, occasional hemorrhage, and interstitial vascular congestion.

Environmental iron availability during bacterial growth paradoxically affects P. aeruginosa in pulmonary infection models. It promotes bacterial growth and biofilm formation while simultaneously reducing virulence and host tissue damage. This decoupling of bacterial burden from disease severity may help explain why P. aeruginosa establishes persistent lung infections that are treatment-resistant yet exhibit variable clinical outcomes.

The findings suggest that iron-restricted environments may push P. aeruginosa toward a more aggressive, virulent state, whereas iron-rich conditions enable robust growth with diminished pathogenicity. The authors caution that therapeutic strategies aimed solely at iron deprivation could unintentionally exacerbate lung inflammation and tissue damage, highlighting the need for approaches that balance bacterial clearance with modulation of iron-responsive virulence pathways, as well as for future studies that directly probe how manipulating iron availability in the lung environment influences long-term infection outcomes.

An expert editorial suggests that widely used diabetes and obesity drugs may help close the long-standing mortality gap faced by people with serious mental illnesses by tackling cardiovascular risk and metabolic disease head-on.



Editorial: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have potential to transform health outcomes for persons with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and other serious mental illnesses by lengthening healthspan and reducing excess and premature mortality.

A recent editorial published in the journal Expert Opinion on Pharmacotherapy discussed that glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) may potentially transform health outcomes for individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMIs). The authors emphasized that these agents are most likely to improve outcomes by addressing the cardiometabolic drivers of excess morbidity and mortality rather than replacing established psychiatric treatments.

In 2005, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved the first GLP-1 receptor agonist, exenatide, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Since then, several GLP-1 mono-agonists have been approved, along with tirzepatide, the first dual GLP-1 and glucose insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonist. Additional dual and triple agonists targeting GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon receptors are in late-stage development.

Beyond T2D and weight management in individuals with overweight or obesity, GLP-1 receptor agonists are approved for metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis in people with moderate or advanced fibrosis, obstructive sleep apnea in obese adults, reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and slowing progression of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular mortality in adults with both chronic kidney disease and T2D.

Synthetic small-molecule oral GLP-1 receptor agonists are expected to be approved in 2026, while oral semaglutide is already available. These formulations may ease barriers related to manufacturing, supply chains, and access. There is a broad consensus that GLP-1 receptor agonists have transformed the management of T2D, obesity, and related morbidity and have been associated with reduced progression of renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and mortality in people with metabolic disorders.

Schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (BD), and other SMIs are severe, prevalent, and lifelong conditions that are major contributors to disability, reduced healthspan, and diminished social and economic participation, particularly in younger populations. Individuals with SMIs experience premature and excess mortality, with years of life lost often estimated between 5 and 25 years, largely due to earlier onset and substantially higher rates of CVD.

Affordable, scalable, and effective interventions are therefore essential to increase healthspan and reduce cardiovascular-related mortality among people with SMIs. Each condition for which GLP-1 receptor agonists are approved contributes differently to cardiometabolic risk and healthspan loss in this population. In addition, several agents are in mid- or late-stage development for chronic diseases such as peripheral artery disease and atherosclerotic heart disease, which disproportionately affect individuals with SMIs.

Despite the availability and clinical effectiveness of antipsychotics, lithium, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants, reductions in healthspan loss and cardiovascular mortality have been demonstrated only for selected classes and agents, including second-generation long-acting antipsychotics, lithium, and clozapine. Lithium, in particular, remains under-prescribed despite its strong efficacy in BD, limiting its overall public health impact.

GLP-1 receptor agonists are recommended for managing weight gain associated with psychotropic medications when discontinuation of psychiatric treatment is not feasible. Preliminary evidence also suggests a potential protective effect against lithium-induced nephrotoxicity, a condition for which no approved therapy currently exists. Additionally, several GLP-1 receptor agonists are being developed or repurposed for the treatment of alcohol, tobacco, and opioid use disorders.

Preclinical studies, small controlled trials, and observational research further suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists may have beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of mood disorders and in psychopathology domains that substantially impair quality of life, including cognitive dysfunction and anhedonia.

Several safety considerations are particularly relevant for individuals with SMIs. For example, the constipating effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists may interact with gastrointestinal motility disturbances caused by psychotropic medications.

Clinicians should also consider the increased risks of pancreatitis and sarcopenia, conditions that disproportionately affect people with SMIs. Furthermore, GLP-1 receptor agonists that are renally eliminated, such as lixisenatide and exenatide, are contraindicated in severe renal disease, which is more prevalent in this population. Although early pharmacovigilance reports suggested a possible association with suicidality, larger subsequent studies have not demonstrated a causal link, though ongoing monitoring remains advisable.

Overall, individuals with SMIs account for a disproportionate share of years of life lost and disability-adjusted life years. Despite decades of advances in psychopharmacology, the mortality gap between the general population and people with SMIs has not meaningfully narrowed. Therapeutic strategies that directly reduce mortality and extend healthspan are therefore urgently needed.

In this context, GLP-1 receptor agonists represent one of the most promising pharmacological classes, particularly if challenges related to cost, equitable access, reimbursement policy, and supply constraints are addressed. Prioritizing individuals with SMIs within fair allocation frameworks may help reduce excess and premature mortality in this vulnerable population in the near term.

BioDlink, a leading global contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO), has released a white paper titled Lyophilization Reimagined: A Digital‑Intelligence Platform for Predictable, Scalable Biologics Development, providing new evidence that digital intelligence tools can drastically improve the efficiency and scalability of biologics freeze-drying processes.

This white paper outlines how traditional lyophilization development, long considered a bottleneck in biologics production, is being disrupted by BioDlink's proprietary BDKLyo™ platform. Traditionally, lyophilization process development could take over two months due to trial-and-error testing and challenges in translating laboratory results to commercial-scale consistency. The BDKLyo™ platform, based on the Pikal model, regarded as lyophilization's 'gold standard', enables precise prediction of thermal and mass transfer conditions across scales.

Key Findings:

Development Time Halved: Digital intelligence applied via BioDlink's proprietary BDKLyo™ platform has reduced average lyophilization cycle development time from over 60 days to fewer than 30.

Fewer Experiments, More Predictability: The number of required experimental iterations is significantly reduced, thanks to advanced modeling based on the Pikal equation, which accurately predicts critical parameters such as chamber pressure, shelf temperature, and primary drying duration.

Increased Scale-Up Success Rates: The digital approach enables consistent product quality across development stages and scales, lowering the risk of revalidation and manufacturing setbacks.

This shift is particularly significant as the biologics market grows increasingly complex, with monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and recombinant proteins dominating new product pipelines. Scale-up precision and manufacturing reproducibility have become critical, especially for molecules with narrow formulation margins. The digital modeling approach described in the paper enables developers to simulate process outcomes in silico, minimizing costly experimental runs and increasing first-time-right outcomes in manufacturing.



According to this white paper, the integration of predictive modeling not only shortens development timelines but also significantly reduces risk during technology transfer. Early identification of critical parameters such as shelf temperature, chamber pressure, and product resistance allows manufacturers to anticipate and control key quality attributes, improving batch-to-batch consistency. Case studies' key findings include, based on real experimental validation data:

In Case Study A, adjusting the shelf temperature from −25 °C to −20 °C based on digital predictions shortened primary drying time from 56 hours to 39 hours, with actual results of 36.4 hours within 10 percent of model forecasts and product temperatures remaining consistent.

In Case Study B, optimization of large‑volume fills demonstrated that predicted drying times closely matched real outcomes: at −18 °C, the model projected 73.5 hours versus 75 hours experimentally, and at −15 °C, projected 64.9 hours versus an actual 66 hours.

These case studies demonstrate the ability of the BDKLyoTM digital-intelligence process calculation platform to accelerate lyophilization process development and scale-up. With BDKLyoTM, IND-stage projects can be completed in 1-2 experimental rounds, saving time and money during the CMC phase.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Lab safety: Is your lab safe enough?","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20260126/Lab-safety-Is-your-lab-safe-enough.aspx","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:21:00 GMT","

It goes without saying that prioritizing team safety delivers a wide range of benefits. Employees tend to view their organization more positively, and fostering a well-managed safety culture gives staff greater confidence, improving productivity and motivation while reducing absenteeism and downtime.

Reducing risks also reduces costs, resulting in fewer accidents, lower staff turnover, and a reduced risk of legal action. Beyond the organization itself, a strong safety culture improves reputation and standing with suppliers, partners, and investors.

Other articles have addressed efficiency and sample security, both of which are essential requirements in any cryogenic laboratory. However, safety must remain the top priority. When it does not, colleagues, samples, and even the entire operation are placed at risk.

To be clear, safety rules are not deliberately ignored in cryogenic laboratory installations. However, disjointed setups, poor ergonomics, shortcuts, inadequate training, and minimal compliance with regulations are frequently found.

These conditions expose laboratories to significant risks, often without awareness. The question is how this situation comes about.

In some cases, procurement practices are the root cause. For example, one supplier may provide the freezers, another the gas, and another the pipework.

Each supplier then assumes responsibility only for their specific contribution rather than the complete installation, creating safety gaps. At Air Products, the entire installation is reviewed, regardless of which elements are supplied.

Another issue relates to regulatory differences. Some equipment suppliers are unaware that standards applied in other countries do not necessarily meet United Kingdom regulations. As a result, purchasers and users may unknowingly fail to comply with the correct requirements.

In such cases, customers are advised on the steps required to meet applicable safety regulations. Wherever possible, solutions are identified that allow existing equipment to be used safely. However, there are occasions when gas supply cannot be provided because it would not be possible to do so safely.

Regulations also continue to evolve. Practices considered acceptable 10 years ago may no longer meet current standards. If any part of an older installation is modified, the entire system must be reviewed against the latest regulations, and guidance must be provided on what is required for compliance.

The British Compressed Gases Association (BCGA) produces the Codes of Practice for the installation and use of gases in cryogenic laboratories. These codes provide guidance and recommendations on safe and effective practices related to the use of compressed gases.

As a member of the BCGA, Air Products ensures that all relevant statutory regulations are applied in designs and installations covered by these codes. Laboratories are also expected to carry out their own risk assessments to ensure compliance during inspections by regulatory authorities.

At Air Products, safety is treated as a fundamental priority. It is embedded in all operations, particularly in industries where gases and equipment are supplied for critical applications. Air Products has consistently aimed to meet and exceed safety regulations, maintaining high standards, especially within cryogenic laboratory environments.

A wide range of additional guidance is available. As part of its safety commitment, Air Products provides an extensive online resource that includes a series of Safetygrams. These downloadable PDF documents cover many safety aspects related to gases and associated equipment.

For cryogenic freezing, the most relevant Safetygrams include number 7 (Liquid Nitrogen), number 16 (Safe Handling of Cryogenic Liquids), number 27 (Cryogenic Liquid Containers), and number 49 (Safe Operation of Liquid Nitrogen Freezers for Cryogenic Freezing).

Air Products also offers fully accredited online training courses covering gas safety, which can be delivered on-site for group training. Training increases awareness of potential hazards and ensures staff remain up to date with current regulations, supporting safe and effective working practices.

Under United Kingdom law, employers hold primary responsibility for the health, safety, and welfare of employees and others affected by their work. Employees also have a duty to safeguard their own safety and that of others.

Whether operating a small laboratory or a large organization such as a hospital or university, liability may arise if a serious accident or incident occurs. For this reason, it is crucial to minimize unnecessary risks by ensuring that laboratories are designed safely and that staff receive appropriate training and have access to personal protective equipment.

Safety is an important element of any cryogenic laboratory, and overlooking it can lead to dangerous or even life-threatening situations.

Mitigating risk is integral to operating an efficient and secure laboratory. Air Products specialists are available to review entire laboratory installations, taking a holistic approach to ensure all safety considerations are addressed and providing confidence that safety requirements are fully met.

IntroductionStructure and CompositionFormation and MaintenanceBiological FunctionsThe Endothelial GlycocalyxRole in Health and DiseaseMethods to Study the GlycocalyxFuture OutlookReferences

The glycocalyx emerges as an active endothelial system whose structure, metabolism, and shear-dependent regulation integrate mechanical forces with vascular signaling. Disruption of this system provides a unifying mechanism linking endothelial dysfunction to inflammation, barrier failure, and cardiometabolic disease.

For decades, researchers conceptualized the vascular endothelium as a simple, non-thrombogenic layer lining the blood vessels, a passive barrier separating the circulating blood from the vessel wall. More recent research has debunked this reductionist view by elucidating the endothelial glycocalyx (eGCX), a complex, gel-like ""glycoscape"" that coats the luminal surface of endothelial cells. 1

It is important to clarify that the term “GlycoLax” is a common pharmaceutical trade name for polyethylene glycol–based laxatives and is unrelated to vascular biology; the correct biological term discussed here is the endothelial glycocalyx. 2

Studies have shown that the glycocalyx is a dynamically regulated organelle that alters vascular homeostasis. It is now known to serve as the primary mechanotransducer of hemodynamic shear stress, a gatekeeper of vascular permeability, and a crucial modulator of the immune response.

This article synthesizes recent research to present a comprehensive overview of the glycocalyx, detailing its molecular architecture and non-template-driven biosynthesis and highlighting how these processes connect vascular health to cellular metabolism.

Furthermore, it unravels how the pathological ""shedding"" of this layer drives sepsis, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, and evaluates emerging therapeutic strategies, from sulodexide to synthetic glycoscapes, that aim to restore this fragile yet vital barrier.

The endothelial glycocalyx is a multicomponent, carbohydrate-rich layer that coats the luminal surface of endothelial cells. Formerly considered an artifact of microscopy, it is now identified as a critical regulator of the cell's interaction with its environment.1

A growing body of literature suggests that the glycocalyx functions as a physical barrier and a transduction interface, mediating the exchange of information and force between circulating blood and the vessel wall. Its integrity is the defining feature of a healthy vascular interface. At the same time, its degradation is increasingly recognized as a trigger for diverse pathologies ranging from acute inflammation to chronic vascular disease.1

Physically, the glycocalyx resembles a ""bush-like"" meshwork composed of a proteoglycan backbone and a canopy of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The layer's structural foundation is provided by transmembrane proteoglycans, primarily syndecans (particularly Syndecan-1), which anchor the layer to the cytoskeleton, and GPI-anchored glypicans (e.g., Glypican-1), which localize to lipid rafts.1,2

Extending from these proteoglycan cores are long, negatively charged GAG chains, predominantly heparan sulfate (50–90 %) and chondroitin sulfate, which create a vast reservoir for binding plasma ligands.1

Interwoven within this mesh is hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid), an extremely long, non-sulfated polymer that does not bind covalently to core proteins but instead interacts with surface receptors (e.g., CD44) to provide hydration and structural volume.1,2

Recent research highlights that, unlike most structural proteins (which are encoded in the host's DNA), the glycocalyx is synthesized through a complex, non-template-driven metabolic process.3

The glycocalyx's proteoglycan cores are synthesized in the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), while the GAG chains are elongated and modified by specific enzymes (such as EXT1/2 and sulfotransferases) in the Golgi apparatus.3 Hyaluronan has recently been shown to demonstrate a notable exception to this synthesis pathway; it is synthesized directly at the plasma membrane by Hyaluronan Synthases (HAS), with HAS2 being the dominant endothelial isoform. 4

Studies have shown that hemodynamic forces dynamically regulate the biological maintenance of the glycocalyx. Specifically, laminar shear stress activates the transcription factor KLF2, which upregulates HAS2 expression and redistributes endothelial glucose flux from glycolysis toward UDP-sugar biosynthesis, thereby supplying substrates required for glycocalyx regeneration. 9

Mechanistic investigations have identified three main glycocalyx functions: 1. Protection, 2. Permeability modulation, and 3. Mechanotransduction (conversion of physical environmental cues into biochemical signals).1,3,5

In the vascular system, the endothelial glycocalyx (eGCX) is the primary determinant of vascular health. A growing body of evidence indicates that the eGCX is not uniform across the body, with significant thickness and compositional heterogeneity among organs.1,5

In the renal glomerulus, the highly anionic glycocalyx contributes substantially to charge-selective filtration, and its degradation has been directly linked to albuminuria in both experimental and clinical studies. 3

In contrast, in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), a dense glycocalyx has been observed to work in concert with tight junctions to strictly limit the entry of potentially neurotoxic elements. Epidemiological and experimental studies now link BBB-associated eGCX degradation to neuroinflammation and cerebral edema.1,6

The degradation or ""shedding"" of the glycocalyx is now established as a hallmark of systemic disease. In sepsis, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress activate enzymes such as heparanase and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to the release of syndecan-1 and heparan sulfate fragments into the circulation.2,6

A 2025 meta-analysis confirmed that elevated plasma levels of Syndecan-1 are significantly associated with increased mortality in sepsis patients (Odds Ratio = 2.04), validating glycocalyx degradation as a prognostic indicator of endothelial injury.7

Furthermore, in diabetes and atherosclerosis, disturbed shear stress and chronic metabolic dysfunction impair glycocalyx biosynthesis, exposing the endothelium to lipoprotein infiltration and leukocyte adhesion, thereby accelerating plaque formation.6,9

Traditional electron microscopy (EM) often dehydrates samples, causing glycocalyx collapse and underestimation of thickness. To overcome this, cryo-electron microscopy and Sidestream Dark Field (SDF) imaging are now used to preserve the hydrated endothelial surface layer in vivo.8

Recently, super-resolution techniques such as Resolution Enhancement by Sequential Imaging (RESI) combined with metabolic labeling have achieved ångström-level resolution, enabling visualization of individual sugar residues within intact cell-surface glycans.2

While earlier work emphasized visualization, the field is now shifting toward intervention. Glycocalyx-targeted therapeutics such as sulodexide, a mixture of heparan and dermatan sulfates, have demonstrated efficacy in restoring glycocalyx integrity, reducing endothelial permeability, and improving outcomes in experimental and clinical sepsis.1

Bioengineers are also developing synthetic glycoscapes, engineered nanomaterials designed to reconstitute endothelial surface layers, representing a promising frontier for acute vascular protection and precision therapeutics.2

From traditional Mesoamerican staple to emerging functional food, mamey sapote offers compelling nutritional promise while science works to define the boundaries of its proven health benefits.

The global search for functional foods is increasingly focusing its attention on the Neotropics, a region characterized by immense botanical diversity.1 Among these, Pouteria sapota, which is more commonly known as mamey sapote, has historically been consumed throughout Mexico and Central America.1

Recent phytochemical and nutraceutical evidence indicates that mamey sapote pulp and by-products contain carotenoids, phenolic compounds, and dietary fiber that are associated with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential, primarily based on compositional analyses and preclinical models.1,7

P. sapota is a large, evergreen tree native to the lowlands of southern Mexico and Central America. These climacteric plants thrive in warm and humid climates, wherein they undergo a rapid increase in respiration and ethylene production during ripening.1-3

Mamey sapote is an ovoid berry between eight and 20 centimeters (cm) in length that is encapsulated within a rough, brown pericarp. Upon maturity, the fruit contains salmon-red pulp with a creamy, finely granular texture and flavor profile reminiscent of almond and sweet potato.1

Mamey sapote pulp remains a staple food in the Neotropic region for centuries, as it is widely used in beverages and desserts, as well as a garnishing for local diet. While seeds are incorporated into some traditional preparations, seed-derived products require controlled processing and safety evaluation because cyanogenic potential has been reported for certain Sapotaceae seeds and preparations.1,3

Biochemical studies of P. sapota demonstrate that this fruit is an exceptional source of dietary fiber, with quantitative analyses indicating contents ranging from 5.4-6 g/100 g of edible portion.1,3 This fiber matrix includes both soluble fractions and insoluble fractions like pectins and cellulose, respectively, which have been established to significantly contribute to satiety and digestive health.1

P. sapota is rich in vitamins C and E, as well as potassium, magnesium, and iron.1 As compared to carrots, which are dominated by β-carotene, mamey sapote also accumulates rare keto-carotenoids with a κ-ring structure, primarily sapotexanthin and cryptocapsin.4,5 Human intervention data support the dietary relevance of these carotenoids as contributors to vitamin A status, despite reduced bioavailability from the intact fruit matrix.5

Hydrophilic extracts of mamey sapote, which contain concentrated phenolic acids and flavonoids, exhibit superior in vitro radical scavenging activity as compared to lipophilic fractions.1,4 Targeted LC-MS profiling has identified multiple polyphenolic antioxidants in Pouteria fruits, including gallic acid and catechin derivatives, which correspond with measured antioxidant capacity.6

Evidence summarized in recent reviews suggests that carotenoids and phenolic compounds in lesser-consumed tropical fruits, including mamey sapote, may influence inflammatory pathways; however, for mamey specifically, most mechanistic insights derive from preclinical or in vitro studies rather than human clinical trials.7

Nutriomics and metabolomics research suggest that P. sapota may present a compelling biochemical profile for dietary interventions against these conditions.1-3,5 In humans, postprandial studies demonstrate absorption of sapotexanthin and formation of retinyl esters following mamey sapote intake, supporting its relevance as a dietary source of provitamin A rather than as a demonstrated modulator of long-term metabolic disease risk.5 Experimental evidence from model organisms indicates improved resistance to oxidative stress following exposure to mamey carotenoid extracts, but these findings cannot be directly extrapolated to chronic human health outcomes.4

The high concentration of insoluble fiber in mamey sapote increases stool bulk, thereby stimulating intestinal peristalsis.1 Concurrently, soluble fiber and polyphenols act as substrates for colonic bacteria, which subsequently ferment these substrates to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) like butyrate, which are crucial for maintaining gut barrier integrity.1,2

These digestive effects reflect well-established physiological roles of dietary fiber and polyphenols in general; however, direct clinical trials evaluating gut microbiome composition, SCFA production, or gastrointestinal outcomes following mamey sapote consumption are currently lacking.1,7

In Mesoamerica, P. sapota pulp is consumed fresh or processed into sorbets and smoothies.1 Culturally, P. sapota differs from Manilkara zapota (chicozapote), which was historically used to manufacture chewing gum.

Ethnobotanical practices also utilize the large seeds (pixtle), which ancient Mesoamerican documents reveal are roasted and ground for traditional beverages like tejate. Mamey sapote seed oil, which is regionally known as sapuyul, also promotes hair health.3,5,6 Analytical studies report that the seed contains high lipid levels and a fatty-acid profile dominated by oleic, stearic, palmitic, and linoleic acids, supporting its traditional and contemporary use in cosmetic and fat-blend applications rather than direct nutritional supplementation.3

Recent scientific research has largely focused on enhancing the bioavailability of the unique compounds present in mamey sapote through the optimization of its acquisition and processing.7 In this context, studies on drying, sensing, and postharvest monitoring of tropical fruits contribute methodological insight relevant to mamey sapote processing, even when not directly evaluating its nutritional effects.2,7

Although the bioavailability of mamey sapote components is established, there remains a lack of clinical data on their long-term metabolic effects using markers like hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and lipid profiles.1 Current human evidence is strongest for postprandial carotenoid absorption and vitamin A contribution rather than sustained cardiometabolic or anti-inflammatory outcomes.5 Important toxicological concerns are due to the presence of cyanogenic glycosides within mamey sapote seeds that release hydrogen cyanide upon hydrolysis, which necessitates additional research to establish standardized safety limits for seed-derived products.1,3,6

A massive nationwide study shows that lighting up before age 20 leaves a lasting cardiovascular imprint, intensifying the damage of smoking and raising the risk of heart attack, stroke, and early death well into adulthood.



Study: Early age at smoking initiation is associated with elevated cardiovascular disease and mortality risk in a nationwide population-based cohort. Image Credit: Gudman / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers investigated whether the age at which people begin smoking is independently associated with future risks of myocardial infarction (MI), combined cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and stroke.

Individuals who started smoking at younger ages, particularly before 20 years, had substantially higher risks of death, stroke, and MI compared with later starters, even at the same level of cumulative smoking exposure. This suggests an additional risk beyond total smoking dose as measured by pack-years, while acknowledging that initiation age and lifetime exposure remain closely related behaviors.

Smoking is one of the leading preventable causes of death worldwide and remains a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, including MI and stroke. Extensive evidence shows that greater cumulative smoking exposure, measured in pack-years, increases cardiovascular risk.

However, this dose-response relationship is not entirely linear, as even light smoking can substantially elevate risk, suggesting that using pack-years as an indicator may not fully capture smoking-related harm.

Age at smoking initiation has emerged as a potential additional determinant of long-term health outcomes. Early initiation is associated with higher adult mortality and morbidity, possibly due to heightened biological vulnerability during development and long-lasting behavioral effects such as stronger nicotine dependence.

Despite this, prior studies on the effects of age at initiation on cardiovascular outcomes have yielded inconsistent findings, often limited by small sample sizes or inadequate adjustment for confounding factors.

Researchers investigated whether early smoking initiation independently increases mortality and cardiovascular risks and whether it modifies the effects of cumulative smoking exposure. They used a retrospective cohort study from a national health database in Korea, which covers more than 95% of the population through a mandatory health insurance system.

The study included 9,295,979 adults above the age of 20 who were part of the National Health Screening Program in 2009 and had no prior history of stroke, MI, or end-stage kidney disease.

Smoking information was self-reported and included age at initiation, current or former smoking status, and cumulative exposure in pack-years, defined as the product of packs of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked. Participants were categorized based on initiation age and smoking exposure. Additional analyses used alternative thresholds and a composite measure of pack-years divided by initiation age.

Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory, and lifestyle data, including blood pressure, lipid levels, diabetes status, alcohol intake, physical activity, and socioeconomic status, were collected and used as covariates.

Participants were followed until incident MI, stroke, death, or the end of 2018. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for each outcome, adjusting for major cardiovascular risk factors and testing interactions between age at initiation and cumulative smoking exposure.

Among the study population, 40.1% had a history of smoking, and nearly one-quarter of smokers had started before the age of 20. Over approximately nine years of follow-up, all smoker groups showed higher probabilities of cardiovascular events and mortality compared with nonsmokers. The highest risks were observed in individuals who both started smoking early and accumulated heavy exposure of 20 or more pack-years.

Compared with nonsmokers, individuals who started smoking early and accumulated heavy exposure had more than double the risk of MI (HR 2.43), a markedly increased risk of stroke (HR 1.78), combined stroke or MI (HR 2.00), and elevated all-cause mortality (HR 1.82). These risks were significantly higher than those observed in smokers with similar pack-years who started smoking later in life.

A clear dose-response relationship was observed. Earlier initiation was linked to progressively higher cardiovascular risk, even after adjusting for total pack-years. Significant interactions indicated that the harmful effects of greater smoking exposure were amplified when smoking began at younger ages. These patterns were consistent across subgroups defined by sex, metabolic health, smoking status, and different exposure thresholds.

Associations with all-cause mortality were directionally similar but generally weaker than those observed for cardiovascular outcomes, particularly among younger participants. The authors note that this may reflect limited follow-up time for mortality endpoints.

This nationwide study demonstrates that starting smoking at a younger age substantially increases the risk of MI and stroke after statistical adjustment for cumulative smoking exposure, and that early initiation intensifies the cardiovascular harm associated with heavier smoking. These findings suggest heightened vulnerability from adolescence into early adulthood, while remaining consistent with an observational, non-causal interpretation.

Key strengths include the exceptionally large sample size, long follow-up, and detailed adjustment for clinical, behavioral, and socioeconomic confounders, allowing robust assessment of interactions between initiation age and smoking intensity.

However, limitations include reliance on self-reported smoking data, potential recall bias, lack of information on smoking changes over time or duration of cessation, and unmeasured confounders such as diet, family history, and genetic risk. The cohort was predominantly male and Asian, which may limit generalizability.

These findings indicate that preventing young people from starting smoking, particularly before the age of 20, could have substantial effects on reducing cardiovascular disease and premature death at the population level.

The Emma Hayes era with the United States women's national team has been a good one so far, with 26 wins and just three losses in 31 games.

A terrific start saw Hayes win the first ever Ballon d'Or awarded for Women's Coach of the Year after leading the USWNT to an Olympic gold medal, defeating Brazil in a tense final. 

It hasn't been speed bump free, but Hayes is exploring the program's depth and mostly producing wins.

Beth Mead speaks after Arsenal's 3-0 win over Oud-Heverlee Leuven in the UEFA Women's Champions League. (0:46)

The inaugural FIFA Women's Champions Cup travels to London on Wednesday as the final four clubs battle for the trophy. Having started back in October, the competition is played between the six best teams from each continental confederation, with this week's final tournament format featuring two semifinals, a third-place playoff and a final.

With diverse playing styles and world-class talent on display, the event promises high-stakes drama with the chance of silverware on the line and the highest-ever single prize-money payout in women's football for the winner. But what do you need to know about it?

Each FIFA confederation held its own version of the UEFA Champions League tournament, many for the first time as they did not have a historical club tournament like UEFA.

On announcing the new competition last year, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said: ""Women's football has reached new heights at national team level and now it's time for global competitions that showcase the best clubs from around the world.""

No, the 16-team Club World Cup is a separate competition. But think of this one as its little sister.

Originally, the Club World Cup was scheduled for 2026, but due to organizational and planning issues, FIFA chose to postpone it until 2028. Not wanting to miss the chance at having three tournaments in consecutive years, with the 2027 World Cup to be held next year in Brazil, FIFA opted to implement the six-team Champions Cup.

The Club World Cup, already engulfed in controversy over its possible hosting in Qatar and scheduling concerns, is set for Jan. 5-30, 2028, which will directly impact at least five Women's Super League (WSL) matchdays, something the league believes could be ""catastrophic.""

The teams competing in London are England's Arsenal (UEFA), NWSL side Gotham FC (CONCACAF), Brazilian team Corinthians (CONMEBOL), and Morocco's ASFAR [Royal Armed Forces Sports Association] (CAF).

New Zealand's Auckland United FC (Oceania) and China's Wuhan Jiangda WFC (AFC) have already been knocked out of the competition, with Wuhan beating Auckland in the first round and then losing to ASFAR in round two. The other three teams progressed straight to the semifinals.

Gotham FC take on Corinthians in the first semifinal at 12:30 p.m. GMT (7:30 p.m. ET) on Wednesday, Jan. 26. Then Arsenal face ASFAR in the second at 6 p.m. GMT (1 p.m. ET).

The winners will play the final on Feb. 1 at 6 p.m. GMT (1 p.m. ET), with the losers in the third-place playoff beforehand at 2:45 p.m. GMT (9:45 a.m. ET).

Having won the UEFA Women's Champions League for a second time -- ending an 18-year wait since their first victory in 2006 -- Arsenal are Europe's representative.

North America will have Gotham FC as they won the 2025 NWSL Championship, which earned them a place in the inaugural CONCACAF Women's Champions Cup -- a 10-team competition split into two groups, a semifinal and final. Gotham came second in their group to progress to the knockouts, then beat Club America 3-1 in the semifinal, before defeating Tigres 1-0 in the final to claim the crown.

Disney+ will be the only place football fans can watch all 75 matches live each season. Visit the Disney+ website to get access.

Africa will be represented by ASFAR, who have won every domestic Moroccan title since 2015 and every Moroccan Throne Cup since 2013. CAF first started the African Women's Champions League in 2021 and ASFAR won it in 2022, then again in 2025, becoming the only team to win it twice in its five-year history.

The CONMEBOL champions are Brazilian side Corinthians, who won the Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino before sealing a third-straight Copa Libertadores in a dramatic penalty shootout against Deportivo Cali.

Meanwhile, Ocenia's Auckland United FC won the third edition of the OFC Champions League, and Chinese side Wuhan Jiangda picked up the inaugural AFC Champions League for Asia.

Originally, the Champions Cup was scheduled for the west coast of the United States. However, as Arsenal are in the middle of a jam-packed season, with crucial WSL title race games either side of the tournament, the nine-hour travel, jet lag and minimal preparation time meant the club were adamant about moving the competition closer to home, sources have told ESPN.

Gotham FC, who run a different calendar to the UK -- they play March-November, while WSL teams play September-May -- are in their offseason but have spent the past month based in Europe, playing a variety of teams to gain momentum, exposure and keep fit.

FIFA agreed to move the tournament to England and Wednesday's semifinals will be played at the GTech Community Stadium, the home of Brentford FC in west London. The finals will be held at Emirates Stadium, Arsenal's home ground, removing the neutral venue advantage for all teams and giving the Champions League holders a huge home advantage.

Auckland United and Wuhan Jiangda were awarded $100,000 for their participation.

The two teams who exit in the semifinals will earn $200,000.

The runner-up will take home $1 million, with the winner earning $2.3 million.

Ali Krieger was full of praise for Gotham FC and their manager Juan Carlos Amorós after their NWSL Championship win over Washington Spirit.

These two are rather unfamiliar opponents to each other but, as a leading powerhouse in one of the most advanced leagues in the world, with a host of top international players like Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle and Esther González, Gotham are likely to take the win.

However, Corinthians' ethos and pedigree is not to be overlooked. They have some impressive players -- such as captain Tamires, who has over 150 caps for Brazil -- and a true identity that makes them a ruthless team. However, Gotham's dedicated preparation in Europe will make them tough to beat.

Gotham player to watch: Ann-Katrin Berger. Anyone who watched the WSL from 2018-2024 will remember Berger for her iconic saves and world-class performances that helped Chelsea to win five WSL titles. Returning to England, Berger comes off the back of some impressive form for Germany and will be at the center of Gotham's hopes for the inaugural trophy.

Corinthians player to watch: Jhonson. The forward has enjoyed a stellar 2025. She netted the decisive penalty against Deportivo Cali in the Copa Libertadores final to qualify the Timão for this competition and has now worked her way into Brazil's senior setup. The 20-year-old is quickly proving to be a key cog for the South Americans and will enjoy trying to open up the Gotham defense.

Prediction: Gotham 3-0 Corinthians.

As one of the best teams in the world -- with history, innovation and resources at their disposal -- Arsenal are in pole position to reach the final. The Gunners have world-class players, state-of-the-art facilities and home advantage too, so it is all stacked in their favor to secure a victory.

But ASFAR may prove more of a challenge than expected. The Moroccan side demonstrated their resilience with a dramatic comeback in their second-round match against Wuhan to secure a semifinal spot, and that is something Arsenal have struggled with this season.

Arsenal player to watch: Alessia Russo. The crown jewel in the Arsenal attack, Russo is used as both a striker and attacking midfielder to force opponents into mistakes at the back. She holds the ball up and dictates the tempo, and has been one of the club's best players this, and last, season. She is hard to stop once she gets going and ASFAR will need to close her down effectively.

ASFAR player to watch: Anissa Lahmari. The former Paris Saint-Germain star has a wealth of experience across the globe. She has played in France for several clubs, had a loan spell at Reading, and spent a period of time in Spain with Levante before joining ASFAR. She was also part of France's youth setup before switching her allegiance to Morocco in 2023. Lahmari has played against Arsenal before, and her teammates will be picking her brains as to how to frustrate the north London side.

Prediction: Arsenal 4-0 ASFAR","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Gotham FC signed Florida State University forward and U.S. youth international Jordynn Dudley to a multi-year contract through the 2028 National Women's Soccer League season, the NWSL champions announced on Monday.

JERSEY CITY, N.J. – Gotham FC signed Florida State University forward and U.S. youth international Jordynn Dudley to a multi-year contract through the 2028 National Women's Soccer League season, the NWSL champions announced on Monday.

Dudley recently completed her junior season with powerhouse Florida State, concluding one of the most prolific collegiate careers in program history. In 53 matches, she recorded 30 goals and 29 assists, claiming two national championships and three All-American recognitions.

“I am so excited to join a championship-caliber organization like Gotham FC with a history of success,” Dudley said in a statement. “I know this environment will push my development every day, and I can't wait to compete alongside this incredible team. Thank you to Yael Averbuch West, Juan Carlos Amoros and everyone at Gotham for this opportunity. Let's go Gotham!”

Dudley, 21, capped her collegiate career as a national champion in 2025, winning the NCAA Division I Tournament for the second time after claiming the title as a freshman in 2023. She started all 22 matches during her junior season, totaling 11 goals and 14 assists, including three game-winning goals. Her third year earned her recognition as a finalist for the Missouri Athletic Club Hermann Trophy and All-Atlantic Coast Conference first team honors.

“Jordynn is a dynamic attacker who has shown the ability to impact games at a very high level,” Gotham FC general manager and head of soccer operations Yael Averbuch. “We're excited to add her to our attacking group and look forward to supporting her continued growth as a professional player.”

Her freshman season was equally impressive. Dudley finished the 2023 campaign with 14 goals, nine assists and 37 points, all second-most by a freshman in school history. She scored the opening goal in the NCAA tournament against Stanford University, helping Florida State to a 5-1 victory. She was named ACC freshman of the year and NCAA Tournament offensive most outstanding player and earned All-ACC freshman team honors.

Across her three collegiate seasons, Dudley was named a Hermann Trophy semifinalist each year, a three-time All-ACC first team selection, a two-time All-ACC tournament team honoree (2023, 2024) and a three-time United Soccer Coaches All-American.

Dudley, who hails from Milton, Ga. has represented the United States at the youth international level, including with the Under-20 team at the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup in 2024. She made five appearances, including two starts, scoring two goals – highlighted by a 98th-minute strike to lift the U.S. to a come-from-behind quarterfinal win over Germany. Last January, Dudley received her first U.S. women's national team call-up.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT Tracker: Matches to forget for Pulisic, Scally, Trusty; McKennie's fine form continues","https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6999133/2026/01/26/usmnt-tracker-scally-mckennie-trusty/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:43:15 GMT","

Pulisic and McKennie had contrasting weekends Getty Images - Gabriele Maltinti/Getty Images and Valerio Pennicino/Getty Images

It was a case of dry spells, own goals and red cards for some — but momentum continued and lavish praise for others across Europe's U.S. contingent this weekend.

First things first, this is not a crisis. Christian Pulisic ranks fifth for goal contributions in Italy this season, and only Serie A top scorer Lautaro Martinez has more goals per 90 minutes than the American.

Advertisement

The USMNT star had a scintillating start to the campaign, when he still managed eight league goals and two assists for Milan despite missing five games with a hamstring problem.

But in a league and team when he has so often been the leading light and most talked-about performer, things have been a little quiet lately.

Six league games have passed without a goal or assist for the 27-year-old, and on Sunday against Roma, his manager Max Allegri preferred to go with two up front, Christopher Nkunku and Rafael Leao, with Pulisic benched.

Milan settled for a -1- draw in the capital and Pulisic's 27 minutes on the field yielded minimal impact.

In context, five unspectacular games (he was not involved in the January 15 win at Como) are not overly worrying.

Forwards are not judged on their numbers alone — Bukayo Saka hasn't scored in the Premier League for leaders Arsenal since November.

And Pulisic, like the England international, has more than enough credit in the bank (and overall influence otherwise) to weather a dry spell.

With Milan second in the table, intent on securing a return to the Champions League next term at the minimum, while also in the title race with Inter, there is plenty to play for.

Plenty too for their talismanic top scorer to influence, as soon as his form from last year catches up with 2026.

What's the opposite of Super Sunday? Just ask Joe Scally and Auston Trusty.

The USMNT defenders have both been in good form for their clubs recently. Both have even contributed goals. But this weekend was one to forget. First, Scally got the ball rolling by bundling it into his own net as his team Borussia Monchengladbach lost 3-0 at home to Stuttgart.



Scally had already struggled after dealing inadequately with a cross, which let the high-flying visitors score their first.

In Scotland, Trusty saved his own disappointing performance for a crucial game as Celtic faced league leaders Hearts.

He was below his own recent high standards before then being sent off in controversial circumstances on 77 minutes, after a VAR review of his foul on Pierre Landry Kabore as he burst through on goal.

The referee initially showed the American only a yellow, but the video assistant said it should be a red card. Obviously, Celtic manager Martin O'Neill did not agree and neither did former refereeing chief Dermot Gallagher on Sky Sports' Ref Watch.



For Borussia Monchengladbach, it's just one win and three defeats in their last five Bundesliga games, and for Trusty's Celtic, it was ground lost in their bid to overhaul Hearts. Worse too, rivals Rangers also pinched their second spot in the Scottish Premiership.

In the grand scheme of things, neither should be too downhearted. They are both regulars for their teams and neither games are representative of their seasons to date.

But they won't want to dwell on this weekend.

Juventus enjoyed a statement win over defending champions Napoli in Serie A on Sunday.

At the heart of the Turin side's 3-0 victory was their dependable USMNT midfielder Weston McKennie, still riding the high of his repeated Champions League heroics.

McKennie scored for the third European game in a row last week, and although he didn't get on the scoresheet against Napoli, he created two chances and prompted lavish praise from manager Luca Spalletti, who underlined the theory that the Texan can play pretty much anywhere.

“McKennie would be the perfect centre-forward,” an admiring Spaletti told Sky Italia. “He is one of the best there is in this role because he's always where the ball is. He fights for every ball.

“He's good in the air because he has this impressive leap, and he attacks the space in behind like nobody else. So we don't only have [Canadian international striker Jonathan] David. We also have McKennie, who does a bit of everything and does it well.”

McKennie is the ultimate Swiss Army knife for his team, but being a jack of all trades is rarely to his detriment.

At the other end of the experience scale, Patrick Agyemang is taking the English Championship by storm.



The striker was on target again on Friday, getting Derby County's goal in a 1-1 draw with West Brom.

He now has eight goals — two in his last three games — during his debut season in England, and seems to be building momentum nicely as he reminds Mauricio Pochettino that it is not Haji Wright he must keep a close eye on in the English second tier during this World Cup year.

The Champions League first league phase draws to a close this week with plenty of American interest.

Folarin Balogun only got a yellow card for his troubles at the weekend with Monaco as they drew with Le Havre on Saturday, but he goes head-to-head with McKennie and Juve on Wednesday at Stade Louis II.

The French side could do with a win to secure progress to the qualifying round for the play-off stage, but Spalletti's side will be a tough obstacle.

Balogun, who has three goals in this season's Champions League, better bring his shooting boots. McKennie, chasing four in four, has certainly been wearing his. Tune in on Wednesday (3pm, Paramount +).

For Johnny Cardoso, who was back in the Atletico Madrid team for their 3-0 win over Mallorca at the weekend, it's the thorny task of Bodo/Glimt on Wednesday, the Norwegians who beat Manchester City last week. It will be an intriguing tie as the underdogs are still not totally out of contention for the play-offs, while Cardoso & Co are assured of a place (Wednesday, 3pm, Paramount +).

Keep an eye on Malik Tillman and Leverkusen, who need to beat second-bottom Villarreal to be certain of progress too (Wednesday, 3pm, Paramount +). PSV could also do with some Sergino Dest magic as they chase a vital win to make it through, although at least their opponents, Bayern, are second in the table (Wednesday, 3pm, Paramount +).

In the Europa League, Auston Trust may have a chance to make immediate amends with Celtic as they take on Utrecht (Thursday, 3pm, Paramount +).

Then Tanner Tessmann and Lyon have been in strong Ligue 1 form, they've won four on the spin, and he has started the last two. The French side are sitting pretty at the top of the Europa League table, guaranteed to progress, but play Greece's PAOK on Thursday (3pm, Paramount +).

Last but not least, Sunday in the Premier League sees Chris Richards, who scored at the weekend in his 100th English top-flight appearance for Crystal Palace (the 3-1 defeat by Chelsea) take on Nottingham Forest (Peacock Premium, 7pm).

A pair of Americans could be moving in the Premier League

As the January transfer window inches towards its frantic and at times desperate end a pair of USMNT players are rumored to be targeted by new teams. Ricardo Pepi has been linked to a move to Fulham since the summer and the team has reportedly submitted a bid worth approximately $38 million for the striker. The move for Pepi comes as he is recovering from a broken arm and it may be several months until he is available. Fulham is sitting in 7th with 34 points on the year and a boost in the attack will be needed as they push for European competition.

While Pepi may be heading to Fulham, he might miss the opportunity to play with fellow USA star Antonee Robinson. Jedi is rumored to be on the transfer list for Liverpool as the team may be moving Andy Robertson this window. Liverpool sits at 6th in the current standings and could use help defensively while also getting support from Robinson's attacking ability.

The teams will have until February 2nd to push the deals over the finish line as the Premier League transfer window will push past the end of January due to the 31st falling on a weekend.

For some of the U.S. men's national team's top attacking talents, 2026 hasn't been kind so far.

Three high-profile USMNT players in particular have suffered through injury and uneven performances to kick off the biggest year of their national team careers.

But there were still some silver linings this weekend, from a forward in England continuing to shine to an unlikely player being dubbed ""the perfect striker"" by his coach.

Let's get to the Five.

The new year has not been a happy one for Christian Pulisic so far.

After he was the unquestioned star of AC Milan's attack for the first half of the season, Pulisic is still without a goal or assist in six total games this year.

The American was a non-factor after coming on in the 69th minute of Milan's 1-1 draw at Roma on Sunday, Jan. 25. The Rossoneri were clearly content to keep hold of a point on the road, limiting Pulisic's attacking opportunities.

Part of Pulisic's struggles can be blamed on the lingering effects of a hamstring injury from the fall. Milan coach Max Allegri admitted earlier this month that the 27-year-old was not fully fit. Pulisic has started just three of his side's six games in January, including one match in which he didn't play at all.

Pulisic is still his team's leading scorer this season with 10 goals in all competitions. With Milan now five points back of first-place Inter, Allegri will need Pulisic fully up and running to ensure the Rossoneri stay within striking distance of their city rival.

In what's become a depressingly common story in recent years, Gio Reyna has suffered another injury setback.

Reyna missed Borussia Mönchengladbach's 3-0 defeat to Stuttgart on Sunday due to ""muscular problems,"" the club said.

There was no indication of how serious the injury is, but any spell on the sidelines is a blow for a player who still hasn't justified Gladbach's move to bring him over from Borussia Dortmund in the offseason.

In 14 appearances for Gladbach this season, including five starts, Reyna has yet to tally a goal or assist.

Malik Tillman has hit a midseason skid during his first campaign at Bayer Leverkusen.

Tillman has not scored or assisted a goal since Nov. 22, a drought of 11 games in all competitions.

The 23-year-old has maintained his starting role throughout most of that dry spell, but Tillman started both of Leverkusen's games last week from the bench.

Tillman is still providing value in possession and with his work-rate, but Leverkusen paid a club-record €35 million transfer fee for goal production.

With three goals and no assists all season, Tillman is falling well short of expectations.

Patrick Agyemang continues to thrive with Derby County.

The striker found the net for the second time in three games on Friday, Jan. 23, opening the scoring in a 1-1 draw with West Brom.

Ageymang's goal was of the opportunistic variety, as he took advantage of a mistake from goalkeeper Max O'Leary to bundle home.

The USMNT striker continues to make his case for a World Cup roster spot. He's now scored eight goals in his debut season with Derby, and has even been linked with a move to the Premier League in recent weeks.

Juventus is in the market for a new forward, but head coach Luciano Spalletti seems happy with his unlikely makeshift options for now.

Weston McKennie once again played a vital role for Juve in Sunday's 3-0 win over Napoli. The American played high up the pitch for much of the match, particularly after Jonathan David was removed with 15 minutes left.

With five goals on the season, McKennie is just one shy of his career high. The 27-year-old has scored in three consecutive Champions League matches.

After the Napoli match, Spalletti was full of praise for the versatile USMNT star.

""McKennie is a perfect central striker,"" Spalletti said. ""He fights, he's strong in the air and he can jump high. He plays to get results because he makes decisions. He would be a perfect striker.""","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

FIFA is boosting women's football. The winner of the first edition of the Women's Champions Cup will receive $2.3 million, the largest single payout ever awarded in women's club football to date. The runner-up will earn $1 million.

Each club eliminated in the semifinals will receive $200,000 for its participation, while teams knocked out in the first and second rounds will each earn $100,000.

FIFA Secretary General Mattias Grafström said that “the distribution of nearly $4 million in total among the six participants based on performance is a clear statement of confidence in women's club football and in the players, teams, and competitions that are driving its continued growth.”

“It reflects the growth of women's football worldwide and FIFA's commitment to making targeted, meaningful investments to strengthen women's club football over the long term. Our objective is clear: to continue investing in women's club football and accelerating its growth, ensuring that opportunities, visibility, and value keep pace with the exceptional performances we see on the pitch,” Grafström added.

FIFA also recalled that “the Women's Champions Cup is part of a broader investment and collaboration strategy aimed at strengthening women's club football around the world.”

It highlighted the $11.3 million distributed to 1,041 clubs following the 2023 Women's World Cup, as well as the creation of the Women's Club World Cup, whose first edition is scheduled for 2028.

The final stage of the inaugural edition will be held in London from January 28 to February 1. On the opening day, Gotham FC (United States) will face Corinthians at Brentford's stadium, followed by a match between Arsenal and Morocco's FAR. 

The Arsenal stadium will then host the third-place match and the final, where the first champion will be crowned.

UEFA Champions League winners Arsenal are one of four teams playing this week Alex Davidson/Getty Images

The ever-increasing women's football calendar will see the final stage of a brand-new competition play out, the FIFA Women's Champions Cup, later this week.

Approved by the FIFA Council in March 2025, the inaugural Women's Champions Cup will be completed with four matches taking place on January 28 and February 1, ultimately crowning a winner from the six football confederations across the world.

The competition has, in part, already begun. Two of its participants have already crashed out ahead of the tournament's crescendo.

Here, The Athletic has all you need to know ahead of this week's games.

For the ‘final phase', Champions Cup welcomes its UEFA, Concacaf and Conmebol participants, alongside ASFAR of Morocco and the Confederation of African Football (CAF).

That means Arsenal, Gotham FC, Corinthians and ASFAR will battle it out for the right to boast the honour of winning the first ever edition of the Champions Cup.

With a 1-0 victory against Barcelona in Lisbon in May last year, Arsenal won the UEFA Women's Champions League for just the second time in their history. Stina Blackstenius' second-half goal sealed the historic win, meaning head coach Renee Slegers would lift silverware in her first year in charge of the WSL side, having replaced Jonas Eidevall early in the campaign.

Arsenal's run to the final included two comeback victories in the knockout stages, beating Real Madrid 3-2 on aggregate in the quarter-final, having been 2-0 down after the first leg, before overturning a 2-1 first-leg deficit to beat eight-time champions OL Lyonnes 5-3 on aggregate in the semi-final.

Gotham, meanwhile, were the winners of the inaugural Concacaf Women's Champions Cup, beating Mexican side Tigres 1-0 in a tense final in May, thanks to Esther Gonzalez's 82nd-minute winner. The NWSL side has also qualified for the semi-finals of this year's competition, where it will face Club America in May.

Brazilian side Corinthians booked their Champions Cup spot as Conmebol's representation in the tournament by beating Deportivo Cali 5-3 on penalties after a 0-0 draw in October's Copa Libertadores Femenina final.

The Women's Champions Cup, introduced by FIFA alongside the separate Women's Club World Cup, pits the six continental club champions against one another. Essentially, the winners of each top-tier continental competition organised by their respective governing body from the previous season: the UEFA Champions League, Concacaf Women's Champions Cup, and equivalent for each continent.

The Women's Champions Cup is split into three separate stages: Round 1, Round 2 and the ‘final phase'.

Round 1 was completed back in October, as Wuhan Chegu Jiangda WFC, last season's AFC Champions League winners, defeated Auckland United, last year's OFC Champions League winners, 1-0 at Wuhan Sports Centre Stadium.

Round 2, played on December 14, saw Moroccan club, ASFAR — representing CAF — come from 1-0 down to defeat Wuhan Chegu Jiangda 2-1 and book their spot in the final phase, which comprises two semi-finals, a third-placed match and the final.

It was announced in December that Brentford's 17,250-capacity Gtech Community Stadium will host both semi-finals, taking place on January 28, and Arsenal's 60,700-capacity Emirates Stadium will be the venue for the third-placed match and final, both taking place on February 1.

Jill Ellis, FIFA's chief football officer, said, in a briefing attended by The Athletic, that ticket sales, the climate, infrastructure and broadcasting scope were all factored into the decision to host the inaugural Champions Cup in London, while Arsenal's large fanbase was also considered a useful platform for buy-in to the competition. There will be bidding processes for future editions.

Semi-final 1

Wednesday, January 28: Gotham FC v Corinthians (12.30pm GMT, 7.30am ET) — Gtech Community Stadium

Semi-final 2

Wednesday, January 28: ASFAR vs Arsenal (6pm GMT, 1pm ET) — Gtech Community Stadium

Third-place match

Sunday, February 1: Runner-up of Semi-final 1 v Runner-up of Semi-final 2 (2.45pm GMT, 9.45am ET) — Emirates Stadium

Final

Sunday, February 1: Winner of Semi-final 1 v Winner of Semi-final 2 (6pm GMT, 1pm ET) — Emirates Stadium

FIFA announced on January 15 that Sky Sports had acquired the rights to show the semi-finals, third-placed match and final in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland.

In the United States, DAZN will show both semi-finals on a free-to-air basis, but not the third-placed match nor the final, with FIFA saying in a release that further details for those matches will be released “soon”.

To all worldwide territories outside of the home markets with competing teams in the semi-finals (UK, Brazil, Morocco and the U.S.), DAZN will be broadcasting the four matches for free.

These broadcast deals are only in place for this year's competition.

Sky Sports has said its coverage of the competition will feature Izzy Christiansen, Caroline Barker, Natalie Gedra, Ellen Ellard and Courtney Sweetman-Kirk.

The winners of the inaugural Women's Champions Cup will earn $2.3million (£1.69m; €1.95m).

FIFA, world football's governing body, said on top of the “highest single payout ever awarded in women's football”, the second-placed team will earn $1m and the third- and fourth-placed sides will earn $200,000 for participating in a prize pot totalling $6m.

Meanwhile, Auckland United FC and Wuhan Chegu Jiangda WFC, who were eliminated in the earlier rounds, will receive $100,000 each.

The promised prize money is only $200,000 shy of the $2.5m awarded to the winners of 2025's global seven-a-side tournament that featured clubs such as Manchester United, Manchester City, winners Bayern Munich and San Diego Wave. By contrast, the women's Champions League winners last year won €350,000 ($412,417), though money was also distributed in the group stages.

Ellis said the decision to host the Champions Cup in the January-February window was reached as a result of consultations concerning player load, with FIFPro — the global players' union — and the confederations agreeing it was the best window for the competition to be played.

FIFPro published a study in December finding women's football has become an increasingly two-speed industry, essentially meaning top-end players were at risk with their schedules becoming too extensive, while on the other end of the scale, players were underloaded through lack of competition outside the elite landscape.

Ellis recognised the challenges of adding a mid-season competition and the concerns that would arise from participating clubs, but suggested it offered an opportunity to utilise their squads in a balanced manner and promote those players who may be underloaded.

There was a short runway between FIFA finalising their plans for the Champions Cup in October and the window in which it was able to be played, making for more difficult negotiations with potential broadcasters. FIFA's stance, however, was that reaching audiences in order to boost the profile of the Champions Cup would take priority.

The 2027 and 2029 editions of the Champions Cup will also take place in January, with the competition window to be reviewed by FIFA in 2030. The 2028 Club World Cup will also be played in January.

The introduction of the Women's Champions Cup came alongside the approval of the Women's Club World Cup, which is set to take place between January 5-30, 2028, following a delay to its original inauguration, which was due for 2026. The competition will take place every four years.

The Women's Champions Cup will take place annually, but only in the years which the Women's Club World Cup is not taking place. So, there will be a 2026 Champions Cup, and again in 2027, but the Women's Club World Cup will take centre stage in 2028, before returning to the Champions Cup for the next three years. Hosts for the 2027 Champions Cup and 2028 Club World Cup have yet to be decided.

Sixteen teams will play at the Women's Club World Cup, with participants split between ‘direct' and ‘play-in' entries — compared to just the six teams which contest the Champions Cup, who directly qualify when winning their respective continental competition.

Five UEFA teams will enter the Club World Cup directly, while Conmebol, Concacaf, AFC, and CAF will each have two participants. Oceania is the only federation to receive no direct entries. It, alongside the other continents, will receive one play-in slot.

GOAL continues its Meet the USMNT series by examining McKennie, a player at the center of a growing debate as he approaches a career crossroads.

A debate recently popped up on social media over whether Weston McKennie has already done enough to be considered the U.S. men's national team's best-ever midfielder. It's a discussion with reasonable arguments on both sides, but the very fact that it's happening speaks to just how good McKennie has been - and how much he has already accomplished in his career.

""So far"" is key in that sentence because, at 27 years old, McKennie is just now reaching his prime. He's a key figure for one of the sport's biggest clubs, Juventus, and, with the World Cup on the horizon, he'll likely be a key part of that tournament, too, as the USMNT look to make a run on home soil.

This year promises to be a life-changing one for McKennie, for more reasons than one. His Juventus deal expires this summer, and his future is uncertain. He's set to be one of the faces of the USMNT, and perhaps the group's loudest personality, ahead of a home World Cup. And, if all goes to plan, he might just put a dent in that best-ever debate by the time 2026 is done, particularly if he continues how he's started this calendar year.

Ahead of the World Cup, GOAL is taking a look at the players that will make up the USMNT. Where did they come from? How are they playing? What should we expect from them next summer? Up next: meet Weston McKennie.

Previous Meet the USMNT: Christian Pulisic | Folarin Balogun|Chris Richards

McKennie was born in Fort Lewis, Washington, but that's not the environment that helped make him who he is. There were two of those places: Texas and Germany. 

Largely raised in Little Elm, Texas, McKennie's soccer education, realistically, began during a three-year stay in Germany from age six to nine. His father, John, was an Air Force officer, and it was during that time that McKennie got his first real taste of high-level soccer. 

Once back in the States, McKennie rose through the ranks at FC Dallas and the U.S. youth national team system, where he befriended future senior team teammates Christian Pulisic and Tyler Adams, among others. For a brief time, he committed to play at the University of Virginia. That never happened, though, as McKennie opted to return to Germany to begin his professional career with FC Schalke.

It took less than a year for the teenage McKennie to make it to Schalke's first team as he made his professional debut in May 2017 against Ingolstadt. His real breakthrough really came the next season, when he made 22 appearances in the Bundesliga to cement his place as one of the Bundesliga's top young players to watch. Among those watching? Italian megaclub Juventus, who swooped to sign the midfielder in 2020 after McKennie put together several strong seasons in Germany's top flight.

McKennie has reached new heights at Juventus, playing for one of the world's most famous clubs. At Juve, he's played alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, scored nine Champions League goals, and lifted three trophies, all while emerging as one of the USMNT's most important pieces through the 2022 World Cup cycle and beyond. It was at that 2022 World Cup that McKennie put in some of his best shifts as an international, famously going toe-to-toe with England's midfield in his second-ever World Cup game.

While largely successful, McKennie's run with Juventus has never been easy. Seemingly, every season, a new coach has come in who has wanted to get rid of him. Each time, McKennie has proved that the coach was wrong, firing his way right back into the team, only for the process to repeat again down the line.

Now, midway through this 2025-26 season, McKennie is at another crossroads. His contract with Juve expires after this season, and there are conflicting reports about what comes next. All of this comes with McKennie putting together his best season yet, particularly in the winter months, as the American has been in top, top form.

What comes next for McKennie is anyone's guess, but in the present, the midfielder is playing like one of the best in Serie A.

After the U.S. missed the 2018 World Cup, the program handed the baton to a talented group of youngsters. The task was simple: build towards 2022, even if it means taking some lumps along the way. McKennie was part of that group called into that first Portugal friendly in November 2017. He's been integral ever since.

In total, McKennie has amassed 62 caps during that time, scoring 11 goals along the way. He's won three CONCACAF Nations League titles, a U.S. Soccer Player of the Year award and was named to CONCACAF's Best XI in 2021. At the 2022 World Cup, McKennie was ever-present, too, forming the MMA midfield alongside Adams and Yunus Musah to really set the tone for the U.S. on the world stage.

This second cycle has been a bit more up and down, with McKennie playing just four times in 2025, in particular. However, given his form, it's almost certain we see the 27-year-old midfielder contributing next summer.

As things stand, McKennie is something of a wild card for the World Cup. He's a player that can play a number of different positions; the question, at least from a USMNT perspective, is which one?

Is he an attacking midfielder alongside Pulisic? Can he hold down the fort next to Adams as a deeper-lying midfielder? Could he make a push for that right-wingback spot, particularly given his success as a right midfielder with Juventus in recent months? It's undoubtedly a difficult decision for manager Mauricio Pochettino, but one that likely doesn't have a wrong answer given McKennie's talent and confidence. Wherever he lines up at the World Cup, expect McKennie to be a player capable of making a difference at the highest level.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Deloitte have published the 29th edition of their annual Football Money League, which ranks the world's leading football clubs by revenue, this time covering the 2024/25 season.

The Money League remains a benchmark report of the financial strength of football clubs, though Deloitte themselves have noted that there are many other metrics that can be used to compare clubs, which are not covered by their analysis, such as profitability, player sales and debt.

That may be the case, but it is still an essential resource, not least because it reveals revenue figures (and implied wages) earlier than many of the clubs, who have not yet published their accounts for last season.

The headline is that the Top 20 clubs once again reported record revenue, as this increased by €1.2 bln (11%) from €11.2 bln to €12.4 bln, thus generating more than €12 bln for the first time.

This was driven by new highs in all three revenue streams. This time it was match day that led the charge, rising by €338m (16%) from €2.1 bln to €2.4 bln, while there was also good growth in broadcasting, up €448m (11%) from €4.3 bln to €4.7 bln, and commercial, up €428m (9%) from €4.9 bln to €5.3 bln.

Although the percentage growth was smallest in commercial, this revenue stream had the honour of being the first to break through the €5 bln barrier.

As a result, commercial remained the most important revenue stream with 43%, followed by broadcasting 38% and match day 19%.

In Sterling terms, the growth was lower, as the exchange rate against the Euro strengthened from 1.16 to 1.19, with total revenue rising 8% (£793m) from £9.6 bln to £10.4 bln.

Nevertheless, this was still the first time that revenue had exceeded £10 bln.

Match day revenue increased by 16% (€338m) from €2.1 bln to €2.4 bln, so this was the fastest growing revenue stream for the fourth season in a row. This was comfortably a new record, having grown by a hefty 61% (€906m) more than the pre-pandemic peak of €1.5 bln in 2018/19.

The growth has been driven by a combination of stadium development, increase in capacity, more premium match day offerings and, of course, ticket price increases.

In addition, a couple of clubs have benefited from Personal Seat Licences (PSL), whereby super VIP customers pay for the right to purchase a season ticket for a specific seat annually for many years.

These factors have led to match day accounting for 19% of total revenue, its highest share for ten years.

As a reminder, the vast majority of games were played behind closed doors in 2020/21, while the season before that was also impacted by the pandemic in the last couple of months.

Clubs are trying to generate much more money from their stadia, so many of them are actively looking at stadium development, which is a costly exercise, but can deliver a significant return on investment.

The traditional driver of growth at football clubs, namely broadcast revenue, also saw a significant increase, rising 11% (€448m) from €4.3 bln to €4.7 bln, thus accounting for 38% of total revenue.

This was a new high, overtaking the previous €4.5 bln peak in 2020/21, even though that was inflated by revenue deferred from 2019/20 for games played after the accounting close.

However, it is worth noting that broadcasting has only increased by 16% in the last six years, i.e. before the pandemic struck.","{'href': 'https://swissramble.substack.com', 'title': 'The Swiss Ramble'}","soccer"

Beth Mead speaks after Arsenal's 3-0 win over Oud-Heverlee Leuven in the UEFA Women's Champions League. (0:46)

The inaugural FIFA Women's Champions Cup travels to London on Wednesday as the final four clubs battle for the trophy. Having started back in October, the competition is played between the six best teams from each continental confederation, with this week's final tournament format featuring two semifinals, a third-place playoff and a final.

With diverse playing styles and world-class talent on display, the event promises high-stakes drama with the chance of silverware on the line and the highest-ever single prize-money payout in women's football for the winner. But what do you need to know about it?

Each FIFA confederation held its own version of the UEFA Champions League tournament, many for the first time as they did not have a historical club tournament like UEFA.

On announcing the new competition last year, FIFA president Gianni Infantino said: ""Women's football has reached new heights at national team level and now it's time for global competitions that showcase the best clubs from around the world.""

No, the 16-team Club World Cup is a separate competition. But think of this one as its little sister.

Originally, the Club World Cup was scheduled for 2026, but due to organizational and planning issues, FIFA chose to postpone it until 2028. Not wanting to miss the chance at having three tournaments in consecutive years, with the 2027 World Cup to be held next year in Brazil, FIFA opted to implement the six-team Champions Cup.

The Club World Cup, already engulfed in controversy over its possible hosting in Qatar and scheduling concerns, is set for Jan. 5-30, 2028, which will directly impact at least five Women's Super League (WSL) matchdays, something the league believes could be ""catastrophic.""

The teams competing in London are England's Arsenal (UEFA), NWSL side Gotham FC (CONCACAF), Brazilian team Corinthians (CONMEBOL), and Morocco's ASFAR [Royal Armed Forces Sports Association] (CAF).

New Zealand's Auckland United FC (Oceania) and China's Wuhan Jiangda WFC (AFC) have already been knocked out of the competition, with Wuhan beating Auckland in the first round and then losing to ASFAR in round two. The other three teams progressed straight to the semifinals.

Gotham FC take on Corinthians in the first semifinal at 12:30 p.m. GMT (7:30 p.m. ET) on Wednesday, Jan. 26. Then Arsenal face ASFAR in the second at 6 p.m. GMT (1 p.m. ET).

The winners will play the final on Feb. 1 at 6 p.m. GMT (1 p.m. ET), with the losers in the third-place playoff beforehand at 2:45 p.m. GMT (9:45 a.m. ET).

Having won the UEFA Women's Champions League for a second time -- ending an 18-year wait since their first victory in 2006 -- Arsenal are Europe's representative.

North America will have Gotham FC as they won the 2025 NWSL Championship, which earned them a place in the inaugural CONCACAF Women's Champions Cup -- a 10-team competition split into two groups, a semifinal and final. Gotham came second in their group to progress to the knockouts, then beat Club America 3-1 in the semifinal, before defeating Tigres 1-0 in the final to claim the crown.

Disney+ will be the only place football fans can watch all 75 matches live each season. Visit the Disney+ website to get access.

Africa will be represented by ASFAR, who have won every domestic Moroccan title since 2015 and every Moroccan Throne Cup since 2013. CAF first started the African Women's Champions League in 2021 and ASFAR won it in 2022, then again in 2025, becoming the only team to win it twice in its five-year history.

The CONMEBOL champions are Brazilian side Corinthians, who won the Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Feminino before sealing a third-straight Copa Libertadores in a dramatic penalty shootout against Deportivo Cali.

Meanwhile, Ocenia's Auckland United FC won the third edition of the OFC Champions League, and Chinese side Wuhan Jiangda picked up the inaugural AFC Champions League for Asia.

Originally, the Champions Cup was scheduled for the west coast of the United States. However, as Arsenal are in the middle of a jam-packed season, with crucial WSL title race games either side of the tournament, the nine-hour travel, jet lag and minimal preparation time meant the club were adamant about moving the competition closer to home, sources have told ESPN.

Gotham FC, who run a different calendar to the UK -- they play March-November, while WSL teams play September-May -- are in their offseason but have spent the past month based in Europe, playing a variety of teams to gain momentum, exposure and keep fit.

FIFA agreed to move the tournament to England and Wednesday's semifinals will be played at the GTech Community Stadium, the home of Brentford FC in west London. The finals will be held at Emirates Stadium, Arsenal's home ground, removing the neutral venue advantage for all teams and giving the Champions League holders a huge home advantage.

Auckland United and Wuhan Jiangda were awarded $100,000 for their participation.

The two teams who exit in the semifinals will earn $200,000.

The runner-up will take home $1 million, with the winner earning $2.3 million.

Ali Krieger was full of praise for Gotham FC and their manager Juan Carlos Amorós after their NWSL Championship win over Washington Spirit.

These two are rather unfamiliar opponents to each other but, as a leading powerhouse in one of the most advanced leagues in the world, with a host of top international players like Jaedyn Shaw, Rose Lavelle and Esther González, Gotham are likely to take the win.

However, Corinthians' ethos and pedigree is not to be overlooked. They have some impressive players -- such as captain Tamires, who has over 150 caps for Brazil -- and a true identity that makes them a ruthless team. However, Gotham's dedicated preparation in Europe will make them tough to beat.

Gotham player to watch: Ann-Katrin Berger. Anyone who watched the WSL from 2018-2024 will remember Berger for her iconic saves and world-class performances that helped Chelsea to win five WSL titles. Returning to England, Berger comes off the back of some impressive form for Germany and will be at the center of Gotham's hopes for the inaugural trophy.

Corinthians player to watch: Jhonson. The forward has enjoyed a stellar 2025. She netted the decisive penalty against Deportivo Cali in the Copa Libertadores final to qualify the Timão for this competition and has now worked her way into Brazil's senior setup. The 20-year-old is quickly proving to be a key cog for the South Americans and will enjoy trying to open up the Gotham defense.

Prediction: Gotham 3-0 Corinthians.

As one of the best teams in the world -- with history, innovation and resources at their disposal -- Arsenal are in pole position to reach the final. The Gunners have world-class players, state-of-the-art facilities and home advantage too, so it is all stacked in their favor to secure a victory.

But ASFAR may prove more of a challenge than expected. The Moroccan side demonstrated their resilience with a dramatic comeback in their second-round match against Wuhan to secure a semifinal spot, and that is something Arsenal have struggled with this season.

Arsenal player to watch: Alessia Russo. The crown jewel in the Arsenal attack, Russo is used as both a striker and attacking midfielder to force opponents into mistakes at the back. She holds the ball up and dictates the tempo, and has been one of the club's best players this, and last, season. She is hard to stop once she gets going and ASFAR will need to close her down effectively.

ASFAR player to watch: Anissa Lahmari. The former Paris Saint-Germain star has a wealth of experience across the globe. She has played in France for several clubs, had a loan spell at Reading, and spent a period of time in Spain with Levante before joining ASFAR. She was also part of France's youth setup before switching her allegiance to Morocco in 2023. Lahmari has played against Arsenal before, and her teammates will be picking her brains as to how to frustrate the north London side.

Prediction: Arsenal 4-0 ASFAR","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

January 26 – The inaugural FIFA Women's Champions Cup is potentially reshaping the financial landscape of women's club football, with FIFA is throwing down the gauntlet to UEFA and the other confederations with ambitions to develop their club games by offering the biggest prize money in the women's international club game to date. 

The club that lifts the first-ever FIFA Women's Champions Cup Trophy in 2026 will earn $2.3 million. In comparison Arsenal Women earned about $1.8 million in prize money for winning the UEFA Women's Champions League last season.

The Champions Cup runners-up will receive $1 million, the two semi-finalists will each collect $200,000, while teams eliminated in Round 1 and Round 2 – OFC representatives Auckland United FC of New Zealand and AFC representatives Wuhan Chegu Jiangda WFC of China PR – will receive $100,000 apiece.

“A total payout of close to $4 million distributed among the six participants based on their performance is a clear statement of the belief in women's club football and the players, teams, and competitions driving its continued rise,” said FIFA secretary general Mattias Grafström.

As global interest, broadcast audiences, and commercial investment in the women's game continue to grow, FIFA is seeking to ensure that financial rewards keep pace. Increased prize money is designed to strengthen club balance sheets, support player development and encourage long-term investment at domestic and continental levels.

Even so, the prize money for the winner of the women's competition doesn't come close to the $100 million+ FIFA paid out to Chelsea for its summer 2025 Club World Cup win for what was effectively a pre-season tournament. It is also short of the $5 million paid to PSG for their one-match 2025 FIFA Intercontinental Cup win against Flamengo last December.

On the women's prize money, Grafström said “it reflects the global growth of the women's game and FIFA's commitment to making targeted, meaningful investments that strengthen women's club football for the long term.

“Our focus is clear: to continue investing in, growing and elevating women's club football at every level – ensuring that opportunity, visibility and value keep pace with the exceptional performances seen on the pitch.”

That approach will be further expanded through reforms to the Women's International Match Calendar and the introduction of new elite competitions, including the FIFA Women's Club World Cup, scheduled to debut in 2028, which aims to rival, if not better, the UEFA's Women's Champions League, long considered the ultimate crown in women's club soccer.

Ex-Fifa boss shows support for boycott calls

Security concerns over tournament have risen

Former Fifa president Sepp Blatter on Monday suggested he supports fans boycotting World Cup matches in the United States this year due to security concerns.

Blatter gave his support to comments from Swiss anti-corruption lawyer Mark Pieth, who worked with Fifa on potential reforms when Blatter was president, saying fans should stay away from the US for the tournament.

“I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup,” Blatter said on social media.

Pieth cited the killing of protester Renee Good by an American immigration agent in Minneapolis earlier this month as one reason for supporters not to travel to the US. Blatter's endorsement of Pieth's comments comes in the wake of the death of a second US citizen, Alex Pretti, last weekend.

The World Cup is due to be hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico from 11 June to 19 July.

“What we are seeing domestically – the marginalisation of political opponents, abuses by immigration services, et. – hardly encourages fans to go there,” Pieth said in an interview with Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger last week.

“For fans, just one piece of advice: avoid the United States! You'll get a better view on television anyway. Upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don't behave properly with the authorities, they will be immediately sent home. If they're lucky …”

Blatter stepped down as Fifa president in 2015 amid several scandals and was replaced by Gianni Infantino, who has forged close ties with Donald Trump.

Blatter and former Uefa chief Michel Platini were last year acquitted definitively on charges stemming from a delayed payment of 2m Swiss francs ($2.5m) Fifa made to Platini in 2011 for consultancy services.

Former France star Platini said earlier this month that Infantino has “become more of an autocrat” and “he likes the rich and powerful”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

The FIFA World Cup 2026 is set to be a monumental event, with 104 matches, including 72 in the group Stage and 32 in the knockouts, spanning 16 host cities across Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

As fans look ahead to the opening match on June 11, 2026, at Mexico City's Estadio Azteca and the final on July 19, 2026, at the New York New Jersey Stadium, the regional hospitality industry is already seeing huge shifts in room pricing.

While the matches are distributed across the continent, certain cities are taking a larger share of the action. Dallas (Arlington) leads with 9 matches, followed closely by Atlanta, Los Angeles, and New York/New Jersey with 8 matches each.

Understanding how hotel prices are evolving across these diverse host sites is essential for maximizing revenue, having now moved from the pre-draw phase, closer to the start of the tournament.

Across host cities, revenue managers are shifting from typical pricing patterns toward more aggressive strategies that capitalize on the official tournament draw and the resulting supply-demand compression.

As fans around the globe mark their calendars for the FIFA World Cup 2026, the hospitality market is already reacting to the anticipated surge in demand.

A key inflection point for hotel pricing was the official tournament draw, which dictates where teams will be playing, and which fans will be supporting.

By analyzing hotel price data across host cities during both the pre-draw and post-draw periods, we can uncover how markets adjust when supporters know where their team will be in the group stages and where they may end up in the knockout round if their team advances.

The shift from the pre-draw period to the post-draw period for the group stage revealed a market in flux, characterized by widespread price hikes and extreme variations per city.

Across all host destinations, there was a clear upward trend in costs as the tournament logistics became concrete.

While the aggregate market lift across all destinations was 13.74%, the mean percentage increase per city was higher at 14.75%, driven by more dramatic spikes in some cities.

The top five markets for room price increases from pre-draw to post-draw for the group stage are centered in Mexico and the South of the USA, all moving well above the 14.75% average:

On the flip side, the least volatile market was Philadelphia experiencing only a 3.25% increase.

While percentage increases tell one story, the absolute price points reveal a staggering gap between the most and least expensive cities.

In both periods, the costliest destination was more than six times the price of the most affordable one.

Vancouver solidified its spot as the most expensive host city for the group stage, with average rates rising from $1,106.38 (pre-draw) to $1,228.62 (post-draw).

Houston remained the most affordable option throughout, with prices moving from $179.68 to $225.20.

On average, the price for a stay across all destinations rose from $438.30 to $498.54, a jump of $60.24 or 13.74%.

As the tournament progresses into the knockout stages, the pricing behavior shifts once more.

While the group stages saw broad volatility, the knockout rounds show a more concentrated surge in specific markets while others maintain surprising stability. While every destination saw some level of increase, the range of volatility was even more pronounced here than in the group stages.

Conversely, some cities remained remarkably consistent and saw the smallest percentage changes, suggesting that their high baseline prices were already baked in early on:

Interestingly, the hierarchy of room prices remained largely unchanged between the two periods for the knockout stage, perhaps reflecting the fact that supporters do not yet know for sure where their team will be. The cities that were expensive before the draw stayed expensive after.

Post-draw (as of 12/1/26) these three maintained their exact ranking:

Ultimately, the average advertised price increase across all host destinations for the knockout period, comparing late 2025 to early 2026, stands at 10.56%.

Whether you are hosting early group stage fixtures or a later stage game, the data suggests there is now significant room price movement following the draw and you should analyse the predictive data from your market and get a strategy in place if you haven't already.

By tracking room price evolution from 350 days out to both group and knockout stages, we can see how initial baseline rates have been aggressively adjusted to reflect the true supply-demand compression of both the group and knockout stages.

Tracking the group stage price evolution from 350 days out to 147 days out shows a dramatic shift in the hierarchy of the cost of rooms per city.

While some cities remained stable, others experienced triple-digit percentage growth as the event moved from a distant date to a reality.

The most striking finding in this period is the sheer magnitude of price jumps in specific markets.

The timing of these price peaks tells you lot about varying market confidence.

As we move closer to the event, the most expensive room price leaderboard has been reshuffled.

Most expensive to least expensive host cities when the event was approximately 350 days away:

Most expensive to least expensive host cities when the event was approximately 147 days away:

Guadalajara experienced one of the biggest leaps, moving from 14th most expensive to 6th most expensive, climbing 8 positions.

New York, which was the most expensive city at lead time 350, dropped to 5th most expensive at lead time 147, while Vancouver jumped from 3rd most expensive to most expensive.

The room price evolution for the knockout rounds, tracked from 350 days down to 164 days before the knockout stage begins, highlights markets that have become increasingly polarized between high-cost stability and low-cost volatility.

While the average price increase across all 16 cities was approximately 79.9%, there was explosive price growth in Mexican cities and Kansas:

Conversely, the US East and West Coasts remained the most stable and saw the lowest levels rise during this period:

By looking at average prices and standard deviation, we can categorize some of the host cities into four risk/value quadrants which demonstrate the power and variation of local market dynamics when a big event is in town:

Most expensive to least expensive host cities when the event was approximately 350 days away:

Most expensive to least expensive host cities when the event was approximately 164 days away:

The pricing hierarchy for the knockout stages underwent a significant recalibration over the 186-day observation window, as more localized market dynamics, and the lack or influx of knockout games for each city came into play:

This realignment of rankings is closely tied to the specific lead-time windows where demand begins to saturate available inventory.

Currently, the data indicates that most destinations hit their peak pricing within a narrow window between 164 and 173 days, roughly 5.5 to 6 months before the event.

While general price trends give us a macro view of the market, the real ‘event tax' is best seen when comparing match days to non-match days.

This granular analysis reveals exactly how much more fans are paying to be in the city on the night of a match versus the surrounding dates.

Across the board, the data confirms, unsurprisingly, that game days are universally more expensive.

In every host city, match nights consistently command a premium over non-match dates. The aggregate data shows a city-wide average of $523.59 on game days compared to the non-match day average of $398.36, representing a typical event-day premium of $125.23.

On average, hotel prices across all 16 host cities jump by 31.44% when a game is in town. However, as expected the intensity of this spike varies dramatically by region.

The most significant price differentials are found in Canada and Mexico. These regions are seeing the highest demand-driven premiums, suggesting that inventory is tighter or the perceived prestige of the match days is being more aggressively monetized by revenue managers.

When we look purely at the percentage increase, the disparity between a standard night and a match night becomes even more apparent:

Interestingly, several US cities, particularly in the South, show a remarkably small difference between game Day and non-game day averages.

Commentary from Lighthouse Commercial Strategist Daniel Foreman, with 10 years revenue management experience.

As you will know, the dramatic hotel price shifts observed for the FIFA World Cup 2026 are not merely products of organic demand.

They are the result of deliberate and sophisticated revenue management strategies that encompass pick-up and pace, demand prediction, dynamic pricing, and inventory control.

Here we take a look at some of the potential tactics being used by revenue managers in host cities.

Our analysis shows a concentrated pricing peak roughly 5.5 to 6 months out. So far, this appears to be the strategic sweet spot for hoteliers

In markets like Vancouver, New York and Boston, high initial rates act as a filter to ensure they don't fill rooms with low-yield leisure bookings (early-bird fans looking for deals) and standard corporate travelers (regular accounts using negotiated fixed rates) before high-value corporate and sponsorship segments enter the market for the event.

The explosive room price growth in Guadalajara (385%) and Monterrey (203.59%) between lead time 350 and 147 for the group stages likely indicates that the initial underpricing was corrected as the booking pace may have triggered automatic rate increases.

This is a classic catch-up strategy once the market's willingness to pay is validated by the draw.

The 10.56% average room price increase for knockout rounds confirms that revenue managers are currently prioritizing rate growth over pure occupancy for the group stages, assuming there will be plenty of demand to sell out.

By maintaining high price floors, revenue managers are banking on a tournament funnel effect. As the field narrows, the scarcity of rooms in the remaining host cities will eventually drive occupancy to near 100% – even at premium price points.

During a mega-event, the traditional business mix is inverted. Revenue managers must navigate a segment swap where standard corporate demand disappears and is replaced by high-yield, event-specific business.

It is a historical certainty that regular meetings and conferences will avoid host cities during event dates to escape high prices. Revenue managers are raising transient rates for fans to offset the loss of this reliable base demand.

Regular corporate travel is replaced by sponsorship, media, and FIFA-affiliated groups. These are the high-value segments that hoteliers are holding inventory for.

Displacement analysis will be used to decide whether to bank a ‘bird in the hand', such as a 50-room media block for 14 nights at $300, or hold out for individual transient fans willing to pay $500+ for a much shorter stay closer to kick off.

In more supply-constrained markets like Monterrey, the data suggests hoteliers are carefully balancing these blocks to ensure the highest Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) across the entire tournament window.

The minimal price volatility in some US markets, like Atlanta's 1.73% match-day premium and New York's relatively small 12.70% price increase for knockout rounds suggests that revenue managers there are likely using inventory fencing rather than just pure price hikes.

Instead of a massive price spike for a single night, many hotels will implement a 2-to-4-night length-of-stay (LOS) restriction. This protects the shoulder nights (the days before and after a match) from cratering in occupancy once the fans leave.

During high-compression windows, savvy hoteliers also often close off discounted channels (Expedia, Priceline, etc.) to drive traffic to their high-margin direct channel.

Vancouver consistently outranks even New York as the most expensive city in this tournament, but why you may be asking yourself?

Along with the world's biggest sporting event, there is a perfect strom of local dynamics at play in Vancouver which can be broken down into four distinct areas.

While Vancouver's population and tourism have exploded, the hotel bed stock has actually decreased over the last two decades.

Between 2002 and 2022, Vancouver saw a net loss of hotel rooms. Approximately 550 rooms were lost during the pandemic alone as the city and province purchased hotels (like the Days Inn and Howard Johnson) to convert them into supportive housing.

High land costs and best-use zoning laws historically favored residential condos over hotels because they offered quicker returns for developers.

Destination Vancouver reports the city needs 10,000 new rooms by 2050 just to keep up with demand. While 4,200 rooms are in the pipeline, very few are opening in time for the 2026 peak season.

Bill 35 (Short-Term Rental Accommodations Act), took full effect in May 2024. The crux of this bill focused on a principal residence requirement, in which most secondary suites and investment Airbnbs are now illegal in B.C.

This removed thousands of units from the market. A 2025 Deloitte report commissioned by Airbnb suggested that these restrictions contributed to hotel price spikes of up to 20% in the first year of enforcement as travelers were forced back into a limited hotel pool.

The summer in Vancouver brings warm, dry weather, attracting tourists for outdoor pursuits like hiking, kayaking, and whale watching. Combine this with Vancouver's high cost of living and you get relatively high hotel prices.

Vancouver's inventory is further constrained in summer by cruise ship arrivals. This is a massive demand multiplier and puts pressure on hotels in the city, with city wide occupancy sometimes hitting 95%.

In 2025, Vancouver saw approximately 1.2 million cruise passengers. Most of these passengers require a hotel for at least one night before or after their Alaska cruise.

When a ship with 4,000 passengers docks, it can effectively wipe out 15-20% of downtown's available hotel inventory in a single day.

In late 2024 and throughout 2025, workers at major hotels (Hyatt Regency, Westin Bayshore, Pinnacle) represented by UNITE HERE Local 40 secured wage increases of roughly 34% over the life of the contract.

Housekeepers in Vancouver now earn among the highest hospitality wages in Canada (heading toward $37–$40/hour by 2027/28).

These increased operating costs are almost immediately pushed to the consumer via room prices.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup will bring extraordinary demand to North America, but as the data clearly shows, every destination is different.

From the explosive price growth in Mexican markets like Monterrey and Guadalajara to the supply-constrained highs of Vancouver and the relative stability of coastal US cities, the impact on North American markets is far from uniform. Just because your market reacted to a certain way to an event in the past doesn't mean the same pattern will repeat this time around.

The extreme demand windows created by big events do not exist in a vacuum. They are in fact highly contextual, with the game schedule also dictated by local supply-demand dynamics.

A one-size-fits-all commercial strategy for events leaves money on the table. To keep you finger on the market pulse you need predictive intelligence.

After German politician Jürgen Hardt raised the possibility of Germany boycotting the World Cup, Oke Göttlich, a vice president of the German Football Association, publicly expressed his support for the idea. Against the backdrop of growing tensions between the United States and Europe — discernible during the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in Davos — both figures argue that a boycott could be justified by concerns over European autonomy and the threat posed by the United States.

Göttlich questioned the consistency of Germany's stance on politics in football. “The 2022 World Cup in Qatar was too political for everyone, and now we're completely apolitical? That really, really bothers me,” he said in an interview with the Hamburger Morgenpost. His remarks suggest frustration with what he sees as selective outrage and double standards in how political issues are addressed in international sport.

A German boycott would have a major impact on the tournament. Germany is a four-time World Cup champion, most recently winning in Brazil in 2014, and its absence would significantly diminish the competition's prestige. Despite the attention such a move would generate, it would likely face resistance both within Germany and across Europe.

France, in particular, has firmly rejected the idea of a boycott. Marina Ferrari, France's sports minister, emphasized the importance of keeping sport separate from politics.

“As it stands now, there is no desire from the ministry for a boycott of this great competition. I am one who believes in keeping sport separate from politics. The World Cup is an extremely important moment for those who love sport,” she said.

Whether Germany, or any other nation, ultimately decides to boycott remains uncertain, especially given recent U.S. policy positions and international reactions to them. It is also important to note that resistance does not come only from governments. Ahead of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, German players protested working and human rights conditions surrounding the tournament's preparation, though the national federation ultimately ruled out a boycott. 

The current debate surrounding a potential German boycott is not unprecedented. Throughout World Cup history, nations have repeatedly used absence to challenge FIFA's political decisions.

After winning the first World Cup in 1930, Uruguay boycotted the 1934 tournament in Italy to protest European nations that had refused to travel to South America in 1930. Their absence made them the only defending champions ever to not defend their title.

The 1938 World Cup, held just over a year before the outbreak of World War II, saw several nations pull out as political tensions escalated. Austria withdrew after being annexed by Nazi Germany in March 1938, which dissolved the Austrian state and its national team. Spain did not enter due to its civil war, while Japan withdrew as a result of its ongoing invasion of China. Argentina and Uruguay also withdrew, believing that the cup should have been hosted in South America.

India qualified for the 1950 World Cup but withdrew due to disagreements over team selection, a lack of preparation and prioritization of the Olympics. The famous ‘barefoot ban' story, which claimed India was denied participation because players competed barefoot, is overstated. Administrative reasons were far more decisive.

All African nations boycotted the 1966 World Cup qualifiers after FIFA allocated Africa no guaranteed finals spot. The protest succeeded, and FIFA later awarded Africa and Asia automatic places, reshaping global representation.

The Soviet Union refused to play a qualifier in Chile's Estadio Nacional, which had been used as a prison camp after Pinochet's coup. FIFA awarded Chile a forfeit win despite the concerns over human rights abuses.

Hopefully, this World Cup avoids boycotts and instead reflects an improvement in diplomatic relations between the United States and European nations.","{'href': 'https://www.tuftsdaily.com', 'title': 'The Tufts Daily'}","soccer"

England's Three Lions Pride and Queer Football Fanclubs, a German LGBTQ soccer fans network, are snubbing the World Cup – but France's group will go.

European soccer fans who are LGBTQ are being advised not to travel to the United States for the FIFA World Cup, amid growing concerns over safety.

After Three Lions Pride (3LP), the England national team's official group for LGBTQ supporters, said it would not attend the tournament this summer, Queer Football Fanclubs (QFF) says it is also advising its members not to travel due to “serious concerns” over the treatment of minorities.

QFF, a network of LGBTQ fan groups of which the majority are based in Germany, says it supports the decision taken by 3LP, which has around 350 members, many of whom follow England home and away.

Jill Ellis won the Women's World Cup twice as a coach. Now FIFA's Chief Football Officer, she defends Qatar as a possible host.

Outsports has also received statements backing 3LP from Pride House International, which is co-ordinating the Pride House United 2026 project of LGBTQ-inclusive spaces at the World Cup in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, and Independent Supporters Council North America, a network of fan groups with more than 140 members.

The organizations Football Supporters Europe and the Sport & Rights Alliance both say they stand in “solidarity” with 3LP, while soccer's anti-discrimination network Fare says it is “sad and regrettable that the most high-profile national team LGBTQ supporters group in the world feel the situation is so difficult that they are unable to travel and have declared a boycott.”

The England fans group said its trans members would be “at high risk of violence and discrimination” in the U.S., adding: “Our butch lesbian family would be caught in the crosshairs of anti-trans legislation around bathrooms, and our queer family generally would be a target for abuse.”

Even Jill Ellis, FIFA's Chief Football Officer, has recently highlighted the increase in anti-LGBTQ bills across the U.S., admitting: “There's a big light being shone on that.”

3LP says there are broader human rights issues, such as the threat of visa rejections relating to social media posts, the potential for detention and removal, and reports of “overzealous policing and law enforcement” on the ground. 

QFF spokesperson Sven Kistner says his network “fully understand and support 3LP's decision” to forgo the tournament. 

“We, too, have serious concerns regarding the safety not only of LGBTQ individuals traveling to the USA, but of all travelers to the 2026 World Cup.

“The ever-worsening conditions for minorities in the USA under this administration leave us with practically no other conclusion than to advise our members against traveling.”

There are also groups from Switzerland and the Netherlands in the QFF network. Seven of the nine group-stage matches involving the German, Swiss and Dutch national teams will be staged in U.S. cities.

At the weekend, a member of the executive committee of the German Football Association (DFB) said it was time to consider a boycott of the World Cup.

Oke Göttlich is a DFB vice-president and also the president of Bundesliga club St. Pauli, long known to be among the most LGBTQ-inclusive of all professional men's soccer teams. He told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper that people in football were forgetting how to “defend values” as tensions rise between America and Europe.

“What were the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s?” Göttlich told . “By my reckoning, the potential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.”

3LP and QFF have also both taken aim at FIFA over exorbitant ticket prices for the World Cup. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, FIFA President Gianni Infantino admitted the resale market is likely to push prices even higher.

The two LGBTQ groups have close ties to Football Supporters Europe, which represents soccer fans across the continent.

Spokesperson Martin Endemann said: “We know that many individual LGBTQ fans have strong concerns about attending this year's tournament and are thinking whether to go or not.

“The recent political developments, as well as the backlash against LGBTQ and especially trans rights in some of the states of the U.S., took away all the anticipation which had been there after two more than challenging World Cups in Russia and Qatar, respectively.

“This tournament needs to be safe for all travelling fans who decide to go, and in this end, we will continue working with other stakeholders and governing bodies to express these concerns.”

For this World Cup, there will be 16 host cities in total, with 11 in the U.S. In all these venues, Pride House United 2026 is planning to establish welcoming spaces for LGBTQ visitors and allies from around the world, to watch games and find community.

Pride House International trustee Keph Senett is helping to oversee the project and says the tournament will be “diminished” by 3LP's absence.

“We completely understand the group's decision to boycott the event,” she told Outsports.

Senett says PHI is “deeply concerned for attendees, particularly LGBTQ and Black and brown people, both already in the United States and as travellers to the country” due to “increasing violence and chaotic policies” which could affect the project's partners in certain locations.

She added: “We're also concerned about the message these circumstances are sending to the international soccer community. This game does not belong to FIFA and its partners. It belongs to groups like 3LP, each of the proud communities in our Pride House host cities, and everyone who loves the game.”

A spokesperson for the Independent Supporters Council North America said: “As friends of Three Lions Pride, we support them and the decision they're making as an organization.”

Fare is an independent human rights body that monitors soccer matches through the deployment of trained anti-discrimination observers.

Asked about its 2026 World Cup plans, executive director Piara Powar said: “We will be working hard to make sure that the situation inside stadiums is as safe and LGBTQ friendly as possible. We are monitoring the situation every day. 

“We should acknowledge that many U.S. states have been at the forefront of embedding legal rights for LGBTQ people.

“But given the political situation in the U.S., we also understand the need for minority groups to protect themselves and be clear about their approaches to the World Cup.”

Andrea Florence, the Sport and Rights Alliance's executive director, said: “It's heartbreaking to see the hopes of LGBTQ supporters to finally have a safe, positive World Cup dashed in light of the escalating situation in the U.S.

“As we have warned for months now, FIFA must match its rhetoric with action and secure binding guarantees to ensure that ‘everyone is welcome' is a lived reality — or the World Cup will never truly be a tournament for all.”

One official LGBTQ fans group for a national soccer team that is still planning to travel to the U.S. is Bleus et Fiers (Blue and Proud), which follows France, who won the 2018 World Cup and were runners-up at Qatar 2022. They will play Group I fixtures in New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia and Boston.

Asked about 3LP's statement, spokesperson Jean-Baptiste Montarnier told Outsports: “I'm disappointed but understand their decision not to attend the World Cup.

“The French Football Federation (FFF) is allowing us to go to the World Cup with tickets at $60 each. I obtained approximately six tickets per match for the French national team, and about 30 people from our association will be going to the U.S.

“As with all previous World Cups, we wanted to be present and make our voices heard.”

The $60 tickets are the cheapest on offer for group-stage matches. Following the criticism of high prices, FIFA announced in December that it was making a small allocation available at this lower bracket for national associations of countries that have qualified to distribute to loyal supporters.

Pep Guardiola has taken a bizarre dig at his own Manchester City players while quoting his “idol”, Johan Cruyff. The demanding Catalan coach worked under the iconic Dutchman during his playing days at Barcelona. Many of the lessons he took back then have been implemented into his own coaching career. Guardiola is now renowned for demanding nothing but the best, and absolute commitment, from all of those working alongside him.

The 55-year-old has never been the type of character to look for excuses, with his remarkable CV built on hard work and determination. Those traits are expected to be adopted by anyone that forms part of his playing and coaching staff.

Guardiola wants to see everyone give their all for the good of the collective cause, with it imperative that they pull in the same direction. When it comes to injuries, that means playing through the odd knock and ignoring any bumps and bruises.

City's highly-decorated manager is not convinced that everybody at the Etihad Stadium is towing that line this season, with fitness problems providing plenty of unfortunate headaches in the 2025-26 campaign.

Guardiola told reporters after seeing the Blues beat Premier League basement dwellers Wolves 2-0, with Erling Haaland being rested from the start in that contest: “We have incredible doctors, incredible physios, [working] 24 hours [a day]. I believe Johan Cruyff - my mentor, my idol, my everything. When he said to me ‘when a player doesn't [want to] be injured, they will not be injured'.

“There are situations [where they are] unlucky, but when you are incredible [in shape] and you don't want to be injured, you will not be injured. Unfortunately we have a lot, that is the problem that we have right now.”

Josko Gvardiol, Mateo Kovacic, John Stones, Ruben Dias, Nico Gonzalez and Savinho are among those currently nursing knocks at the Etihad. They will play no part in a Champions League clash with Galatasaray on Wednesday.

Guardiola said when delivering a selection update ahead of that contest, with a couple of January signings also set to be ineligible against Turkish opposition: “We need our fans, we need them. I know Marc (Guehi) cannot play, Antoine (Semenyo) cannot play, Rodri cannot play, apart from all the players that we have sidelined. Nico Gonzalez will not be ready and Savinho will not be ready and John Stones will not be ready.”

One player that does epitomise the spirit that Guardiola wants to see is Portuguese playmaker Bernardo Silva. He is seeing his contact run down towards free agency, but a summer departure is not guaranteed.

Guardiola said of still having the classy 31-year-old - who is City's club captain - at his disposal: “I would love for Man City, for myself as well, if Bernardo could to stay forever. But we spoke a lot with Bernie and Bernie has to decide the best for him and for his family.

“Whatever happens, this season, next season, in 10 years, he will remain one of the greatest players that this club has had in its long history.

“He will be undroppable. Undroppable. I cannot. When I decide to play Bernardo in the team, I go to bed and I sleep better. I have to take care of my health, you know? He's a competitor. He has fire in his eyes still. Hopefully he can contaminate and can inoculate this fire to the rest of the group. 

“How he defends every single ball, how he reads what he has to do. And you know, the guy who creates excuses forgets his mistakes. And he never finds excuses. Never. And that's why he's a special, special player.”

There haven't been many periods of great optimism at Manchester United in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, but for a brief moment at the start of 2019, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made supporters believe again. He delivered eight successive wins after replacing Jose Mourinho as interim manager, including a stunning 3-1 victory at Arsenal in the FA Cup fourth round, bringing back the scintillating counter-attacking style Ferguson championed throughout his glorious 26-year reign.

Solskjaer eventually earned the permanent role, and remained at the helm for almost three years, guiding United to a runners-up finish in 2020-21 and a Europa League final. But the beloved former striker lost control in the end, and left Old Trafford without adding another piece of silverware to his glittering career CV.

The consensus now is that United must avoid making the same mistake with Michael Carrick, who was installed as interim boss after Ruben Amorim's sacking at the start of the month. ""I think if United win every game from now until the end of the season, I still wouldn't be giving him the job,"" Roy Keane said on Sky Sports this weekend. ""I just think they need a bigger, more experienced manager, it's as simple as that.""

Gary Neville added: ""I think it's right that Carrick keeps the job until the end of the season and then hands the baton over to a [Thomas] Tuchel or a [Carlo] Ancelotti, someone of that world-class ilk."" However, not every United legend sees it the same way.

Keane and Neville were trying to temper expectations after watching Carrick's Red Devils beat Arsenal 3-2 at the Emirates on Sunday, one week after their statement derby win over Manchester City, but Wayne Rooney couldn't help but be swept up in the euphoria. ""Of course, he can [be the right man for the job if he continues like this],"" he said to BBC Match of the Day. ""He's got the opportunity to show everyone, and the club, that he's capable of doing the job. And if he carries on like this, there'll be massive pressure on the United board to put him in at the end of the season. I know they've been there with Ole before, but I think this feels a little bit different.""

Rooney's conclusion rings true. United have handily beaten the two best teams in the league after being unshackled by Carrick, and destiny is in his own hands. The INEOS ownership regime will certainly find itself backed into a corner if Carrick now oversees a late tilt at the title, which, crazy as it might sound, is a genuine possibility in a season that has already been so wildly unpredictable.

Indeed, chants of ""we're gonna win the league"" rang out in the visitors' stand after United's triumph in north London, which was their first away to the Gunners in the Premier League since 2017. It was also Arsenal's first home defeat since May 2024, and the first time they have conceded more than two goals in a league game since December 2023.

The significance of the final result, then, should not be downplayed. A major mentality shift has taken place in the United dressing room. They found themselves 1-0 down when Lisandro Martinez inadvertently put through his own net after Arsenal had dominated for a good half hour, and probably would have buckled from there had Amorim still been on the touchline.

But Carrick did not allow his players' heads to drop. United responded brilliantly, harrying the Gunners into uncharacteristic mistakes at the back - one of which was punished before the interval, as Bryan Mbeumo pounced on a misplaced Martin Zubimendi pass, calmly rounded David Raya, and side-footed the ball into the net. 

Five minutes into the second half, they were in front, with Patrick Dorgu doing his best impression of Tony Yeboah when cracking a brilliant volley in off the crossbar. United continued to look dangerous on the break thereafter, but also seemed to relish every tackle and interception as they defended in numbers to frustrate Arsenal.

Even after the hosts found a scrappy equaliser through Mikel Merino in the 84th minute, Carrick urged his team to push for another goal. The Red Devils were fearless, and Matheus Cunha's remarkable late winner was no less than they deserved. To beat Raya from 30 yards is no mean feat, and Cunha's curling shot was truly unstoppable, reflecting the new confidence surging through the United squad.

This was not the same all-conquering display as United put on in the derby, where they managed seven shots on target and restricted City to zero, while also seeing three goals ruled out. City were fortunate the final scoreline was only 2-0 at Old Trafford and not five or six.

Carrick was well aware that facing Arsenal at the Emirates would be a greater test of his side's resolve, but they passed with flying colours. ""It was a tough game for us today. I think we knew that coming into it. It was never going to be the perfect kind of game for us,"" he admitted. ""We've been together less than two weeks so we knew coming here we were going to have to draw on many different things to get a performance and a result. It was up and down at times, there's some really good things in the game for us, things we can work on, but the way the boys were, their belief, the confidence and the spirit, everything that came together made me really proud today.""

No one embodied that spirit more than Cunha, who was decisive off the bench for the second week running. Carrick made the bold decision to stick with Dorgu on the left wing, which could easily have gone down like a lead balloon, but Cunha was once again chomping at the bit.

""When Matheus came on, I just fancied him to score, to make an impact. Fantastic finish,"" said Carrick. ""He epitomises what, as a group, we've been like this week. He has not started both games, but he's had a real big impact. He's been disappointed not to start, but he's used that in a really good way.""

Carrick also opted to stick with Mbeumo upfront over Benjamin Sesko, despite the latter's potential to upset Arsenal from a physical standpoint, and it paid off. Mbeumo stretched and unsettled the Gunners' backline with his pace and awareness. It bodes well that Carrick already has a strong sense of how United can cause maximum damage, and has everyone pulling in the same direction, regardless of whether or not they are selected to start.

Carrick has also sparked an instant improvement in several players, most notably Dorgu. For so long, the former Lecce man looked like a dud signing, having been snapped up for £25 million ($34m) by Amorim last January, managing only one goal in his first 30 appearances.

But the Dane has scored twice in as many games since Carrick's arrival, finally proving his worth after being shifted from wing-back to the left of the attack. ""Pat's been a big player for us over the last couple of games attacking-wise - he's scored two goals, but in terms of his threat and athleticism and his quality coming in as well,"" Carrick said after the Arsenal game. ""He ended up coming off with a little bit of cramp, hopefully it's nothing worse. At this stage it's hard to tell, so we'll just have to wait and see, but we're hoping it's not too bad.""

The fact that there is so much concern around Dorgu's fitness underlines how far he's come in such a short space of time. Meanwhile, academy jewel Kobbie Mainoo - unforgivably ostracised by Amorim - also impressed on his second successive start alongside the 33-year-old Casemiro, who has rolled back the years to become a lynchpin for United, Harry Maguire has been colossal at the back, Amad Diallo is exerting more influence higher up the pitch and Bruno Fernandes is again serving as creator-in-chief after being restored to his favoured No.10 berth.

Carrick has not done anything particularly ground-breaking. He has just gone for a 4-3-2-1 that suits United far better than Amorim's perplexing 3-4-3 and put the players in their strongest positions. Now they attack with proper width and verve, and defend in a compact shape; a simple but effective formula for success.

For most supporters, the enduring memory of Amorim will be him fiddling with a magnetic tactics board like a mad scientist during the shocking Carabao Cup loss to Grimsby back in August. The Portuguese overcomplicated everything, and obviously didn't understand the much-debated United 'DNA'. Carrick does, though, and that's why he's commanded instant respect.

Carrick is also a far more composed and hands-on coach than Amorim. His predecessor was honest to a fault, prone to emotional outbursts in front of the media that distracted from the team's efforts on the pitch. 

According to the Manchester Evening News, Amorim sometimes preferred to observe in training sessions, but Carrick is always involved. He has also made sessions shorter and more intense, with a greater focus on individual work, and the players have responded positively.

""Carrick's been brilliant with us, he's brought a fresh energy in, the group's really galvanised,"" Maguire said to Sky Sports on Sunday. The former United midfielder had a similar effect in his unbeaten three-game stint in the dugout between November and December in 2021, leaving a lasting impression on Fernandes in particular. ""He knows how to speak, he knows a lot of football,"" the former Sporting CP playmaker said at the time. ""He was one of the great players that not a lot of people talk about. From what I have seen, he can be a top coach.""

In the last five years, Carrick has not done quite enough to make good on Fernandes' prediction, despite a largely encouraging spell at Middlesbrough, but he could be put into the ""top coach"" bracket if United's resurgence lasts through to May. This doesn't have to be Groundhog Day; Carrick appears better equipped to handle the pressures of perhaps the hottest seat in world football than Solskjaer was, and a flawless finish to the campaign would provide Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEO with incontrovertible evidence of his credentials.

Rooney visited Carrington last week to get a feel for the atmosphere Carrick and his staff have been building before United's ""absolutely incredible performance"" against the Gunners. ""There's a calmness about the place,"" the Red Devils' record goalscorer said on the latest episode of the Wayne Rooney Show. ""You've got all the coaching staff all there watching the under-18s play. And then again, on a Saturday morning, they're all there watching the under-16s play after the training session.

""These are all things which used to happen in the past and it makes a big difference. In my eyes, they have taken a step towards getting the club back a little bit closer to where they used to be when the club was successful. What I saw, not just from Michael, but the other coaches, Johnny Evans as well, is a real calmness and a belief. Michael told me how good the players were and he felt he had to stop the session early because they were that good and he wanted to bottle it up.""

Carrick, Steve Holland, Jonathan Woodgate and Evans were all sat in the same section as Wayne to watch his son Kai make his Old Trafford debut on Friday, with the 16-year-old coming on as a substitute in a 2-1 extra-time win over Derby County in the FA Youth Cup. They all recognise the importance of preserving the club's proud youth development record, unlike Amorim, who did not attend a single academy match in his 14-month tenure.

Jose Mourinho was also criticised for appearing to neglect those foundations, and there is a risk it could happen again if they go for another foreign coach, but not with Carrick; he's already acting like a model long-term manager. If INEOS want stability, Carrick may well be the standout candidate to succeed Amorim.

Carrick has given himself a real chance of earning an extended stay, but he can guarantee it by bringing the Premier League title back to Old Trafford. United are still 12 points behind current leaders Arsenal, but Mikel Arteta's side have only picked up two points from their last three games, and the nerves that derailed their previous title bids appear to be setting in.

Arsenal don't have the swagger of champions; they have become far too reliant on set-pieces and their frontline is suffering in open play because of it. Second-placed City are enduring similar struggles in the final third amid a worrying injury crisis, while no one expects Unai Emery's over-achieving Aston Villa to stay the course in third.

All three of those clubs are having to juggle commitments across multiple competitions, too, which gives United a clear advantage. Carrick only has 15 games left to prepare for, and in theory, his team should be fresher than the majority of their opponents. 

Aside from home matches against Aston Villa and Liverpool and a trip to Chelsea, their fixture schedule is also favourable. Another win against Fulham at Old Trafford next weekend could see United emerge as dark horses, with Arsenal facing a tricky trip to an improving Leeds side and City traveling to Tottenham, who have beaten them in three of their last four meetings.

Perhaps privately, Carrick will be taking inspiration from United's class of 1996, who were 12 points adrift of Newcastle after 23 games, but pulled off a miraculous turnaround to clinch the title by four points. Champions League qualification should only be the minimum aim for the Red Devils now that they are back in the top four; they have the quality to push for the ultimate prize.

Although Arsenal are still favourites because of their superior strength in depth, United are gathering momentum. If they can keep up their newfound level and adapt when needed against the so-called lesser teams that play with a low block, anything is possible. Carrick's at the wheel, and so far, it just feels right.

Marseille president Pablo Longoria admits to having sought the advice of his mother before completing a controversial transfer for ex-Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood. The one-cap England international made his way to Stade Velodrome during the summer of 2024, having seen headlines made off the field bring an end to his spell at Old Trafford.

During his time with the Red Devils, Greenwood faced allegations of attempted rape and assault. Those charges were discontinued in February 2023, freeing him to resume his professional career.

A productive loan spell was enjoyed in Spain with Getafe during the 2023-24 campaign, allowing a £27 million ($37m) move to Marseille to be completed. Greenwood ended his debut season in France as a Ligue 1 Golden Boot winner alongside Paris Saint-Germain superstar Ousmane Dembele.

He has found the target on 42 occasions through 64 appearances, with Marseille finding value for money in the deal that they struck. They were, however, aware of the noise that a move for Greenwood would generate when entering into talks with Premier League giants United.

Longoria has told The Telegraph of speaking with his mother, Begona, before signing off on a swoop for Greenwood: “For me, it's correct to speak openly about it. Creating taboos in life is never positive. For us it was a massive market opportunity from a sporting perspective where we analysed, very carefully, what really happened.

“In that case, having done due diligence and having all the information – and this is the first time I speak about this – with all the information I called my mother. And I said ‘what do you think, knowing all the situation?' And my mother, who used to work in the prison system in Spain, having a very innovative prison system model in Spain – she was recognised with the medal of the state – so I ask her, having all this information, ‘what would you do in my position?' And she said to me ‘do it'. With all the information.

“It was important because I wanted someone who doesn't have the incentive of the sport, because the talent is there, that her only incentive is the good of her son. As a man, not as a president. And, for me, it was very important that she said to me, knowing all of this, ‘do it'.”

He went on to say of the criticism that a high-profile transfer generated: “For me, at the moment when you have the full information, you deal with it with normality. Like I am doing with you right now. Because this is the most important thing – to have normality in life. Deal with that. 

“Yes, I know that there is criticism. I know that the situation, it's so many times, potentially reputational [damage]. But, I repeat, if you think that you are taking the right decision, with the right level of information, and from a human perspective as well, because Mason, he's a good kid, seriously. From that time, I sleep at night.”

On Greenwood having the right to move on in his life, Longoria said: “I'm not the kind of man who makes judgments without knowing everything and without taking into account all the different elements. It is also not about saying ‘what goes on outside football I don't care about'. That is not correct.”

Longoria believes that Greenwood has become “one of the best players in the world”. The obvious question now is, can Marseille keep him? Longoria said when quizzed on that subject, with interest said to have been shown by leading sides from across Europe: “We are happy. He's performing and the numbers, the talent is there.

Paris Saint-Germain are on the brink of poaching one of Barcelona's brightest talents, with Dro Fernandez currently undergoing a medical ahead of a controversial €8 million transfer. The move has sparked fury in Catalonia, with club president Joan Laporta blasting the teenager's camp for breaking a verbal agreement regarding his future in what he described as an 'unpleasant' surprise for the Spanish giants.

The relationship between Barcelona and PSG has been frosty for years, and the temperature is set to drop further with the imminent departure of highly-rated attacking midfielder Dro Fernandez. According to Fabrizio Romano, the deal is effectively done, with the youngster in Paris today to complete his medical examinations ahead of an €8m (£6.7m) switch.

However, the transfer has left a bitter taste in the mouth of Barcelona president Laporta. Speaking to Catalunya Radio as the news broke, Laporta did not hide his disappointment, revealing that the club believed they had a concrete plan in place to secure Fernandez's long-term future at Camp Nou once he reached maturity.

“We will speak when everything is closed,” Laporta said. “It has been an unpleasant situation. We could have redirected this situation as it had been proposed, but it has been a surprise because we had agreed on a new solution with Dro when he turned 18. Surprisingly, his agent told us that he would not be able to fulfil what was agreed.”

The sense of loss at Barcelona is compounded by the rapid progress Fernandez had made over the last six months. The midfielder had been fast-tracked into the first-team set-up, signalling the club's intent to make him a cornerstone of their future project.

Fernandez was included in the senior squad for Barcelona's pre-season tour of South Korea, a significant milestone that allowed him to train alongside the club's elite stars. He did not have to wait long for his competitive breakthrough, making his La Liga debut in September during a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Real Sociedad.

His trajectory continued to soar in October when he was handed his Champions League debut. Fernandez seized the opportunity, contributing an assist in a 6-1 demolition of Olympiakos. To date, he has made five senior appearances for the Blaugrana, four of which came in La Liga. For a player to have impacted the first team so quickly, only to leave midway through his breakthrough season, represents a significant failure of retention for the Catalan club.

For Barcelona supporters, this narrative is painfully familiar. PSG have a history of targeting Barcelona's youth ranks, similarly poaching Xavi Simons from the youth academy in 2019, as well as the world-record seizure of Neymar which fundamentally altered the transfer market.

The €8m fee represents a significant outlay for a player with only a handful of senior appearances, highlighting how highly rated Fernandez is by the recruitment team at the Parc des Princes. For PSG, securing a talent who has already tasted Champions League football and held his own in La Liga is a major coup, fitting their recent strategy of recruiting elite young talent rather than just established superstars.

Conversely, for Barcelona, the fee offers little consolation. While the club's financial difficulties are well-documented, losing a homegrown talent who was already contributing to the first team for a relatively modest sum is a sporting blow that money cannot immediately fix.

""As a coach, what we do is give confidence to the players,"" Hansi Flick said when reports of a possible move first emerged last week. ""You try to believe in them so that they grow. I also know that there are people around him. I want to wait for this to be a thing of the past. If he decides to change clubs, then we will deal with it. Now is not the time.""

With the medical taking place today, an official announcement is expected imminently. Fernandez will swap the sunny climes of Catalonia for the French capital, where he will look to establish himself in Luis Enrique's squad.

The immediate challenge for Fernandez will be adapting to a new league and a new language, but his performances in the autumn suggest he possesses the temperament to handle the pressure. Meanwhile, Barcelona must now conduct an internal inquest into how ""what was agreed"" was allowed to collapse, leaving them powerless to stop another academy star from walking out the door.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Pep Guardiola has candidly admitted that winger Oscar Bobb is likely looking for a way out of Manchester City before the January transfer window slams shut. The City boss confirmed that the Norwegian international is unhappy with his lack of game time - a situation that has become untenable following the big-money arrival and immediate impact of Antoine Semenyo. 

In a frank exchange with the press, Guardiola refused to shy away from the speculation surrounding one of his most promising academy graduates. Bobb, who dazzled in flashes during previous campaigns, has found himself on the periphery of the squad this season. When asked directly if the 22-year-old was seeking a move away from the Etihad Stadium, Guardiola offered a blunt assessment.

""I don't know yet. I know there are rumours. I know he is talking but I don't know right now,"" Guardiola said regarding the status of a potential transfer. However, when pressed on whether the player himself actually wants to leave, the Catalan manager was even more direct: ""I think so.""

Previously seen as a future star on the right flank, Bobb has seen his progress stall, and Guardiola's comments suggest the club is now resigned to losing him if a suitable offer arrives.

The writing was on the wall for Bobb the moment City sanctioned the £65 million deal to bring Semenyo to the club earlier this month. The former Bournemouth forward has not just arrived to make up the numbers; he has exploded onto the scene in sky blue.

Semenyo has already endeared himself to the Etihad faithful with ""incredible energy"" and, crucially, goals, finding the net against Exeter City in the FA Cup, the Carabao Cup semi-final against Newcastle and again in the Premier League victory over Wolves. His physical dynamism and direct running have offered Guardiola a different profile of attacker, one that the manager is clearly eager to utilise immediately.

With Semenyo joining an attacking corps that already includes Phil Foden, Jeremy Doku and Savinho the competition for places on the wings has never been more intense.

For Bobb, the desire to leave is born out of necessity. At 22, he is no longer a ""prospect"" happy to sit on the bench and learn; he is a full international who needs regular football to continue his development. Despite signing a long-term contract extension previously, his minutes in the 2025-26 campaign have been severely restricted. He has made 15 appearances in all competitions, starting nine of those and has frequently been left as an unused substitute in crunch Premier League and Champions League fixtures. 

With the World Cup on the horizon in the summer of 2026, Bobb is desperate to ensure he is match-sharp and playing week-in, week-out - something Guardiola clearly cannot guarantee him in Manchester.

City have a well-documented policy regarding unhappy players: if you want to leave and the price is right, the door is open. Guardiola has previously sanctioned the exits of key players like Cole Palmer, Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko when they expressed a desire for more playing time.

""We need players who want to be here and fight for their place,"" Guardiola has often stated. By admitting that he ""thinks"" Bobb wants to go, he has effectively given the green light for suitors to make their move. Talks are reportedly ongoing and with the deadline approaching, it appears increasingly likely that Bobb will be the next high-profile academy graduate to trade the comforts of the Etihad for a starting role elsewhere.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Amad Diallo openly mocked Mikel Arteta's tactics after seeing Manchester United claim a dramatic 3-2 victory over Arsenal at Emirates Stadium. The Red Devils inflicted a costly defeat on the Premier League leaders, with more questions being asked of the Gunners' reliance on set-pieces. Amad has savagely reminded them that “your only hope is a corner”.

Arteta's team did provide plenty of threat from dead-ball situations against United, but offered little outside of that - which has become an unfortunate theme for a team that have seen their lead at the top of the table cut to four points.

Only Manchester City have scored more goals than the Gunners this season, with Arteta's side registering 42 across 23 games, but their attacking players have struggled for a spark as individuals.

Bukayo Saka, who is being rewarded with a lucrative new contract in north London, has no goals through his last 13 games in all competitions. Swedish striker Vikor Gyokeres has failed to score a goal that was not a penalty in 11 league games, while Gabriel Martinelli is without a Premier League strike in his last 13 appearances. Another winger, Noni Madueke, has no goals through 25 top-flight outings, and Leandro Trossard has recorded one effort across his last 11 matches in all competitions.

Set-pieces have remained a reliable source of end product for Arsenal, with 26 goals being registered via that method this season - the highest return across Europe's top five leagues. They are, however, in danger of becoming over-reliant on that route to success.

Amad was quick to point out as much after seeing United leave the Emirates with three points. Matheus Cunha grabbed a stunning winner for the Red Devils in the 87th minute - just three minutes after Mikel Merino had restored parity when bundling home from a corner.

Amad responded to a fan on social media by saying: “Your only hope is corner”. He included a laughing emoji and went on to say, alongside a full-time result graphic and be quiet emoji: “Be humble KID.” He was replying to a pre-game post that read: “Arsenal are winning 4-0 they just sent me the script.”

Amad impressed again for United in their hard-fought win at Arsenal, having previously played the full 90 minutes of their eye-catching derby victory over Manchester City. Interim boss Michael Carrick has found a role for the Ivory Coast international that does not require him to line up at wing-back - a position that he was often asked to fill in Ruben Amorim's much-maligned 3-4-2-1 system.

Carrick has been using Amad in his favoured position on the flanks, with Bryan Mbeumo being deployed as a No.9 - meaning that big-money striker Benjamin Sesko has had to settle for a place on the bench.

Carrick told reporters when asked if, after opening his reign with two notable victories over title hopefuls, a top-four finish is now on the cards for United: “I know from our perspective, it's just moving forward to the next game. It's been less than two weeks we've been together. So it's just keep getting good habits, really, and good routines and good habits. The boys have been fantastic with that. I don't think we can look too far ahead. We certainly won't be, anyway. It's a big week leading up to Fulham and games coming up. We'll finish where we finish by getting the results. 

“I know that's kind of obvious, but looking too far ahead can come back and bite you really. So we've taken this week by week, and game by game. We'll certainly continue to do that. But we've got to ride it and use the emotion, you have got to use the energy and use the confidence. You've got to be humble enough to understand how we could just achieve these two big results. It doesn't just come easy, so we need to continue that and bottle it and use it again.”

YouTube sensation and vocal Arsenal supporter KSI has singled out Bukayo Saka as the ""most important player"" in Mikel Arteta's title-chasing squad, while offering a staunch tactical defence of under-fire striker Viktor Gyokeres. Despite the Swedish forward's well-documented struggles in front of goal since his big-money move, KSI insists that Gyokeres acts as a crucial ""magnet"" that unlocks space for his teammates, arguing that the Gunners simply look a better team with him on the pitch.

Speaking on a recent episode of the Beast Mode On podcast, KSI did not hesitate when asked to identify the driving force behind Arsenal's surge to the top of the Premier League table. With the pressure mounting after Manchester City closed the gap at the top to four points at the weekend, the internet personality believes one name stands above the rest as the team's indispensable figure.

“Saka is most important player easily,” KSI declared, dismissing any debate regarding the winger's influence. The England international has been electric throughout the 2025-26 campaign, providing the creative spark and clinical edge that has kept the Gunners at the summit. For KSI, Saka's consistency and ability to deliver in big moments make him the undisputed talisman of Arteta's project, eclipsing even the likes of captain Martin Odegaard and defensive rock William Saliba in terms of pure value to the system.

While Saka received unequivocal praise, the conversation turned to the more divisive topic of summer signing Gyokeres. The striker has faced scrutiny for his goal return since arriving from Sporting Lisbon, having netted nine times in all competitions. However, KSI pushed back against the criticism, arguing that the forward's contribution goes beyond the scoresheet.

“Obviously, Gyokeres isn't firing. He isn't scoring goals,” KSI acknowledged regarding the forward's current form.

However, he elaborated on why he believes the striker remains crucial to the side. “But I call him the magnet,” he explained. “He draws all the players towards him, he allows all the other players like Saka, Trossard, Odegaard to find space in order to score.”

KSI further supported his ""magnet"" theory by pointing to the team's collective performance when Gyokeres is on the pitch compared to when he is substituted. He suggested that the team's ability to win matches is directly linked to the Swede's involvement.

“So, yes, he's not scoring himself but whenever he's there, whenever he's in the squad, wherever he's playing, we most of the time win,” KSI remarked. “We do very, very well with him.”

The YouTuber also noted a drop in performance levels when Arteta withdraws the striker. “And then as soon as he comes off, we just invite pressure,” he added. 

KSI's comments come at a critical juncture in the season. Arsenal remain top of the Premier League table, but the gap to second-placed City has narrowed to just four points following the weekend's results. With the pressure mounting, the form of key players like Saka and the tactical role of Gyokeres will likely dominate the discourse among supporters.

While acknowledging the striker is not scoring enough, KSI remains convinced that his role as a ""magnet"" is vital for the team to function. As Arsenal prepare for their next fixture, the debate over whether Gyokeres needs to start scoring or simply continue ""drawing players"" to him will continue, but for one of the club's most famous fans, his value to the side is clear.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Manchester United continue their resurgence under Michael Carrick's guidance, having beaten Manchester City last week and now shocking Arsenal. A late goal from Matheus Cunha secured a surprising three points at Emirates Stadium against the current Premier League leader.

Following their massive derby win, Man United were in a confident mood as they travel to the Gunners' home ground on Sunday. However, it was the league leader that got the first blow as an own goal from Lisandro Martinez put Mikel Arteta's men 1-0 up in 29 minutes.

Going one goal down didn't break down United's spirit, though, as they got back into the game thanks to Bryan Mbuemo's equalizing goal in the 37th minute. After the break, it was Carrick's men that turn the tie around with a goal from Patrick Dorgu in 50 minutes.

Arsenal working hard to get back into the game and did get themselves that equalizing goal through Mikel Merino's effort six minutes from time. However, three minutes later, it was Man United that came away with all three points as Cunha struck the final blow with his winning goal.

It was an important result not just for United to build on their confidence, but also for the Premier League title race, as it opens things up again. Arsenal's defeat means that Man City are now only four points behind in second place.

Ben Shelton showcased the growing versatility of his game on Monday at the Australian Open, where he rallied past Casper Ruud to book a return to the quarter-finals in Melbourne.

The 23-year-old American combined resilient defence with bursts of explosive aggression to seal a gripping 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 victory after two hours, 36 minutes inside Rod Laver Arena. It marks Shelton's third quarter-final appearance in just four trips to Melbourne Park, where he advanced to a meeting with two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner.

“For me, the atmosphere is everything,” said Shelton. “I'm definitely a competitor. I'm rowdy on the court and I look forward to rowdy crowds. Down here in Australia, there's no shortage… From my first experience, I fell in love with this tournament. It's one of my favourites marked down on the calendar every year.”

Quarter-Finals Bound! 👏@BenShelton takes out Ruud to advance into a 5th career Grand Slam quarter-final 💪#AO26 pic.twitter.com/Qp1kC6H4y3

Ruud had set the tone early with a dominant serving display in the opening set, but the Norwegian will rue costly lapses on serve late in both the second and third sets, moments that allowed Shelton to wrestle control of the contest.

Once in front, the eighth seed raised his level, striking a series of eye-catching winners and finishing points at the net with authority. Shelton won 97 per cent (29/30) of net points during the clash, according to Infosys Stats, and dropped just three points on serve in the fourth set as he closed out the match in commanding fashion.

“It's what you look forward to most in this sport,” Shelton said of his upcoming clash with Sinner, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 8-1, including victory in their semi-final meeting in Melbourne last year. “It's where I wanted to be. I wanted to be back here. I wanted to give myself another shot, improve on some things I didn't do as well last year and leave it all out on the court.”

Jannik Sinner negotiated a brief moment of late uncertainty on Monday at the Australian Open, but ultimately asserted his authority to defeat fellow Italian Luciano Darderi 6-1, 6-3, 7-6(2) and move into the quarter-finals in Melbourne.

The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings struck with authority, pairing relentless precision with a clinical edge that largely kept doubt and drama at bay. Having struggled with cramping against Eliot Spizzirri in the previous round — a match in which he later admitted he “got lucky” with a timely roof closure — Sinner escaped a nervy finish against Darderi, as both his momentum and physical condition briefly threatened to fade.

“It was very difficult. We are good friends off the court, that's also a small difficulty to put away,” Sinner said of Darderi. “In the third set I had a couple of break chances, [but] I couldn't use them… Then I got very tight, so I'm very happy that I closed it in three sets.”

Simply too good 🔥@janniksin defeats compatriot Darderi to reach the quarter-finals for the fourth time.@AustralianOpen | #AO26 pic.twitter.com/LVdNyAZeO4

In his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Darderi, Sinner dictated from the baseline with clean timing and sharp serving. Darderi briefly threatened late in the third set when he produced a surge of aggressive baseline play to earn four break points at 4-4 and led 2/0 in the tie-break. It loomed as a potential turning point, but Sinner shut the door emphatically, winning seven straight points to close out the victory.

Next up, Sinner will face Ben Shelton as he continues his bid to join Novak Djokovic as the only men to lift three consecutive Australian Open titles. The pair now sit just one win apiece away from a potential blockbuster semi-final clash.





With his two-hour, nine-minute victory over Darderi, Sinner advanced to his fourth Australian Open quarter-final, drawing level with Grigor Dimitrov, Kei Nishikori and Stefanos Tsitsipas for the fourth-most appearances at that stage among active players.

Sinner's blend of power and efficiency proved decisive in his straight-sets victory, allowing him to close out the match without inviting further questions around his fitness. He finished with 46 winners, including 19 aces, and remained perfect against his countrymen, extending to an 18-0 tour-level record against fellow Italians.

""We put a lot of work in, especially with the serve,” Sinner added. “We changed the motion a bit and I feel for sure a little bit more confident. There is still room to improve, which is normal, but I'm very happy with how I have come back in the new season. At the end of last season, I served really well, [and] it's much more stable.”

Lorenzo Musetti downed fellow Top 10 star Taylor Fritz on Monday at the Australian Open, where the Italian is into his fourth major quarter-final and first in Melbourne.


Combining elite court coverage with his blistering shotmaking, Musetti scored a 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 victory inside Rod Laver Arena to seal a set of quarter-final appearances at the four Slams.

“I think today [my serve] was really working well,” said Musetti, who struck 13 aces and won 84 per cent of his first-serve points. “I think I made one of my best performances in aces in my career so far, so I'm really, really happy.

 

“When I finished last season pretty late, the goals were to start well this year, because I'd never surpassed the first week here. Making the final in Hong Kong, winning doubles in Hong Kong [with Lorenzo Sonego] and now being in the quarter-finals, for me, it's really a dream.”


The fifth seed has earned a clash against record 10-time champion Novak Djokovic, who reached the last eight after Czech Jakub Mensik withdrew due to an abdominal muscle injury. Djokovic leads Musetti 9-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, and will enter Wednesday's meeting on a six-match winning streak against the Italian.


Two days removed from playing a four-hour, 27-minute five-set battle against Tomas Machac, Musetti showed no obvious signs of fatigue under the afternoon sun. Musetti opened his shoulders and dictated play from the baseline, crushing 33 winners and using his heavy top-spin forehand to draw errors from Fritz.



The American struggled early to land his usually reliable serve, finishing the first set with a 42 per cent first-serve percentage, according to Infosys Stats. Though Fritz found more rhythm behind his delivery as the match wore on, he was unable to make inroads on return (0/2 on break points). 

Sporting k-tape on both his left and right oblique areas, Fritz called for the physio at 3-2 in the second set. Musetti, a two-time tour-level titlist, broke Fritz to love at 5-5 later that set, allowing him to serve for a two-sets-to-love advantage. Musetti again broke Fritz in the opening game of the third set and rarely looked back, clinching victory after two hours and three minutes. Musetti kept his cool when serving for the match, landing three deft drop shots en route to holding to love.“I definitely improved my serve a lot and especially trying to be more aggressive with the forehand and trying to use my variation to lead the game,” Musetti said when asked about adjustments he's made to improve on hard courts. “Like today, with the forehand trying to open the court and make the opponent move. I think before, I was starting to play too far and I was a little too passive on the rally.

“My coach always keeps telling me to be a little more aggressive and try to go for it, take the lead of the rally. That's what I did today.”

Musetti is competing at a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings this fortnight. Last year, he posted a career-best 45 tour-level match wins and competed at the year-end Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. With his latest win, Musetti improved to 4-3 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Fritz, who beat the Italian in Turin in November. The Italian's victory marked his first hard-court win against Fritz.Here to stay 😤Lorenzo Musetti defeats Fritz 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 to reach the Australian Open quarter-finals for the first time.@AustralianOpen | #AO26 pic.twitter.com/DYXdTDropk— ATP Tour (@atptour) January 26, 2026

Musetti, a two-time tour-level titlist, broke Fritz to love at 5-5 later that set, allowing him to serve for a two-sets-to-love advantage. Musetti again broke Fritz in the opening game of the third set and rarely looked back, clinching victory after two hours and three minutes. Musetti kept his cool when serving for the match, landing three deft drop shots en route to holding to love.

“I definitely improved my serve a lot and especially trying to be more aggressive with the forehand and trying to use my variation to lead the game,” Musetti said when asked about adjustments he's made to improve on hard courts. “Like today, with the forehand trying to open the court and make the opponent move. I think before, I was starting to play too far and I was a little too passive on the rally.



“My coach always keeps telling me to be a little more aggressive and try to go for it, take the lead of the rally. That's what I did today.”


Musetti is competing at a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings this fortnight. Last year, he posted a career-best 45 tour-level match wins and competed at the year-end Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. With his latest win, Musetti improved to 4-3 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Fritz, who beat the Italian in Turin in November. The Italian's victory marked his first hard-court win against Fritz.

The two-time defending champion struggled in the heat in his third round but showed no ill effects to defeat countryman Luciano Darderi in straight sets.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 26, 2026 copy_link

MELBOURNE, Australia—Jannik Sinner showed no ill effects from a physically challenging third round at the 2026 Australian Open, rebounding to post a 6-1, 6-3, 7-6 (2) win over Luciano Darderi to reach a third straight quarterfinal in Melbourne.Sinner struggled with cramps through four sets against unseeded American Eliot Spizzirri but eased past his 22nd-seeded countryman to win an 18th straight Australian Open match in two hours and nine minutes on Margaret Court Arena on Monday.“Yesterday was a very, very easy day for me,” Sinner said of his recovery from the Spizzirri match. “Just played for nearly half an hour. Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a bit different when there is no sun, even if it's quite warm outside still.“But yeah, it's also different opponent. Everything is different in every day. So, I felt quite good out there physically. Everything was okay today. Let's see what's coming in the next round.”The No. 2 seed captured his day off for his official YouTube channel, taking fans through a day at the practice courts followed by an evening out to dinner in anticipation of his evening match on MCA.

“For me, every court here is very nice,” Sinner said of playing in Melbourne Park's second biggest show court. “I'm very happy also to go on Margaret Court. I felt like the third set was a bit different because it also got a bit later. The court slows down a bit. From 7:30 on it's a bit different. But this I feel like it's in every court. I don't know how the outside courts are, for example, without the stadiums around.“But all things considered, it's more or less the same. Of course, it might feel a bit faster because the court itself is a bit smaller than Rod Laver. The same thing in Roland Garros if you play in Chatrier or in Lenglen. I feel like it also depends how much space you have around to move. But I didn't feel so much difference, to be honest.”Playing Darderi for the first time in an official match, he struck a clean 46 winners to just 16 unforced errors and broke serve four times while saving all six break points against his own serve over three sets. Though Darderi made a strong push in the third set, Sinner ultimately proved too strong.

“Of course, we try to prepare the match in one way,” Sinner said. “Things got very different from the third set on, for example. He was serving much better. I couldn't return as much as in the first couple of sets.“Yeah, I mean, of course you try to understand where he is going to play. Of course, there is a certain percentage. If you play cross-court or you play down the line, you know a little bit. In the same time, if I would lose the first couple of sets, I also would change like he did today. It gets a bit more unpredictable.”Sinner will next face the winner of the final fourth-round match between No. 8 seed Ben Shelton and No. 12 seed Casper Ruud. If Shelton advances, seven of the Top 8 seeds will have made the quarterfinals in the men's draw.

Published Jan 26, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—Amanda Anisimova spoke out about multiple online controversies that dogged her through the first week of the 2026 Australian Open after reaching the quarterfinals on Monday.“I feel like the Internet, it's tough. It comes with the job, which is something I've learned to get used to,” Anisimova said after defeating Wang Xinyu to make it into the last eight for the first time in Melbourne.“There are definitely days where it bothers me a little bit, and I tell myself it's okay to get upset or frustrated, because at the end of the day, I'm human. But yeah, I mean, it can be pretty difficult. It's not worth so much of my energy and time. That's something that I've learned to get used to.”The No. 4 seed was at the center of two such dust-ups as her Australian Open campaign got underway, first after she declined to answer a question about U.S. politics, and later when a deceptive video surfaced accusing her of hitting a ball kid with a ball during a match.

“In my other press conference…I didn't want to answer a question that was obviously intended for just, like, a headline and clickbait,” Anisimova said. “That was my right. It had nothing to do with my political views or anything like that.”Anisimova was one of several American players asked about U.S. politics and current events in the first week of the tournament; her response drew numerous comments on social media that attempted to infer her political leanings.“The fact that people assume they know my stance on certain important topics is just wrong, and it's not factual,” she somewhat obliquely clarified.Ansimova later posted and deleted a tweet in response to a circulating video, which attempted to equate an innocuous on-court moment with Novak Djokovic's near-miss of a ball kid during his third-round match against Botic van de Zandschulp

“I didn't even hit the ballkid,” confirmed Anisimova, who would have been defaulted from the tournament if she had. “You couldn't even see it in the clip.“People are always saying something. Yeah, people just love talking about stuff that's not even about the tennis.”On the court, Anisimova has left little to question when it comes to her form, which she has impressively carried over from a breakthrough 2025 season. Yet to drop a set Down Under, the 24-year-old has now reached the quarterfinals or better of all four major tournaments, having reached the finals of the last two at Wimbledon and the US Open. Her win over Wang guaranteed at least one American woman will reach the semifinals by drawing No. 6 seed Jessica Pegula.“We've always had some great matches,” Anisimova said of Pegula, who leads their tour-level head-to-head 3-0. “It's funny enough, I played her twice in the exhibitions in the pre-season. But yeah, I mean, she's such a great player. I really like her game. I'm sure it's going to be a tough battle again. We always, you know, really go for our shots when we play against each other. I feel like we always have really long rallies.“I feel like I always have a chance against anyone,” she added. “In my head, I feel like every match is new and different. Yeah, I think the fact that I've never beaten her before is an extra challenge for me.”

The former world No. 1 revealed Sunday that he's trading in racquets for clubs, joining Angel Ayora's team.“We'll be working together on the mental side of performance and professional development,” Ferrero wrote on his social media.“We've already started, highly motivated and looking forward to continuing this journey.”The 45-year-old will still be involved with the training center that bears his name in Villena. The Ferrero Tennis Academy, founded in 1990 by Antonio Martínez Cascales and later rebranded to honor the future Roland Garros champion he would coach, also features the ""Rural Ferrero Hotel"" and several padel courts among its facilities.

'It was a precaution' - Bortoleto on short day 1 stint with Audi in Barcelona

Liam Lawson: 'It feels good' after day 1 in Barcelona

With the Barcelona Shakedown underway, F1.com explains why the event is being held in private, how much running the teams are permitted and more...

A number of 2026 F1 cars have already made their track debut as part of the Barcelona Shakedown – but why is the event being held privately? We have all of the details on that and more about the shakedown below…

The Barcelona Shakedown is an opportunity for the teams to run their new cars on track, without the limitations posed by filming days where running is generally restricted to 200km.

The event allows each squad to check that everything works as expected on their 2026 machines and to see how various aspects correlate with the data from their simulations.

The Barcelona Shakedown runs from January 26-30 at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, a venue that the drivers and teams are very familiar with as the host of the Barcelona-Catalunya Grand Prix.

A shakedown differs to a test in that it is the first time that a team runs its car. As such, the event is not about chasing performance – instead the teams will be focused on getting mileage on their cars and ensuring that all of the various parts work as expected amid the introduction of new regulations for the 2026 season.

From the data they gather, each outfit will then be able to focus on where they need to improve going forward.

Unfortunately the Barcelona Shakedown will not be aired live. However, a highlights video will be released each day as well as short interviews with the drivers and team principals, clips on social media and supporting coverage across F1.com.

While the event spans five days, each team will be permitted to run for a total of three days. This allows them flexibility in deciding when it is convenient for their car to hit the track – for example, some may opt to run later in the week in order to work on their machine during the opening days.

This approach also means that teams can adapt to any changing weather conditions and avoid running on days where the forecast predicts rain or snow.

All of the teams look set to participate in the event with the exception of Williams, who have stated that they are continuing to “push for maximum car performance”. The Grove-based outfit will join the rest of the field at the first Bahrain pre-season test (more on which below).

While several teams held their launches/livery reveals prior to the Barcelona Shakedown, others will do so afterwards, with Mercedes, Williams, Cadillac, Aston Martin and McLaren all set to host their events in early February.

The teams will then head to the Bahrain International Circuit from February 11-13 for the first pre-season test, while the same venue will host a second test across February 18-20.

The last hour of running during each day of the first Bahrain test will be streamed live, while every minute from every day will be aired on a full live broadcast during the second test.

Alongside this, there will be plenty of supporting content across F1.com, F1's social media and F1 TV.

After all of that, the attentions of the drivers and teams will switch to the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, which kicks off a 24-round calendar on March 6-8.

'It was a precaution' - Bortoleto on short day 1 stint with Audi in Barcelona

Liam Lawson: 'It feels good' after day 1 in Barcelona

British racer Freddie Slater is set to become the first driver signed to Audi's junior programme.

Rising star Freddie Slater has become the first recruit of the Audi F1 Team's new Driver Development Programme.

The British racer will compete in F3 this season with Trident Motorsport, under the guidance of Audi's new junior academy run by former F1 driver Allan McNish, following a stellar rise through the motorsport ranks.

He followed up major championship wins in karting with the UAE and Italian F4 Championship titles. Last year, he won the Formula Regional European Championship (FRECA) in his rookie campaign.

Audi say Slater's signing reinforces their ""strategic focus on youth and long-term planning, laying the foundation for a competitive team and aiming to cultivate the champions of tomorrow"".

“It's an incredible honour to be the first driver selected for the Audi Driver Development Programme,” said Slater. “Audi is a brand with a legendary motorsport history, and to have their trust and support at this crucial stage of my career is a dream come true.

""Joining forces with a respected team like Trident Motorsport for Formula 3 and having the backing of Audi Revolut F1 Team is a massive opportunity. I am fully focused on working hard and making the most of this pivotal step towards my goal of reaching Formula 1.”

McNish added: ""In Freddie, we see the immense potential of a future star. His track record is remarkable, but more importantly, he possesses the focus, determination, and willingness to learn that are essential for reaching the pinnacle of our sport.

""He is the ideal candidate to be the first signing of the Audi Driver Development Programme, and we are committed to providing him with the tools, mentorship, and support he needs to succeed as he steps up to Formula 3 with Trident Motorsport.

""This is the first step in building our future on and off the track.""

Red Bull have shown off the car Max Verstappen and Isack Hadjar will campaign in 2026 – the RB22.

1 / 3

Red Bull have revealed images of the RB22 set to be helmed by Max Verstappen and Isack Hadjar in 2026, ahead of the car hitting the track at the Barcelona Shakedown.

Having revealed the team's livery at a media event in Detroit on January 15, Red Bull have now shown off the actual RB22 set to run this week at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, where teams will get to try out their cars as a new era of regulations begins.

Especially significant for Red Bull is the fact that 2026 marks the first year of their partnership with Ford, which sees the Ford name making its return to Formula 1 for the first time since 2004.

Check out images of the car in the gallery up top.

'It was a precaution' - Bortoleto on short day 1 stint with Audi in Barcelona

Liam Lawson: 'It feels good' after day 1 in Barcelona

F1.com is delving into those bubbles to gain a greater understanding of the lives of those who work closely with the stars of F1. This week Bradley Lord, Mercedes' Team Representative and Chief Communications Officer, explains how his team guides its drivers in dealing with the media, managing relationships, and co-ordinating activities through a race weekend.

Modern Formula 1 teams are huge companies with hundreds of employees all working hard to try to be the best in the sport. But within these vast organisations there are the teams within a team – the small cadre of people centred around helping each driver perform at their maximum.

Formula 1.com is delving into those bubbles to gain a greater understanding of the lives of those who work closely with the stars of F1. This week Bradley Lord, Mercedes' Team Representative and Chief Communications Officer, explains how his team guides its drivers in dealing with the media, managing relationships, and co-ordinating activities through a race weekend.

Part of the obligation for Formula 1 drivers throughout the course of a Grand Prix season is to regularly converse with the championship's media corps. This group encompasses the print press, internet journalists, digital and social media, and broadcast media – and drivers have to deal with a torrent of press requests across the course of a campaign.

Acting as a go-between for drivers are the teams' communications officers, who assist with managing a driver's calendar, dealing with requests and interviews, and accompanying drivers to the media sessions – they are the people you will regularly see standing next to a driver during on-screen interviews.

Grand Prix weekends typically last for four days, with three days of on-track activity preceded by a day of media activities on the Thursday.

“A media schedule on a race weekend is built firstly around the core points of the regulations,” Lord explains.

“There are certain paragraphs in the sporting regulations that outline the minimum availability – so that's after practice, after Qualifying, and after the race, and also includes clauses that says drivers must be, if requested to do so, be available at reasonable times to talk to the media, so that's useful, as it embeds access for media.

“Generally the way teams will structure that is to really front-load the weekend, so most media activities, including one-to-ones or more in-depth conversations, will take place on a Thursday.

“There's then a window, usually after Qualifying, to do more on a Saturday, then post-race on a Sunday everyone's keen to debrief and get home.”

Managing a driver's schedule is important to ensure that they are never distracted from their main objectives at each race weekend.

“In the teams I've worked with, you really try and leave the drivers in as much peace as possible through the performance parts of the weekend,” Lord says.

“On Saturday morning there's the fan forum, but between practice and Qualifying that's complete time dedicated to being with the engineers, preparation, recuperation, relaxation, ahead of Qualifying, because we don't want any distractions.

“We try and build the schedule, be it sponsor appearances, Paddock Club, meet-and greets, in a way that doesn't cost the drivers any performance. We can't make them faster, but if we organise it badly, we can make it slower.”

Teams are conscious of interest surging and waning at various intervals throughout the course of a season, and plan accordingly where possible.

“We generally agree a bit of an approach at the start of the year: where you want to focus, what the priorities are,” Lord says. “A driver's national media are important – so that's Italian media for Kimi [Antonelli], the British media for George [Russell], so you'll probably offer a bit more access there, just so they're able to look after their core journalists, and generally the media group also accompany them through the racing pyramid and have been there on the road to success.

“It's important to respect existing relationships too, whether that's working on the team side, or the driver's side.”

The Formula 1 news cycle can sometimes be relentless and part of the role of a communications officer is to be across all subjects to ensure that drivers aren't surprised by a topic or a left-field query, while also separating the wheat from the chaff.

“The way we work with drivers is we brief them, and we have a traffic lights system where green is a topic to say what you think – and we try and have as many greens as possible – and then if we want to present a particular point it might be a red or an amber, but it's very rare there's a conflict.

“Our job is to protect the drivers, and if something has gone wrong the team will always stand in front of the driver and not leave the driver exposed, that's part of the team work of the sport. Our main goal with Kimi and George, and Lewis beforehand, is to be yourselves and be authentic, and don't tell lies, because that trips you up and you get found out.

“A lot of the briefing process is giving them context and awareness. Very few of the drivers spend time digesting and consuming media, so our job is to give them a scan of what's going on and what might be coming up – ‘just so you know you might be asked about this, we'd suggest this is a good way to navigate that, don't get drawn into this particular situation or discussion'.”

Lord has seen the evolution of Formula 1 across the past few decades and has seen how that has influenced and affected the commitments drivers now have with the media.

“It remains as important as ever, particularly as Formula 1 is growing, to have an independent media corps, who hold us to account,” Lord stresses. “It's not just content that the teams or series produces – independent voices and independent media are important, as it upholds the integrity and credibility of the sport.

“I came into a sport where we were printing, photocopying and handing out press releases in the media centre, which feels like the Stone Age!

“Now you're seeing independent media, and individual media, as well as the more traditional powerhouses. There's more broadcast demand now, there's Netflix now and other projects that are similar to that. It's our job to deliver to as many of those, without creating the drag factors on the drivers. Those are the main changes.

“We're also seeing the drivers being asked a much wider variety of questions. It used to be very narrow, now it's what are their interests, their backgrounds, lots of weird and wonderful things, as that makes it fun – for the drivers instead of being asked the same old questions, it's nice to have some freshness of approach and freshness of perspective.”

And in his evolved role as Team Representative it has meant crossing the divide for Lord, who now holds media sessions and undertakes TV duties when Team Principal Toto Wolff is not present.

“It's much more difficult than most PR people will give credit for! You stand in front of the camera or on the other end of the microphone and have to deliver cogent and coherent answers to what can be sometimes tricky questions.

“It's quite easy for us to underestimate the stress it can cause and the challenge it can cause for the people we work with too – so it's a useful insight.”

'It was a precaution' - Bortoleto on short day 1 stint with Audi in Barcelona

Liam Lawson: 'It feels good' after day 1 in Barcelona

Former Red Bull boss Christian Horner exited his role at the Milton Keynes-based team in July 2025.

Alpine have confirmed former Red Bull boss Christian Horner is part of a group of investors who have shown an interest in investing in the Formula 1 squad.

The Enstone-based team sold a 24% stake to Otro Capital – which included high profile investors like Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds and golfer Rory McIlroy – in 2023 with the Renault Group retaining a majority 76% stake in the operation.

Alpine said in a statement that ""it is no secret that Otro Capital has held preliminary talks to sell its stake in the team"".

They added: ""⁠With the continued rapid growth of Formula One, the valuation of the teams has been increasing and, not surprisingly, has led to multiple interested parties looking to enter the sport.

""⁠The team is regularly approached and contacted from potential investors, particularly given Otro Capital declared exploratory talks have taken place.

""⁠One of those parties to express an interest is a group of investors, which also includes Christian Horner.

""⁠Any approaches or discussions are with the existing shareholders, Otro Capital (24%) and Renault Group (76%).""

Horner has been out of work since leaving Red Bull – the team which he had led since their arrival in the sport two decades ago – last year and it is believed the 52-year-old is keen on a return to the grid if the project is right.

Alpine finished last in the Teams' Championship in 2025, but switched their attention and resources very early in that campaign to their 2026 car, which has been built to sweeping new chassis and power unit rules.

They are also partnering up with Mercedes power for the first time, following the decision to close their Renault Formula 1 power unit operation at the end of last year.

Alpine are hopeful their decision to switch resources early to 2026 and take on Mercedes power, which has been the class-leader for the last decade, will haul them back into contention this year.

""Currently, the primary focus for the team is to be more competitive on track in 2026 which, with the new regulation era, presents a unique opportunity to show a sustainable recovery of performance,"" added Alpine.

The team are in action in Spain this week for the Barcelona Shakedown, a five-day private test where all 11 teams are permitted to run at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya for a maximum of three days.

They will all then start chasing performance when official pre-season testing begins in Bahrain next month, split across two tests of three days apiece.

The female-skewing psychological thriller — starring Sydney Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried — has already passed up 'Bridesmaids' to become the top-grossing film of Feig's career in its original run.


							By 

	Pamela McClintock


Senior Film Writer


	Heading into the year-end holiday season, very few in Hollywood were focused on director Paul Feig's The Housemaid, save for the social backlash engulfing star Sydney Sweeney over her American Eagle jeans ad. The in-demand young actress stars opposite Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar in the adaptation of Freida McFadden's best-selling book of the same name.


	They are now. And if they aren't, they will be soon.




	Over the Jan. 23-25 weekend, The Housemaid passed up Bridesmaids ($289.6 million) to become the top-grossing film of Feig's career in its original run with a stunning $294.9 million in global ticket sales, not adjusted for inflation.

	It's also the top showing of Sweeney's career in a leading role, easily trumping the breakout romancer Anyone But You ($208 million). And it has earned far more than many high-profile 2025 releases such as One Battle After Another, a frontrunner for the Oscar. It also comes as the box office continues to struggle even though the pandemic is in the rearview mirror. Many pundits believe midrange films, and especially those targeting females, are better suited for streaming. Feig vehemently disputes that.


	The R-rated psychological thriller, costing a net $45 million to make, is a major victory for Feig in particular. Some 15 years ago — when R-rated comedies were all the rage — he pushed the boundaries of the genre when making Bridesmaids, an all-female property (sorry, Seth Rogen and pack). The Universal film ranked No. 12 on the year's list of top-grossing films. It's also ahead of the 2024 book-to-movie sensation It Ends With Us, which grossed $250 million.

	











	Feig became the toast of the town. He also bonded with Bridesmaids star Melissa McCarthy, and more hit movies followed, including The Heat (2013) and Spy! (2015). Still, there was a fight every time.


	“I don't how many times in my career I've had to prove to Hollywood that women will show up at movie theaters, but they still do,” said Feig. “It happened with Bridesmaids, it happened with Spy, it happened with The Heat and Simple Favor to a lesser degree, since it didn't do as well as I wanted to. But it still is considered a success because the budget was so small. It's just what I do. I do it over and over and over again. The town always seemed so amazed when women show up. So these movies, I don't know what it's going to take for people to just get it that this is a giant audience out there that just needs to be served.”


	Feig continued, “But they need to be served something good. You can't just serve them shit. And I think that's what happened for so long, a certain kind of romance or rom-coms. Some were great and some weren't. And then I think the quality just started dropping because I don't know, people were just doing, oh, women will just show up for this. And it's like, well, no, women are as discerning as anybody else, so you just got to give them great stuff.”


	Then came the reboot of Ghostbusters with a twist — the ensemble cast would be all-female. The Sony film was deemed a major disappointment even though it too earned north of $229 million globally, considering it had a higher budget and marketing costs.

	











	Feig wasn't exactly thrown into director's jail, but he has never worked for a major studio again. Nor was he willing to give up making females pics. A Simple Favor went to Lionsgate, while the recent sequel, A Simple Favor 2, went straight to streaming via Amazon's Prime (that decision was largely the result of the pandemic).


	Now comes along The Housemaid, which has two built-in sequels, since the books are a trilogy. Insiders say while Lionsgate has yet to seal a deal for Sweeney to return, she will be in The Housemaid's Secret. Seyfried's character isn't in the second book, but she and the filmmakers have indicated her character could make an appearance. Among those integral to the first film were producer Carly Elter of Hidden Pictures, who read the independently published manuscript and loved it. She and Todd Lieberman brought it to Lionsgate exec Chelsea Kujawa, who was equally as                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              enthralled. She and Lionsgate president Erin Westerman saw so much potential they optioned it before it became a hit, with Westerman playing an instrumental role in packaging and securing the project (just as she's doing for tthe sequel).

	











	“The female audience has been and will continue to be a tremendous opportunity if you make the film at the right price with the right partners. It can be both incredibly rewarding creatively and financially,” said Lionsgate Motion Picture Group chairman Adam Fogelson, who has a long history of giving the greenlight to female-led pics. He was at Universal when Feig made Bridesmaids, and also Pitch Perfect and Fifty Shades of Grey. And at STX, he backed Bad Moms and Hustlers.


	Feig's leading ladies heap praise on the director. Seyfried has said in various interviews she felt “completely liberated” by the filmmaker, who allowed her to take risks with her character. In describing his unconventional approach, she said she enjoyed surprising Feig with her performances, describing their working relationship as highly engaging. 


	“Here's what we did that everybody needs to do is this movie was engineered to be a group experience for an audience. If you see this movie in a theater with people, people go nuts. They've right from the get-go, people are, I got a lot of laughs in there. There's a lot of gasps, there's a lot of shock, there's a lot of twists,” said Feig. “And when I'm testing these movies and when we're assembling them, I start my test screenings like five weeks into my director's cut, so that we're trying fine-tuning the movie each time we're recording the audience, not only just audio, but we're recording them with night vision. So I can watch and see are people leaning forward? Are they reacting? Are they covering their eyes? Are they jumping up and down?”

	











	Continuing, he said, “And that's why I think we're doing so well. Word just goes out that you're going to go to the theater and you're going to have a blast. People aren't just sitting there passively munching popcorn and looking at their phones during this movie. People are really involved. And so that's what filmmakers have to do. Otherwise, everything will end up on streaming. I don't know how many times I can say this, but this is my fifth movie to cross a hundred million dollars, and they're all female-led movies.”


Bridesmaids eventually topped out at around $324 million because of two rereleases in Australia (either way, Housemaid will eclipse that stat as well).


	The intention is for Westerman's team and Feig to shoot the Housemaid sequel this year for a release in 2027.Feig is also coming off the success of 2025's Another Simple Favor, which reunited him with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick. Feig pushed for a theatrical release from Amazon MGM Studio, but it wasn't to be. And while Prime doesn't consistently reveal viewership numbers, insiders with access to the data say the sequel broke viewership records for a thriller.

The move follows a standstill agreement signed with Mnuchin's Liberty 77 Capital and MHR Fund Management, led by studio chairman Mark Rachesky, to ensure ""interests are aligned."" 


							By 

	Etan Vlessing


Canada Bureau Chief


Lionsgate Studios has named Steven Mnuchin, a former Treasury Secretary in Donald Trump's first presidential administration, to its board of directors.


	Bringing on the hedge fund operator and film producer follows Lionsgate signing a standstill and voting agreement with Mnuchin's Liberty 77 Capital L.P., and MHR Fund Management, LLC, run by Mark Rachesky, chair of the Lionsgate Board of Directors, according to a Jan. 26 regulatory filing. “Steven brings a long record of public and private sector leadership and is an exceptional addition to the Lionsgate Board,” Rachesky said in a statement on Monday.

	Standstill agreements typically prevent investors and their affiliates from acquiring shares beyond a certain limit and taking other actions with respect to the companies. Mnuchin holds around a 13 percent stake in Lionsgate Studios. News of his ascent to the board of directors sent stock in the Hollywood studio to $10.09 in early morning trading on Monday, which represents a 52-week high. 


	“His steady judgment, global perspective and deep industry insights will be enormously valuable as Lionsgate continues to grow as one of the world's leading pure-play content studios. Steven and his fund are significant Lionsgate investors, and his interests are aligned with those of Lionsgate shareholders. I and the rest of the Board look forward to working closely with him on the creation of further shareholder value,” Rachesky added.


	The standstill agreement stipulates that “none of the Liberty parties and MHR Fund Management will engage in customary standstill actions, including increasing their ownership in the company above 17.5 percent, making unsolicited proposals, launching proxy contests, forming groups, or otherwise participating in activities that could challenge or circumvent the company's governance structure.”

	











	Besides his hedge fund, Mnuchin co-financed the Avatar franchise and has over 35 executive producer credits. He is also managing partner of Liberty Strategic Capital, a private equity firm focused on technology, financial services, fintech and new media content. 


	“I have long admired Lionsgate's creativity, entrepreneurial spirit, and ability to excel in a competitive industry. I am pleased to join the company's Board. Lionsgate's board and management team are building something dynamic and forward‑looking, and I am eager to support that momentum. I look forward to helping guide the company in combining strong vision with disciplined execution,” Mnuchin said in his own statement.

The 'Bugonia' and 'Poor Things' director will bring his surrealist style and visual flair to a campaign for the food delivery app.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	Over the course of his career, director Yorgos Lanthimos has crafted a distinct style of absurdist, surrealist and genre-defying filmmaking with projects like The Lobster, Poor Things and Bugonia.


	But The Hollywood Reporter has learned that the Greek filmmaker is set to make arguably his most mainstream project yet: a Super Bowl commercial for Grubhub.




	It will be the director's first Super Bowl ad (Grubhub's too), and fans of his work will immediately recognize his style.

	The food delivery app released a teaser spot for the campaign Monday morning, with a visual design that is distinctly his, and a cast of characters that like something straight out of one of his films. “This February, one food delivery app will finally put their mouth where their money is,” the teaser proclaims.

	











	Watch:


	The rest of the spot is being kept under wraps for now, but look for it to set a new tone for what to expect from Grubhub going forward.


	It's worth noting that while Lanthimos is now best known for his incredibly distinctive style of filmmaking, he began his career in Greece directing commercials, music videos and experimental plays, so the campaign is not exactly outside his wheelhouse, even if it will be his Super Bowl debut.


	The Big Game is the biggest advertising event of the year, and while some brands lean on raw star power to stand out, others try to craft something memorable and different in a bid to steal attention, and that appears to be the case here. So what does Lanthimos have planned? We will have to wait a bit longer to find out.

	











	The spot was created and produced by creative agency Anomaly.

International Investigations Editor


Kanye West, now known as Ye, has taken out an ad in The Wall Street Journal to plead for forgiveness after his antisemitic rampage in 2025.


	In a 750-word statement headlined ‘To Those I've Hurt,' the “Gold Digger” rapper apologized to the Jewish and Black community for his behavior last year.


	Ye, who published the apology as he prepares to release new music, said he suffered a “four-month-long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life.” 


	During this period, Ye sold $20 shirts with swastikas and used X/Twitter to post a series of antisemitic posts, including declaring himself to be a Nazi.

	“I LOVE HITLER NOW WHAT BITCHES,” he wrote in one all-caps missive, an escalation of a previous outburst against Jewish people in 2022, for which he also apologized.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The 2025 comments prompted an outpouring of condemnation from critics, including Piers Morgan and David Schwimmer, who said Ye was spewing “sick hate speech.” He deactivated his X account last February.


	In his WSJ apology, Ye claimed that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2023 after undergoing “comprehensive scans” following a car accident in 2002, during which he broke his jaw.


	Ye said he lived in denial of his diagnosis and “lost touch with reality.” He continued: “Things got worse the longer I ignored the problem. I said and did things I deeply regret. Some of the people I love the most, I treated the worst.”

Ye, fka Kanye West, takes out a full-page in the Wall Street Journal to apologize to the Black community, and for antisemitism: “I lost touch with reality”


	Ye added: “I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability, treatment, and meaningful change. It does not excuse what I did though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I love Jewish people.

	











	“To the black community – which held me down through all of the highs and lows and the darkest of times. The black community is, unquestionably, the foundation of who I am. I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us.”


	Ye said his mental health had improved recently. “As I find my new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise, and clean living, I have newfound, much-needed clarity. I am pouring my energy into positive, meaningful art,” he said.


	“I'm not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness.”

Don't apologize. They won't accept it anyway.

W Ye

Who was the last public figure of any mainstream repute prior to Ye who sold Nazi merchandise? Some punk rocker, maybe? Not sure an apology is going to fully cut it.

so it's an apology, but it's not his fault, it's a disease. Ok. And his deranged fascist behavior started years before 2025… so I don't buy it!

I know people with bipolar disorder.   It doesn't make you sell Nazi merch.

Now, please take out an ad and apologize to people with bipolar disorder.

					By Destiny Jackson 

Awards Writer


	It's time to dust off our trusty pistols and break out the leather jacket because we're finally headed to bingo. OK, not exactly bingo, but instead the iconic locale of Raccoon City. Not seen since 1999's Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (or technically Resident Evil 3's 2020 remake), the latest game in the Resident Evil franchise, Resident Evil Requiem, is returning to its beloved roots. 


	Taking place about 30 years after the missile strike on Raccoon City, Resident Evil Requiem centers on FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft, the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak protagonist Alyssa Ashcroft, who is still haunted by the mysterious death of her mother some eight years prior. When she is thrown into an investigation of ritualistic murders connected to her mother's past in Raccoon City, she catches the decrepit eye of a former Umbrella scientist named Dr. Victor Gideon, who claims she holds the key to unlocking a secret project that is probably super darksided. Since there's still a month to go until the game's release, we don't know all the details just yet, but somewhere along the way of Grace's investigation, she crosses paths with fan favorite and resident badass, RPD's Leon Kennedy.

	After checking out a preview, Deadline spoke to director Kōshi Nakanishi and producer Masato Kumazawa about what fans can expect from what is sure to be Capcom's next horror smash-hit.




			Watch on Deadline		







DEADLINE: It's been three decades. How does the team keep current on what's scary? What inspirations are you pulling from when making a Resident Evil game? 












KŌSHI NAKANISHI: That is a challenge that the developers have when they are doing an entry in the series. The easiest way to find out [if we succeeded] is to have people play it. How did you find the preview?  


DEADLINE: I was overwhelmed with scares. There was a scene where I had three different paths to go down: one led to a kitchen with a big, scary chef, the other led to a dining room full of zombies eating people, and another, which I thought would be safe, contained a maid in the bathroom ready to attack me. I didn't want to go anywhere.


NAKANISHI: [Laughs.] That's exactly what we aimed for. I'm very happy to hear that. What you felt, that fear, even to the point where you are kind of scared to go forward or proceed, that's key to providing fear. It's about not knowing what's going to happen or what's around each corner. Is your death waiting around the corner? You don't know until you find out. Fear is a seed in your own imagination. So, the key to providing a scary experience in any of these titles is to give the player enough to let their imagination go and basically create fear. 


DEADLINE: Resident Evil Requiem has a split-narrative style like Resident Evil: Revelations. What have you learned between making the two games? 


NAKANISHI: There is some similarity between the two games, but I want to be clear that I did not purposefully set out to make Requiem a split story just because Revelations was a split story. But yes, there's similarities in terms of differences in gameplay, surroundings, characters [you interact with], circumstances and so on. When you played the preview, you started out as Leon, and he's got a lot of firearms, choices and combat options. He's a very strong character. Once you go from him to Grace, it's a very big shift. You go from playing a powerful character to Grace, who is more modest in her options, which should give you this feeling of, “Oh my goodness, how am I going to be going through all of this [horror], will I be OK?” This is like my previous answer about the key to fear really being all about players' imaginations. And this [storytelling device] is just another way that we feel stoked that. 


DEADLINE: Was it ever just going to be Grace alone? When did Leon come into the picture? 


NAKANISHI: During early prototyping, there were times when we thought about Leon as the single main character or just having Grace as the single character. It was just a lot of trial and error that let us do both. 


DEADLINE: How would you describe Leon and Grace to the audience? 


NAKANISHI: Grace is a young woman who, eight years earlier, lost her mother. And that's still traumatic for her, and she hasn't fully processed that trauma, so it still affects her to the [game's] present day. She's much more on the inexperienced side of things, whereas, of course, Leon has been fighting biohazards for close to 30 years at this point. Obviously, he has a lot of mental and physical strength and resilience. But at the same time, since he has been doing this for so long, he's seen a lot of tragedy, and that weighs on him, which is something that is expressed in Requiem. They're very contrasting characters. However, through Requiem, Leon's journey leads him back to Raccoon City, and Grace is also there. So, with that combination, we've got some legacy and newer characters both being tied back to Raccoon City, and that's one of the overall themes and concepts that is expressed throughout Requiem. 

	











DEADLINE: In the preview, it was mentioned that Leon has something called the Umbrella curse. What more can you say about that? 


NAKANISHI: This game's setting takes place 30 years after the Raccoon City incident, which was connected to Umbrella. So, this phrase about the “Umbrella curse” refers to something that has affected people who were either enveloped by the incident or present when that situation happened. But that's about all I can say for now. [Laughs.] 


DEADLINE: Producer Kumazawa, what were some non-negotiables that you had to have in this game to get the themes across? 


NAKANISHI: I'll add that it was vital to [show the effects] of the Raccoon City incident and how it's affected many people over and over again for close to 30 years in the game. Presenting that in the game is one of the key aspects of communicating the concept and themes of Requiem across the series. 


MASATO KUMAZAWA: This was touched on a bit earlier, but it was depicting the contrast [that was important for us]. You have such different characters at different points in their lives between Grace and Leon, which allows the player to experience varied gameplay. And, of course, with storytelling, this is about two different people finding a common journey that leads them both to Raccoon City. Tying all of that together is the core of the themes in Requiem. 


DEADLINE: What are you most excited for people to experience with this game? 


NAKANISHI: There are two styles that are presented here between Grace and Leon. They are both styles that have been in Resident Evil games in the past. However, this is the first time we've combined our gameplay styles in a way that provides tension and release when switching narratives. So, it's very unique to Requiem. So, I'm most excited to see how users experience that when they play the game. 


DEADLINE: I must ask. In the preview, Leon is talking to someone on a headset. And I need to know. Is it Claire or Ada? Where are they? 


NAKANISHI: [Laughs.] So, I know a lot of fans are interested in similar things. We all want to know. I am also very interested in the private relationship between Leon and Ada. However, I can't comment on either one of these things. But I will say that we have put a lot of work into Requiem, implementing stories and things that fans will love and enjoy. So, I hope the fans are looking forward to the game. 


Resident Evil Requiem will release February, 27 on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, Windows and Xbox Series X/S

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Amazon MGM Studios‘ new Head of Global Television Peter Friedlander is putting his stamp by restructuring the studio's scripted series team and bringing in Blair Fetter who previously worked with him at Netflix.


	Leaving as part of the reorg are the two top scripted executives under previous Amazon MGM Studios TV head Vernon Sanders: Laura Lancaster as Head of US SVOD TV Development and Series – Co-Productions and Nick Pepper as Head of US SVOD TV Development and Series – Wholly Owned. Both are in talks for producing deals with the streaming studio. 


	“Effective immediately, we are transitioning from our current structure — split between Wholly Owned and Co-Productions — to a streamlined, genre-based organization (drama & comedy, worldbuilding, animation, and unscripted),” Friedlander said in a memo announcing the changes, which you can read in full below. The realignment, which bears some resemblance to Netflix's scripted series executive structure, impacts both development and current.

	Each of the four genre areas will be led by an executive who will be a Friedlander direct report. 


	Fetter, who starts February 2, will be Head of Worldbuilding & Genre Series. That is right up his alley as Fetter most recently oversaw Spectacle Series at Netflix.


Tom Lieber, Head, Co-Production Genre Development and Current Series under Lancaster, who has overseen The Boys universe, Fallout, and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, and Matt King, who was on Pepper's team, will continue to work on worldbuilding genre programming, now reporting to Fetter.


	A Head of Drama & Comedy Series will be named soon. Kara Smith, most recently Head, Co-Production Drama, Comedy Development and Current Series under Lancaster; Michael McDonald, Head of the Comedy and Drama Development – US SVOD TV Development and Series – Wholly Owned under Pepper; and Jen Chambers, Head of Creative Synergy & Development on Pepper's team, will be working across drama, comedy, and young adult programming under the new Head of Drama & Comedy. They will report to Friedlander in the meantime. Smith has been involved in the development of some of Prime Video's biggest hits from outside studios, including The Summer I Turned Pretty and Reacher.

	











Melissa Wolfe will continue as Head of Animation. Previously under Pepper, she will now be reporting directly to Friedlander. Also reporting to Friedlander is Jenn Levy, the Netflix alumna he recently brought in as the streamer's new Head of Unscripted and Documentary Television. 


	Additionally, Lauren O'Connor, Head of Global IP, who previously reported to Pepper, will now report directly to Friedlander. Lindsay Sloane, Head of MGM Television, Scripted Series, will also continue to report to Friedlander.


	The restructuring comes four months after former Netflix Head of UCAN (U.S. and Canada) Scripted Series Friedlander joined Amazon. He took time to familiarize himself with the TV studio's executive team and its development slate while plotting his strategy. 


	While doing that, Friedlander has been keeping things largely close to the vest. Speculation about the pending reorg picked up momentum earlier this month as he is expected to present the new structure at a town hall that has been scheduled for later this week. 


	Amazon MGM Studios' TV operations went through quite a few rounds of restructuring over the past several years with lines between programming areas drawn and redrawn to a point where many producers and agents felt confused whom to pitch a particular project. When Friedlander took over, there was expectation that he would streamline the way the TV division operates while building his own team. In doing so, he met with a number of executives – both internally and externally.


	“By organizing around these specialized genres with dedicated leadership, we will move faster, make sharper creative decisions, and continue to build groundbreaking series that define the future of television,” Friedlander said in the memo. “I'm energized by the opportunities ahead and confident in this team's ability to deliver for our customers and the creative community in which we work.”


	Pepper and Lancaster joined Amazon in 2021 and were named to their most recent roles in 2022 as part of a restructuring of the scripted team.


	Since then, Pepper has spearheaded the exploration of the MGM library of IP for television following Amazon's $8.5B acquisition of the 100-year-old studio, which has resulted in several greenlights to date, including Legally Blonde prequel Elle, Tomb Raider and Carrie. Additionally, he has worked on building a slate of owned YA series, including Overcompensation, and the upcoming Off Campus and Carrie, and has overseen animation with slate that includes Secret Level and Hazbin Hotel.


	Lancaster was originally brought in to oversee the ongoing series for Prime Video. She and her team have shepherded several series that have gone to multiple seasons, with some growing season-to-season, most notably The Summer I Turned Pretty. Other shows under her purview included Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power, Fallout, Reacher, The Terminal List and We Were Liars.


	“Nick and Laura have been invaluable builders of our scripted series slate, and we are deeply grateful for their significant contributions to our success,” Friedlander said. 


	Before joining Amazon, Lancaster was Alcon Television Group President and head of drama at NBC; Pepper was President of Legendary Television and Head of Television for the Mark Gordon Company. 


	Fetter left Netflix after more than 13 years in October, two months after Friedlander's exit. Fetter has been rumored to follow Friedlander to Amazon MGM Studios ever since, though, according to sources, he met with other companies too.

	











	During his Netflix tenure, Fetter worked on such series as Ozark, The Queen's Gambit, Stranger Things, BoJack Horseman, 3 Body Problem, Godless, Big Mouth, Haunting of Hill House and Death by Lightning. 


	“His ability to discover and develop expansive worlds paired with his commitment to high-quality storytelling makes him an ideal addition to my leadership team,” Friedlander said of Fetter.


	Before joining Netflix, Fetter worked on HBO's Big Love, on which Friedlander was a producer and executive for Playtone. Fetter started as an assistant before being promoted to associate producer on the show. He made the move to Netflix six months after Friedlander had gotten there.


	Amazon MGM Studios' international originals, led by Nicole Clemens, falls under VP Kelly Day who reports to Mike Hopkins, Head of Prime Video & Amazon MGM, as does Friedlander.


	Here is Friedlander's email:

I'm writing to announce a new organizational structure for the Scripted Series team at Amazon MGM Studios, designed to accelerate our mission of delivering exceptional original television that captivates audiences worldwide. Effective immediately, we are transitioning from our current structure — split between Wholly Owned and Co-Productions — to a streamlined, genre-based organization (drama & comedy, worldbuilding, animation, and unscripted). Both Development and Current will reside in this new framework, which will provide greater clarity, specialized expertise, and clear ownership across our entire portfolio. As part of this evolution, Laura Lancaster and Nick Pepper will be transitioning out of the organization. Deal conversations are underway. Nick and Laura have been invaluable builders of our scripted series slate, and we are deeply grateful for their significant contributions to our success. Laura has made incredible contributions to Prime Video's programming successes as she and her team have led the creative oversight of The Summer I Turned Pretty, Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power, Fallout, Reacher, The Terminal List, The Better Sister, We Were Liars, amongst many others, as well as upcoming series such as Spider-Noir, Blade Runner 2099, Scarpetta, and God of War. Nick was the driving force behind the critically acclaimed Prime Video series Overcompensating and the upcoming titles Tomb Raider, Elle, Young Sherlock, and Carrie. In addition, Nick has built a bold and distinctive animation slate, including Secret Level, Hazbin Hotel, Helluva Boss, and two of Critical Role's premium campaigns, Vox Machina and Mighty Nein.With this transition, I'm pleased to announce that Blair Fetter is joining Amazon MGM Studios as Head of Worldbuilding & Genre Series, reporting to me starting February 2nd. Blair brings outstanding experience from Netflix, where he oversaw Spectacle Series and was essential to the success of shows such as Stranger Things, Ozark, The Queen's Gambit, Death by Lightning, BoJack Horseman, The Haunting of Hill House and 3 Body Problem. His ability to discover and develop expansive worlds paired with his commitment to high-quality storytelling makes him an ideal addition to my leadership team. Tom Lieber and Matt King will report to Blair, continuing to focus on our Worldbuilding genre programming. As previously announced, Jenn Levy has joined as Head of Unscripted and Documentary Television. Melissa Wolfe will continue as Head of Animation, now reporting directly to me. For our Drama, Comedy, and Young Adult programming, Kara Smith, Michael McDonald, and Jen Chambers will report to me on an interim basis until we finalize the structure and put in place a new Head of Drama & Comedy Series. With these changes, Lauren O'Connor, Head of Global IP, will now report directly to me. Lindsay Sloane, who leads MGM Television, Scripted Series, will also continue to report to me. By organizing around these specialized genres with dedicated leadership, we will move faster, make sharper creative decisions, and continue to build groundbreaking series that define the future of television. I'm energized by the opportunities ahead and confident in this team's ability to deliver for our customers and the creative community in which we work.Peter

EXCLUSIVE: One of the greatest directors of all time is going vertical.


	Alfred Hitchcok's 1927 silent feature The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog has become possibly the first classic movie to be reframed as a microdrama. 


	The movie is available now in the U.S. on nascent UK microdrama app Tattle TV in vertical form. Tattle said the move is “one of the first known instances of a classic feature film being fully reframed for vertical, mobile-first consumption.” 


	Deadline understands The Lodger can't be made available via vertical video in the UK or EU as it is subject to IP licensing restrictions, but in the U.S. the silent version is available for adaptation.

The Lodger was Hitchcock's first big movie, establishing the icon's reputation as a director to be taken seriously. The silent film starring Marie Ault and Ivor Novello followed a serial killer who targets young blonde women on Tuesday evenings. 


	“Tattle TV is an early adopter of cutting-edge AI tools, allowing us to streamline our vertical‑first workflow and bring classic and archival content to mobile audiences faster than ever,” said Tattle co-founder Philip McGoldrick.


	Deadline profiled Tattle TV last week in our “Microdramas Go Global” feature, in which we wrote about the next generation of vertical video creators. Tattle's founders have spoken about a desire to repurpose British classics like Monty Python for vertical. The app features the likes of MMA movie Tramp and reality pilot Dog Dates.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","The teenage sex scene that sparked infamous rift between edgy director brothers behind Hollywood's hottest movies","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/26/hollywood/the-teenage-sex-scene-that-sparked-safdie-brothers-infamous-rift/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:59:00 GMT","

One of the more enduring riddles that has mystified Hollywood in recent years is what triggered the rift between Josh and Benny Safdie.

Trying to figure out what prompted the breakup of the hottest indie director duo in town — brothers no less! — after a string of critically acclaimed hits has been a favored parlor game of Hollywood insiders and reporters. Rumors swirled that one brother went full MAGA, creating tensions, while the duo vaguely blamed the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike in conversation with colleagues. 

Speculation only intensified on Thursday (January 22) when Josh nabbed four Oscar nominations for his solo effort “Marty Supreme,” while Benny came up empty handed for his “The Smashing Machine.”

But the root of the quarrel stems from a much darker incident that occurred on the set of their 2017 breakout “Good Time,” Page Six Hollywood can reveal, with Benny cutting ties with his brother in 2023 after he learned the full scope of the event.

According to “Good Time” sources, a 17-year-old girl was cast to play a prostitute in the crime thriller. Once on set, the teenager was thrust into a scene that involved nudity and simulated sex with “actor” Buddy Duress during production in New York.

As part of their verité style, the Safdies were known for using a mix of professional stars like the film's lead, Robert Pattinson, as well as non-actors like Duress, who had just been released from prison. (Duress, real name Michael Stathis, had been jailed numerous times dating back to 2009 on drug charges, weapons violations, fencing stolen property and motor vehicle theft, according to court records.)

While Josh watched the action unfold on his monitor, and Benny stood in the corner holding the boom, Duress, who was high at the time, pulled down his pants, exposed himself and asked the girl if “he could stick it in” as the cameras continued to roll, multiple sources tell Page Six Hollywood (Duress died of a heroin overdose in November 2023.)

“Any director who had seen that should have yelled cut and stopped the scene, but Josh let it continue,” says an on-set source who noted that Josh, and not Benny, was the de facto commander on set.

Three sources say Josh, who is now vying for this year's best director Oscar, became aware of the girl's age on the day of production, shortly after the scene shot, as the traumatized girl spiraled. Josh declined comment.

Using a minor for nudity and a sex scene would flout industry norms including a Screen Actors Guild rule that stipulates work conditions not be “detrimental to the health, morals and safety of the minor.” Those familiar with the chain of events say Josh's recklessness was beyond the pale.

The Safdies removed the scene sometime before the A24 film made its splashy world premiere at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. Sources close to them insist that the scene was excised “for creative reasons.” But the repercussions of that incident didn't surface until 2022, when their former producing partner, Sebastian “Sebo” Bear-McClard, became locked in a bitter divorce with actress Emily Ratajkowski, threatening to expose the “Good Time” dirty laundry. (In a side drama, the then-single Bear-McClard had become romantically involved with the “Good Time” actress after production wrapped, and that information was now bubbling up in EmRata's battle for custody of their son.)

Sources also said Bear-McClard had dalliances on the set of the Safdies' “Uncut Gems,” including an extramarital fling with a cast member. A rep for the siblings at the time said they were “made aware of [McClard's] behavior in July 2022.” 

It was also the moment Benny was made aware of the “Good Time” actress' age, creating a “wedge” between the brothers, as one friend of theirs described it. Josh blamed Bear-McClard for hiring a minor. Bear-McClard pushed back and noted that he wasn't the producer responsible for ensuring her age. Sources also note that Bear-McClard wasn't in the room when Duress tried to have on-camera sex with the teen. The brothers cut ties with Bear-McClard and began private mediation to unravel the company the trio founded.

“You don't all of the sudden develop a moral conscience six years later. Like that's not how it works,” says a source familiar with the drama.

Still, the Safdies continued to work with one another for another nine months amid mounting tensions. In early 2023, they were in pre-production on yet another red-hot property that would reunite them with their “Uncut Gems” star Adam Sandler at Netflix. Then, in March 2023, I reported for Variety on the behind-the-scenes drama of Ratajkowski's split from Bear-McClard, which included some of the details from the “Good Time” incident including the girl's age. It was the final straw for Benny, who swiftly ended his creative partnership with his brother, insiders say.

As a result, their Sandler project for Netflix was suddenly dead. The edgy auteurs then went their separate ways, with Josh tackling “Marty Supreme” with Timothee Chalamet, and Benny pivoting to “Smashing Machine” with Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.

As the town pondered the Safdie breakup, it turns out the sibling rivalry in this year's Oscar race is merely a secondary drama. Now that the dust has settled on this year's nominations, it's clear that Josh prevailed, with “Marty Supreme” landing nine nominations overall, while “Smashing Machine” earned just one in a minor category.

Regardless, both will continue to work with Hollywood's A-list. But some of Josh's longtime associates are asking at what cost? The brothers have a history of playing fast and loose with labor norms in creating their signature aesthetic. While shooting the Jay-Z “Our Block” music video in Brooklyn in 2017, they allegedly raised eyebrows when they kept a child actor on a rooftop past 1a.m. and long after the allowable eight hours. One on-set source says he was horrified by Josh's lack of regard for the child, who cried and asked to go home because he was tired.

Josh, for one, still appears to be enamored with working with unhinged non-actors: During a recent awards-season Q&A, Chalamet said that a “Marty Supreme” background actor threatened him and warned, “I was just in jail for 30 years. You really don't want to f–k with me. You don't want to see me angry.”

Apparently awards voters were more inclined to reward his risky style.

“It seems Academy members have a very short memory when it comes to the on-set behavior of their ‘best directors,'” says Anne Henry, co-founder of BizParentz, an advocacy group for child actors. “It is troubling that just a few years later Josh Safdie is being honored as a director. Maybe it is my perspective as a child advocate, but I don't consider a director who hires a non-union kids off Instagram, skirts safety protections for minors, has a girl do a surprise nude scene, to be stellar. I would have hoped Oscar-nominated directors would be judged for their methods and professionalism as well. This is 2026. We shouldn't be in a ‘create entertainment at all costs' environment.”","{'href': 'https://pagesix.com', 'title': 'Page Six'}","entertainment"

Brooks Nader is putting an end to gossip about a rumored romance with Ben Affleck. On Saturday, Deuxmoi posted an item to Instagram that read “Despite reports that Ben Affleck & Brooks Nader are ‘hooking up,' a source tells Deuxmoi exclusively the two have ‘never met.'”In the comments, Nader confirmed, “Haven't met him in my life,” of the 53-year-old actor.

The “Love Thy Nader” star, 28, was most recently linked to her pro partner on “Dancing With the Stars,” Gleb Savchenko, 42, with whom she had a messy split with in April 2025 after a steamy on-again, off-again romance.

The two met during season 33 of the ABC competition series. After the “DWTS” Season 33 cast was announced in September 2024, the professional dancer and his partner sparked romance rumors by posting several flirty social media videos while practicing for the competition series.

Nader denied being romantically involved with her dance partner during an interview with Page Six that month. The duo, however, sent mixed signals, as they were seen kissing backstage at the dance competition and out in public later that month.

In April of 2025, the relationship came to a halt. “I was surprised to learn through article(s) published today … that Brooks has ended our relationship,” Savchenko told Page Six after news broke.

“The last communication I received from her was a text on April 6, asking to speak. I called her today in response, but she has not replied.”

Prior to dating Savchenko, 42, Nader was married to Billy Haire from 2019 until they separated in 2024. Their divorce was finalized this past May.

In September 2025, the Sports Illustrated model played coy when asked about Page Six's exclusive report that she dated US Open finalists Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner at the same time that summer.

“I would just say, a lady never kisses and tells, especially twice,” the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model responded on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.”

The future in-laws are gearing up for their children's upcoming wedding, which Page Six revealed will take place on June 13, 2026.

Wedding planning seems to be the name of the game these days after Travis and his Kansas City Chiefs failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2014, eliminating their chances to make it to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in a row.

However, for some time, the “Cruel Summer” singer was focused on lifting Kelce's “defeated” spirits over their upcoming wedding, per the DailyMail.

“Taylor is trying to put him in a better mood by spending more time with him and not bombarding him with wedding plans,” the insider said.

“She would want him to focus on [the wedding] after he makes his career decision because she knows how important that is to him.”

The insider noted that Taylor, 36, is looking at the rough patch as the pair's “first real test of their relationship.”

“They have been together and in love and have enjoyed the success of her tour and career and his Super Bowls and his career. Travis hasn't been in this position before where he is staring at his future with complete 20/20 vision,” they said.

Travis, also 36, has been left feeling “a bit defeated” as retirement rumors hang in the air.

As for when fans will know if the tight end will return to the NFL, the source said, “We will know a few weeks after the Super Bowl if he will be returning or not. 

“That is his timeline that he has set to make a decision to play one more year or not,” they added.

Even if the football icon does not return to the field for another season, Page Six revealed the couple has their post-NFL life planned out with different projects.

The couple — who began dating in the summer of 2023 — announced their engagement in August 2025.

When does she sleep?!

On the heels of her “SNL” hosting debut, Teyana Taylor jetted off to Paris Fashion Week, where she popped up in the front row at Monday's Schiaparelli Haute Couture show at the Petit Palais.

And while other notables in attendance (like Demi Moore, Lauren Sánchez and Jodie Turner-Smith) were attired in suiting separates and gowns, the Oscar nominee turned heads in a completely transparent (and unlined) black Chantilly lace top and matching pencil skirt, a black tuxedo coat draped over her shoulders.

The “One Battle After Another” actress completed the daring look with black platform pumps, a silver chandelier brooch with a rhinestone knot and — the pièce de résistance — an antique silver crown encrusted with rhinestones and pearls that asserted her fashion dominance.

In a cheeky twist, both pieces were re-creations of jewelry stolen from the Louvre Museum last October, per Vanity Fair.

Taylor's turned to Schiaparelli for some of her most memorable red carpet moments, recently gracing the Golden Globes in a sculptural black halter gown finished with a racy diamanté thong.

“The crack is covered in diamonds. It's expensive!” the 35-year-old quipped on the step-and-repeat.

At the Paris premiere of “All's Fair” in October, Taylor stole the show in a gold metallic mesh gown that hugged her every curve.

That same month, she attended a Desert Diamonds bash in a surrealist leather Schiaparelli coat embossed to look like crocodile hide.

And for the Disney Upfront in May, Taylor dazzed in a denim set adorned with the fashion house's signature gold bijoux buttons shaped like eyes, ears and lips.

With awards season just kicking off, it's a sure bet we'll spot the style star in more headling-making Schiaparelli styles in the months ahead.

Kanye West has issued an apology to Black and Jewish communities after years of spewing racist and antisemitic beliefs. 

“I lost touch with reality. Things got worse the longer I ignored the problem. I said and did things I deeply regret. Some of the people I love the most, I treated the worst,” he wrote in a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal.

“You endured fear, confusion, humiliation, and the exhaustion of trying to have someone who was, at times, unrecognizable. Looking back, I became detached from my true self,” West, 48, added.

“In that fractured state, I gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika, and even sold T-shirts bearing it.”

West, who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, said his illness prompted him to have “poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body experience.”

“I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability, treatment, and meaningful change,” he penned. 

“It does not excuse what I did though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I love Jewish people,” West declared.

The Grammy winner then spoke directly to the Black community, who he claimed “held [him] down through all of the highs and lows and the darkest of times.”

“The black community is, unquestionably, the foundation of who I am. I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us,” West wrote.

“My words as a leader in my community have global impact and influence. In my mania, I lost complete sight of that.”

The rapper said he is not “asking for sympathy, or a free pass,” but he wants to “earn” people's forgiveness.

“I write today simply to ask for your patience and understanding as I find my way home,” he wrote.

West explained in his letter that he wasn't “properly diagnosed” until 2023, more than two decades after he suffered a brain injury in a car crash.

“That medical oversight caused serious damage to my mental health and led to my bipolar type-1 diagnosis,” he wrote.

“The scariest thing about this disorder is how persuasive it is when it tells you: You don't need help. It makes you blind, but convinced you have insight. You feel powerful, certain, unstoppable,” the fashion designer shared.

West has made several controversial statements over the years.

In 2022, the hip-hop hitmaker rocked a “White Lives Matter” T-shirt to a surprise Yeezy fashion show in Paris.

That October, West tweeted that he was going to go “death con 3” on Jewish people. The remark caused several companies to cut ties with the dad of four, including Adidas. 

The following year, West wore a black Ku Klux Klan hood to his “Vultures” album listening party.

He also promoted swastika T-shirts in a 2025 Super Bowl ad and released a song titled “Heil Hitler.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms gets bawdier, and better, in ""Hard Salt Beef""","https://www.avclub.com/a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-recap-season-1-episode-2","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:39:34 GMT","

A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms, much like the series of novellas on which it's based, is zeroed in on the humanity of its characters, ridiculous or embarrassed as they can sometimes be. If Ser Dunk's brief but energetic bout of diarrhea hadn't already made that clear, this week's vivid recounting of Ser Arlan Of Pennytree (Danny Webb) reiterates the point: The saga of Ser Duncan The Tall (Peter Claffey) and his squire Egg (Dexter Sol Ansell) is shaping up to be a bawdier, earthier affair than Game Of Thrones or House Of The Dragon, more Tyrion Lannister than Ned Stark.  

That's not a bad thing. In fact, the series can be hilarious when it veers into lampoon, as it does when Dunk recounts the exploits of his fallen mentor to Leo “Longthorn” Tyrell (Steve Wall), giving us a fuller view of his ser's, um, greatness. We watch Arlan attend to his post-coital duties, as we listen to Dunk begging Tyrell to remember the man's deeds and to vouch for him for the lists at Ashford Meadow. It's a startling moment—not just for the hugeness of Ser Arlan's member, but for what else we see and the smash cut to black that follows as the title card drops. Says Dunk: “Even as he was dying, he just…he just got on with it.” 

“Hard Salt Beef,” directed by Owen Harris and written by Aziza Barnes and series co-creator Ira Parker, strikes a nimble balance of irreverence and pathos that a less conscientious production would fumble. It's all in the brief morning quiet that follows Dunk's line, nestled in the blackness, before the episode begins in earnest. It allows us to clear our throats, settle in, and ruminate a bit on what Arlan meant to Dunk and what kind of man this fallen knight brought up. It's a phenomenal show of storytelling dexterity. Are we meant to interpret Arlan's enormous phallus as shorthand for the enormity of his modest legend in Ser Dunk's heart? Or was Ser Arlan simply granted by the gods a second, equally reliable sword? 

Clearly, this moment isn't from Dunk's memory. Its frank intimacy rules that out, as does a detail that Dunk might have overlooked: a nasty red gash on Arlan's arm, perhaps from some minor scuffle or accident. He regards the wound silently before returning to bed, worry flashing quickly across his face followed by something resembling acceptance. Dunk's words at this exact moment—“he never complained”—suggest Arlan kept its severity from his squire. It represents the kind of knight Ser Arlan was: full of life and content with his lot. The words are Dunk's, but this memory, I think, is meant solely for us. 

“Hard Salt Beef” ushers in a new day and a new host of worries for Ser Dunk. Tyrell's response to Ser Arlan's service, delivered through a mouthful of sourleaf, is curt and final: “I knew him not.” Lord Ashford's tourney looms, but our hedge knight, discouraged but undaunted, presses on with Egg squeaking in his ear. “[Arlan] can't have been a very good [knight] if no one remembers him.” It's a troubling thought for Dunk to chew on and one that will prove significant later. For now, his ser's relentless begging chafes Egg, who lets off a bit more steam than he likely means to: “You are a knight of the realm, ser; you can say fuck their permission, ride into the lists, call out Longthorn Tyrell, and turn his arsehole into a lance-hole!” Unbecoming language for a squire, perhaps, but the boy has a point: Why doesn't Dunk flex his rights as a knight of the Seven Kingdoms? Unless, of course, he has something to hide? 

Dunk's secrets will keep for now. The heralds trumpet the arrival of House Targaryen, and all of Ashford Meadows snaps to attention—including Egg, who gets one peep at those banners and bolts back to camp. This frees Dunk to ingratiate himself indelicately with the ruling house: Baelor (Bertie Carvel), King Daeron's Hand and eldest son (see stray observations); Maekar (Sam Spruell), afforded lesser heraldry compared to his brother; and Prince Aerion (Finn Bennett), Maekar's haughty son, who clocks Dunk as a servant on sight. “I have the honor of being a knight!” Dunk insists, to which Aerion sneers, “Knighthood has fallen on sad days.”  After a stablehand takes a princely hoof to the face, Dunk leads Aerion's horse to the stables, where he encounters two Kingsguard: Ser Roland Crakehall (Wade Briggs) and Ser Donnel Of Duskendale (Bill Ward). 

Courteous and steeped in classism, this meeting charts the distance between hedge knight and royal knight. Donnel mocks Roland's grief about shitting in the stables (“a man of such birth has never deigned to disturb his arsehole with hay”), prompting a sympathetic retort from Dunk. Here, Donnel regards Dunk and claims humbler beginnings than his sworn brother—that he, like Dunk, is from “nowhere,” that his family has been crabbers since days immemorial. “May I ask, ser, how the son of a crabber came to have the honor of being a knight in the Kingsguard?” “Same way we became crabbers.” 

Whatever Donnel meant by that—Egg clarifies matters later, which I'll get to—it sparks ambition within Dunk. Soon, he's skulking the service corridors of House Ashford, overhearing the Hand, Maekar, Lord Ashford (Paul Hunter), and Plummer, the master of games (Tom Vaughan-Lawlor), discuss the absence of Maekar's other two sons, Daeron and Aegon. Before he's caught sneaking, Lady Gwin Ashford (Cara Harris) creeps up behind him and casually suggests the missing princes could be dead—and that wars have started over less. She's playing with Dunk, another example of how the highborn treat smallfolk. She's perhaps even flirting with him in her own cracked way. (“You're big and stupid!” she says with a flick of her hand, causing Dunk to flinch.) But there's no time for love: Dunk's busted by Maekar, forcing the smelly hedge knight to plead his case before the Hand Of The King.

It's a fun scene. Plummer guides Dunk through his first, disastrous stab at politics with stiff nods and grimaces, and the dynamics of House Targaryen at this point in Westerosi history become clearer. Baelor is kind and patient, even if Dunk tests him with his fumbling entreaties; Maekar, all dragon fire, barely tolerates it. Baelor also recalls Arlan, which Maekar scoffs at. And so, after some mild dickering over Ser Arlan's joust with Baelor (four lances broke that day, not seven), Baelor grants Dunk his wish to join the lists on one condition: He must find a sigil of his own.

So, what will be the standard of Ser Duncan The Tall? Egg, back from camp, contributes an idea as Dunk brainstorms before Tanselle (Tanzyn Crawford), the puppeteer from Dorne who makes ser weak at the knees: a grand elm tree over a field of sunset hues and a shooting star soaring overhead. Will she paint this sigil for the hedge knight? Does she share Dunk's feelings as she nearly shares his height? The first answer comes quickly—she takes the shield with his thanks—while the second will have to stew awhile longer in sweet Dunk's head. There's plenty to distract him from love's subtle call: Lyonel Baratheon (Daniel Ings) bids him join a tug of war against House Tyrell (among others), and soon, the first jousts begin. 

It's here where new facets of Egg begin to show. For starters, the joust brings out his inner flame: he roars himself hoarse and later swings a stick at invisible Blackfyre rebels. Where does this behavior come from? Certainly not the same part of King's Landing that Dunk's been to. And Dunk, meanwhile, gets a rude awakening about the caliber of knight he's up against: One rider (Ross Anderson's Ser Hardyng) is unhorsed at full gallop only to haul himself and his shield back into the saddle without his steed breaking stride. Strength alone may get him noticed, but it won't win Dunk Ashford Meadow. Then, there's an unbidden image: his dead ser lying in his muddy grave, a harsh contrast to the pomp he witnesses at the joust. 

Back to Egg, who earlier showcased his knowledge about royal houses, including Duskendale. What he has to share reframes Ser Donnel in Dunk's estimation. This supposed “son of a crabber” is actually the heir to a maritime empire; his humility might be genuine, but it's not the same as Dunk's. Dunk doesn't fully understand the significance of Egg's savvy royal trivia yet—the boy seems to be more than he lets on, but he's got too many things rattling around in his skull—but he picks up that he and Ser Donnel are definitely not of the same stock. So what kind of knight will Ser Duncan be? 

The better question is: What kind of knight does Duncan want to be? A peacocking Kingsguard, or a vainglorious braggart who chomps the heads off fish before running full tilt? Is that what a knight is? If so, what does that make Ser Arlan, who won no jousts, owned no lands, and died by the side of a muddy road? The answer is the kind of knight Dunk admires, which speaks to his heart. It's why the blacksmith Steely Pate (Youssef Kerkour) takes pity on him, why Baelor grants his greatest wish despite barely knowing him. The deep regret Dunk shows as he sells his horse, Sweetfoot, to afford proper armor says it all. Coming just moments after a rowdy, muddy, profanity-laden match between houses, the scene underscores what A Knight Of The Seven Kingdoms is doing so well. Between raunchy knight-bro excess and a keenly felt heart, the series strikes a remarkable balance.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista are bad at being Bad Boys in The Wrecking Crew","https://www.avclub.com/the-wrecking-crew-review","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:01:01 GMT","

The combined testosterone flowing through Jason Momoa and Dave Bautista, the mega-macho leads of The Wrecking Crew, would be enough to fuel the manosphere's masculinity crisis for decades. The pair put their personae and pectorals to work in the action-comedy, playing beefy bickering half-brothers doling out juvenile jokes and hardcore violence in equal measure, though never skewing far enough in either direction to reach the lovable lunkheadedness of the Fast And Furious films, or the virtuosic brutality of a direct-to-video brawler. Instead, The Wrecking Crew casts about between genres like driftwood caught by the tide; for two hours, the script cycles between family trauma drama, goofy Hawaiian noir, meathead romp, and wham-bang slugfest. The indecision at least showcases some consistency, though, in that each approach is equally dissatisfying.

Directed by Ángel Manuel Soto (Blue Beetle) and written by Jonathan Tropper (showrunner of Momoa and Bautista's See), The Wrecking Crew pitches a familiar idea: Two burly boys of opposing temperament have to team up to solve a crime. Hijinks and a mounting body count ensue. But estranged siblings James (Bautista) and Jonny (Momoa), despite how they're introduced, are effectively the same; a buy-one-get-one-free at the Costco meat department. The Wrecking Crew may initially insist that James is a straightlaced Navy SEAL hardass teaching recruits in Hawaii and that Jonny is a drunken biker cop in Oklahoma, but when their dad is murdered, they reunite to figure out what happened and merge into a single stunted Bad Boy living through two bodies.

From the too-simple set-up of the initial crime—their private eye father, whom neither have spoken to in years, sends Jonny a package right before he's run down by a van in the opening scene—The Wrecking Crew tries to stuff its plot with convolutions and runarounds, the kind of cluttering misdirection and ephemera that's usually handwaved away by the cynical atmosphere and hangdog detectives of noir. Here, Jonny and James are the exact same kind of vanilla badass, bumbling through a mystery clear to everyone but them and where each new character slots easily into a predetermined screenplay type. There's the local cop (Stephen Root), who serves as their surrogate Lethal Weapon captain. There's the shady businessman (Claes Bang with a weebish topknot) and family-friend politician (Temuera Morrison), obviously in cahoots. There's the comic-relief tech nerd (Jacob Batalon, who desperately needs to escape this typecasting) and the brothers' wives/girlfriends (Morena Baccarin and Roimata Fox) who exist to alternately nag and fawn over the leads. Henchmen fodder is supplied by the Yakuza and the Hawaiian mob.

If this looks like a bullet list you scribble down the hour before a big presentation about your Momoa-Bautista team-up movie, that's representative of what it feels like watching The Wrecking Crew. The duo muscle through swaths of story with a tone that is clear only in its aggression, interlacing crime cliches and left-field emotional melodrama with dick-swinging stupidity—a cheese-grater moment out of Evil Dead Rise and a teeth-scattering pseudo-curbstomp are matched by wit like “Fuck you, fat Jackie Chan!” and “Oh look, it's fat John Cena.” It's The Nice Guys if the script got a Spike TV rewrite and the leads had been replaced by two big bags of gas station beef jerky. The butt-rock score from Bobby Krlic is, at least, fitting.

Perhaps the most disappointing part of The Wrecking Crew is that both Momoa and Bautista have worked with and against type to charm before. Tropper's script gestures towards self-awareness, with every other side character commenting on the leads' undeniable dumb-jock aura. And yet, though they have every opportunity to rebel against this—and Bautista, at least, is ostensibly playing a by-the-book military man—they fall into the stereotype without over-embracing it. They're playing stupid, but not stupid enough, and a too-similar kind of stupid to generate any kind of driving friction between them. Their bickering is toothless, and their approaches to investigating Hawaii's underworld mostly involve highly telegraphed punching. Soto's set pieces are similarly underwhelming—scenes of storming a compound and outrunning a helicopter are as derivative as yet another fight scene mimicking the Oldboy hallway.

The Hawaiian setting, dueling-brother premise, and egoless charisma of its leads (both Bautista and Momoa made their superhero characters into enjoyably dense scene-stealers, not to mention their abilities to get silly in kids' movies) offered plenty to set The Wrecking Crew apart, both from its brainless-action contemporaries and its straight-to-streaming star vehicle peers. But outside of some local slang and sandy shooting locations, there's little that's memorable—even the rancid vibes and intangible action aren't especially notable for a two-hander like this. It's rarely the case where a film would actually be improved by leaning into its worst impulses, but if The Wrecking Crew had gone full tank-top cinema, it might have at least felt like its makers were having fun making a mess.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Kirsten Dunst Showers Her Husband with Support After Oscars Snub","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/kirsten-dunst-jesse-plemons-support/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 02:44:58 GMT","

When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences unveiled its Oscar nominations this year, Jesse Plemons was missing from the Best Actor lineup. For many film fans, the omission came as a surprise. For Kirsten Dunst, it prompted a public show of support.

Dunst responded to the snub by amplifying praise for her husband's performance in “Bugonia,” the latest film from director Yorgos Lanthimos. The actor had earned awards season buzz and multiple nominations elsewhere for his role, making his absence from the Oscars conversation a notable talking point.

The moment also reignited a familiar debate around awards recognition and what gets left out when the final ballot is announced.

Dunst, an Oscar nominee herself, used Instagram Stories to highlight reactions that questioned the Academy's decision. She reposted a message from “Bugonia” cast member Stavros Halkias, who jokingly called out Oscar voters for overlooking Plemons' work. She also shared a clip from a podcast episode in which host Ev Durán described Plemons' performance as one of the strongest of the year and worthy of serious awards consideration.

Earlier this month, before the nominations were announced, Dunst had already signaled her admiration. On Jan. 9, she posted a still from “Bugonia” on Instagram with a brief caption praising the performance. The post resurfaced after the nominations dropped, underscoring that her support was not reactionary but consistent.

Dunst has not issued a formal statement, but her social media activity made her stance clear. She believes the performance deserved recognition.

Directed by Lanthimos, “Bugonia” blends dark comedy with sci-fi elements and centers on a man who becomes convinced that a powerful CEO is not human. Plemons plays the obsessive and unraveling lead, delivering a performance many critics described as unsettling and darkly funny.

The film earned Oscar nominations in other major categories, including Best Picture and Best Actress for Emma Stone. The Best Actor category, however, went to Timothée Chalamet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ethan Hawke, Michael B. Jordan, and Wagner Moura.

Plemons' omission stood out because he received nominations from both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Those precursors often overlap with the Oscars, though they do not guarantee a nomination.

Dunst and Plemons share a long professional and personal history in Hollywood. The couple married in 2022 and previously earned Oscar nominations in the same year for “The Power of the Dog.” Their careers have often run in parallel, making this moment especially personal.

Awards season always brings its share of surprises, snubs, and spirited debate. This year, Dunst added her voice to the conversation, not through speeches or interviews, but by publicly standing behind her partner's work.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Zach Braff Shares Emotional Update on Late Co-Star's Tribute in ‘Scrubs' Revival","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/zach-braff-sam-lloyd-scrubs-revival/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:15:39 GMT","

Zach Braff is opening up about how the upcoming “Scrubs” revival is honoring the late Sam Lloyd while bringing fans back to Sacred Heart Hospital.

In a new interview with Esquire, Braff revealed that the ABC revival includes a meaningful tribute to Lloyd, who portrayed Ted Buckland for nine seasons on the original series.

“There's a new bar that we all go to, and we named it Lloyd's Tavern,” Braff shared. “That was the production designer's idea, which I thought was beautiful. So there's a nod to Sam.”

Braff added that the cast is also planning a dedicated tribute episode.

“We love Sam; we miss him. It's hard to do this show without him,” he said. “And our plan is to most definitely have an episode that is a tribute to him.”

Braff explained that it's still unclear whether that tribute will appear in the first revival season, which consists of nine episodes, or be saved for a potential second season.

Lloyd died in 2020 due to complications from lung cancer. He was 56.

Braff returns as J.D., alongside Donald Faison as Dr. Christopher Turk and Sarah Chalke as Dr. Elliot Reid as series regulars. Judy Reyes reprises her role as Nurse Carla Espinosa, while John C. McGinley returns as Dr. Perry Cox in a recurring capacity.

Robert Maschio appears as The Todd, and Phill Lewis guest stars as Hooch.

Two longtime fan favorites — Neil Flynn's Janitor and Ken Jenkins' Dr. Bob Kelso — are not currently confirmed for the revival's initial nine-episode order. Braff explained that their absence is tied to story logistics and timing, not interest.

“The true answer is, if we're blessed to have a second season, absolutely,” Braff said. “They're both interested in doing it. But do we have the bandwidth in the first nine episodes to get to it all and service a story that would be worthy of Ken and Neil?”

The ABC revival also introduces a new group of Sacred Heart staff and interns.

Vanessa Bayer joins as Sibby, who runs a wellness program for hospital faculty and staff, while Joel Kim Booster plays attending physician Dr. Eric Park.

The incoming intern class includes Ava Bunn as Serena, Jacob Dudman as Asher, David Gridley as Blake, Layla Mohammadi as Amara, and Amanda Morrow as Dashana. Additional recurring roles include Michael James Scott as co-charge nurse, Francois Dubois, and X Mayo as co-charge nurse, Pippa Raymond.

Series creator Bill Lawrence previously told TVLine the revival aims to reflect both the humor of the original series and the realities of modern medicine.

“If I saw two guys in their late 40s or early 50s doing ‘World's Most Giant Doctor,' I'd go, ‘What the (expletive) is going on?'” Lawrence said. “To see what that friendship looks like at their age, and take a comedic look at what medicine has become since those kids started out as interns — that's the goal.”

ABC's official logline reads: “J.D. and Turk scrub in together for the first time in a long time. Medicine has changed, interns have changed, but their bromance has stood the test of time.”

“Scrubs” premieres Wednesday, February 25, at 8 p.m. ET with back-to-back episodes on ABC. Episodes stream next day on Hulu.

Can't wait!! Love this show.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Laura Vandervoort Wows Fans With Bold New Look: See Her Transformation","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/makeover-hair-laura-vandervoort-202/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 01:17:57 GMT","

Fans are swooning over the way longtime Hallmark actress Laura Vandervoort has started 2026 — with a fresh outlook, bold energy, and a hairdo to match. 

The “Melt My Heart This Christmas” star surprised fans with several new social media photos revealing that her signature long blonde hair is now a rich brunette. 

Although Vandervoort posted a couple of images earlier in the month with her dark hair, it wasn't quite clear if the new look was for a movie role. On January 14, however, she posted a cheeky video of herself in the car, looking deadly serious as Blur's “Song 2” played in the background. 

As the band sang the lyrics — “It's not my problem / Woo-hoo / It's not my problem” — Vandervoort slipped on a pair of shades and flipped off the camera. 

In the caption, she wrote, “Mantra for 2026… 🖕🏻🫶🏻” and added that her hair color was “By The Amazing” celebrity hairstylist Annastasia Cucullo, who commented, “Omg the hair looks great!! 😍”

In another post on January 21, Vandervoort shared a photo of her muscular back during a workout, with her hair up in a bun under a baseball cap. She captioned the photo, “Blondes may have ‘more' fun but brunette's get [expletive] done 😏”

Fans flooded Vandervoort's posts with heart and fire emoji, as well as praise for her new look. One wrote, “The hair is 🔥😍!!!!”

Someone else called the “Supergirl” and “Smallville” alum a “SuperBrunette” and another exclaimed, “saaaxyyye! 🤘💋❤️✨️”

Vandervoort tested out a light brunette look in November, posting a brief video of her with color that she told was a “temporary change” that she was considering making “permanent.”

Vandervoort unveiled her new look after posting a series of photos in December of her 2025 wedding to her longtime beau, Adam Coates. The couple, who met on a dating app, married in September, two years after getting engaged, per People. 

The ceremony and reception, held at the Langdon Hall Country House, Hotel & Spa in Ontario, Canada, was held three months after the couple were legally married in a “little backyard celebration” with their family and dogs, they told the outlet. 

“Miracle in Bethlehem, PA” star captioned one of her wedding posts, “We didn't do a traditional ceremony. Adam's very close friend Gerry Price was our officiant and spoke from the heart, our big sisters (Sarah & Sarah) gave their speeches/words of advice before our vows. Lots of laughter and tears.”



Really?!?!? Flipping us off?? I'm done watching her!

I'm not a prude but I'm with you Melodee. Totally unnecessary! Don't think I want to watch her anymore either!

Why on earth would Hallmark post a video of one of their “stars” flipping people off??!! Whoever is running the social media for Hallmark should actually look at their posts — and watch the videos they embed — before posting. What a disappointment!

I totally agree with the others. Totally unbecoming of her. Done also watching her. Shame on
Hallmark for posting. She always had a sour look on her face with her acting anyway.

To all the previous posters, judgy much?
I don't think she was personally flipping any of you off, yes maybe not the best choice of picture to add to the article, but to not watch an actor because of of this one gesture.  Wow!
Not that it would matter to any of you, but I did read an article recently where she is having major fertility issues and maybe that was a gesture in response to what she is going through.  Who knows?

In 2014, David Wain introduced a new cinematic technique that was arguably the biggest contribution to the art of moving images since the advent of Technicolor. With the release of his New York-set rom-com “They Came Together,” he proved that a city doesn't just have to serve as a film's setting — it can actually be a character in the movie. Breaking down such a layered metaphysical concept with the relatively few words left in this review would be a fool's errand, but suffice it to say that all of the math miraculously checks out. 

 










Wain has spent the subsequent decade coasting off the success of that breakthrough, but it's hard to blame him — nobody can be expected to stumble upon that level of innovation twice in a lifetime. But his latest masterpiece, “Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass,” proves that his cinematic gambit applies to more than just the Big Apple. The conceptual genius has found a way to turn Los Angeles into a movie character too!

“Gail Daughtry” is a love letter to Los Angeles, just without any of the city's good parts. It's a tribute to chain restaurants and star maps and grifters who ply Old Hollywood jargon at the unsuspecting tourists who don't realize they're missing all the great culture that the city currently has to offer by pursuing what they erroneously believe it once had. It's all shown through the eyes of Gail (Zoey Deutsch), a clueless midwesterner who shows up in the City of Angels for a hairstyling convention only to find herself questioning everything she once took for granted after a few chance encounters with a CAA assistant, a disgraced paparazzo, and a former “Mad Men” star with a lot of time on his hands.

But that's getting ahead of ourselves. When we meet Gail, she's perfectly content with her small Kansas life. She's very excited about marrying her fiancé in two weeks, so when the topic of a celebrity “hall pass” comes up, she doesn't even know how to answer the question. Her fiancé is quick to reveal that he would use his sex pass on Tilda Swinton (before changing his answer to Jennifer Aniston), but she can't even come up with a single celebrity fantasy when she's pressured about it. It's he who has to remind her that she once masturbated to Jon Hamm when she was 16 years old, so she reluctantly decides to use Don Draper as her pass — still assuming that this is just a harmless thought exercise.

 










But when her fiancé does fuck the real Jennifer Aniston — after meeting her in a hilarious context that will remain unspoiled here — Gail's life is thrust into crisis. With less than two weeks before she's set to be married, she accompanies her gay best friend Otto (Miles Gutierrez-Riley) to L.A. for a weekend to take her mind off things. Naturally, they determine that the only way to avenge the injustice is for her to have sex with Jon Hamm to even the score. The two clueless tourists embark on a mission to find him that blatantly mirrors “The Wizard of Oz,” picking up a coterie of misfits along the way who help them out of the kindness of their hearts (and the occasional ulterior motive).

The film overflows with celebrity cameos of both the explainable and absurd variety, but it's all in service of a greater vision. From a Second Amendment-loving Weird Al Yankovic to yet another “Shark Tank” investor trying their hand at big screen acting, “Gail Daughtry” is a film that's best watched with a face sheet. All of them are funny, but nobody tops John Slattery, who gives a hysterically self-deprecating performance as a fictional version of his post-“Mad Men” self. Unemployed and brimming with confidence that crumbles at the slightest provocation, the self-proclaimed “Slat Man” is desperate to get back into Hamm's good graces. He sells Gail on his proximity to his former co-star, only for her to find out that their current relationship consists of little more than unanswered text messages. He becomes one more addition to their traveling party, and he remains the straw that stirs the drink for the remainder of the film. 

 










The plot takes quite a few wild digressions on our heroes' way to meeting Hamm (who also gives an excellent performance as himself). But anyone familiar with Wain and Marino's work should know that all of this plot summary is worth little more than the digital paper that it's not actually printed on. Much like “Wet Hot American Summer” and “They Came Together,” “Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass” is best understood as a basket of jokes and non sequiturs that simply need some kind of framework to keep things semi-coherent. That's a compliment, of course, as these are very, very funny jokes. Wain and Marino have turned the dumb punchline into a precise science, alternating between wholesomeness and vulgarity with such mastery that you'll barely have time to catch your breath before you're ready to start laughing again. 

The old cliche that writing about a great film is like dancing about architecture has some truth to it, and this writer is well aware that nothing he could put down into words will be as funny as watching the damn thing. But 25 years after “Wet Hot American Summer” premiered at Sundance, it's a relief to know that Wain and Marino are still at the absolute top of their game. Here's hoping we get 25 more years of movies from them — by then, the world might be ready for “Gail Daughtry: Ten Years Later.”

 










“Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

[Editor's note: This interview contains spoilers for “The Housemaid.”]

One of the most delightful surprises of the holiday movie season last year was director Paul Feig‘s “The Housemaid,” a thrill ride based on the novel by Freida McFadden about a housekeeper (Sydney Sweeney) who gets more than she bargained for when she takes a live-in job with a dysfunctional wealthy couple (Amanda Seyfried and Brandon Sklenar). Feig has long expressed admiration for Alfred Hitchcock's work, and in screenwriter Rebecca Sonnenshine's adaptation of McFadden's bestseller, he discovered the perfect vehicle to, as Hitchcock was fond of saying, “play the audience like a piano.”

“When I first read the script and then the book, I thought, this is so much fun to really make an audience root for everything they should not be rooting for in the first hour and get them really passionate about it,” Feig told IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast. “And then have the fun of their anger in the second half for being so hoodwinked, and the satisfaction that comes with the retribution.” The fact that “The Housemaid” essentially reboots halfway through, revealing to the audience that the husband we thought was a nice guy is actually the antagonist, is instrumental in its box office success, as many viewers are returning again and again to the movie to experience how it plays differently once one is aware of the twists.    

 










“Obviously every filmmaker hopes to make things that you'll want to watch a few times, but knowing this has that twist, it's really fun to know that we're seeding things in the first half that, if you watch this a second time, you'll interpret in a completely different way,” Feig said, adding that the script's potential for manipulating the audience was a large part of its appeal. “It's funny, when I was in film school at USC back in the 1980s, all the serious film students were very against manipulating the audience. They were down on Spielberg because he was ‘manipulative.' And I was like, ‘Guys, that's what movies are. All we do is manipulate people!”

Indeed, one of the many pleasures of “The Housemaid” is the way Feig and his department heads slyly direct the audience's eye to miss the clues that are often hiding in plain sight; from the use of color and the selection of props and artwork to the subtle performance choices by Sklenar and Seyfried — whose work has to be convincing in two entirely different contexts — every decision in “The Housemaid” is geared toward deceiving the audience without cheating, so that when they discover they've been manipulated they feel giddy and not offended. Figuring out how and when to parcel out the information was a painstaking process.

 










“I am very slavish to test screenings,” Feig said, noting that he tends to screen his films for audiences as early in the process as possible so he can gauge what's landing and what isn't. “I have 10 weeks [to put together] a director's cut where no one can mess with me. I'll do my first recruited screening at about five weeks, just to say, okay, I think this is working, it's all together now, but I don't want to fall in love with anything.” Feig not only records audio of the crowd reactions but also video via night vision goggles. “I find night vision to be incredibly helpful because you can see if people are watching passively versus when they start sitting forward and looking around at each other.”

The pacing of “The Housemaid” was particularly tricky, because it required a certain amount of patience from both the audience and the filmmakers in the first half — if the groundwork wasn't carefully laid, the shocks and suspense of the second half wouldn't work. “I always say I want to shoot my movie out of a cannon,” Feig said. “But you can't shoot this movie out of a cannon. We tried [with an opening flash-forward to the crime scene], but we found with an audience that it took the fun out of them discovering this world.” Feig looked to “Once Upon a Time in the West” and its meticulously calibrated structure.

 










“That movie's brilliant in its slow doling out of information,” Feig said. “It's the best way to do a movie where you're trying to pull people along.” If Leone was an inspiration in terms of pace, Hitchcock remained the big influence in terms of tone. “What I love about Hitchcock is he always lets you have fun. I've watched so many thrillers in my life that take themselves so seriously that I don't feel there's room for fun. I'm very religious about the thriller genre, but how can I bring [laughs] into that genre and get the double response out of the audience? We're treating the story seriously, but there's something wonderfully absurd about this dangerous situation.”

In spite of Feig's reverence for Hitchcock, he says he doesn't follow the master of suspense's model of rigid planning. “ I leave myself very open,” Feig said. “When I started my career, I obviously loved Hitchcock, and he storyboarded every shot, didn't shoot any more frames than he needed so he could control the edit. I tried to do that, but you get to the set, and people have ideas, and you're slapping their ideas down because it takes you off your plan. And I realized early on that I was cutting off all the creativity from my cast.”

Feig changed his approach when he worked on the TV show “Arrested Development” and was forced to fly by the seat of his pants. “They would get you the scripts so late,” he said. “Sometimes you'd just show up in the morning and get the scenes. But it was the greatest thing because it got me out of my head to work with the actors.” Feig typically comes in with an idea of how to shoot the scene, but leaves himself open to new possibilities suggested by the performances. “I've got all these versions of the line or scene, so that when I get to the editing room, I can figure out, ‘Were they right or was I right?' I want that input from the cast.”

 










Input from his collaborators also led Feig to one of the best needle drops in “The Housemaid,” for Amanda Seyfried's dance of liberation to Kelly Clarkson's “Since You Been Gone.” Initially, Feig used Bob Seger's “Old Time Rock and Roll” as an homage to “Risky Business,” but when he screened the film, the cue didn't work. “I realized, okay, I'm an old guy,” Feig said. “No one in the young audience gives a shit about that.” Feig polled the women who worked on the movie to ask what they would put on to celebrate breaking up with somebody or getting out of a toxic relationship, and the Kelly Clarkson song won in a landslide.

Relying not only on test audiences but his cast and crew is central to Feig's filmmaking philosophy. “I'm very democratic when it comes to this stuff, because I'm making commercial movies,” he said. “I have things I'll fight for, but at the end of the day, if the audience doesn't respond to it, or if women don't respond to it — because I make very female-centric movies — I'm not going to be the guy saying, ‘You're wrong.' I want to be in service to them so they have the best experience they can.”

As the author Salman Rushdie remembers it, the first clear thought that came to him after the brutal 2022 knife attack that almost took his life was simple: “We need to document this.” Fortunately, Rushdie's beloved wife, fellow writer and multidisciplinary artist Rachel Eliza Griffiths, was on hand with  a fierce dedication and a new camera. (Griffiths remembers her take on the idea to document the after-effects of the attack with a little more bite: “We said that we want everyone to see.”)

And see we do in Alex Gibney's “Knife: The Attempted Murder of Salman Rushdie,” which combines Griffiths' footage (she is credited as one of the film‘s cinematographers; she is also its true heart) with archival material, new animations, tons of movie clips, and Rushdie's own work (mostly from his 2024 memoir “Knife: Mediations After an Attempted Murder,” but with plenty from his seminal “The Satanic Verses”). Gibney's film doesn't ease into it at all, opening with a clip of the attack, squarely dropping us into the horror of it. Rushdie provides voiceover throughout, and there is an immediate impact from hearing a man narrate his own attempted murder, and with such a calm (and often darkly humorous) demeanor.

Griffiths faithfully totes her camera to the Pennsylvania hospital Rushdie is airlifted to after the attack at the Chautauqua Institution in upstate New York. When she and Rushdie are not fearlessly documenting the staggering scope of Rushdie's injuries (and, yes, that includes numerous shots of his right eye, which was hit during the attack and which he no longer has use of), Griffiths is hunkering down for solo interviews that take us straight into the heart of their love and her profound grief.

But to understand why Rushdie was stabbed that day, we must also understand a story that unfolded more than three decades ago, and then even further back, to his own childhood in India. Gibney unspools an ambitious, three-pronged timeline that mixes and mingles throughout the documentary, including the immediate aftermath of the attack, Rushdie's youth and early years of writing, and what happened in 1988 after the publication of his “Satanic Verses.” 

While many will remember that Rushdie was the subject of a fatwa from the Ayatollah Khomeini because of the contents of the book, which some Muslims believed was blasphemous against Islam and the prophet Muhammad in particular, Gibney's film powerfully catapults us back to 1988 and 1989 and the extreme fervor around the call to murder the author. Archival footage illustrates, in pulse-pounding and nerve-rattling fashion, just how widespread calls for Rushdie's murder were. Not just in Iran, but as far as Belgium, his own adopted hometown of London, even New York City. Bookstores that carried it were firebombed. People associated with its publication were beaten, some even killed. Rushdie went into hiding and remained under police supervision for nearly a decade.

The man who attacked Rushdie wasn't even born when the fatwa was put into effect, and while Rushdie mostly doesn't want to talk about the assailant, referring to him simply as “the A,” the doc eventually works up to a series of imagined conversations between the men. Such convos also appear in Rushdie's memoir, and have the bizarre effect of making us feel a distance from our subject and narrator when they appear in the latter half of the film. The reality of the situation is much more interesting, much more personal.
 










Rushdie himself did not know the full extent of his injuries for many weeks after, though we're confronted with them throughout “Knife” — the long line of staples up his stomach, the severed nerves of his left hand, the massive gash along his throat, and of course his ruined eye — witnesses to this document, being forced to truly see what was done to this man in the name of God and religion and faith and conviction. The revulsion that we feel toward this attack is, of course, baked right into the film, but Gibney often dances away from making it feel like a symptom of something wider. (That “the A” was radicalized partially by YouTube videos is the sort of thing deserving of its own film.)

Both the back-and-forth structure of Gibney's film and Rushdie's own words eventually bring us around to the idea that it's a chronicle of the many times Rushdie has had to remake himself (though we venture to say that recovering from the attack is a hell of a lot harder than reinventing himself by cameoing in “Bridget Jones's Diary” in 2001, just as he was emerging from his exile). Each time, something new is found, but something else is certainly lost. 

The circular nature of the film and Rushdie's own life is further cemented in its final moments, as Rushdie and Griffiths return to the site of his attack more than a year after it occurred. That alone would be upsetting, but Rushdie, forever trying to understand the story of his own life, then walks his wife and her camera through all the moments before, during, and after the attack. Extended footage of the attack from all sorts of angles follows, much of it slowed down, horrifying, still hard to believe. At one point, the knife itself appears. At many others, we see Rushdie's face and hands. He's reaching, terrified, blood-soaked, but still alive. And you can't look away.

An addict's rock bottom may be the most dramatic part of their journey, but it's bookended by a series of small decisions, both on the way down and back up. These are harder to dramatize than violent crashouts and tearful repentance, but writer/director Adam Meeks accepts the challenge in his debut feature, “Union County.” Expanding on his 2020 short film of the same name, Meeks makes a quiet but risky choice by crafting a narrative where the tension revolves around a character not doing something.

Produced in cooperation with a court-mandated drug rehabilitation program in Union County, Ohio, and featuring personal stories from people who have passed through its doors, “Union County” doesn't completely bypass addiction-drama clichés. But its detailed, humanistic approach successfully creates a realistic world that supports its muted storytelling. In “Union County,” characters relapse and crash cars and strain relationships with loved ones to their breaking points. But these events unfold with minimal theatrics — the film's most shocking development takes place entirely off-screen — as Meeks chooses instead to focus on their aftermath, bathing it in the cool blue light of early morning.

Stick-and-poke tattoos tell their own tales, as do cigarettes dangling from shaky hands at Narcotics Anonymous meetings. A bedroom in a sober living house has a collection of paper ephemera taped to one wall, each revealing the personality of someone who, however briefly, called this room home. Meeks and cinematographer Stefan Weinberger pay special attention to the region's natural beauty, repeating a single shot of a car bobbing over a two-lane highway amid vibrant green hills. The shot takes on a new emotional resonance when it recurs late in the film, showcasing Meeks' ability to convey profound meaning through visuals alone. 

 










Star Will Poulter is also understated, spending much of the film listening as nonprofessional actors tell real stories about their experiences with substance abuse in Union County. It's not unusual for young men from this part of the world to be reserved, but Cody Parsons (Poulter) is especially so: At support-group meetings, he declines to share much beyond his first name, and his conversations with his brother Jack (Noah Centineo) are heavy with unspoken subtext. Cody and Jack's sister Katrina (Emily Meade) is barely mentioned until Cody relapses and breaks into her house to pass out on her couch. 

As the story unfolds and his recovery continues, Cody begins to reveal things about himself, piece by hesitant piece. This is encouraged by program counselor Annette (Annette Deao, playing herself) and by Anna (Elise Kibler), a new friend and potential love interest for Cody, who's also in long-term recovery. Through them, we learn that Cody blames himself for both his and his brother's substance issues — he was the one who introduced Jack to heroin, after all — and that he believes he doesn't really deserve redemption as a result. 

Poulter's slow-burning performance benefits the film in a couple of ways. First, it prevents the fictional storyline in “Union County” from overwhelming its compelling first-person narratives, which unfold in a series of monologues filmed in static long shots. This is consistent with the film's community-based values and helps ground it in lived reality. It also increases the impact when Cody's turbulent emotions break through his stoic exterior, tears overflowing, his face turning red as he struggles to face himself without the comfort of a needle in his arm. 

 










Conversely, one area where Meeks' restraint doesn't pay off is in his assiduous avoidance of the political context around Cody, Jack, and the program. Located just northwest of Columbus, Union County (population 69,356) voted for Donald Trump by 32 points in 2024. To be clear, this does not disqualify the people in the film — real or fictional — from help. But despite what are clearly good intentions on the part of Meeks and his crew, they seem largely unaware of, or disinterested in, the conservative narratives embedded in “Union County” that merit addressing.

The influence of evangelical culture hovers over every passionate personal testimony, for example, and while court officials are kind as they mete out punishments and reward good behavior, they're still part of a carceral system that preaches individual solutions to societal problems. Yes, addiction crosses political, class, and ethnic lines. But who we consider criminals and why, and how we treat them as a result, are issues impossible to remove from their political context, as Meeks attempts to do here.

“Union County” is a docudrama, not a documentary, and Meeks is under no obligation to show us the larger mechanisms at work around his characters. But “Union County” believes that the type of program highlighted in this film is an unequivocal good, while making minimal inquiries into its philosophy and methods. Maybe it is all virtuous and necessary and the best thing for people who are trying to break the hold that substances have over their lives. The nonprofessionals in the film certainly believe so. But without larger context, it's difficult for the nonprofessionals in the audience to know for sure. Telling the truth means revealing the full picture about a place and the people who live there. And in this way, “Union County” gets lost in the details. 

 










“Union County” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

A schematic but sensitive prison drama about a maximum-security lifer who begins to care for an older inmate suffering from early-onset dementia, Petra Volpe's “Frank & Louis” soberly interrogates what it really means to “serve time.” Time may be the currency with which people are required to pay for their crimes, but as this gloomy two-hander confronts at every turn, the purgatorial nature of prison doesn't excuse convicts from being subjected to its effects. 

Change is constant, even within the walls of an institution where people are rigidly defined by what they did before they got there. Bodies age. Minds harden or expand. New memories are made, coloring the old ones in a different light. Some felons become entirely different people, while others might lose sight of who they used to be altogether. Our punitive carceral system might prefer to pretend that criminals remain as static as the sentences that define them as such, but Volpe's film — dour and dull gray as it tends to be — palpably recognizes how even the smallest display of personal growth might seem like a genuine spectacle in a place where nothing ever changes, just as the slightest display of compassion might resonate with explosive force in a place that's unforgiving by design.

A story about the weight of memory as it's shared between a pair of forgotten men, “Frank & Louis” never steps foot outside of the upstate New York penitentiary where the younger of its title characters is transferred at the start of the film. The first thing we sense about Frank (a crushed and compellingly recessive Kingsley Ben-Adir) is that he's used to life in a loose-fitting jumpsuit. Long and fit but dead behind the eyes in a way that makes him look much older than he is, Frank has been in prison for at least half of his time on this earth, though the only specific information we get is that it's been 17 years since he suffered through a stint in solitary confinement. He's cooled down since then. Maybe he's found a lasting measure of peace in the toy motorcycles he carves out of soap in his cell. Or maybe he's just given up.

It's hard to glean much of anything from his non-reaction to the news that he's up for parole, but Frank agrees to join the Yellow Coats — the prison's in-house memory care program — in a bid to make him seem worthier of release. After just a few minutes with Louis (a fully committed Rob Nelson, never betraying his character's mental condition for the sake of a more emotionally digestible film) it feels like the gig might blow up in Frank's face, as he seems more liable to kill the old-timer than to help him tie his shoes. Louis is such a tough customer that Frank would sooner be assigned to the unit's biggest skinhead — at least that guy is too far gone to hate people anymore. Maybe it's just the fact that he looks like an oversized baby, but the towering bigot radiates a pitiable innocence that's only belied by his unavoidable swastika tattoo; the ink that identified him as a Nazi has outlasted the ideology that made him one in the first place. 

Louis is a different story. Although a pale shadow of the vicious gang leader that he used to be, 60-year-old Louis still brims with the rage and ferocity that once made him king of the prison yard; all of the same emotions are still kicking around inside him, but they've been completely unmoored from their context, and sharpened by the shiv-like volatility of dementia. A roaring lion one minute and a helpless lamb the next, Louis is so clearly at the mercy of his disease that Frank struggles to imagine that his new friend could be the same man who made enemies or underlings out of all the other inmates. When another convict pressures Frank to let him beat the shit out of Louis in his cell (revenge for a previous slight of some kind), Frank agrees with an indifferent shrug — not only is it not any of his business, it doesn't seem to be Louis' business, either. At least not the Louis that he knows. 

 










Ben-Adir and Morgan bring a raw and layered energy to the dynamic between their characters, and while the relationship between them thaws and complicates along a very predictable trajectory, progressive brain afflictions don't exactly lend themselves to novelty or surprises. That Volpe and Esther Bernstorff's script is overly diagrammed on a scene-by-scene basis is more difficult to ignore (when Frank and Louis sit down to play chess, you know it's only a matter of time before the latter swipes all of the pieces off the board in a fit of rage), but the actors are too locked into the circumstances at hand for the movie to ever meaningfully diminish the urgency of the questions it's trying to ask. It also helps that “Frank & Louis” tends to unfold in a minor key, and that even its most nakedly sentimental plot points — such as Louis' persistent belief that he's got a lunch date scheduled with his daughter — are undergirded by the kind of hard truths that leave you with a fuller appreciation for the lives these characters have led.  

Still, “Frank & Louis” is at its best during the subtler moments when its minute human gestures contrast against the art house stiffness of Volpe's compositions (the Swiss “Late Shift” director brings a small but welcome dose of European formalism to her English-language debut), and the glassy abstractions of Oliver Coates' score. Watching Frank learn to touch Louis without either of them flinching is a movie unto itself (Rene Perez Joglar is excellent as a Yellow Coats veteran with hypersensitivities of his own), and it's heart-rending to watch these two men forge new sense memories between them in the short time they have together. 

 










The more that Louis forgets about his past, the more that Frank comes to reconsider about his own, and while Frank's backstory isn't quite as textured as Volpe needed for her movie to deliver a lastingly powerful gut-punch, it crucially resists the temptation to answer its most pressing questions. What's the point of punishment if someone doesn't understand what they're being punished for? Are these the same men they were back when they committed their crimes? It's the Ship of Theseus paradox in human form, its discrete parts held together by a quietly stirring drama that finds dignity in decay, and grace in the memory of men who the rest of society would sooner forget.

“Frank & Louis” premiered at the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. It is currently seeking U.S. distribution.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Kanye West, in Wall Street Journal Ad, Attributes Antisemitism and Erratic Behavior to Brain Damage","https://pitchfork.com/news/kanye-west-in-wall-street-journal-ad-attributes-antisemitism-and-erratic-behavior-to-brain-damage/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:03:32 GMT","

After years of inflammatory social-media posts and antisemitic invective, Kanye West has taken out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal that traces his erratic behavior to his 2002 car crash. West, who now goes by Ye, published the open letter, “To Those I've Hurt,” as he prepares to release a new album, Bully. He claims that various medical issues over the years—which share characteristics with bipolar 1 disorder and autism, he says—could be linked to right frontal lobe damage from the crash that inspired his breakout single “Through the Wire.” He also describes “disconnected moments” that have left him in a state akin to “an out-of-body experience,” adding, “It does not excuse what I did, though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite.”

West blames his turn in mental health on a medical oversight after the crash. At the time, he writes, “the focus was on the visible damage—the fracture, the swelling, and the immediate physical trauma. The deeper injury, the one inside my skull, went unnoticed. Comprehensive scans were not done, neurological exams were limited, and the possibility of a frontal-lobe injury was never raised. It wasn't properly diagnosed until 2023.”

The escalation of West's outbursts of racial hatred began in 2022, when he posted, on the platform then called Twitter, that he wanted to go “death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.” (Adidas and Gap dropped their partnerships with Yeezy; the former company estimated the cost of the termination to be $246 million.) Soon after the platform's acquisition by Elon Musk later that year, West posted an image on X of a swastika inside the Star of David, leading to another temporary ban. Around the same time, he sold swastika T-shirts through a custom website and appeared on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' InfoWars alongside the white supremacist, antisemite, and Holocaust denier Nicholas J. Fuentes. West praised Hitler and the Nazis, echoing rhetoric he has reportedly espoused in private for many years. His use of the swastika, he writes now, was a product of his “fractured state,” as he reached for “the most destructive symbol [he] could find.”

In February 2025, West returned to X and posted a series of comments that were homophobic, racist, misogynistic, and ableist, reiterating his pro-Nazi remarks. That May, he released “Heil Hitler” and the similarly themed “WW3,” songs that were removed by streaming services but widely shared on X. He writes now, “In early 2025, I fell into a four-month long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life. As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn't want to be here anymore.”

In late 2024, two women sued West, one for sexual battery and the other for sexual assault, over alleged incidents earlier in his career. The woman who brought the former lawsuit, West's former assistant Lauren Pisciotta, said he had drugged her at a party thrown by Sean “Diddy” Combs, whom West defended in his February 2025 posts. West denied her claims. In an updated filing, Pisciotta claimed last July that she had gone into hiding after a “swatting” campaign that she believes West initiated. West does not address allegations of sexual misconduct in his letter.

As part of what he describes as a “newfound, much-needed clarity,” he tries to make amends for his undermining of the Black Lives Matter movement—presumably with regard to provocations such as wearing a M.A.G.A. hat and “White Lives Matter” T-shirt and saying that slavery “sounds like a choice.” He writes, “To the black community—which held me down through all of the highs and lows and the darkest of times. The black community is, unquestionably, the foundation of who I am. I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us.”

West concludes, despite conflicting diagnoses, that bipolar disorder is the cause of his behavior. “I have found comfort in Reddit forums of all places,” he writes. “Different people speaking about manic depressive episodes of a similar nature. I read their stories and realized that I was not alone. It's not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day and being told by the so-called best doctors in the world that I am not bipolar, but merely experiencing ‘symptoms of autism.'”

He adds, “I'm not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness. I write today simply to ask for your patience and understanding as I find my way home.” Read the full ad, which is paid for by Yeezy and co-signed by company CFO Hussein Lalani, below.

Kanye West:

Twenty-five years ago, I was in a car accident that broke my jaw and caused injury to the right frontal lobe of my brain. At the time, the focus was on the visible damage—the fracture, the swelling, and the immediate physical trauma. The deeper injury, the one inside my skull, went unnoticed.

Comprehensive scans were not done, neurological exams were limited, and the possibility of a frontal-lobe injury was never raised. It wasn't properly diagnosed until 2023. That medical oversight caused serious damage to my mental health and led to my bipolar type-1 diagnosis.

Bipolar disorder comes with its own defense system. Denial. When you're manic, you don't think you're sick. You think everyone else is overreacting. You feel like you're seeing the world more clearly than ever, when in reality you're losing your grip entirely.

Once people label you as ‘crazy,' you feel as if you cannot contribute anything meaningful to the world. It's easy for people to joke and laugh it off when in fact this is a very serious debilitating disease you can die from. According to the World Health Organization and Cambridge University, people with bipolar disorder have a life expectancy that is shortened by ten to fifteen years on average, and a 2x–3x higher all-cause mortality rate than the general population. This is on par with severe heart disease, type-1 diabetes, HIV, and cancer—all lethal and fatal if left untreated.

The scariest thing about this disorder is how persuasive it is when it tells you: You don't need help. It makes you blind, but convinced you have insight. You feel powerful, certain, and unstoppable.

I lost touch with reality. Things got worse the longer I ignored the problem. I said and did things I deeply regret. Some of the people I love the most, I treated the worst. You endured fear, confusion, humiliation, and the exhaustion of trying to love someone who was, at times, unrecognizable. Looking back, I became detached from my true self.

In that fractured state, I gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika, and even sold t-shirts bearing it. One of the difficult aspects of having bipolar type-1 are the disconnected moments – many of which I still cannot recall—that lead to poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body experience. I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability, treatment, and meaningful change. It does not excuse what I did, though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I love Jewish people.

To the black community—which held me down through all of the highs and lows and the darkest of times. The black community is, unquestionably, the foundation of who I am. I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us.

In early 2025, I fell into a four-month long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life. As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn't want to be here anymore.

Having bipolar disorder is not a state of constant mental illness. When you go into the manic episode, you are ill at that point. When you are not in an episode, you are completely ‘normal.' And that's when the wreckage from the illness hits the hardest. Hitting rock bottom a few months ago, my wife encouraged me to finally get help.

I have found comfort in Reddit forums of all places. Different people speak of being in manic depressive episodes of a similar nature. I read their stories and realized that I was not alone. It's not just me who ruins their entire life once a year despite taking meds every day and being told by the so-called best doctors in the world that I am not bipolar, but merely experiencing “symptoms of autism.”

My words as a leader in my community have real global impact and influence. In my mania, I lost complete sight of that.

As I find my new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise and clean living, I have newfound, much-needed clarity. I am pouring my energy into positive, meaningful art: music, clothing, design, and other new ideas to help the world.

I'm not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness. I write today simply to ask for your patience and understanding as I find my way home.

It's been 43 years, 17 albums, and 32 member changes since Dave Mustaine was kicked out of Metallica, the fabled schism that galvanized the thrash-metal pioneer to form his own band. Megadeth was fueled by spite, inspired by speed, and enabled by Mustaine's preternatural gift for Flying V warfare, as well as his knack for asking provocative economic queries about the salability of peace. For four decades, Megadeth have been high priests—not the highest, but close—in a church of metal where technical prowess, breakneck tempos, and sneering attitude are the holiest of virtues. Megadeth have weathered nearly all of metal's generational permutations, only once deviating from their heshin' formula with 1999's infamously confused country'n'industrial mish-mash, Risk.

Like most '80s metal heroes who briefly lost their way in the late '90s, Megadeth have spent the 21st century varnishing their legacy with what's tried and true, delivering eight LPs since 2001 that all basically sound the same. And now, not by choice, but by necessity, Megadeth are exiting the business with their self-titled swan song. Mustaine, the band's leading visionary and only original member, is suffering from a hand injury called Dupuytren's contracture that will eventually claim his singular ability, so Megadeth might be the last album the guitar god is ever capable of making. For a career that can be symbolized by Mustaine's fascination with ellipses, both textual (So Far, So Good…So What!) and musical (those guitar solos…), it's too bad that his final statement amounts to the terse utility of a single period.

If you're going into the 17th Megadeth album expecting fresh perspectives and guitarwork that goes toe-to-toe with the brilliantly imaginative riffs that Mustaine laid down half a lifetime ago, that's a skill issue. Bands in Megadeth's grandad age bracket—Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, even Metallica—make new albums for the same reason that people re-register their cars: to prove they're still functionally fit for the road. Opener “Tipping Point” earns the green light in that regard, a brisk and bludgeoning thrash jaunt that begins with a torrential solo raining down from Mustaine's fretboard. The 64 year old vamps for the doubters once again on “Let There Be Shred,” a lighthearted blitz that revisits the meta posturing and tongue-in-cheek silliness of thrash's foundational texts. And on the midtempo “Puppet Parade,” Mustaine dons his grizzled spoken-word cadence in a pointed nod to all-timers like “Peace Sells” and “Symphony of Destruction.”

Megadeth proves that Megadeth can still do the thing, but it's missing the communal gravitas of a band's last hurrah. Megadeth have endured more personnel changes than any other thrash institution, and while Mustaine has firmly maintained the spotlight, the band's greatest feats have always been a team effort. He's never had a lineup as creatively inspired as the early-'90s ensemble responsible for the nimble riffs, jaw-dropping solos, and slugging prog-jazz grooves of Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction, which is why nothing on Megadeth comes anywhere close to those highs. His current hired guns get the job done, but without decades of camaraderie behind them, their recorded chemistry sounds bland and inflexible. Plus, it's a little disappointing that Megadeth's tastiest solos are handled by Temu Dave Mustaine, a guitarist literally named Teemu Mäntysaari who's never appeared on a Megadeth record before this one.

Nevertheless, Mustaine's leadership ensures that Megadeth has all the hallmarks of a competently forgettable Megadeth album. His lyrics are the usual fare: vaguely critical ruminations on war and conflict that never surpass a ninth-grade level of boyish intrigue with industrial murder. When he does seek inspiration beyond the writings of Sun Tzu, he's unloading a barrage of non sequiturs with the sophomorically bratty tone of AJ Soprano (“I Don't Care”) or dimming the lights and reflecting earnestly on the twilight of his career. Closing cut “The Last Note” ends with Mustaine reciting the phrase, “I came, I ruled, now I disappear,” which would actually be a pretty badass way to go out if it was indeed the album's final note.

Mustaine has so much to be proud of, both personally and professionally, that no amount of late-career mediocrity can possibly take away his gilded status as thrash-metal's tenacious anti-hero. On top of Megadeth's Grammy accolades and double-platinum record sales, Mustaine beat throat cancer in 2019, holds black belts in taekwondo and karate, and owns a successful winemaking business with his wife and daughter. But none of those achievements have filled the Four Horsemen-sized hole in his heart that the other, more successful metal band he co-founded ripped open when they sent him packing in 1983.

All of those years of seething animus have led up to Megadeth's recorded repertoire ending with a perfectly fine, perfectly unnecessary cover of Metallica's “Ride the Lightning,” a song Mustaine co-wrote with his former bandmates that was only released after he'd been booted. In context of all the hilariously bitchy and awkwardly deferential comments Mustaine has made about Metallica in recent years, this choice of a bonus track initially struck me as a desperate troll. However, upon further consideration, covering “Ride the Lightning” might actually be the most fitting, full-circle finale for Megadeth. It's Mustaine's way of reaffirming what's been animating his revenge-born band from the jump: At the end of the day, he'd rather just be playing in Metallica.

World's Gone Wrong is an album title suited to the times, one that suggests Lucinda Williams is seeking some meaning amid the mayhem. It's a notion amplified by the song titles: “Something's Gotta Give,” “How Much Did You Get for Your Soul,” “Freedom Speaks,” and “We've Come Too Far to Turn Around” all seem to address the condition of constant chaos.

Topical as it is, part of World's Gone Wrong is grounded in tradition. The title derives from “The World Is Going Wrong,” an old blues song by Mississippi Sheiks—one irresistible to Bob Dylan, who named a collection of blues and folk standards World Gone Wrong in 1993—and Bob Marley's “So Much Trouble in the World” has a prominent place on the record, closing out its first side. Williams sings “So Much Trouble in the World” as a duet with Mavis Staples, and the soul legend is hardly the only guest here. Norah Jones plays on the placid closer “We've Come Too Far to Turn Around,” Willie Nelson's right-hand man Mickey Raphael lends harmonica to “Low Life,” and upcoming country singer Brittney Spencer sings on a pair of songs.

All these additional voices add the slightest suggestion of communion to World's Gone Wrong: Everybody is banding together to gather strength so they can pull through. With its stately spiritual crawl, “We've Come Too Far to Turn Around” makes the connection explicit, but that song serves as the record's benediction, closing the proceedings on a note of elegiac hope. For the rest of the record, Williams revels in the comfort of rock'n'roll, encouraging her band to play loud even when they're playing slow.

The band, which remains anchored by bassist David Sutton and now features onetime Emmylou Harris drummer Brady Blade and former Black Crowes guitarist Marc Ford, sounds big and greasy, as comfortable with a slow, Stones-y swagger of “The World's Gone Wrong” as they are with the swampy blues of “Black Tears” or the spritely soul of “Freedom Speaks.” There's a casual, authoritative swing to their performance that belies the stylistic range on the record; the songs touch upon different traditions, yet all sound of a piece.

Their professionalism does lack a sense of urgency, though. When Williams sings about “false gods and deceivers, playing on our deepest fears” on “Punchline,” it's to a modulated, noir-ish blues; when she laments, “There's a heaviness to these days… I think we've lost our way” on “Something's Gotta Give,” the guitars and rhythms offer moody, muscular support. The suppleness of the band softens Williams' tales of despair, transforming them into songs of solace, not outrage. This isn't an album designed to provoke action; it's to console kindred spirits. To that end, the key song is “Low Life,” a slow-burner about a dive bar where Slim Harpo's playing on the jukebox, the bartender pours good hurricanes, and nobody knows her face. “I guess this is the lowlife, but it's where I wanna be,” Williams sighs as she sinks into a groove that feels so familiar, it seems eternal. Sometimes, those familiar chord changes provide enough sustenance to get by.

Nashville producer username first heard footwork music when DJ Rashad's “It's Wack” played on a Grand Theft Auto V radio station. Bay Area producer Marsh crane's introduction came when he stumbled onto Knxwledge's VATOGATO tapes on Bandcamp. Their journeys to the Chicago dance genre reflect the stylistic approaches that set them apart from their Midwestern compatriots; where RP Boo and co.'s minimalism emphasizes the persistent rhythms that sustain a dancefloor, username and Marsh crane embrace a busier, Zoomer-inspired sound, hashing underground rap microgenres and recognizable samples into dreamy collagist fantasies.

After a slew of collaborative tracks in 2025, OVERTIME arrives as the friends' first joint project. For 30 minutes, the producers mostly paint with a warm, lively palette, whisking fragments of IDM, ghettotech, and house into a hypnotic swirl. The music's dizzying rhythmic variation is skillful and studied enough that its humor can't be mistaken for gimmicky internet caricature. The intensity rarely lets up, and no sample feels off-limits; it's a notably fresh take on footwork capable of introducing the genre to a new generation of listeners.

While username and Marsh crane approach footwork as outsiders, they're a part of a web of internet artists sourcing similar material. Parts of “Report,” like the spaced-out intro that drops unexpected marching drumrolls on offbeats, read as their take on the sstep microgenre created by ivvys-led hip-hop collective #stepTeam. When the track gets more frantic, with extra jittery hats and piercing crashes, it feels more aligned with traditional footwork. The seamless blend of rhythms makes it apparent that sstep is practically a variation of footwork—one that pulls a few layers back to make space for an emcee. It's fascinating to hear these communities interact.

Footwork often uses samples for comedic effect, and with username and Marsh crane this element is center stage. Take DJ Clent's “gimmie head,” where skittering drum patterns accent a sample of a man asking for fellatio. Part of why it's hilarious is the content itself, but it's also how much the sample gets spammed. OVERTIME's wittily self-referential “Repetition” understands this tradition, shuffling through vocal samples of Lil Wayne saying “repetition,” “record spins,” and “rotation.” Even the melodramatic orchestra stabs around Wayne's voice sound ironic, like they came ripped off a hoop mixtape from the late aughts. The voice of G Herbo insisting you “take a nap” over the ethereal pads of “Nap” sounds more comforting than a threat of violence ever should. When mixtape-era Drake vocals get this treatment on the beautiful, warbly “Never Switch,” it sounds weirdly erotic. The duo's sense of humor shines through, highlighting how unserious contemporary hip-hop culture can be when displaced from its original context.

On “Overtime,” the duo places flowery, melancholic plugg-esque piano chords under Millie B's “M to the B,” a song any brainfried 20-something would remember from TikTok's quarantine era. The disparate components are bound by hefty percussion hits and an angelic vocal sample that sounds like trying to remember a distant memory. The title track gets at what username and Marsh crane do best on OVERTIME—meld sarcasm with sincerity, finding that grey area of emotion that comes with ingesting more information than you can process. You can play it in your headphones and cry about what's been lost, how just five years can feel like a lifetime. Or you can put it on your speakers and get the fuck up.

	We are being told by the Trump administration that an intensive care nurse, Alex Jeffrey Pretti, and a mom of three, Renee Nicole Good, both gunned down by ICE agents in Minnesota, are a new breed of homegrown terrorist. You can see video of both incidents and judge for yourself the grotesque absurdity of these claims. Or you could take the word of the resident Renfield of the White House, Stephen Miller, who took to social media and called Pretti “a would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law enforcement.” 


	Videos of Pretti's horrific killing, shot from multiple angles, show six or seven agents wrestling a passive Pretti to the ground. When they discover a gun on his body, one of the agents appears to disarm Pretti, and then another shoots him four times in the back. A third agent also fires into his body. Shooting a subdued man in the back is the very definition of excessive force and cowardice. 


	Despite visual evidence to the contrary, Department of Homeland Security honcho and self-proclaimed dog executioner Kristi Noem claimed the Pretti killing was justified: “This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”

	Border Patrol commandant Gregory Bovino, whose recent wardrobe choices call to mind someone cosplaying as an Indiana Jones villain, claimed Pretti “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” According to the available videos, the only thing Pretti had in his hands during the encounter was a phone. He doesn't seem to fight the ICE agents in any way. Bovino also made the preposterous and offensive comment that the agents were the real victims in the incident. The lies pile up and insult our intelligence.

	











	No matter what the Trump administration may claim, federal agents are not authorized to act as judge, jury, and executioner on the streets of America. These agents are not above the law. But in both of the Minneapolis killings we see behavior that breaks protocol of a police shooting. The agents leave the scene. Local authorities are prevented from examining the evidence of the killing. Elected officials and the White House trade insults and invective but there's no effort from Washington to conduct the kind of rigorous investigation that the death of any human being merits on principle or under the eyes of a nation governed by laws. Partisanship and extreme policy turned into a literal blood sport.

	A more serious and sober president would attempt to diffuse this situation before the gyre widens further and the country is convulsed by more violence and damage. Instead, President Trump took to Truth Social to attack Minnesota Democrats in a particularly unhinged stream of rage. “Where are the local Police? Why weren't they allowed to protect ICE Officers? The Mayor and the Governor called them off? It is stated that many of these Police were not allowed to do their job, that ICE had to protect themselves — Not an easy thing to do! Why does Ilhan Omar have $34 Million Dollars in her account? And where are the Tens of Billions of Dollars that have been stolen from the once Great State of Minnesota? We are there because of massive Monetary Fraud, with Billions of Dollars missing, and Illegal Criminals that were allowed to infiltrate the State through the Democrats' Open Border Policy. We want the money back, and we want it back, NOW.”


	What the alleged fraud in Minnesota has to do with ICE killing civilians, other than to distract and deflect, is unclear. This yearlong blitz of insidious distortions from the administration has taken a toll on all of us. There is a fact pattern of mendacity. From DOGE to the Big Beautiful Bill, the gutting of the government workforce, and the weaponization of the Department of Justice to punish political enemies, it's been an exhausting year of ugly theatrics. Unfortunately, a parade of falsehoods has been used to justify violence before. If killing Venezuelans in boats with missiles was about drugs, where are the narcotics — or any evidence at all? The administration asks us to simply trust them.

	Last week, Trump brought his black cloud to Davos to insult our European allies and openly plot to seize a longstanding friendly nation's territory: Greenland. An island where we already have military access to suit our strategic needs. Trump's long and deranged speech, filled with more lies and ugly invective, veered into mad king territory. He called Greenland Iceland four times. The performance was an embarrassment, one only bootlicking true believers in the administration would fail to recognize as the president's brain rot fully exposed. Trump's coarse and venal character has left the world and large swathes of the country horrified, fearful, and rightfully furious. At home and abroad, the president's anger and lies sow chaos, confusion, and revulsion. 

	











	Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney summed up the situation: “We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition,” Carney told the crowd at Davos. “Over the past two decades, a series of crises in finance, health, energy, and geopolitics have laid bare the risks of extreme global integration. But more recently, great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons, tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited. You cannot live within the lie of mutual benefit through integration when integration becomes the source of your subordination.”


	The carnage needs to stop. Congress has broad powers and must act. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said in the wake of Good's killing, “We just saw them murder an American citizen in cold blood in the street. Despite whatever lies the president wants to tell, you can see what happened for yourself.”

	Despite a bipartisan call for an investigation into Pretti's killing, led by Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota, there are too few signs of courage beyond the usual vocal opposition. Unless a significant number of the GOP majority joins the minority, this outrageous and consistent abuse of power will only get worse. We can't have thousands of federal agents roaming cities, sweeping people off the streets, operating with impunity, clashing with protestors, and not expect more violent episodes and senseless death. Unless ICE is reined in, we are heading for more tragedy and bloodshed across the country. 


	Americans cannot live within all these lies any longer.

	Abbey Road Studios was buzzing with activity last fall. Longtime record executive Rich Clarke remembers the scene in the London studio's cafeteria in late November 2025: “You look up and you've got [Fontaines D.C.'s] Grian Chatten having a talk with [the Libertines'] Carl Barât by the door,” he says. “You've got Damon Albarn sat with Jonathan Glazer on one table. And then suddenly all of Pulp walk in and they're in a queue to get their lasagna.”


	Those luminaries were all there to work on HELP(2), a compilation album supporting the charity organization War Child UK, where Clarke serves as head of music. Out March 6, it's a majorly star-studded affair, with new songs and covers by Olivia Rodrigo, Cameron Winter, Wet Leg, Sampha, Arlo Parks, Depeche Mode, Big Thief, and many others. The first single from the album, “Opening Night,” is also the first new song that Arctic Monkeys have released since 2022: a perfectly louche anthem-in-waiting with an instant-classic lead vocal from Alex Turner.

	











	Founded in the early Nineties by a pair of filmmakers who were horrified by the violence of the Bosnian Civil War, War Child provides services to children who are affected by global conflict — meaning not just the immediate needs of food, water, and shelter, but also longer-term support for mental health and education. The organization has a long history of partnering with musicians, going back to 1995's The Help Album, which boasted new songs from Paul McCartney, Radiohead, Blur, Oasis, Portishead, and more of the biggest names in British music. “That had a huge effect for the charity,” Clarke says. “At that point, they were doing minor things, delivering supplies behind siege lines in Sarajevo. It allowed the organization to scale up, because crucially, it had money to fund activities.”

	











	The idea for a new Help album had been percolating since around Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “Since that moment, we've seen escalation of violence in the Middle East. We've seen the civil war in Sudan go to probably the largest humanitarian crisis in the world right now — there's 15 million children who are in need of humanitarian assistance in Sudan,” Clarke says. “There's been a real feeling from the artist community of wanting to do something.”

	The project gained speed in late 2024, when producer James Ford came on board, followed quickly by Arctic Monkeys, with whom he's worked closely for many years. “Anything James touches turns to gold,” drummer Matt Helders tells Rolling Stone. “If he's putting something together, we know it's going to be for the right reasons, and also be a good-quality thing, as well.”


	Arctic Monkeys have their own relationship with War Child going back to 2018, when they played a show at the Royal Albert Hall and donated the proceeds to the organization. A live album from that concert, released two years later, yielded even more funds for children affected by war. “I think we're just shy of £1.5 million from the show and the record,” Clarke says.


	When the band met up at Abbey Road toward the end of 2025, it was their first time together in a studio in a few years. They decided to revisit an unfinished song that Turner had been toying with for more than a decade; Helders estimates that it first surfaced “in Joshua Tree, when we used to record out there.” (Dedicated Monkeys scholars can deduce that it probably entered the picture during the sessions for 2009's Humbug or 2013's AM, both partially recorded in the California desert.)


	“He never got to scratch the itch of completing this song,” Helders says. “It was just one of those that wouldn't go away in his head, I think. There was never a full version of it. We'd jam it out and try to write parts for it. It never got over the finish line, but it was too good to just leave alone.”

	Now, they tried taking another run at “Opening Night” in the style they've evolved into on later albums like Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino and The Car. “And it just worked,” Helders says. “It's different to what it was going to be if we did it 10, 15 years ago, but we were all really happy with it… It's almost like this song was waiting until we were good enough to do it.”


	The rest of the HELP(2) sessions, the bulk of which took place over three days at Abbey Road, featured some other familiar faces, too. Back in 1996, when Pulp won the Mercury Prize for their era-defining album Different Class, they donated their winnings to War Child, feeling that The Help Album ought to have won instead. Three decades later, Jarvis Cocker and company stepped up to contribute a characteristically droll rocker called “Begging for Change” to the new project.

	











	The original Help album, released at the height of the Britpop craze, included an instrumental track from Blur. This time, Blur guitarist Graham Coxon dropped by Abbey Road to sit in with the indie band English Teacher, while Albarn teamed up with Chatten and rapper Kae Tempest to polish off a new song called “Flags.”


	“It was quite major chords, which is unusual for me,” the Blur/Gorillaz singer tells Rolling Stone. “So when conversation of War Child came, I thought it was quite a good thing to present as an idea.”


	Albarn is a fan of both Chatten and Tempest, calling them both “huge talents,” and he was delighted to form an impromptu trio with them in the studio. “Flags” wound up featuring guitar from Johnny Marr, Portishead's Adrian Utley, and Dave Okumu, as well as backing vocals from Cocker, Barât, Declan McKenna, Marika Hackman, the members of Black Country, New Road, and several other musicians who were around that day.


	“We did it all together, like a band,” Albarn says. “When you do music for charity, it can be a bit trite somehow. But I don't think we got distracted by that sense of, ‘Oh, we're doing a charity record.' We all just enjoyed recording together in Abbey Road.”


	All of this action was recorded on hand-held cameras wielded by a crew of grade-schoolers that Glazer, the filmmaker behind The Zone of Interest and Under the Skin, sent to Abbey Road to document the sessions. “It's to tell the story through the eyes of children,” Clarke says. “At one point, they'd be sat next to Damon on the piano stool, or sticking a camera up Jarvis' nose in the vocal booth in Studio Three. It had a wonderful effect on the atmosphere, because once you've got kids running around, it just takes the stress away.”


	Sadly, Ford, who was diagnosed with leukemia in early 2025, was unable to attend the sessions in person. So War Child brought in top producers including Marta Salogni and Catherine Marks to help out, and Ford continued to provide as much remote input as possible.


	On the final day of recording, Dec. 17, Olivia Rodrigo came by Abbey Road to record a quietly stunning cover of the Magnetic Fields' “The Book of Love”; the track also features Coxon on acoustic guitar. Ford, who was receiving treatment in the hospital at the time, guided the session over Zoom. “He was actually talking into Olivia Rodrigo's [headphones] while she was recording, while he was having a blood transfusion,” Clarke says. “Remarkable man, and an absolute genius.”

	Around Christmas, Clarke got to hear Arctic Monkeys' “Opening Night” for the first time. A longtime fan of the band — “I'm old enough to remember seeing them in Camden in skinny jeans and a flannel shirt and long hair” — he knows that getting a new single from them is no small feat. “We didn't take it for granted,” he says. “I was absolutely blown away. It's a brilliant track, isn't it?”


	With “Opening Night” out now and the album arriving on streaming services soon, he's looking forward to seeing how fans respond to all the music that got made at Abbey Road for War Child. “The wonderful thing is, these rights are going to support children affected by conflict in perpetuity,” Clarke says. “The music's the legacy piece, and the quality of that will carry through for the next 30 years, we hope. Fingers crossed.”

	Ye, the artist formerly known as Kanye West, apologized for his years of antisemitic and other controversial comments in a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal.


	In the lengthy note, titled “To Those I've Hurt” (and paid for by Yeezy), West issued his apology alongside a discussion of his battle with bipolar disorder. Noting that he was not properly diagnosed until 2023, West linked his mental health struggles to undiagnosed and unexamined head trauma he might've suffered in the 2002 car crash that shattered his jaw (and inspired his debut solo hit, “Through the Wire”). 


	“I lost touch with reality. Things got worse the longer I ignored the problem,” West wrote of his recent manic episodes. “I said and did things I deeply regret. Some of the people I love the most, I treated the worst. You endured fear, confusion, humiliation, and the exhaustion of trying to love someone who was, at times, unrecognizable. Looking back, I became detached from my true self.” 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	Describing what it's like to be in a manic episode, West said, “You don't think you're sick,” and it feels like “everyone else is overreacting. You feel like you're seeing the world more clearly than ever, when in reality you're losing your grip entirely. Once people label you as ‘crazy,' you feel as if you cannot contribute anything meaningful to the world.” 


	He added, “The scariest thing about this disorder is how persuasive it is when it tells you: You don't need help. It makes you blind, but convinced you have insight. You feel powerful, certain, and unstoppable.” 

	











	West went on to admit that in this “fractured state I gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika, and even sold T-shirts bearing it.” (West started selling the swastika merch on his website last February, while a few months later he released a song called “Heil Hitler.” But even before that, there had been other public incidents involving praise for Adolf Hitler and the promotion of Nazi iconography, along with numerous antisemitic outbursts. Rolling Stone has also reported that West's fascination with Hitler and Nazis goes back several decades.)

	In his apology, West continued: “One of the difficult aspects of having biopolar type-1 are the disconnected moments — many of which I still cannot recall — that lead to poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body experience. I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability, treatment, and meaningful change. It does not excuse what I did, though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I love Jewish people.” 


	West also apologized to the Black community, which he said “held me down through all of the highs and lows and the darkest of times. The black community is, unquestionably, the foundation of who I am. I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us.” 


	According to West, the four-month “manic episode of psychotic, paranoid, and impulsive behavior” he endured early last year nearly “destroyed my life.” He even appeared to admit to some apparent suicidal ideation, saying, “As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn't want to be here anymore.” He credited his wife, Bianca Censori, with encouraging him to finally get help after he finally hit “rock bottom a few months ago.” 


	West said he has been searching for a “new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise and clean living.” He also said he has found comfort in Reddit forums, where people share their own experiences of “being in manic or depressive episodes of a similar nature.” West said, “I read their stories and realized that I was not alone.”

	In closing out his apology, West said he has found some “much-needed clarity” and is putting his “energy into positive, meaningful art: music, clothing, design, and other new ideas to help the world.” He concluded: “I'm not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness. I write today simply to ask for you patience and understanding as I find my way home.”  

	











	This is not the first time West has apologized for his behavior and offensive comments. In December 2023, after several years' worth of antisemitic comments, he published a note on Instagram, written in Hebrew, that read, “I sincerely apologize to the Jewish community for any unintended outbursts, caused by my words or actions. It was not my intention to hurt or demean, and I deeply regret any pain I may have caused.”

Dave Grohl revealed that the Foo Fighters have wrapped work on their forthcoming new album. During a concert in Tasmania, Australia, over the weekend, Grohl told the crowd that no only is new music coming, but that the band would return to Australia sooner than later. 


	“This won't be the last time you see us,” Grohl said. “We'll be back here sooner than you think. And it's before my next birthday.”


	He added, “And we might have a whole new record of fucking songs that we just finished the other day.”


	For the record, Grohl's birthday is on Jan. 14, which means Foo Fighters would hit the road globally again this year. The band has already announced a North American summer stadium tour, which kicks off Aug. 4 at Rogers Stadium in Toronto and concludes Sept. 26 in Las Vegas. 


	Foo Fighters' last album, But Here We Are, arrived in 2023. It was their first LP since the death of drummer Taylor Hawkins. Grohl handled the drum duties himself on the album, and the band hired Josh Freese for the tour. They parted ways with him in May. When they announced their 2026 tour dates, the Foos also shared a new single entitled “Asking For a Friend.”

	“[It's] a song for those who have waited patiently in the cold, relying on hope and faith for their horizon to appear,” Grohl wrote. “Searching for ‘proof' when hanging by a wish until the sun shines again. One of many songs to come…”

	











	The band's performance at UTAS Stadium in Launceston, Tasmania, on Saturday night marked their first show in Tasmania in more than a decade. It was also the first time the Foo Fighters played on the island since Hawkins' death. When the show was announced, Grohl explained it was a one-off gig in Australia.

	“We have a very special relationship with Tasmania — as we do with all of Australia,” Grohl said. “To come down and have a special night is amazing… even though we're literally flying down for 48 hours.”


	During the show, Grohl shared the story behind Foo Fighters' 2007 song “Ballad of the Beaconsfield Miners” and brought out one of the real-life miners, Brant Webb. Webb famously requested an iPod loaded with Foo Fighters songs while he was trapped underground.

	 ”I look forward to dying,” Bob Weir told Rolling Stone‘s Angie Martoccio early last year. “I tend to think of death as the last and best reward for a life well lived. That said, I've still got a lot on my plate and I won't be ready to go for a while.”


	In the new episode of Rolling Stone Music Now, we play clips from that interview — which turned out to be his final encounter with Rolling Stone — in the wake of Weir's death earlier this month. The episode also includes a a guide to some of the highlights of Weir's career, and a new interview with Gov't Mule's Warren Haynes, who toured with the post-Jerry Garcia incarnation of the Dead in 2004 and 2009. To hear the podcast episode, listen on Apple Podcasts or Spotify, or just press play above — some highlights from Haynes' interview follow.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







Haynes' last real conversation with Weir was about forming an acoustic trio with Dave Matthews — a project that never came to be. “Dave Matthews and myself and Bob played at a private event at Brooklyn Bowl,” he recalls. “We wound up on stage playing together, and we had a conversation afterward about how unique that blend was, and even talked about maybe taking it on the road. We all felt that there was something unique about it and there were several conversations about trying to make room for it at some point, which never happened.”

	











Haynes explains the mechanics of Weir's rhythm-guitar approach.  “He wasn't necessarily coming up with a repeating pattern that worked as one of the gears of the song. He was kind of comping moment by moment behind whatever was going on. The second verse was different than the first verse. And the third verse was different from the second verse. He was just, moment by moment, making it up as he went along.”Haynes says he didn't mind when Weir moved on to Dead and Company, with John Mayer taking on Jerry Garcia's vocal and guitar duties instead of Haynes. “I never had any hard feelings about it,” says Haynes. “I never looked at it as a parting of ways. I looked at 2004 and 2009 as an opportunity for me to do something really cool with those guys. But I didn't think of it as something that was gonna keep going into the future.” He adds that he's a fan of Mayer's work with the band:  “I think I was skeptical in the beginning like a lot of people were, but he really poured himself into it and did a great job. I think a lot of people were just not convinced that was gonna be the case, and he proved everybody wrong.”

The Dead's dedication to improvisation meant that rehearsals were often pointless. “I remember there would be songs when we had spent like an hour working on some background vocal part,” Haynes says. “And then the song came up in the set list, and I would look up and no one was at their microphone. Everybody was just jamming and forgot all about the rehearsal. And hey, that's part of it too.”


When Weir joined Haynes for a symphonic Dead tribute, his guitar volume offended the orchestra. “We had added another electric guitar and another keyboard to the mix,” Haynes recalls. “So the symphony was not too happy about it. A bunch of the string players walked out at the end and refused to play because they said the volume was too loud. And of course, Bob was like, ‘Well, fuck 'em.'”

For a much-loved ballad on 1981's The Wild, The Willing And The Innocent, UFO turned to the criminal underworld for inspiration

Although best known for high-energy rockers such as Let It Roll, Too Hot To Handle and Lights Out, UFO have always had a softer side. Their albums typically include at least one song in a mellower vein, of which Profession Of Violence from 1981's The Wild, The Willing And The Innocent album is a prime example.

UFO message boards long urged the band to revisit songs in this style, and from this era. Indeed, in 2011 singer Phil Mogg told Classic Rock that the band had considered adding it to their set list: “We've done Try Me (from Lights Out, 1977) recently and have thought about Belladonna (No Heavy Petting, 1976) and Profession Of Violence, too – just to mix the set up a bit.”

Good news, then. The story of Profession Of Violence starts with then-guitarist Paul Chapman explaining that he wrote the incredible guitar solo (that forms the second half of the track) paddling in the warm Caribbean waters lapping the island paradise of Montserrat while recording UFO's 1980 album No Place To Run…

“That's the only solo that I've ever written before I had a backing track,"" he told us in 2011. ""I used to go down to the beach with an Ovation acoustic and just stand knee-deep in this beautiful, crystal clear water, just jamming away. There were no waves, I'd stand there for hours, while my feet shrivelled up. I came up with this melody there, and recorded it later on my Revox.

“I discovered that part of it is in a harmonic minor scale which I didn't even know about at the time. All I knew was that this thing sounded good. When I showed the chords to Phil he came up with the vocal and then I brought back the solo. We did it totally backwards.”

But Chapman's description of the writing process definitely jogged a memory with Mogg: “Yeah… That's what we used to do with a lot of Michael [Schenker]'s stuff, too. He'd put solos down and if it sounded really cool, we'd work out a chord sequence to go with it and put a song around the solo.”

The title and lyric came later, both inspired by the 1972 book The Profession Of Violence: The Rise And Fall Of The Kray Twins. Drummer Andy Parker reckoned: “That was a book that I had, originally. I'm not sure if I lent it to Phil or he bought his own, but he's always had this thing where he reads stories and gets ideas for songs.”

Mogg: “I'd read the book and liked the title – although I preferred Profession Of Violence without the 'The' – and sometimes I write down different titles for later use. But I often forget things and they only come back to me years later and I think: ‘Oh, that'll work!'

“The lyric was more of a sad affair than the subject matter of the book – which was more of a fucked-up thing. Being banged up isn't very pleasant. If you're a big-time gangster maybe you get used to it, but for the average Joe it's not very pleasant and Profession Of Violence was more of a sympathetic ear for those left behind.”

The poignancy of Mogg's lyrics are superbly emphasised by a string section arranged by one Paul Buckmaster – a cellist best known for his 1970s work with Elton John, but who also worked with the Rolling Stones on Sticky Fingers, David Bowie's Space Oddity and, more recently, Axl and co's Chinese Democracy. But it was the Elton John track Sixty Years On (on his breakthrough eponymous second album) which led Mogg to choose him.

“I think he was supposed to have been working on the Flash Gordon soundtrack, but then they got Queen to do it so he had time to work with us.

“We were never very good with money so I didn't think to ask how expensive he might be. The album saw us run up a huge debt. We were just shown into Studio One and left to get on with it. It was near Oxford Circus and dead expensive…”

Neither Mogg or Parker can recalled how they ended up recording without a producer. Parker: “Steve Churchyard was the engineer but he ended up producing it with us. I'm wondering how the hell we ended up doing that – did Chrysalis just not give us a producer?! Why we would have been in Air London, good studios, where we'd have been running around like a chicken with no head? We needed producers to tell us what to do, otherwise we'd have just gone down the pub, drinking and not really getting much done!”

Mogg: “Leaving us to our own devices was never a very good idea. The debt just built up. It was only around 2002 that it finally got paid off.”

Mogg: “We did have a great time doing that album. There was none of that studio tension you sometimes get. Air was right in town and it felt like a real English rock'n'roll album.”

Last word, then, to the man who started it all, on recording the solo that ends it…

Chapman: “The day we recorded it, my red BC Rich 10-string arrived from America. We'd just been on tour with Aerosmith, and Joe Perry was playing one of these – a wicked space machine with all the bells and whistles on. I took one look at his and said: ‘I want one of those!' So I got in a cab to my mate Kevin's in Denmark Street, picked it up, came back to the studio, tuned it up, plugged it in, and the first thing I recorded was that solo!

“Steve Churchyard and I worked on it again later at Air Studios. At the end of the solo – which you don't hear now – I held that note, swooped it round, put this echo on it and it sounded like the end of World War III. It was amazing. I said something to Steve like: ‘It would be really, really dreadful if that got wiped,' and I found out later that that's exactly what he did. He just misheard me. We got our wires crossed or something. I think there was Special Brew involved. That's the only thing I regret about that album.”

This feature originally appeared in Classic Rock 156, published in April 2011, and updated in 2026. Paul Chapman died in 2020.

For music lovers, this compatibility becomes even more crucial. Whether you're a bedroom DJ who spins vinyl until 2 AM, a guitarist who practices daily scales, or simply someone who appreciates good sound quality, living with people who understand and share your passion for music can transform your living situation from tolerable to truly harmonious.

According to a Qualitative Thematic Study on the Significance of Compatible Room/Flatmate, compatibility in lifestyle, personality traits, and shared interests is crucial for a positive co-living experience. This rings especially true for musicians and music enthusiasts whose creative pursuits often extend into unconventional hours and require understanding housemates.

The good news? Several specialized platforms now make it easier than ever to find roommates who align with your musical lifestyle. Here are the best options available today.

SpareRoom

When it comes to finding roommates who truly get your lifestyle, SpareRoom stands out as the most comprehensive and reliable platform available. With a massive user base across popular cities in the US, this platform has revolutionized how people connect for shared living arrangements.

What makes SpareRoom particularly valuable for music lovers is its search functionality that lets you filter based on what matters most to you. You can specify your preferences, which is crucial when you need housemates who won't complain about your late-night recording sessions or weekend jam sessions.

Safety is where SpareRoom truly excels. Their dedicated team of moderators works seven days a week to check ads and content, ensuring you're connecting with genuine people rather than scammers. This peace of mind is invaluable when you're inviting someone to share your living space — and your music collection.

The platform makes the entire process remarkably simple. Whether you're searching on desktop or using their mobile apps, posting an ad or browsing affordable options takes just minutes. And if you have questions? Their Customer Services team answers calls within three rings and responds to emails within 24 hours — a level of support that's rare in today's automated world.

For musicians and music enthusiasts, SpareRoom's detailed profiles allow you to showcase your lifestyle honestly, helping you attract like-minded individuals who'll appreciate your 3 AM inspiration sessions rather than resent them.

Roomster

Roomster takes a community-focused approach to roommate matching, connecting people worldwide through lifestyle compatibility filters. The platform's strength lies in its emphasis on personal connections, with detailed profiles that go beyond basic demographics.

For music lovers, Roomster's lifestyle filters help you find roommates who share similar daily rhythms and preferences. The platform encourages users to be specific about their interests and habits, making it easier to identify potential housemates who might become jam session partners or concert companions. Whether you're looking for fellow musicians or simply music appreciators who understand the importance of quality speakers and won't judge your extensive vinyl collection, Roomster's community-based approach facilitates these connections.

Roomi

Roomi recognizes that roommate searching often happens on the go. This mobile-first app prioritizes secure matching while providing built-in messaging and payment tools that streamline the entire process.

Roomi's focus on user privacy protection makes it an excellent choice for musicians who may have concerns about sharing their schedules or lifestyle details publicly. The platform's communication features let you have detailed conversations with potential roommates about important topics (like whether they're comfortable with instrument practice or impromptu listening sessions) before committing to anything.

The integrated payment tools also simplify financial arrangements, an often-overlooked aspect of roommate compatibility that can prevent future conflicts.

RoomieMatch

RoomieMatch takes a more scientific approach to roommate matching through quizzes and specialized algorithms. This platform analyzes lifestyle preferences, habits, and personality traits to suggest highly compatible matches.

For music enthusiasts, this data-driven approach can uncover unexpected compatibility with people you might not have considered otherwise. The platform's detailed questionnaires allow you to specify your musical habits, preferred volume levels, and schedule, helping the algorithm find roommates whose lifestyles naturally align with yours.

Regardless of which platform you use, asking the right questions helps ensure long-term compatibility. For music lovers, consider discussing:

● Noise tolerance and quiet hours: When do they need silence? Are they light sleepers? How do they feel about music practice or listening at various times?
● Music preferences: Do your tastes align? Even if they differ, is there mutual respect for different genres?
● Guest policies: Will they be comfortable with band rehearsals or music-focused gatherings?
● Space usage: Are they open to musical equipment in common areas?
● Work schedules: Do your routines complement each other, especially regarding noise-sensitive hours?

Empirical evidence shows that young adults who get along well with roommates typically have better mental health than those living alone or those who experience conflict with roommates. This mental health benefit extends to shared interests like music, which can create bonding opportunities and reduce stress.

Interestingly, research from an NIH study on pet ownership and social support shows that shared interests and lifestyle compatibility (whether around pets, music, or other passions) correlate with mental health benefits like reduced anxiety and depression symptoms. The study highlights how maintaining social support through compatible living arrangements contributes to overall wellbeing.

The journey to finding compatible roommates mirrors the process of forming a great band — it requires patience, clear communication, and a willingness to find people who complement your rhythm. Whether you prioritize SpareRoom's comprehensive safety features and extensive user base, Roomster's community focus, Roomi's mobile convenience, or RoomieMatch's algorithmic precision, the right platform can connect you with housemates who enhance rather than inhibit your musical lifestyle.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=extraterrestrial","Banks are secretly preparing for an encounter with aliens","https://universemagazine.com/en/contact-with-extraterrestrials-will-lead-to-a-global-financial-crisis/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 11:48:14 GMT","

When it comes to threats to economic stability, experts consider everything from cyberattacks to political conflicts. But a senior analyst at the Bank of England warns of a risk that seems fantastical — first contact with an extraterrestrial civilization.

Helen McCaw, who previously worked at the Bank of England, is calling on key institutions, including her former employer, to start preparing for a financial crisis caused by official confirmation of the existence of extraterrestrial life. She has already approached the bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, appealing for the need to have contingency plans in place for emergencies that threaten stability.

Her concern stems from the fact that, in her opinion, the US government is in the process of gradually disclosing information about UFOs, or, as they are more correctly called, “unidentified anomalous phenomena” (UAP). If it turns out that they are of artificial, non-human origin, humanity will face a force more powerful than any state, and one with unknown intentions at that.

According to McCow, the main danger lies in the reaction of financial markets. The discovery could trigger sharp fluctuations on the stock markets — from catastrophic panic to unbridled euphoria. But the worst-case scenario would be a complete loss of confidence, when traders stop believing in the future of the human economic system.

“If an official statement is made with irrefutable evidence, we could see complete financial instability within hours,” the expert claims. This could lead to bank bankruptcies, the collapse of payment systems, and social unrest when people are unable to buy even the most basic necessities.

No one knows exactly how humanity will react psychologically to such a discovery. That is why, McCow notes, financial regulators are obliged to consider even such an exotic risk. Even if the probability seems minimal, ignoring it would be unwise.

The former analyst insists that in a world where reality often surpasses fiction, being prepared for any scenario is not a sign of fear, but rather a manifestation of responsibility for the stability of the global economy.

Chris Skinner&#039;s blog

Shaping the future of finance

I just watched The Life of Chuck based upon a story by Stephen King (strongly recommended). Throughout the film, it constantly references Carl Sagan's Cosmic Calendar. The Cosmic Calendar compresses the 13.8-billion-year history of the universe into a single calendar year, where January 1 is the Big Bang and December 31 is the present*. At this scale, modern humanity is just 25 minutes old.

It kind of makes you feel small.

It also makes you wonder a bit, as there's a theory that the biggest breakthrough in humanity was when Egypt was visited by aliens 5,000 years ago. This would answer many questions around how they built pyramids and worked out the size of the Earth and more. There is no doubt that the Egyptian period of progress was a massive leap for humanity – not ignoring the fact that there were other civilisations who may have had visitations (look over South American mummifications) – and some speculate this was all due to a Periodic visit by alien life forms.

Much of this theory is formed by the themes of Erich von Däniken's Chariots of the Gods**, which proposed that extraterrestrial visitors interacted with ancient humans 5,000 or more years ago, changing our technological development, religion, and culture. More than this, he believed there was evidence of ""ancient astronauts"" being mistaken for gods, suggesting humans are descendants of these extraterrestrial pioneers.

Equally, before von Däniken's book, there is the Fermi Paradox***. This is a question posed by physicist Enrico Fermi back in 1950 and asks, with the vast expanse of space out there, how come we haven't found alien life? His reasoning:

All of this is interesting, but why blog about it? After all, the first time I visited a Futurists conference, they had a whole stream dedicated to close encounters of the fourth kind. This was speculating that we would one day be dealing with alien life forms. It's an interesting idea and, as a Trekkie and Star Wars fan, it would be lovely to meet an alien … but highly unlikely. It's just good fiction, which is why I no longer go to Futurists conferences.

Having said this, Elon Musk caught my attention when, at Davos last week, he admitted that he is an alien.

When BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink asked Elon whether we are alone in the universe he replied probably yes. With 9,000 satellites in orbit and no sign of alien activity, he called human consciousness a fragile “candle in a vast darkness” and stressed the moral importance of protecting it. Musk argued that becoming a multi-planet species through SpaceX is key to ensuring humanity's survival in a universe that may hold no other intelligent life.

You can watch that panel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZzmrh9lcbc

But then he concluded with a joke that he was an alien. That statement does not surprise me as he is weird, but he is also our leader in building a multiplanetary species, using space for connectivity through Starlink and building a reusable rocket firm called SpaceX. Is he an alien?

Finally, I did blog last week about trading with aliens as this was a question posited by Helen McCaw, a former analyst at the UK's central bank, to Andrew Bailey, the Bank of England's governor, urging him to set out contingencies if the White House confirms the existence of alien life.

Is this just all smoke and mirrors, pomp and circumstance, fluff and puff?

Who knows? What we do know is that we, as humans, desperately want to find another life form to connect with. That's the point of Star Wars, Star Trek, Aliens, Dune, Doctor Who, Battlestar Galactica and more.

It's great entertainment, but the reality is that there is little evidence of life out there beyond Earth … or is there?

It's not quite a Hollywood ending, it's a Santa Clara, California one.

The NFL's Super Bowl logo conspiracy has been pervasive over the years, with tin-foil-hat wearers around the football world trying to draw conclusions from innocuous color schemes within the NFL's official logo for the ""Big Game.""

This year, the NFL shied away from a Super Bowl logo that some viewed as predictive. But some are turning to another official league-created graphic as a cause for skepticism.

Posted on Sept. 4, the first day of the NFL's 2025 regular season, a graphic with notable players from all 32 teams was shared from the league's official platforms, with the caption ""32 teams with February dreams. We're so back.""

While that isn't notable, what is notable are a few players closest to the Lombardi Trophy in the graphic.

While several stand near the ""front"" of the graphic, including New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers and Jacksonville Jaguars CB/WR Travis Hunter, two players stand out as closest to the trophy and Levi's Stadium: Seattle Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold and New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye.

Both passers and their respective teams will meet in Super Bowl 60 in a few weeks' time.

Take a look for yourself:

Some are viewing the graphic as a ""leaked script""-moment, while the truth is simply a happy coincidence.

Regardless of whether the football gods were at play with an unintentional prognostication, the reality remains that Darnold's Seahawks will meet Maye's Patriots in Super Bowl 60.

Graphic designers: choose your next creation carefully.

The questions surrounding the graphic were so loud that Brian McCarthy, the NFL VP of communications, responded to the ""controversy"" on X (formerly Twitter), putting to bed any doubts:

The rapid spread of conspiracy theories about Victoria's recent bushfires – such as a government-orchestrated internet blackout, and lasers causing the blazes – has prompted warnings that misinformation will become more frequent as natural disasters increase because of climate change.

Premier Jacinta Allan was accused by some locals in Alexandra, which narrowly avoided disaster from the nearby Longwood fire, of deliberately switching off the internet in the area.

Before the premier's visit on January 13, government officials walking through the town, in central Victoria, were approached by locals who made the claim that the internet was being shut off intentionally. Some of these people were among the dozens who tried to confront Allan before and after a press conference and heckled her from outside Alexandra District Health.

Many locals asked valid logistical questions, such as when they would be able to access roads and provide feed to their livestock. They also questioned whether the government was adequately funding the Country Fire Authority.

Some locals also demanded to know why communications weren't working in the region.

Not long after, a screenshot of a WhatsApp message was circulated, alleging Health Minister Mary-Anne Thomas had told locals the government had shut down internet and phone services to stop the spread of misinformation. Others speculated the internet was switched off to coincide with Allan's visit and prevent locals from organising against her.

There is no evidence to suggest this is true. Premiers and other government officials do not have the power to switch off internet services. Communications were patchy as phone and internet towers were damaged in the fires, and services including electricity went down, prompting calls to better secure this infrastructure in emergencies.

But the rumour was just one of several conspiracy theories that emerged after 400,000 hectares were burnt. Some online posts, appearing on Facebook profiles and in local community groups, were shared hundreds of times across communities with small populations.

Other conspiracies circulated online include that the bushfires were deliberately lit to encourage wind farms. In the 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires, a similar rumour alleged the fires were lit to enable high-speed rail.

Another theory was that the fires were started by “energy weapons” such as lasers. This has become a regular accusation by conspiracy theorists for bushfires around the world.

Posts circulating online alleged that houses were burnt but vegetation was not – a claim that AAP FactCheck demonstrated to be false.

Experts are warning that the spread of these types of conspiracies will only become more common as extreme weather events increase.

Dr Mathew Marques, a senior lecturer in social psychology at La Trobe University, said it was typical for conspiracy theories to emerge during times of crisis and collective trauma.

“It clearly will become more common with climate change effects increasing,” he said.

Marques said research suggested people turned to conspiracies for explanations at times of catastrophic events.

“The idea is that they're meant to provide this way for people to buffer this anxiety or reduce the frustration of these needs that they've got. Like the need for certainty, need for belonging, need for knowing,” he said. “But the reality is they actually make people feel worse.

“These kinds of stories about bogeymen, or state premiers pulling the strings, don't actually make people feel any better, even though they allow people to attribute the blame to a person, or sometimes a faceless group.”

Marques said people who accepted or promoted these theories often already had a distrust of government or institutions. But there was also a political element at play, he said, with people finding it easier to lay blame on groups with different political allegiances or from different social classes.

Marques said there was little evidence to suggest conspiracy theories had become more common, but social media made them more visible.

“It might just be we're more readily able to view people's sincere or insincere beliefs on social media, so people will talk about them ...” he said.

“It's really hard to gauge whether or not somebody sharing something online sincerely believes it, or whether they're doing it for another reason.”

A 2025 report from the Centre for Resilient and Inclusive Societies, titled Crisis Points, found natural disasters could have political and societal consequences that could be exploited by extremists.

“In so doing, they have tacitly, or sometimes directly, incited and conducted violence against government, response agencies and identified out-groups,” the report says. “It has become increasingly difficult to ensure the take-up of accurate messaging from government or authoritative sources.

“Deliberate disinformation campaigns by malign actors during natural disasters are also increasing and are causing multifaceted harms.”

Associate Professor Josh Roose, an extremism expert at Deakin University, said conspiracies would become more common, but the side effects of this trend were not well understood.

“Governments need a long-term strategy on how they're going to cope with the conspiracy theories that inevitably arise in these contexts,” he said. “It comes back to building trust and building trust with communities.”

Roose said evidence from the developing world showed a rise in extremist groups after natural disasters.

“There's a rapid decline in trust in government and there's a vacuum of information, and conspiracies tend to proliferate in that space,” he said.

Among those who were traumatised, there were also bad faith actors.

 “There are people out there who are profiting from this, both financially but also politically, in seeking to build movements, he said.

“You've only got to get onto Telegram. Look at the “freedom” movement, which still exists to this day, and you'll see how quickly they proliferate in sovereign citizen circles.”

Authorities needed to be transparent and communicate effectively but shouldn't attempt the impossible task of controlling the online space, Roose said.

“What they can do is deal, in particular, with the impacted communities, be physically present on the ground, communicating with them on a daily basis through whatever mechanism necessary.”

Tammy Pitkin worked as a real estate agent in Red Bluff. She disappeared during a trip to Oregon in Oct. 2022.

RED BLUFF, Calif. - The disappearance of Tammy Pitkin, a woman from Red Bluff, remains a mystery more than three years after she vanished while visiting Oregon. Pitkin was last seen on October 17, 2022.

Her new gray Toyota Camry was discovered 12 days later on a forest road, 30 miles east of Sweet Home, Oregon. This location is 400 miles from her home in Red Bluff.

Pitkin's new Toyota Camry was found abandoned on a remote forest road, 30 miles east of Sweet Home, Oregon.

Searchers scoured the area multiple times, but no trace of Pitkin was found. Pitkin's sister, Airaka Laughlin-Bento, said Tammy took her two dogs with her on a getaway to reset.

Tammy Pitkin's dogs, Trooper (left) and Cope (right), were with her at the time of her disappearance. Trooper was found alive near her abandoned car four months later.

Pitkin had lost her job and was going through a divorce. She was well-known in Red Bluff, where her ex-husband and adult son live. Pitkin worked as a realtor and volunteered at a local animal shelter.

Tammy Pitkin of Red Bluff vanished during a trip to Oregon in Oct. 2022

In February 2023, four months after her car was found, one of her dogs, Trooper, was discovered alive in the woods near where the car was recovered. There is still no sign of Tammy or her other dog, Cope.

Laughlin-Bento spoke about a person of interest in Tammy's disappearance. She said it's a man Tammy knew through family and business connections. At the time of Tammy's disappearance, he was living in the same area of Oregon where her car was found.

Tammy Pitkin's abandoned car was found off Highway 20 in rural Linn County, Oregon. It was about 30 miles east of Sweet Home, Oregon.

Laughlin-Bento believes her sister is dead but is dedicated to finding out what happened. She urged people in Red Bluff to help.

""Quit being afraid,"" Laughlin-Bento said. ""I know there are people in Tammy's community who know what happens, who have details regarding what happened to her, things that could help us get her justice.""

""What we need from the public at this point is any little detail that you think is insignificant,"" said Laughlin-Bento. ""These are things that some people think, 'oh, that's not a big deal,"" but it is because it's part of the timeline.""

Pitkin was 54 years old, 5'4"", and weighed 160 pounds. She had blonde hair and hazel eyes. Anyone with information is urged to call the Linn County Sheriff's Office in Oregon at (541) 967-3911 or contact her sister on the Facebook page ""Finding Tammy Pitkin.""

Alex Rogue, host of the Shady podcast ""Erased but Not Forgotten: The Tammy Pitkin Story,"" has interviewed people in Red Bluff and followed Pitkin's path into Oregon. The first four episodes are available on Spotify and other podcast platforms.

According to Alex Rogue, this is the timeline of Pitkin's disappearance:

Oct. 14, 2022: Tammy was last seen by colleagues and her adult son in Red Bluff

Oct. 15, 2022: Tammy left Red Bluff around 3:30 am, refueled in Redding, and drove to Oregon.

Oct. 16, 2022: Tammy stayed at a Best Western hotel in Sutherlin, Oregon.

Oct. 17, 2022: Tammy was last seen on surveillance video in Albany, Oregon.

Oct. 26, 2022: Husband reported Tammy missing to authorities in Tehama County, Calif.

Oct. 29, 2022: Hunters discovered Tammy's car abandoned on a forest road off Highway 20, 30 miles east of Sweet Home, Oregon in the Santiam Wilderness

Feb. 10, 2023: Tammy's dog Trooper was found alive in the woods near where her car had been found abandoned.

We can't shift the chaos we're in until we name it. When we can recognize what's pushing us — in our personal lives and as a society — we already have a degree of freedom from it. Challenging information can paradoxically remind us of the greater good. It is the courage of the people and the love for the common good that brings these injustices to light—fueling open dialogue and constructive action.

A concise essay explores the core reasons there is so much corruption and manipulation in our world and gives inspiring ideas on what we can do to create a brighter future.  

This thought-provoking piece examines how the primary means for manipulating are through promoting fear, secrecy, and polarization, and through distracting people from their deeper purpose in life. It also provides concrete ways we can turn all of this around. 

Don't lose hope. This inspiring essay reminds us in a most eloquent way that we were made for these times. Here's one paragraph of this poetic writing. 

""Ours is not the task of fixing the entire world all at once, but of stretching out to mend the part of the world that is within our reach. Any small, calm thing that one soul can do to help another soul, to assist some portion of this poor suffering world, will help immensely. It is not given to us to know which acts or by whom, will cause the critical mass to tip toward an enduring good.""

Few people wield more power in New York City real estate than Andrew Farkas. Mr. Farkas, 65, is the founder of Island Capital, a merchant bank, and has also been a powerful political benefactor, especially to former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, to whom he has donated millions and whom he employed in a lucrative role when Mr. Cuomo was out of office. He is also friendly with President Trump and has invested in projects of Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law. But a 127-slip marina he owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands has put the billionaire real estate investor in a new and troubling spotlight. His co-owner was Jeffrey Epstein, whose private island served as the grim center of a sex-trafficking operation that was just a few miles south of the marina. Mr. Farkas's name appears in Mr. Epstein's personal emails. Mr. Epstein and Mr. Farkas had regular phone calls. Sometimes they met in person for breakfast in New York. And on one occasion, Mr. Epstein even offered the use of Mr. Farkas's plane to visitors in need. Mr. Epstein's stake in the marina was essentially unknown until 2018, when Jennifer Doelling, the chief financial officer of Island Global Yachting, revealed it during a deposition for a tax audit lawsuit. Mr. Epstein was first charged, on a single count of prostitution, in 2006, one year before the marina deal became final, although allegations had been swirling for years. The victim in the charge had been as young as 14 years old.

New York State's Bedford Hills Correctional facility, Illinois' Pontiac Correctional Center and Albion Correctional Facility in New York State are the three U.S. prisons with the highest reported rates of sexual victimization. These are the findings of a new Department of Justice (DOJ) report about sexual victimization in state and federal prisons, as reported by inmates. The Justice Department carried out a National Inmate Survey in 177 federal prisons. The annual survey is required by the 2003 Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA). The survey of 27,541 state and federal inmates found that some 4.1 percent of adult prison inmates reported being sexually victimized in state and federal prisons during the prior 12 months. Furthermore, 2.3 percent of inmates reported sexual victimization by another inmate while 2.2 percent reported sexual victimization by facility staff. Meanwhile, 17 prisons had rates defined as high compared to other facilities. The data pertains to prisons that participated in the survey so the data may not accurately capture those with the highest sexual victimization in America. The prison with the highest proportion of prison inmates reporting sexual victimization was Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, a female prison in New York where 18.6 percent of inmates reported sexual victimization. Pontiac Correctional Center, a men's prison in Illinois was second, with 15.9 percent of inmates reporting sexual victimization.


Note: These numbers represent a small number of institutions that voluntarily provided survey data for this study. The actual incidence of sexual violence in correctional facilities may be much higher. To understand how disturbing and common sexual abuse in prison is, read this Human Rights Watch report that documents dozens of first-hand accounts of rape and sexual slavery in prison systems across 34 states.

In this solo episode of The Michael Shermer Show, Michael Shermer responds to the shooting of Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old healthcare worker who was killed by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis during protests over enforcement of immigration law. 

As political debate intensifies, Shermer asks a tough question that most discussions are avoiding: What role does personal responsibility play in emotionally charged, high-risk situations?

He separates the facts we can reasonably assert from what remains uncertain and explains why scrutinizing frame-by-frame video misses something essential about how humans behave under stress and fear.

This is Kollen Post reporting from Kyiv on day 1,433 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story: Russia has yet to use Iranian missiles in its war on Ukraine

Iran gave hundreds of its missiles to Russia as a gift to help in its war on Ukraine. So far, they've been plagued by failure to launch. 

Ukrainian intelligence told the Kyiv Independent on Jan. 26 that of the over 350 Fath-360 missiles that Iran has given Russia, none has come down on Ukraine. 

Those dormant Fath missiles contrast with Russia's use of North Korea ballistic missiles, widely seen as shoddy but reportedly improved thanks to Russian assistance. Russia's seeming disinterest in Iran-supplied Faths could be seen a passive indictment of a missile program that Iran has invested in heavily. 

Iranian-designed Shaheds have proved themselves a mainstay of the war in Ukraine, but these days Russia is producing the vast majority of its own supply rather than buying them from Iran, which is currently engaged in a brutal crackdown on protests against the current regime. 

The Council of Europe has a new plan to cut off its continuing dependence on Russian natural gas – next year. 

The EU just gave final approval to the new plan, with barring liquified natural gas by the beginning of 2027 and pipeline natural gas by autumn of the same year. 

The European bloc remains the largest buyer of both pipeline and liquified natural gas from Russia, despite widespread calls to pull away from economic contact with Moscow. 

Russia's Jan. 24 air attack damaged the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, a holy site in Eastern Orthodoxy and a UNESCO heritage location, an official said on Jan. 26. 

""For the first time since the days of the second world war, as a result of military activity the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra was struck,"" general director of the historical preserve Maksym Ostapenko, told Interfax-Ukraine. ""Each time, Moscow has been behind it, as happened in 1918; as happened when, by an order from Moscow, the Uspensk (Dormition) Cathedral was blown up in 1941, and, by an order from Moscow, Shaheds and missiles now fly throughout Kyiv, including those that now inflict damage on the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra.""

The blasts on Jan. 24 blew out windows and damaged plaster on two of the buildings of the Lavra, which includes extensive underground cave complexes and looks out along the Dnipro River. 

Ostapenko was re-appointed as the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra's general director earlier this month after a contentious firing last year. The Lavra itself has long been a zone of tensions due to alleged Russian influence through the orthodox church. 

General Oleksandr Syrsky, Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine's Armed Forces, issued a stark warning about Russia's renewed assaults on Pokrovsk, the long-embattled city in western Donbas. 

""The aggressor is not giving up attempts to break through; he is strengthening pressure and pulling up reserves,"" Syrsky wrote on Facebook on Jan. 26, reporting 400 clashes in the Pokrovsk and Ocheretyne areas. 

One of Ukraine's fortress cities in the west of Donetsk Oblast, Pokrovsk has been a hot spot for Russian attacks for over a year and a half. Russian forces have taken most of the city but fighting continues in the northern areas. 

Russian attacks killed at least three Ukrainians and injure 24 others over the past day, local authorities said on Jan. 26.

Russia launched 138 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight, Ukraine's Air Force reported, including roughly 90 Shahed-type drones. Ukrainian air defenses intercepted 110, but 21 drones struck 11 locations across the country, and drone debris was recorded at one additional site.

In Donetsk Oblast, two died and 13 were injured in Russian attacks on Druzhkivka and Oleksiivo-Druzhkivka, the local military administration reported, recording a total of 18 attacks on civilian areas. 

Authorities evacuated 53 civilians from ares near the frontline, including 22 children.

In Kherson Oblast, Governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported one civilian dead in Russian attacks, which hit 29 municipalities including the city of Kherson itself.  

Two other civilians went to the hospital with injuries including concussions resulting from a Jan. 24 drone strike on their balcony, the oblast government said. 

In Sumy Oblast, which is facing renewed pressure from Russian attacks, authorities reported seven injuries among civilians, including a 59-year-old woman and her 8 and 11-year-old grandchildren.

The oblast fell under air alerts for all but 4.5 hours of the preceding day. 

In Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, the local government reported continued attacks, particularly with FPV drones striking the Nikopol area. Russian attacks injured a 58-year-old man, but seemingly resulted in no deaths. 

In Kharkiv Oblast, Russian attacks including several dozen drones damaged eight homes and apartment buildings throughout the oblast and injured an 80-year-old woman in the city of Kharkiv, Governor Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram. 

In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, Governor Ivan Fedorov reported 775 Russian strikes, which injured two civilians. 

Russia has lost around 1,235,060 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Jan. 26.

The number includes 1,020 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 11,608 tanks, 23,951 armored fighting vehicles, 75,906 vehicles and fuel tanks, 36,644 artillery systems, 1,626 multiple launch rocket systems, 1,286 air defense systems, 434 airplanes, 347 helicopters, 115б813 drones, 28 ships and boats, as well as two submarines.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has told Europe it should “keep on dreaming” if it thinks it can defend itself without the support of the United States.
    


            “If anyone thinks here again that the European Union, or Europe as a whole, can defend itself without the US, keep on dreaming. You can't. We can't. We need each other,” Rutte said during an address to the European Parliament in Brussels on Monday.
    


            The NATO chief warned European nations they would need to increase defense spending to 10% if they “really want to do it alone,” adding they would need to build up their own nuclear capability, costing billions of euros.
    


            “In that scenario, you will lose the ultimate guarantor of our freedom, which is the US nuclear umbrella. So hey, good luck,” he said.
    


            The comments came after a rollercoaster week for Europe and its Western allies, after President Donald Trump continued to advance his demands for the US ownership of Greenland, before publicly ruling out the use of force to annex the Arctic island during his speech at World Economic Forum in Switzerland's Davos.
    


            The NATO chief continued to praise Trump for raising the issue of Arctic security, acknowledging his defense of the president would likely irritate many in the room.
    


            “I think he's right. There is an issue with the Arctic region. There is an issue of collective security, because these sea lanes are opening up, and because the Chinese and the Russians are more and more active,” he said.
    


            Rutte outlined there would be two work streams going forward regarding the Greenland issue. The first would involve NATO taking more collective responsibility for the defense of the Arctic, to prevent Russia and China's access to the region, both militarily and economically.
    


Rinse and Repeat: Western allies ready for next rollercoaster with Donald Trump



            The second would involve the continuation of trilateral discussions between the US, Denmark and Greenland. Rutte said he would not be involved in the discussions, adding that he has no mandate to negotiate on behalf of Denmark, and will not do so.
    


            Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeld met with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington earlier this month. Rasmussen said the meeting was “constructive” but that a “fundamental disagreement” persists.
    


            The following week, Trump and Rutte met in Davos, with the president claiming he had reached a framework for a Greenland deal with the NATO chief, and as a result said he would no longer impose tariffs on European nations that had opposed his ambitions to acquire the semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's not yet fully clear what's included in the framework, or Rutte's exact role in the negotiations, but Trump's stunning about-turn once again shone the spotlight on the NATO secretary general.

EDITOR'S NOTE:  CNN Style is one of the official media partners of Paris Fashion Week. See all coverage here.



            Fashion is not a dignified business. It is messy, constantly changing and prone to disposability — of ideas, trends and especially people.
    


            So it was heartening to see a fashion house celebrate, with pitch-perfect dignity, the departure of one of its longtime designers at Paris Men's Fashion Week on Saturday night. Véronique Nichanian, who for almost four decades oversaw men's clothing at Hermès, marked her final outing with a show that provided a rare moment of elegance in a tumultuous fashion business, and a collection that underscored how this ultra lowkey designer has created a pragmatic lavishness that countless contemporaries have copied in vain.
    


            Nichanian revealed in October that she would depart the French luxury house after 38 years. A respectful few days later, Hermès announced the 71-year-old's successor: Grace Wales Bonner, the British millennial darling whose quiet intelligence has helped her build a small empire on sophisticated, self-assured clothes.
    


What can't a man wear? Designers push the boundaries at Paris Men's Fashion Week



            Such a seamless, peaceful transition of power is wincingly rare in fashion, and stands out against the wider industry mood. Over the past year and a half, in what some have called the “great fashion reset,” designers have been swapped, chopped, substituted for one another and dismissed with seemingly little humanity or under outrageous pressure. An unsettled air now hangs over fashion weeks and flagship stores, where there should be excitement about new ideas. If anyone can leave at any time, or brands change their identity at the drop of a CEO's hat, how do you know what you're buying into when you purchase a handbag or coat? What does it all stand for, aside from a ruthlessness that, while certainly glamorous, feels so ambivalent?
    


            Rather than a romp through her greatest hits on Saturday, Nichanian instead focused on her mandate, just as she's always done: making extraordinarily beautiful clothes for the man who seeks the best in life. Not the flashiest or most fashionable, but the most exquisitely made, the most precise.
    


            Her final collection featured sweaters and scarves crafted from such pure and sweet wool that they bounced with each step; suits slimmed but were not cloyingly youthful. Slightly cropped trousers revealed the shaft of sublime flat boots. A leather suit was stitched with a whisper of chalky pinstripe. There were clothes for Travis Scott (like a crocodile suit), who was sat on the front row; for the man who loves great clothes but is skeptical of “fashion” (loose leather trousers); and for the one who's feeling a little naughty (a brown coat with punch-pink lining).
    


            The show demonstrated how Nichanian has pioneered a language that every brand, from The Row to Uniqlo, is now attempting to recreate in their quest for clothing that transcends trend and time. For too many designers and shoppers today, the pleasure and invention of clothes boils down to something simplistic: mere perfection. Fashion has been remade into the hunt for the “perfect” sweater, the “perfect” trouser or the “right” Oxford shoe. But of course, perfection isn't human, and so we find ourselves searching for timelessness as a defense against a world that refuses to stop changing, for better or worse.
    


            As Nichanian has shown, season after season, it is design, not perfection, that makes clothing peerless. Why else show nubby fleece trousers with a coordinating striped jacket, which nobody needs but would be a hoot to wear? If we are to take away one thing from the Nichanian ethos, it is that clothes should not be “timeless” or strive towards perfection, but be good enough, so that, whatever happens, we feel right.
    


            And that points to Nichanian's greatest strength — and one we would all do well to embrace: longevity. These days, doing anything for longer than a few years can mean risking irrelevance. Longevity means going to work dutifully and doing your job. In fashion, specifically, it means you have honored your customers and put their wishes and needs above an ego that might push you to greener, or stranger, pastures. You see what people want, sometimes before they know they want it and other times just when they've dreamed about it — both are essential. You must be creative but, almost impossibly, on an industry schedule that demands collections twice a year or more.
    


            Nichanian liked to say she didn't design clothing but “vêtements-objets” — clothing as objects, lovely to behold and even more delightful to use. She made the excesses of fashion look pointless without turning to something monastic; instead, she offered sensible sumptuousness. Lines and silhouettes may have morphed over the decades, but her fundamentals remained.
    


            After the models' finale, Nichanian strolled down the runway as an audience of hundreds of clients, celebrities and editors offered her a five-minute standing ovation. She embraced Hermès' artistic director; Eric Clapton's “Forever Man” played; screens hanging from the ceiling played loops of Nichanian bowing at shows throughout her tenure. It was grand but not sentimental, and she grinned and waved like royalty without lingering. She seemed to know that this marvelous chapter of her life was over, and there is more fun to be had elsewhere.

President says his administration is reviewing fatal shooting as Republicans and Democrats criticize ICE surge

US politics live – latest updates

Donald Trump's efforts to deploy militarized immigration agents in US cities may finally be reaching a reckoning as he faces widespread opposition across the US, dissenting lawmakers in his own party, and impending court rulings after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal officers in Minneapolis.

Trump said on Monday that his administration was reviewing the shooting of Pretti in Minneapolis by a federal officer, and that he would send border czar Tom Homan to Minnesota.

“Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Monday. In the same post the president said Congress and the justice department were “looking” at Ilhan Omar, the Democratic Minnesota congresswoman who has been the target of much of Trump's ire in his recent crackdown on the state.

The Trump administration is contending with the fallout from the surge of federal immigration officers to Minnesota and the death of two American citizens in confrontations with federal agents. Lawsuits from state and local officials seeking an end to the federal surge will be heard on Monday in federal court, where a judge will consider a novel legal question: are the thousands of arrests, three shootings and two deaths in the surge so disruptive to civil order that it violates the 10th amendment rights of state sovereignty?

Trump told the Wall Street Journal in a short interview that immigration enforcement officers would leave the Minneapolis area “at some point”. The publication said Trump did not directly answer when asked twice whether the officer who shot Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care nurse, had done the right thing.

In the same interview, Trump criticised Pretti for carrying a gun during protest activity. “I don't like any shooting. I don't like it,” Trump told the publication. “But I don't like it when somebody goes into a protest and he's got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded up with bullets also. That doesn't play good either.”

The Trump administration is facing criticism from all sides over the shootings and upscaled enforcement. The NRA attacked the suggestion by a Trump-appointed federal prosecutor that armed protest creates “a high likelihood” that federal agents “will be legally justified” to shoot protesters. The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, described comments from the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, the senior border patrol leader Greg Bovino and other officials about the shooting as “lies”.

Trump and Walz spoke on Monday morning, Trump wrote on Truth Social, offering conciliatory words about the governor after weeks of vitriol.

“It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” Trump wrote. “I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession. The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future.”

Walz's office issued a statement that hinted at signs of a future de-escalation of the situation. It said the governor and the president had held a “productive” call where Trump “agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals”.

In Minneapolis, Pretti's death resonated with the thousands of people now helping with rapid response and community aid. Outrage over his killing drew some to protest, with a demonstration at a hotel overnight on Sunday bringing federal agents out of their rooms to shoot chemicals at protesters. A memorial for Pretti, filled with flowers, notes and candles, continues to grow on the site where he was gunned down.

The mark of the federal government's occupation can be seen and heard throughout Minneapolis and its suburbs. Signs and spray paint call for “ICE OUT”. After moments of silence for Pretti at sporting events this weekend, crowds chanted against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Residents are not deterred by the violence, though they are shaken. They are still getting into their cars to follow and document ICE's activities, and gathering food and supplies to distribute to the families sheltering at home in fear of deportation.

“Perhaps they want to make an example out of us. Perhaps they're trying to break our spirit. Perhaps they're just dug in,” the Minneapolis city council member Aisha Chughtai told the Guardian on Sunday. “This is a city that has this long history of resistance and of standing up for ourselves and each other. I think we will weather this.”

The widespread outrage is registering in Washington as well, as a growing number of Republicans are pressing for a deeper investigation into federal immigration tactics in Minnesota after Pretti's fatal shooting – a sign that the Trump administration's accounting of events may face bipartisan scrutiny.

The Republican chair of the House homeland security committee, Andrew Garbarino, has sought testimony from leaders at ICE, Customs and Border Protection and US Citizenship and Immigration Services, saying “my top priority remains keeping Americans safe”, according to the Associated Press.

Other congressional Republicans have pressed for more information, including the Texas representative Michael McCaul and the senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Their statements, in addition to concern expressed from several Republican governors, reflects a party struggling with how to respond to federal agents' killing of Pretti.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) almost immediately alleged Pretti had “violently resisted” officers, saying they fired “defensive shots”. Video evidence contradicts that account. Trump also shared an image of the pistol allegedly found on Pretti in a Truth Social post, writing: “This is the gunman's gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!) and ready to go.”

Pretti was reportedly legally permitted to carry a gun. Widely circulated video of his shooting death does not appear to depict him holding a gun; it does show an officer reaching to Pretti's lower back and stepping away with what appeared to be a pistol – and Pretti being subsequently shot to death.

Marjorie Taylor Greene, the former House Republican from Georgia, posted in support of law enforcement, but defended the right to legally carry firearms. “I unapologetically believe in border security and deporting criminal illegal aliens and I support law enforcement. However, I also unapologetically support the 2nd amendment,” Greene wrote. “Legally carrying a firearm is not the same as brandishing a firearm.

She added: “I support American's 1st and 4th amendment rights. There is nothing wrong with legally peacefully protesting and videoing.”

Democrats have vowed to withhold further funding from DHS unless a bill soon to come before the Senate is amended to include reforms that would restrict federal agents' actions in their deportation surge.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said Democrats would not provide the necessary votes if DHS funding remained in the measure. A spokesperson for the Senate majority leader, John Thune, said DHS and other government funds would be voted on as a single package. Without a compromise, the government faces a partial shutdown at the end of January.

The Connecticut Democratic senator Chris Murphy told CNN's State of the Union that Democrats “can't vote to fund this lawless Department of Homeland Security … that is murdering American citizens, that is traumatizing little boys and girls all across the country, in violation of the law.”

Meanwhile, Homan has been the subject of controversy and is unlikely to de-escalate the situation in Minnesota. Undercover FBI agents recorded him accepting $50,000 in cash in 2024 in exchange for promising future government contract help. Trump's justice department closed the bribery investigation last year, citing insufficient evidence, which Democratic leaders have described as a cover-up.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Airbus SE's EADSY new top executive in Canada says the European plane maker has no regrets about taking over Bombardier Inc.'s BBD-B-T C Series jet program despite its continuing challenges and will push to make it profitable as the company weighs when to move ahead with a larger version of the aircraft. 

Guillaume Chevasson started as chief executive of Airbus Canada Limited Partnership and head of the A220 program, formerly the C Series, this past October. He leads roughly 5,000 Airbus employees in the country and says he's optimistic about the jetliner as well as the company's business prospects as the Carney government ramps up defence spending. 

“Airbus took over the C Series in 2018 and today, it's become an essential and strategic product in the Airbus family,” Mr. Chevasson said in a recent interview.

“There is no debate. There is no doubt” inside the company about whether the takeover was worthwhile, he said. 

The executive's bullishness reflects the progress made to date on sales and production flow since Bombardier relinquished ownership of the aircraft, prized for its fuel efficiency and technological prowess. 

Quebec again writes down value of Airbus partnership

But significant obstacles remain, namely achieving a manufacturing cadence that delivers a return for Airbus and the Quebec government – its partner in the venture. 

Airbus has said it needs to produce 14 A220 jetliners a month at its facilities in Mirabel and Mobile, Ala., for the program to break even.

That threshold has proven elusive: Less than a month after Mr. Chevasson stepped in the door as Canada CEO, the plane maker stated that it wouldn't achieve that level in 2026 as previously planned. The new target is now to stabilize output at 12 jets per month this year from the current seven or eight, with no specific timeline for the 14 level. 

The European company has struggled with supplier and labour issues, blaming bottlenecks in airframe components and cabin materials for the delays in getting aircraft into its customers' hands. 

It has also been working to lower the costs of parts for the jet, which were high originally because suppliers demanded more compensation for what was a higher-risk product under Bombardier.

The A220's geared turbofan engines have been another major problem. Pratt & Whitney, the manufacturer, disclosed in 2023 a major and widespread defect in the motors because of what it said was contaminated powder metal used in production. 

A number of airlines have grounded their A220 jets as Pratt worked through a fix and at least one, Egyptair, sold off its A220 fleet entirely. Air Baltic, an early A220 customer, cancelled 4,670 flights last summer as a result of what it said was Pratt's “inability to meet its timely maintenance obligations” for the engines. 

As of last October, nearly 80 A220 jets, or about 18 per cent of the global fleet, was parked or inactive, according to aerospace trade publication Leeham News, though Pratt says the engine issues are related to only 32 of those planes. The engine maker has hatched a solution that is gradually being swapped into all A220s in service while newly built A220s are now being fitted with upgraded engines, Airbus officials say. 

Still, analysts say the trouble has dented the trust airlines had in the aircraft and, more particularly, in the capacity of Pratt & Whitney to offer engine support. Airbus tallied orders for 49 A220s last year and only 17 the year before. 

“The problem is once you get in the queue for the fix, it could be a three to four months waiting process to get in and then a three to four month process to do the overhaul,” said Ernie Arvai of U.S. aerospace consultancy AirInsight. “That's a long time to keep an airplane on the ground.”

Back in Mirabel, the opening of a dedicated subassembly area in 2022 in a hangar formerly used for Bombardier CRJ jets has improved production flow. Airbus's takeover last month of the A220 work packages previously done by struggling Spirit AeroSystems Holdings in Belfast should also help, bringing manufacturing of the aircraft's composite wings and other pieces in-house. 

Airbus simply needs more time to digest the Spirit operations and work through the introduction of the optimized engine with Pratt & Whitney, which has complicated the A220 production ramp up, Mr. Chevasson said. 

All the tools are in hand now to boost the production rate further while the corrections to in-service aircraft should be mostly done by the end of this year, he said. 

Still, analysts say the aircraft needs more sales to cement its viability. As of the end of December, the jet maker has struck deals for 949 A220s from 32 different customers, including major carriers like Delta Airlines, Jet Blue and Air Lease Corp. It has a backlog of 467 jets ordered but not yet delivered, which is about five years of work at current rates. 

Some airlines such as U.S. budget carrier Breeze and Air France are keen on Airbus offering a stretched version of the A220 that would seat up to 180 passengers. Mr. Chevasson said Airbus is working on exactly that but that a final decision to move ahead hasn't been made.

Quebec, which had invested US$1-billion in the plane program to help Bombardier avoid financial collapse, held a 16-per-cent stake when Airbus took control and later boosted its share to 25 per cent, while Airbus owns the other 75 per cent. The province has since written off the initial US$1-billion investment and, last fall, reduced by half the estimated value of its current stake in the limited partnership, pegging it at US$300-million. 

“It's a legitimate question to ask whether Quebec will recoup the money,” said Mehran Ebrahimi, an aerospace specialist at the University of Quebec at Montreal. “But we shouldn't only look at it through an accountant's lens.” 

Airbus's expansion in Quebec has created 2,000 new jobs and bolstered the wider aerospace cluster as the giant's work practices and know-how filters down to smaller manufacturers, Mr. Ebrahimi said. All those elements have “paid off and they'll continue to pay off” for years to come, he said. 

Mr. Chevasson, a native of Toulouse, France, with two young kids, says he's looking forward to building a life in Quebec, cold and all. 

“What Airbus has here in Mirabel is fairly unique” outside Europe, Mr. Chevasson said. “We can build, develop, support and flight test an aircraft. That's unique. We've got big decisions that are coming potentially and investments. … There's more work to do.”

The union vowed to do everything in its power to ensure Congress members who vote to fund DHS are voted out.

The largest nurses' union in the U.S. has demanded the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after a federal agent shot and killed nurse Alex Pretti on Saturday, joining a rapidly growing chorus calling for Congress to do away with the rogue agency.

In a statement, National Nurses United (NNU) strongly condemned the killing of Pretti, saying the shooting demonstrates the “violence, terror, and lawlessness” and “dire public health threat” that federal immigration agencies pose to communities nationwide.

“The nation's nurses, who make it their mission to care for and save human lives, are horrified and outraged that immigration agents have once again committed cold-blooded murder of a public observer who posed no threat to them,” NNU said. “ICE agents have been kidnapping hard working people — mothers, fathers, and children — and now murdered a registered nurse, one of the most trusted professions in the country.”

“Nurses demand the immediate abolition of ICE,” the group said. “Abolish ICE now.”

Pretti, 37, was an intensive care nurse at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital. He was shot and killed by a Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agent on Saturday as he was filming immigration agents conducting a raid on a Minneapolis street. Videos from bystanders showed multiple agents tackling him, taking his gun, and then shooting at him at least 10 times, killing him.

In their statement, NNU called on the Senate to block the funding package for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) slated to come to a vote this week. Senate Democrats have said that they are going to block the vote, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reportedly told his caucus in a call on Sunday not to back calls to abolish the agency; instead, he said, the message must be to “restrain, reform and restrict ICE.”

On the date of the general strike in Minneapolis on Friday, just a day before Pretti's killing, NNU had put out a statement condemning the House for its passage of the DHS appropriations bill. 

The union, which has 225,000 members, has pledged to do “everything in our power” to get any members of Congress who vote to pass funding for ICE voted out of office.

Pretti was also a union member, part of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which condemned his killing in a statement, but did not name ICE. 

Other nurses' unions have spoken out, including the Oregon Nurses Association, which said: “Provision 8.2 of the American Nurses Association Code of Ethics for Nurses is clear: ‘Where there are human rights violations, nurses ought to and must stand up for those rights and demand accountability.' That is exactly what Alex was doing.”

Those who knew Pretti have described him as a man who was drawn to nursing and opposed to ICE's raids because of his deep care for people and passion for helping those in need. Pretti's family condemned the Trump administration's “sickening lies” about Pretti, as officials sought to label him as a terrorist and “would-be assassin” after the shooting.

NNU's statement adds to growing calls for the abolition of ICE, which, along with DHS and CBP, was created under the Bush administration in order to surveil Americans and enforce the global “war on terror” at home, to disastrous effect.

Pretti was the second person to be shot and killed by federal agents on the streets of Minneapolis in a matter of weeks, with agents killing Renee Nicole Good earlier this month.

As a result of escalating ICE violence, polls have found rapidly increasing support for abolishing ICE. Whereas data analyzed by Civiqs in January 2025 found that only 24 percent of Americans supported abolishing the agency, a YouGov/Economist poll found last week that 45 percent now support the idea, tied with those opposed.

Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump's crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.

            The European Union has launched a wide-reaching investigation into Elon Musk's Grok chatbot on X following global outrage over its ability to generate sexually explicit images, including of children.
    


            The scandal erupted at the end of last year when the AI chatbot churned out a barrage of digitally undressed images of women and children in response to requests from users.
    


            The global outcry that followed was met by an initial announcement by X that the tool would be limited to paying subscribers, but the company eventually prevented all users from using Grok to create images of real people in revealing clothing.
    


            The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said in a statement Monday that the investigation would examine whether X “properly assessed and mitigated risks associated with the deployment of Grok's functionalities into X in the EU.”
    


            Henna Virkkunen, a senior commission official focusing on technology, as well security and democracy, said in the statement: “Sexual deepfakes of women and children are a violent, unacceptable form of degradation. With this investigation, we will determine whether X has met its legal obligations… or whether it treated rights of European citizens – including those of women and children – as collateral damage of its service.”
    


            When contacted for comment, X referred CNN to a January 14 statement on its social media platform that said among other things: “We take action to remove high-priority violative content, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and non-consensual nudity, taking appropriate action against accounts that violate our X rules. We also report accounts seeking Child Sexual Exploitation materials to law enforcement authorities as necessary.”
    


After days of outrage, X restricts Grok's ability to create explicit images



            In a briefing for journalists, another European Commission official acknowledged the measures taken by X so far but said the company had not properly assessed the risks before launching the chatbot.
    


            The probe was opened under the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires Big Tech companies to do more to tackle illegal and harmful online content.
    


            There is no timeline for completing the probe nor any indication of what action the European Commision might take based on its findings. However, the official, who asked to remain anonymous, told journalists the body had “quite a few tools at our disposal” and that a fine was possible.
    


            “What we are after is changing the platform's behavior,” they said.
    


            The EU hit the social media platform with a fine of around $140 million in December, saying the “deceptive design” of its blue verification checkmark and other features violated the Digital Services Act. At the time, Musk called the fine “crazy.”
    


            When asked whether the fine had been paid, the unnamed EU official said it had not but that the company still had time to settle it.
    


            Earlier this month, California Attorney General Rob Bonta also announced an investigation into the “proliferation of non-consensual sexually explicit material produced using Grok.”
    


            Grok is still banned in Indonesia and Malaysia as a result of the image generation controversy. UK regulator Ofcom has also launched a formal investigation into X.

Live Updates


            • Trump-Walz call: President Donald Trump struck a notable shift in tone after a call with Gov. Tim Walz, saying they're “on a similar wavelength.” Walz said Trump agreed to consider reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota.
    


            • Border czar to Minnesota: Trump earlier said he is sending Tom Homan to the state, following the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti in an encounter Saturday with federal agents.
    


            • Few details back claims: Federal officials have declined to provide critical details substantiating their claim an agent shot Pretti in self-defense. Read CNN's fact check and watch analysis of videos from several angles.
    


            • In court today: A judge heard arguments on whether to temporarily halt the immigration crackdown in Minnesota. Separately, a federal court hearing is set for today after a judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking federal agencies from destroying or altering evidence related to Pretti's killing.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration could pull back on the deployment of US Customs and Border Protection in Minnesota if state officials cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on the ground.
    


            President Donald Trump has called for more cooperation from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, including that they “turn over” all undocumented immigrants incarcerated in the state to federal authorities.
    


            “If Gov. Walz and Mayor Frey implement these commonsense cooperative measures, CBP will no longer be needed to support ICE on the ground in Minnesota,” Leavitt said during today's White House press briefing.
    


                    “ICE and local law enforcement will peacefully work together as they are effectively doing in so many other states and jurisdictions to remove violent criminals from American neighborhoods across the country,” she added.
                





Remember: A surge of federal immigration officers in Minnesota has left the Midwestern state on edge for weeks, with Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in an encounter with Border Patrol officers marking the second time a US citizen has been fatally shot by federal law enforcement this month. Border Patrol is an agency within Customs and Border Protection.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called President Donald Trump a strong supporter of Americans' Second Amendment rights, days after Trump and other officials questioned why Alex Pretti was carrying a firearm prior to being fatally shot by federal agents.
    


            “There has been no greater supporter or defender of the right to bear arms than President Donald J. Trump,” she said during a White House press briefing.
    


            Still, Leavitt qualified her statement by cautioning that “Americans do not have a right to impede lawful immigration enforcement operations,” and blamed Pretti for inviting the altercation that led to his death.
    


            “Any gun owner knows that when you are carrying a weapon, when you are bearing arms, and you are confronted by law enforcement, you are raising the assumption of risk and the risk of force being used against you,” Leavitt said. “And again, that's unfortunately what took place on Saturday.”
    


            Trump in a Truth Social post over the weekend questioned why Pretti had been carrying a gun and additional magazines. FBI Director Kash Patel also sought to shift blame on Sunday, saying in an interview that “you cannot bring a firearm loaded with multiple magazines to any sort of protest.”
    


            Tom Homan, the White House border czar, will now be the “main point of contact on the ground in Minneapolis,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
    


            Trump said today he is sending Tom Homan to Minnesota this evening, following Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti.
    


            Meanwhile, top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino will “continue to lead” the agency nationwide, Leavitt said.
    


            Bovino's heavy-handed enforcement style has been supported by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem but has also drawn criticism. He has been seen in Minneapolis amid heightened tensions in recent weeks.
    


            The White House is tamping down any appearance of conflict between Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan, as CNN reports they have at times been at odds. US officials told CNN the two have generally not spoken to each other in recent months.
    


            “Mr. Homan is doing an exceptional job and he has been working with Secretary Noem and President Trump over the course of the last year. ” Leavitt said during a press briefing.
    


            “Secretary Noem is also in charge of FEMA and we're in the wake of a brutal winter storm where hundreds of thousands of Americans have been impacted by that. Border czar Homan is in a unique position to drop everything and go to Minnesota to continue having productive conversations with state and local officials,” Leavitt added.
    


            Leavitt also reiterated numerous times in Monday's briefing that the president still has “confidence and trust” in Noem.
    


Some context: President Donald Trump's announcement Monday morning that Homan is being dispatched to Minneapolis suggested a potential sidelining of the heavy-handed tactics used by top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and underscored the internal dispute within the administration over executing the president's immigration agenda.
    


            The move has been met with relief from some Homeland Security officials who have been waiting for Homan to weigh in, given his vast experience in federal law enforcement.
    


CNN's Priscilla Alvarez contributed.



            A two-hour hearing in a federal courtroom in Minneapolis ended today with no immediate decision from a judge on whether to order the Trump administration to suspend Operation Metro Surge.
    


            Judge Katherine Menendez did not say when she will rule on the request from the state and the Twin Cities, but assured the attorneys, “If I had a burner in front of the front burner, this would be on it.”
    


            Attorneys for the state of Minnesota argued statements made by President Donald Trump and US Attorney General Pam Bondi showed the surge of agents into the Minneapolis area was intended to “stir the pot” and coerce the state to adopt Trump-approved policies on immigration rather than achieve a law enforcement objective.
    


            An attorney for the federal government said the surge was connected to those policies because the state's lack of cooperation forced federal officials to take immigration enforcement in Minnesota into their own hands, using the president's constitutional authority.
    


            “I think it kind of goes without saying that we are in shockingly unusual times,” Menendez said.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she has not heard President Donald Trump commit to releasing the federal agents' body camera footage from the fatal shooting of ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minnesota.
    


            “That's not something I've heard the president commit to, so I won't do that from the podium,” she said today in a press briefing at the White House.
    


            Leavitt was asked by CNN's Alayna Treene whether ICE agents should wear body cameras so the footage could be used to settle disputed accounts of activity on the ground.
    


            “Well, that's a policy question that I know the policy folks in the building are having with members on Capitol Hill, and I'll leave it to them and the president to make that decision,” Leavitt said.
    


Some context: CNN was first to report that at least two officers involved in the Saturday incident were wearing body cameras, which are part of the internal review.
    


            Federal agencies like ICE aren't required to wear body cameras, thanks to a 2025 executive order by Trump rescinding a Biden-era policy. Agents have relied on phone cameras to record during tense situations, a practice that has come under scrutiny, as CNN has reported.
    


This post has been updated with additional information.



            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Donald Trump has not characterized Alex Pretti as a “domestic terrorist,” despite claims made by members of his administration.
    


            “I have not heard the president characterize Mr. Pretti in that way. However, I have heard the president say he wants to let the facts and the investigation lead itself,” Leavitt said during a White House press briefing.
    


            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller have both likened Pretti, who as fatally shot in an encounter Saturday with federal agents, to a domestic terrorist.
    


            When pushed again on claims from the administration and whether Miller will apologize for his comments against Pretti, Leavitt said the investigation is underway.
    


            “Nobody here at the White House, including the president of the United States, wants to see Americans hurt or killed and losing their lives in American streets,” Leavitt said.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt avoided answering when asked why Trump administration officials rushed to issue unfounded claims in the hours after Alex Pretti was shot and before an investigation had taken place.
    


            “Well, look, this has obviously been a very fluid and fast-moving situation throughout the weekend,” Leavitt told reporters during a White House news briefing.
    


            Leavitt distinguished President Donald Trump's mindset on the shooting from statements made by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and top White House aide Stephen Miller, who called Pretti a “domestic terrorist.”
    


            “As for President Trump, whom I speak for, he has said that he wants to let the investigation continue and let the facts lead in this case,” Leavitt said.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt insisted Monday that the Trump administration believes its mass deportation operation remains broadly popular with Americans, despite the intensifying blowback over the killing of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.
    


                    “Americans overwhelmingly want exactly what President Trump is delivering: strong borders and strict immigration enforcement against the worst illegal aliens,” she said during a White House press briefing, adding that “polling shows huge support for this exact thing.”
                





            Leavitt's defense of the administration's approach came two days after a federal agent fatally shot Pretti, prompting calls from both sides of the aisle for officials to reevaluate their enforcement presence in Minneapolis.
    


            The administration's aggressive tactics in Minnesota and other states over the last several months have weighed on voters' views of President Donald Trump's immigration policy, according to a range of polling, including rising disapproval of Immigration and Customs Enforcement's tactics even among those who support Trump's handling of the southern border.
    


            Leavitt on Monday blamed state and local officials for failing to help with the deportation efforts, vowing that Trump “will never back down from his promise to deport violent criminal illegal aliens.”
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the FBI and Department of Homeland Security are actively conducting investigations into the shooting of Alex Pretti.
    


            Saturday's shooting remains under active investigation by Homeland Security Investigations and the FBI, Leavitt said, and Customs and Border Protection is also conducting its own internal review.
    


            “As President Trump said yesterday, the administration is reviewing everything with respect to the shooting, and we will let that investigation play out,” Leavitt said.
    


            However, top Cabinet and White House officials on Saturday have mad declarative statements about Pretti, including White House chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, who called him a “domestic terrorist.”
    


            Leavitt added: “Nobody in the White House, including President Trump, wants to see people getting hurt or killed in America's streets. This includes Renee Good, Alex Pretti, the brave men and women of federal law enforcement and the many Americans who have been victimized at the hands of illegal alien criminals.”
    


            Investigators have interviewed the immigration agents involved in Saturday's shooting of Alex Pretti, according to a federal law enforcement source.
    


            Investigators are also reviewing footage from several officers involved in the incident that led to the fatal shooting, a senior Department of Homeland Security official said Monday.
    


            CNN was first to report that at least two officers involved in the incident were wearing body cameras, which are part of the internal review.
    


            The investigation is being led by the Department's Homeland Security Investigations agency, while local officials in Minnesota are conducting their own independent investigation.
    


            The footage could be a key part of both investigations, given the close range of the shooting, which was also recorded by bystanders.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed elected Democrats for the “tragedy” in Minnesota, specifically calling out Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.
    


            The comments came shortly after President Donald Trump wrote on social media that he had a “very good call” with Walz, saying they're “on a similar wavelength.”
    


                    “This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota,” Leavitt said during Monday's press briefing. “For weeks, Gov. Walz and the mayor, Jacob Frey, and other elected Democrats were spreading lies about federal law enforcement officers who are risking their lives daily to remove the worst criminal illegal aliens from our streets.”
                





More on the call: Walz called his conservation with the president “productive” and said Trump agreed to consider reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota.
    


            Ahead of Friday's government funding deadline, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is demanding Senate Majority Leader John Thune separate the Department of Homeland Security funding bill from the other five appropriations bills in the package.
    


            In a statement, Schumer said, “If Leader Thune puts those five bills on the floor this week, we can pass them right away. If not, Republicans will again be responsible for another government shutdown.”
    


            All 100 senators would have to agree to separate the DHS funding bill, which includes funding for ICE, from the rest of the package. If even one senator objects, then that portion will remain in the package, setting the stage for a partial government shutdown.
    


            As she decides how to respond to a request from the state of Minnesota to order an end to Operation Metro Surge, a federal judge expressed skepticism over whether the operation is really addressing law enforcement concerns.
    


            “No disrespect, but you all named it. You all declared it. You said when it started,” US District Court Judge Katherine Menendez said during a court hearing in Minnesota on the matter today. “Presumably since you created it, you understand its scope.”
    


            The judge's frustration came after a Department of Justice attorney was unable to say how many officers have been deployed to the Twin Cities under Operation Metro Surge. Menendez said some administration demands — such as requiring jails to turn over immigration suspects to ICE — don't seem to be fixed by sending in thousands of agents.
    


            “Hundreds and hundreds of people being arrested (in the surge) have never been in jail, so that change wouldn't have changed anything,” Menendez said.
    


            Administration attorney Brantley Mayers said the state cannot claim the 10th Amendment allows it to both avoid cooperation with federal immigration and prevent the federal government from sending more agents to do work the state refuses to do.
    


            “If they change their policy tomorrow, one of the goals of the surge would have been accomplished,” Mayers said.
    


            Menendez said at the conclusion of the hearing that she was not immediately prepared to rule on the request, which she acknowledged presented many difficult legal questions.
    


            “Here we have executive action that isn't on paper; it's in the street,” Menendez said. “But that can't put it beyond the reach of consideration.”
    


            Today's hearing related to a lawsuit in which Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seek an end to Operation Metro Surge, the federal government's influx of immigration officers into the Minneapolis area. The plaintiffs first want an order that would temporarily halt the operation while the suit plays out.
    


            Republican lawmakers are privately expressing relief that border czar Tom Homan will be taking over leadership of the immigration operations in Minnesota, sources told CNN.
    


            “He knows what he's doing. He gets it,” one Republican lawmaker told CNN, saying Homan understands the system and how to do enforcement operations the “correct way.”
    


            Homan is longtime border official with decades of law enforcement experience. While Homan has pushed for some of the Trump administration's most controversial immigration-related policies, allies and advisers view him as being “a grown-up,” one source said.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune publicly praised the president's decision Monday, calling Homan's assignment a “positive development.”
    


            “This is a positive development — one that I hope leads to turning down the temperature and restoring order in Minnesota,” the Republican leader wrote on X. “I encourage local officials in Minnesota to work with the administration to keep communities safe and continue the important work of enforcing our laws and getting dangerous criminals off of America's streets.”
    


            Lawmakers have been stressing to the White House for weeks the importance of getting the messaging right on immigration, two sources told CNN. The sources stressed they still support Trump's immigration crackdown and believe the country does too, but they felt the White House was not articulating a thought-out plan to the public.
    


            On the shooting of Alex Pretti in Minnesota over the weekend, Republican allies and advisers told CNN no one should be getting ahead of an investigation.
    


            “I think everyone wants a transparent and independent investigation,” one lawmaker said. “It seems the White House is getting that message, or at least I hope they are.”
    


This post has been updated with additional reaction.



            Two Italian journalists for state broadcaster RAI posted video of an altercation they had with ICE agents while reporting in Minneapolis over the weekend.
    


            Journalist Laura Cappon and filmmaker Daniele Babbo were riding alongside activists who were following ICE vehicles, when their own car was surrounded by ICE vehicles, according to the video posted on social media for RAI's “In Mezz'Ora” program.
    


            In the video, the driver, who identified herself as Rachel Thunder, can be heard telling someone a description of the ICE vehicle she and the journalists were following.
    


            “We're not doing anything wrong,” Thunder says to the passengers in the car. “We haven't broken any laws.”
    


            Cappon can then be heard speaking in Italian saying there is one ICE vehicle in front of them and another behind them. “They're trapping us,” she says in English. “So we are trapped.”
    


            In the video, an ICE agent can be seen approaching the vehicle, and Thunder can be heard telling the officers, “I'm not doing anything wrong, I'm just driving around my community.” Cappon repeatedly says, “Press, we are press,” during the altercation.
    


            The officer then says, “This is the only warning. If you keep following us from this point on, you are on camera right now, we will break your window and we will pull you out of the vehicle.”
    


            The incident has caused backlash in Italy, with opposition leaders calling on Italian Prime Minsiter Giorgia Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani to formally protest the incident.
    


            Spokespeople for both leaders have not responded to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the RAI program told CNN the video speaks for itself and did not rule out filing a formal complaint.
    


            Gov. Tim Walz said President Donald Trump agreed to consider reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and pledged to talk to his Department of Homeland Security about ensuring state officials can investigate Saturday's fatal shooting.
    


            The two leaders spoke by phone Monday morning, with Trump also describing it as “a good call.” The comments marked a notable shift in tone from the president, who has repeatedly attacked Minnesota Democratic officials.
    


            In the full readout from Walz's office, the Minnesota governor said he argued to Trump that there needs to be “impartial investigations of the Minneapolis shootings involving federal agents, and that we need to reduce the number of federal agents in Minnesota.”
    


            Walz's office said the president agreed to talk to DHS “about ensuring the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is able to conduct an independent investigation, as would ordinarily be the case.”
    


            Walz said Trump “also agreed to look into reducing the number of federal agents in Minnesota and working with the state in a more coordinated fashion on immigration enforcement regarding violent criminals.”
    


            Trump has called for more cooperation from Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, including that they “turn over” all undocumented immigrants incarcerated in the state to federal authorities.
    


            “The Governor reminded President Trump that the Minnesota Department of Corrections already honors federal detainers by notifying Immigration and Customs Enforcement when a person committed to its custody isn't a U.S. citizen,” Walz's office said.
    


            Members of the Minnesota National Guard handed out coffee, hot chocolate, donuts and hand warmers to protesters and others outside the Whipple Federal Building in frigid Minneapolis temperatures Sunday.
    


            A guardsman on the scene told CNN affiliate WCCO that the hospitality was their “demonstration of safety and security and that they're here to help.”
    


            The guardsmen in the video were wearing reflective yellow vests, which the Guard has said is “to help distinguish them from other agencies in similar uniforms.”
    


            “These Minnesota National Guardsmen live, work, and serve in our state, and are focused on protecting life, preserving property, and ensuring Minnesotans can safely exercise their First Amendment rights,” the Guard previously posted online.
    


            The Whipple Federal Building, where many people are temporarily detained after being taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, has become a site of steady crowds and demonstrations against the immigration enforcement blitz in Minnesota.
    


            Gov. Tim Walz activated the National Guard to assist Hennepin County law enforcement with crowd control and to provide backup to Minneapolis police.

            Facing a lawsuit requesting an end to Operation Metro Surge in the Twin Cities, a Trump administration attorney said the surge of federal agents is to enforce the law, not coerce the state to change its policies.
    


            “If you work with us, we will probably need less resources, less boots on the ground,” Department of Justice attorney Brantley Mayers said during a federal court hearing in Minnesota this morning.
    


            Today's hearing — which still is underway — relates to a lawsuit in which Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul seek an end to Operation Metro Surge, the federal government's influx of immigration officers into the Minneapolis area.  The plaintiffs first want a temporary restraining order that would halt the operation while the suit plays out.
    


            Judge Katherine Menendez asked if there was any legal boundary to the number of federal officers that could be sent to the state.
    


            “Would 10,000 ICE agents on the ground in the Twin Cities cross the line?” Menendez asked. “I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcement of immigration law?”
    


            “I have a hard time (believing) there is a judicially administrable line as to when too many boots on the ground is too many,” Mayers responded.
    


            Menendez spoke skeptically about President Trump's online January 13 statement that the state would get a “day of reckoning & retribution,” but Mayers said the president's threats don't affect his power.
    


            “I don't think that would negate the fact that there is legitimate law enforcement activity going on in Minnesota that the federal government has the authority to do,” he said.
    


            President Donald Trump said Monday that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called him “with the request to work together with respect to Minnesota” and that he facilitated a call between Walz and border czar Tom Homan, who the president is sending to the state.
    


            “It was a very good call, and we, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, striking a notably conciliatory tone, given how he and other administration officials have repeatedly attacked Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.
    


                    “I told Governor Walz that I would have Tom Homan call him, and that what we are looking for are any and all Criminals that they have in their possession. The Governor, very respectfully, understood that, and I will be speaking to him in the near future,” Trump said, adding that Walz is “happy” Homan is going to Minnesota.
                





            Trump emphasized “tremendous SUCCESS” with federal coordination in other cities, ending on an optimistic note: “Both Governor Walz and I want to make it better!”
    


            CNN has reached out to Walz's office for comment on the call.
    


            Just yesterday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Walz of spreading “malicious lies about federal law enforcement officers,” “placing targets” on their backs and encouraging chaos.
    


            Trump's request for cooperation was part of a list of demands he posted on social media Sunday night, calling on Walz, Frey and every Democratic governor and mayor to “to enforce our Nation's Laws, rather than resist and stoke the flames of Division, Chaos, and Violence.”

The Federal Aviation Administration says a private aircraft with eight people on board has crashed on takeoff from Bangor International Airport in Maine. There was no immediate word on the conditions of those aboard.

BANGOR, Maine (AP) — A private aircraft carrying eight people crashed on takeoff Sunday night at Maine's Bangor International Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said.

The Bombardier Challenger 600 crashed around 7:45 p.m., and there was no immediate word on the conditions of those aboard. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating. 

The crash occurred as New England and much of the country grappled with a massive winter storm. Bangor had undergone steady snowfall Sunday along with many other parts of the country. 




The airport issued a statement that emergency crews were on the scene at the airport, which was closed after what it described as an incident involving a single aircraft departing the airport. 

Bangor International Airport offers direct flights to cities like Orlando, Florida, Washington, D.C., and Charlotte, North Carolina, and is located about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Boston.

Throughout the weekend, the vast storm dumped sleet, freezing rain and snow across much of the eastern half of the U.S., halting much air and road traffic and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses in the Southeast. 

Commercial air traffic was also heavily disrupted around much of the U.S.

Some 12,000 flights were canceled Sunday and nearly 20,000 were delayed, according to the flight tracker flightaware.com. Airports in Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore, North Carolina, New York and New Jersey were among those impacted.

The Bombardier Challenger 600 is a wide-bodied business jet configured for nine to 11 passengers. It was launched in 1980 as the first private jet with a “walk-about cabin” and remains a popular charter option, according to aircharterservice.com

Fox News correspondent Griff Jenkins reports on the Trump administration's expansion of immigration enforcement operations into Maine on ‘Special Report.'

As anti-ICE protests continue to erupt across the country, a new Maine law restricting cooperation between state law enforcement and federal immigration authorities is set to take effect after Democratic Gov. Janet Mills declined to veto or delay the measure, drawing renewed criticism over her progressive record as she runs for Senate.

The law, passed by Maine's Democrat-controlled legislature late last year, will soon take effect after the current legislative session ends and bars state and local law enforcement from assisting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a wide range of civil immigration matters. 

Even though the law has not officially taken effect, Mills, who declined to veto or sign the law, which will take effect without her signature, has already ordered Maine State Police to begin enforcing its provisions, according to a report from the Portland Press Herald.

The legislation passed the Maine legislature by just one vote last year.

ICE LAUNCHES NEW OPERATION IN MAINE AMID TRUMP'S BROADER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CRACKDOWN AROUND THE US

Mills, who is running for Senate in the Democratic primary to unseat moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins, has recently called ICE ""secret police"" and said their ""reckless actions"" have ""no place here.""

As ICE ramps up activity in Maine, including over 50 arrests in one day last week, Republicans in the state have pushed back against the ICE rhetoric coming from Mills.

""Let me be very clear: ICE agents are federal law enforcement officers,"" Assistant House Republican Leader Katrina Smith said last week. ""They take an oath. They operate under federal authority. And they show up to work knowing that rhetoric alone can make them a target. You can oppose immigration policy without turning the people enforcing the law into enemies.""

Mills released a statement on Saturday, shortly after federal immigration agents shot and killed an armed man in Minneapolis, demanding a meeting with President Trump and for him to remove ICE from Maine.

The immigration law is the latest in a series of high-profile decisions that critics say underscore Mills' liberal record as Maine prepares for her State of the State address later this month.

Since taking office, Mills has expanded eligibility for MaineCare, the state's Medicaid program, to include non-citizens regardless of immigration status. The policy allows taxpayer-funded health care for non-citizen children and pregnant individuals, a move Republicans say has driven up costs for working Mainers. State records show Maine has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on health care for individual illegal immigrants in recent years.

MaineWire reported last month on a photo from a Maine city bus advertising how MaineCare is now being offered to ""pregnant people and children under 21, with or without proof of citizenship"" which prompted criticism of Mills from the National Republican Senatorial Committee. 

Mills has also repeatedly clashed with Trump, most notably over transgender policies. Last year, she publicly confronted the president over federal funding threats tied to allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's sports, vowing to sue the administration if funding was withheld.

Her administration has signed and defended a slate of laws expanding access to gender-affirming care, including protections for minors to receive certain treatments even if parents object, mandates requiring insurance coverage for such care, and measures shielding providers from out-of-state legal action.

On abortion, Mills has signed legislation expanding who can perform abortions, removed criminal penalties tied to reproductive care, and strengthened protections for providers and patients traveling to Maine from other states.

Ultimately, the NRSC told Fox News Digital it believes Mills is more focused on a ""progressive agenda"" than she is on results for the state. 

""Janet Mills has spent her time as Governor expanding transgender rights, offering taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal aliens, and combating the Trump administration every chance she gets,"" NRSC Regional Press Secretary Samantha Cantrell told Fox News Digital. 

""Mainers deserve a Senator who is focused on delivering real results, not Janet Mills who is more concerned with pushing her progressive agenda on Maine.""

Authorities in upstate South Carolina have arrested the 19-year-old grandson of a retired couple found slain in their home earlier this month, charging him with two counts of murder in a case that has shaken a small rural community.

The Oconee County Sheriff's Office said Levi Kevin Jones was taken into custody late Friday and charged in connection with the deaths of Larry Moore, 76, and Sandra Moore, 75, who were discovered inside their residence on Cromer Moore Road near Westminster on Jan. 15.

Jones is also charged with two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, according to arrest warrants obtained by Fox News Digital. He remains in custody pending a bond hearing.

The couple was found after a family member requested a welfare check when repeated attempts to reach them were unsuccessful. Investigators and the county coroner later determined the deaths were homicides.

According to the Oconee County Coroner's Office, Larry Moore died from multiple stabbing injuries, while Sandra Moore died from manual strangulation. Autopsies were conducted the following day.

Arrest warrants allege Jones stabbed his grandfather multiple times in the torso and neck and strangled his grandmother, cutting off her airway and blood flow. Authorities said a knife was used during the attack.

Authorities have not provided a motive for the attack.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Minneapolis readies for more protests after Alex Pretti killing as Trump dispatches troubleshooter Tom Homan","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/immigration/4433160/minneapolis-readies-more-protests-alex-pretti-killing-judges-debate-ending-ice-minnesota-operation/","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:10:27 GMT","

Minnesotans are rallying for another day of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement‘s continued operation in the state, after a second protester was killed by federal law enforcement personnel over the weekend.

Residents have been demonstrating despite the frigid temperatures after Alex Pretti was killed by a Border Patrol agent. Pretti was killed during a physical altercation after he had been recording federal operations on his cellphone and had intervened, which resulted in a melee. Now, President Donald Trump is sending “border czar” Tom Homan to Minnesota on Monday night to report directly back to the president on the situation there.

“He has not been involved in that area, but knows and likes many of the people there,” Trump wrote in a post Monday morning. “Tom is tough but fair, and will report directly to me.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Homan going to the city is “good news for peace, safety, and accountability.”

A sit-in at the state capitol is planned for Monday morning in St. Paul, while some University of Minnesota students are staging a walkout at noon and skipping classes, echoing previous actions. Later in the evening, other students are headed to a Twin Cities Hilton hotel, which they believe is housing ICE officers, telling participants to “Get these fascist bastards out of our cities.”

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE FATAL SHOOTING OF ALEX PRETTI IN MINNESOTA

Also on Monday, two courts will consider separate cases that could hold sweeping ramifications for ICE's presence in Minnesota, and the Trump administration's efforts to carry out deportation sweeps in blue states antagonistic to the White House. 

At 2 p.m., a federal judge in Saint Paul will hear arguments regarding Minnesota's attempt to access evidence from the latest shooting involving an ICE operation on Saturday. Pretti, 37, died during the incident, prompting more backlash against the Trump administration. Trump weighed in on the case over the weekend, announcing the shooting is under investigation, while expressing concern that Pretti was carrying a gun during anti-ICE protests. He had a lawful carry permit.

There is already a restraining order approved by U.S. District Judge Eric Tostrud that has paused any destruction or alteration of evidence. 

In another court hearing, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Menendez is set to consider arguments centered on Minnesota's attempt to end the federal government's “Operation Metro Surge” in the state. ICE says it has removed over 3,000 criminal illegal immigrants, including murderers, rapists, and pedophiles, during the surge, which began in December 2025. Should the state win its case, ICE would face significant restrictions in how it operates in Minnesota, and the surge would be forced to end.

The latest round of protests against ICE in Minnesota, which have, at times, turned violent, began on Jan. 7 when an ICE officer killed Renee Good. Video footage of the deadly shooting sparked sweeping controversy, as the Trump administration said it proved the use of force was justified, and protesters believe that it showed that, at best, ICE grossly mishandled the situation.

The Minnesota Chiefs of Police Association has requested a meeting with Trump and his advisers to discuss public safety in the wake of the unrest.

“Minnesota's law enforcement officers are facing growing challenges in fulfilling their core responsibilities of protecting life, enforcing the law, and serving communities in accordance with constitutional principles,” the MCPA said, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Dozens of local business leaders have urged Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), and the White House to cooperate and de-escalate tensions. Their concerns come after the state saw extensive damage during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests and riots following the death of George Floyd. 

“In this difficult moment for our community, we call for peace and focused cooperation among local, state, and federal leaders to achieve a swift and durable solution that enables families, businesses, our employees, and communities across Minnesota to resume our work to build a bright and prosperous future,” 60 CEOs wrote in a letter published over the weekend.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

My quest to understand consciousness took me to a cave in New Mexico and then deep into the cosmos.

Anyone who thinks the contemplative life amounts to a form of quietism or a retreat from the world's suffering should spend some time shadowing Joan Halifax, the Zen priest and anthropologist. I'd been curious about Halifax for years, ever since I heard about an annual trek that she leads through the mountains of Nepal, bringing a cadre of doctors and dentists to remote mountain villages with little access to health care.

Each summer over the course of two weeks or so, this Nomads Clinic covers more than 100 miles on foot and horseback, at altitudes of nearly 18,000 feet. These “medical mountaineers,” as they've been called,  all volunteers, sleep in tents, often in freezing temperatures. But after some 40 annual trips to Nepal—Halifax is normally based in Sante Fe—she recently decided it was time to hang it up. She had just turned 80.

In addition to bringing medical care to remote mountain villages half a world away, Halifax has ministered to the dying in hospice, worked with the homeless in New Mexico, cared for prisoners on death row, and led countless protests for peace. I don't know if Halifax has shed the last remnants of her ego—she would say she hasn't—but the selflessness she manifests in the conduct of her life is something to behold, a reminder of what the exploration of human consciousness can lead a person to do and be. This, too, is a Buddhist principle—that overcoming one's own small self should lead to greater compassion for others, and that the suffering alleviated when we transcend the ego is not only our own.

For more than 30 years, Halifax has been the abbot at Upaya Zen Center, the retreat she founded in Santa Fe in 1990. I've had the chance to meet her a couple of times; once, we appeared together on a panel to talk about psychedelics. Halifax was married to the pioneering Czech psychiatrist Stanislav Grof for several years in the 1970s. Working together, they gave transformative doses of LSD to the dying. For a period of time, Halifax regularly took large doses of LSD herself. Her first psychedelic trip, while wandering the streets of Paris in 1968, showed her “that there was beauty behind the beauty I perceived, and that mind was both in here and out there. I was dumbstruck.”

I could relate. After years of curiosity about psychoactive plants, my own experimentation with mushrooms and LSD in recent years fundamentally changed the way I understand the mysteries of consciousness and the self. So in 2024, I emailed Halifax to see if I might pay a visit to Upaya. My idea was to spend a week or so in residence, meditating with the aspiring monks, performing monkish chores, interviewing Halifax, and seeing if I could make a little more progress untying the knot of self. “Upaya is a factory for the deconstruction of selves,” she had told me. I was curious to find out how that worked.

Read: Psychedelics open your brain. You might not like what falls in.

But Roshi Joan, as everyone calls her, had other plans for me. She decided I should spend a day or two at Upaya and then accompany her up to “the refuge,” an off-the-grid compound of tiny houses and huts stretched out across a broad hammock of meadow at 9,400 feet in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, north of Santa Fe. Whenever she's not traveling or running conferences or teaching, Halifax retreats to these mountains, where she meditates and hikes and paints and writes and doesn't have to play the role of abbot. She dispatches students to the refuge when she deems them in need of a period of monastic solitude—for years at a time, in some cases.

“After you've acclimated to the altitude, we'll drive up to the refuge,” she said by email before my arrival in Santa Fe. “You can stay in the cave.” This was not put in the form of a question.

The cave?

Halifax explained that even though it had neither plumbing nor electricity nor an internet connection, this was “a five-star cave” and I would be comfortable—or, more likely, I'd be uncomfortable in a spiritually productive way. I'm not much of a camper but decided I might as well put myself in her hands to see what the experience would yield.

The first thing you notice about Joan Halifax is her undiminished beauty—the shining blue eyes and the easy smile and the generous sweep of white hair. That she's 83 is hard to believe. She moves through Upaya's little village of low-slung adobes and tended gardens with a graceful authority. Yet abbot is a role that, these days, she's more than happy to trade for the solitude and freedom of the refuge.

The refuge is at the end of a 25-mile-long rutted dirt road that climbs through a shadowy forest of pine and spruce, punctuated by the sparkle of the occasional stream or meadow. Though it was well into June, spring was still unfolding at this altitude, the meadow grasses and spruce tips bright green and the groves of ivory-trunked aspen just leafing out. After we unloaded our SUV at the main house, where we would gather for meals (and connect to the outside world, as the house has a satellite internet connection), Halifax escorted me to my lodgings, a hike of half a mile along a path through meadows lined with aspen trees, their new leaves fluttering gently. Along the way, she identified the scat of elk, deer, and bears.

The cave was a 12-by-15-foot cell dug into a south-facing hillside and lined with brown stucco; it was windowless except for a sliding glass door overlooking the meadow. In one corner stood a spartan single bed, in the other a small woodstove. Between them, against the back wall, a meditation cushion sat on a raised platform, beneath an embroidered fabric depicting a Buddhist figure I didn't recognize. I pictured myself seated cross-legged on the platform, like one of those levitating yogis in a New Yorker cartoon. The room also had a small sink fed by a five-gallon jug of water suspended above it, a two-burner camp stove, some shelving for clothes and books, and a car battery hooked up to a small solar panel outside. This produced just enough juice to power a reading light and charge a phone, though with no cell service or internet connection, what was the point?

What was the point? Why did Roshi Joan want me here rather than at Upaya or the main house, with its creature comforts? (And why did she keep putting off our interview?) I came to suspect she had decided that the questions I had for her—questions regarding Buddhist ideas about the self and consciousness and her own path from psychedelics to Zen—were best approached obliquely, perhaps by way of firsthand experience rather than words; that I should answer them myself. When I'd told her what I was working on, she had diagnosed me as hopelessly stuck in my head. Better to spend several days alone with myself meditating and navigating these hills than in the more familiar landscape of concepts, something to which I should have known a Zen priest would be allergic. When we finally did sit down for our interview, in the main house on the morning of the third day, Roshi Joan began by saying, somewhat cryptically, that she had “divested from meaning.” Okay. 

It took me a while to realize that for Halifax, the practice of Buddhism was everything and theories were of little use or consequence. It was only through doing that she had learned her most enduring life lessons, whether that meant sitting with death-row inmates who taught her how powerlessness ferments into anger, or ministering to people in their last days and hours. “You learn to be nimble toward whatever is arising, because there's no one death,” she said, “and if you cling to expectations, you will experience futility.” It was here, in doing the work, that Buddhist ideas about impermanence, conditioning, and dependent arising became flesh.

I took the hint. When I asked Halifax about herself or about Buddhist philosophy, she often ducked my questions or directed me elsewhere, so during one of our daily walks, I instead asked her to describe exactly how her factory for the deconstruction of selves operated.

People come on silent retreat for a week or two at a time and spend most of their days sitting in the Zendo—the meditation hall—facing a wall or tracing walking meditations on the gravel paths that meander through Upaya's gardens. (I'd witnessed this glacial parade of earnest zombies.) I asked if novices received any guidance or technique. Not much, she said. Students are instructed about posture, and beginners are told to follow the breath, which “unifies body, mind, and space.” As Halifax has written, zazen, or sitting, “is not a mental exercise, a thing you do with your mind.” Rather, “it is about being radically open to things just as they are, not grasping at or rejecting phenomena, but simply being present and at ease with moment-to-moment uncertainty and groundlessness” and “letting openness or not-knowing deconstruct our version of reality. It is the method of non-method.” Just sitting, upright—that, apparently, is all there is to zazen.

“Zen is the hardest school,” Halifax explained, “because there is so little support.” But at Upaya, she told me, “there is the jungle gym of structure”—the strict rules and rituals and routines that govern life on retreat.

“There's a certain point at about day three where you can feel the whole room go poof,” she said. “And everyone realizes we're now in one body, one mind.” I asked her how this transformation was achieved. “We don't say we're deconstructing the self, but that is what we're doing,” she told me. “Living in silence means you can't start a conversation, so there's no opportunity for self-presentation. Then there are the rituals that organize the day. These draw people into the group and relieve them of having to make decisions. Rituals take the place of a certain amount of volition.” It hadn't occurred to me that ritual and silence could serve as tools to change consciousness and breach the hard shell of self.

But it is the agony of meditating for hours at a time that finally breaks down the ego. I asked her what people meditate about. “Mostly they ruminate and plan,” she said. “They do that until they can't stand the thought of themselves any longer. You're just sitting there for hours on end, and the entertainment value of watching the same reruns all day long diminishes over time. Pretty soon, it becomes unsustainable; they're exhausted and uncomfortable, and that's when they drop in.”

To “drop in,” Halifax explained, is to enter a state of being completely present in time and space, experiencing “the sense field”—the world as it appears to our senses prior to thought—without conceptualizing, and surrendering the sense of a separate self. The recipe was simpler (and much less appetizing) than I would have imagined: To transcend the self, force yourself to be alone with it long enough to get so bored and exhausted that you are happy to let it go. 

Poof!

Halifax, who did anthropological fieldwork in Africa, thinks of the Zen retreat as an initiation ceremony, or rite of passage, and like most such rites, it involves the metaphorical death of the ego followed by rejoining the group. She regards the psychedelic trip as another rite of initiation, but “it's a shortcut,” and one she'd rather her students not take. I wondered if this helped explain why she preferred that I stay at the refuge rather than mingle with her students at Upaya. Perhaps she thought contact with me would undermine the process by encouraging them to take the psychedelic shortcut.

“There is a lot gained when we give up the self,” she noted. “We break out of rumination. We discover we're part of something larger, and we learn it feels good to care for others.” When I asked Halifax if she had succeeded in exorcising her own self, she allowed that she can be self-righteous at times. “There is moral injury, moral outrage, moral apathy—all of them are products of either a sense of superiority or inferiority,” she said. “So they're all ego-based.”

I came to understand that Roshi Joan had sent me to the cave because there were no words or ideas she could offer that would teach me as much as simply being completely alone with myself in the middle of these mountains, with no phone or any other screens (and no toilet). Her idea, I eventually saw, was to pose a kind of experiential koan for me to puzzle and, perhaps, to help me unlearn some of the things I thought I had learned about consciousness and the self.

Cave life quickly stripped down to the bare essentials: collecting, splitting, and stacking wood; building fires; hauling water; digging pits in the woods; sweeping the floor and threshold; and, for hours each day, meditating on the platform. I've meditated for several years now, but never as easily or as deeply or as strangely as I did in my little cave. It may have been the silence, which felt bottomless, or the certainty that I would not be interrupted or distracted. Even the air there felt different, as if the absence of the electromagnetic waves that normally surround and pass through us made it easier to empty the mind of its usual detritus. I found I could sit for hours at a time, something I'd never managed to do before.

It helped that there was nothing else I needed to do, except maybe brew a cup of tea or sweep the cave again. Somehow, these seemed like particularly cave-appropriate activities. I fell into a routine so elemental and repetitive that it began to feel like ritual. The only snafu came the first time I attempted to use my hand-dug pit toilet and, failing to position myself properly, managed to pee into my sneaker. Now I was a shoeless monk. Which also seemed cave-appropriate.

One morning, I decided to try a meditation I'd learned from my time with the Nepalese French Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard, who has written extensively on the self as an illusion. To see this, he suggested I explore the rooms of my mind, one by one, as if searching for a thief—what he called “the thief of self.” Looking within, I found all sorts of mental stuff but, as Ricard had predicted, none of it qualified as a self. Rather, I witnessed a parade of unbidden, free-floating perceptions, feelings, images, sensations, and thoughts, but I could locate no thinker of these thoughts or perceiver of these perceptions.

The longer I sat, the stranger these appearances became, as the space of my awareness became an empty stage. Picture a circus ring where all kinds of images might suddenly and inexplicably appear out of nowhere. Why is there now a bank of three old-timey telephone booths with men inside making calls? And what's this hammer suddenly coming down on a knee?! Or that automatic glass door swinging open for no one? These stray images were then blasted away by a blazing sun that completely filled the space of awareness before transforming itself into a gigantic eyeball—a sighted sun with a black circle of iris. Could this be the anarchic mind that emerges when the ego relinquishes its hold?

Maybe, and yet these dreamy, hypnagogic images were more curious than frightening, probably because it was easy enough to chase them away, to change the mental channel, simply by willing it. So then who, or what, did the chasing? The source of that will, that inchoate “I,” might have escaped introspective detection, yet it could still make things happen or stop happening. The self might well be illusory, I decided, but no more so than color or any other construct of the mind. Put another way, the self can be both illusory and real, or real enough.

Initially, I found I was talking to myself out loud, trying to fill the vast space of silence, which made it feel as though I had doubled my self rather than eliminated it—given it a little company. “Should I brew a cup of tea? Put another log on the fire?” I would ask. And I would answer: “Sure,” or “Good idea.” But after a day or two, I fell in love with the silence, and the voices stopped. I found the handful of chores completely absorbing, as if nothing in the world mattered as much as splitting firewood, fully occupying my attention and leaving no remainder of thought, self-consciousness, or anticipation. The distance between living and meditating had narrowed to a sliver. When I described the satisfactions of my routine to Roshi Joan during one of our hikes, she smiled: “That's the sacredness of the everyday.”

Something was happening to my sense of self, and it seemed to have everything to do with what was happening to my sense of time. I had never given much thought to the relationship between self and time, but it explains a lot. When the self is deprived of time past (memory) and future (anticipation), it melts away. Absorbed in meditation, or in my chores, or in watching a small herd of elk graze in the meadow below at sunset, I could feel my time horizon shrink. The feeling was unfamiliar, since my usual mental coordinates place me somewhere in the proximate future, a locus of anticipation and, all too often, unfocused worry. But now, for longer and longer stretches, I was simply here, being, with no thought of the past or the future.

To my surprise, these moments of simple and more or less self-less consciousness did not occur when my eyes were closed—in fact, the darkness sent me zooming off to all kinds of strange places. No, now it was when my eyes were open that the stream of thought stilled and pooled, and not only on the meditation platform; it could happen when I was moving around the cave doing chores or hiking in the woods. The miraculous everyday fact of consciousness loomed larger than “the hard problem” of how a brain produces subjective experience.

Had I “dropped in”? There were moments when all I experienced was what Roshi Joan had called the “sense field.” This happened especially upon opening my eyes in meditation, but it was never very long before I slipped back into reflection and then the inevitable jotting-down of notes, and all at once I was back in the self-world. To stay in that state of unthinking presence was like walking a tightrope only to suddenly look down, panic, and come plunging back to Earth.

Except once, when I managed to look not down but up. I had woken up in the middle of the night and stepped outside into the cold night air. There was a new moon, and the only light in the world was that of the stars, which were out in force, brighter and more numerous than I'd ever seen them, but also strangely different. Instead of dotting the same black scrim, like pinholes in a two-dimensional theater backdrop, the stars were scattered through space at dramatically varying distances, a vast swarm of them filling every last corner of an even vaster, more numinous, and emphatically three-dimensional darkness. Even stranger, the negative space between the stars had flipped to positive, forming a soft, almost palpable blackness that embraced the stars and reached all the way to Earth, enveloping it and me in the same intergalactic blanket. For the first time, I could see—no, could feel—that the stars and I shared the same infinite space.

Adam Frank: The truth physics can no longer ignore

My brain's usual priors, predictions, and inferences about the night sky had broken down, it seemed, allowing me to see more of the galaxy and space itself than I ever had. There was hugely more of it and less of me, rendered infinitesimal in the presence of this immensity. I felt as though every previous experience I'd had of the night sky had been filtered through some idea or model or expectation and so had been something less than completely conscious. And I understood that this state—abstracted, distracted—had been my default. A line in a poem by Jorie Graham came to me:

This is what is wrong: we, only we, the humans, can retreat from ourselves and

not be

altogether here.

Only we, the humans. Yes! What other animal can afford to be anything less than completely conscious?

This moment of being fully, freshly present to the universe stopped me cold and made me wonder if all my hard thinking about consciousness had missed something crucial about it. The more I focused the narrow beam of my attention on what consciousness is and what it does and how it came to be, the less of it I was actually experiencing—whatever it was. My time in the cave and, now, beneath this night sky showed me the price of my impatience with the mystery.

“Always keep a don't-know mind,” Roshi Joan had said to me. Sometimes not knowing opens us to possibilities that knowing, or trying to know, or thinking we already know, closes off. In the years since I had embarked on this inquiry, desperate to know, I had narrowed the aperture of my awareness, sacrificing this, the glory of the night sky, for a keen intellectual focus. But as my days of solitude in these mountains had shown me, that wider circle of light, that numinous lantern of awareness, is still available to us, so long as we can break the spell of self and its distractions. Consciousness is a miracle, truly, and remains the deepest of mysteries, yes, but it is also so very simple that it can fit into a sentence: I open my eyes and a world appears.

A massive winter storm is battering the US, bringing heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain to millions of Americans.

The storm, which has stretched over 2,000 miles from New Mexico to Maine, hit the south-central US on Friday night and is now pummeling the Northeast. At least 18 people have died from weather-related causes, according to the Associated Press.

As snowfall picked up in New York City, Mayor Zohran Mamdani announced schools would operate remotely on Monday due to the weather.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul had previously announced that ""all state employees"" were also authorized to work remotely to start the week.

""I encourage other employers to do the same, just to keep people off the roads and think about this,"" she said.

Here's where else the storm is set to hit.

Heavy snow is continuing to fall across large parts of the northeastern US.

""The storm will produce heavy snow over the Northeast and patches of rain/freezing rain over parts of the Mid-Atlantic. Snow will also develop along the Appalachians on Monday,"" the National Weather Service said in a Monday morning update.

The Great Lakes region is also set for a fresh wave of snow, travelling south from Canada, the NWS said Monday.

As of around 11:30 a.m. ET on Monday, extreme cold weather warnings are in effect for parts of 18 of the contiguous states, including Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri.

In Arkansas, some areas recorded around seven inches of snowfall through Friday night into Saturday.

Much of the Northeast remains under Winter Storm Warnings, including parts of New York, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut.

The agency said power outages, tree damage, and dangerous travel conditions are also likely across parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic due to freezing rain and lingering icing.

Major cities in the weather system's path include Atlanta, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, DC, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston.

Roughly 800,000 customers from New Mexico to Virginia are without power as of late morning on Monday, according to PowerOutage.us.

Moving forward, the NWS said heavy snowfall is likely to lead to ""widespread travel disruptions and closures"" that could last several days.

Travel was hit hard this weekend, with airlines canceling thousands of flights across Saturday and Sunday, and cancellations continuing into Monday.

On Monday, over 4,900 flights were canceled as of around 11:30 a.m. ET, with all three New York airports canceling more than 40% of flights. Boston Logan was the worst-affected airport on Monday, canceling 61% of flights.

Monday's disruption followed the worst single day of flight cancellations since the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 11,500 US flights canceled on Sunday, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightAware.

Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Texas and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International were the worst-affected airports on Sunday, per flight-tracking site FlightAware.

Washington DC's Ronald Reagan National Airport said airlines had cancelled all flights on Sunday.

In an update issued at 11 p.m. ET, the airport said that with precipitation ending, flight operations ""should gradually increase beginning on Monday.""

Many airlines are waiving rebooking fees for flights to and from affected regions.

Much like office snacks and flashy holiday parties, corporate wellness programs have always struck me as a bit of a scam — nice to have, but not at the expense of my job, salary, or a decent healthcare plan. Maybe that makes me a cynic, but in the zero-sum world of corporate budgets, if it comes down to layoffs vs. avocados, I'm fine skipping the avocados. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I'm not the one making those decisions.

Workplace wellness programs have exploded over the past decade or so, with companies rolling out a suite of subsidized perks, such as gym discounts, mental health apps, and other benefits aimed at attracting and retaining workers. The pandemic upped the ante even more — in the face of a tight labor market and a hyper-stressed workforce, plenty of business leaders looked around and thought, ""Well, a Zoom meditation session can't hurt, right?""

Now, the ground is shifting. Corporations aren't cutting their wellness programs altogether, but they are taking a hard look at what they're paying for. They're cutting excessive, underutilized benefits, scrutinizing ROI, and shifting to more cost-effective, targeted products. They're trying to support employee well-being amid economic uncertainty and rising healthcare costs — without breaking the company piggybank.

Your job still wants to help you out with the gym, but it would rather you hit up Planet Fitness than Equinox. And, if it figures you've given up on your New Year's resolution to exercise already, it doesn't want to waste money on a benefit you'll never use.

In the 2010s, the millennial-driven flurry of ""work-life balance"" chatter nudged companies to invest more in the life end of things. A low-interest-rate environment made such spending easy to justify. Perhaps a smaller player couldn't compete with the tech giants' lavish perks, but many of them did pour money into products and services they hoped might support employee health and morale, to varying degrees of success.

""I don't know that anybody's told me that it's paid off. I mean, I don't hear companies saying, 'Our well-being program has been our secret to success,"" says Josh Bersin, global industry analyst and CEO of The Josh Bersin Company, a consultancy. ""So it does not surprise me that this got really overbuilt and overhyped.""

Now that companies are tightening their belts again, many of these ancillary perks are on the chopping block. Wellness is a fairly straightforward place to make spending reductions, as it falls in the optional category. Returns are hard to track, employee uptake is limited, and costs often balloon.

Data Ramp Capital shows companies using its expense management platform have reduced wellness benefits for employees to $1,103 a year per worker in 2025 from $1,366 in 2023, a 20% decline. In turn, employees have upped their usage of budget-friendly apps such as Classpass and Wellhub and shifted toward lower-cost gyms.

""Benefits are being cut, and then as those benefits are being cut, people are spending at cheaper places on average,"" says Ara Kharazian, an economist at Ramp.

The cuts to these side benefits come as the cost of companies' major healthcare expenditure — the insurance they provide for their employees — continues to rise. Annual family premiums for employer insurance coverage increased by 6% to nearly $27,000 in 2025, per the Kaiser Family Foundation, and are expected to hit $30,000 this year. Employers say that controlling healthcare costs is their primary benefits objective, according to a recent MetLife survey, outweighing productivity, loyalty, and attracting talent.

""What they're doing in light of really large increases is they are going through every benefit,"" says Todd Katz, head of US group benefits at MetLife.

Cesar Carvalho, the CEO of Wellhub, which gives employees access to a network of gyms, studios, and classes, says one of the main appeals of his business is its price point, especially in this environment. ""The value proposition of the company is very simple, they pay $2-$5 per employee per month, and that's it,"" he says.

If I had to make a bet, I would guess that you, the reader, do not fully understand the various wellness-related perks your job offers. That's OK! Neither do I! Companies have been spending a lot of money on corporate wellness — by one estimate, nearly $95 billion worldwide this year — without always checking whether it's effective.

One 2023 Deloitte survey found that 68% of workers don't use the full value of their company's well-being resources because the programs are too ""time-consuming, confusing, or cumbersome"" to access. A separate 2025 survey from Sapients Insights Group, a research and advisory firm, found that under a third of workers access their company's digital wellness platform monthly. Much of this stuff hasn't proven very impactful anyway: A 2024 study out of Oxford University in the UK found that employer offerings such as well-being apps, relaxation classes, and financial coaching generally didn't make workers better off. The exception: providing opportunities to volunteer. (Resilience and stress management training actually had a negative impact.)

Zachary Chertok, a senior research manager for employee experience at IDC, a market-intelligence firm, tells me that spending on physical and mental well-being is growing more strategic. Decisions around these products and services have historically been ""top down and driven by internal company initiatives,"" he says. Essentially, someone in the C-suite or in HR decides there's going to be a wellness push, picks out whatever app(s) to implement it, and everyone moves on. Now, companies are getting smarter at identifying and spending on what's actually being used rather than what isn't. What this looks like in practice is businesses enlisting vendors that offer a potential suite of services or a central hub to manage a set of offerings, rather than contracting with a bunch of ad hoc programs. The model lets them choose which options they do and don't want to include and, over time, decipher what employees are using to refine the offer.

""As wellness spend matures, companies are thinking more about individual use and engagement cases and how spend can be mapped to it,"" Chertok says. New platforms that collect data on what people are using and what they aren't, he adds, helps ""connect the dots on what is actually having an impact and working.""

Essentially, if my work wellness platform realizes I'm never going to download the mental health app, it will stop bugging me about it, and if enough people do the same, it will alert my employer to drop the benefit.

Employers don't do all of this extra investing out of the kindness of their hearts. They do it because they think healthier employees will reduce their healthcare costs, take fewer sick days, and be more productive. That, in turn, saves the company money on their end of the insurance bill. From the employee perspective, it results in an awkward arrangement. For people who use the perks, the benefits are a plus, but workers can also feel like their bosses are simply trying to slap a band-aid-sized app onto a much larger problem of stress, burnout, and overwork.

A mindfulness workshop scheduled in the middle of the workday doesn't help an employee who's so overwhelmed they don't have 20 minutes for lunch. It also fosters animosity, as they wonder exactly who among the ranks actually has time for that. The way to build a healthy workplace culture is for the workplace to be holistically healthy: a financial health app doesn't do much if you're severely underpaid, a gym membership is useless if you're working 11-hour day, a video about stress management doesn't help you figure out how you're going to manage your new, sky-high insurance premiums.

""I think most people would rather have it go into their medical benefits because that's the big cost,"" Bersin says.

Business Insider is giving us ClassPass this year, and I am excited to use it — assuming I don't forget, which, TBD. We lost the reimbursement fitness benefit that came with our health insurance last year, which was more financially advantageous. I remind myself this benefit is an extra, not a requirement, and I hope my bosses know I'm OK if they cut it. I can learn to run outside.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","A McDonald's superfan dined at over 100 of its restaurants around the world. See the most unique.","https://www.businessinsider.com/most-unique-mcdonalds-in-the-world-gary-he-2026-1","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:51:00 GMT","

Most McDonald's locations around the world follow a familiar design: red-and-white branding topped with golden arches. But some stand out for their distinct architecture and unique backstories.

From a glass-covered restaurant in Batumi, Georgia, to one built over an ancient Roman road in Italy, the fast-food chain has found unique ways to blend with the local surroundings while maintaining its individuality.

In his book, ""McAtlas: A Global Guide to the Golden Arches,"" which was released in November 2024, author and photojournalist Gary He captured the essence of some of these locations while explaining what makes each one special.

Between 2019 and 2024, He traveled to over 55 countries and dined at more than 100 McDonald's restaurants. When it came to picking his top locations, he had clear favorites.

""I wanted to document the more interesting parts of the largest restaurant group in the world,"" He told Business Insider, emphasizing that the project was an independent undertaking.

Here are five unique McDonald's locations that He recommends fans of the brand must visit.

The McDonald's in Sälen, Sweden, tops He's list of best locations.

Nestled in one of Sweden's biggest ski resorts, Lindvallen, this spot offers a unique ""ski-thru"" experience. It allows skiers to grab a Big Mac without leaving their skis.

The restaurant opened in 1996 and operates daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. during ski season.

""The air is so clean and crisp — it's like being on top of the world,"" He told Business Insider, adding, ""When I visited, it wasn't even busy. It was just me, the McSki, and the mountains. I was just hanging out and enjoying myself.""

Getting there isn't easy, though. He said it took him six hours to travel from Stockholm, with three transfers — first, from a train station at Borlänge Centralstation to a bus, and then 48 stops later, another bus — but the journey was worth it.

""The McSki is hands-down the coolest McDonald's I've visited anywhere in the world,"" He said.

""I really love the Shenzhen location in China,"" said He, adding, ""It was the first McDonald's in China at a time when the country wasn't fully open to American businesses.""

The restaurant opened on October 8, 1990, in Shenzhen's special economic zone. On its first day, it welcomed over 40,000 customers despite a seating capacity of 460, the South China Morning Post reported.

The restaurant balances local design with the chain's signature branding. The three-floor building features pagoda-style roofs, integrating traditional Chinese architectural design with the golden arches.

""It's pretty epic,"" He said.

Have you ever wondered what it's like to enjoy a Big Mac on a static passenger plane? In Taupo, a town in New Zealand, you can.

Named one of the ""world's coolest McDonald's,"" per a signpost, this restaurant is inside a decommissioned DC-3 plane built in 1943. At first, it was used as a passenger plane and then as a crop duster, an agricultural aircraft that sprays pesticides on crops from the air.

In 1984, it was decommissioned and, per Atlas Obscura, became a promotional product in Taupō's Aeroplane Car Company's parking lot until McDonald's bought it in 1990.

""The airplane location in Taupo is iconic,"" said He.

A McDonald's in the shape of a UFO is fitting for Roswell, a town known for its rumored alien sightings and extraterrestrial encounters.

The town became popular in 1947 when a mysterious aircraft, which the local newspaper, the Roswell Daily Record, identified as a ""flying saucer,"" crashed into a ranch. Then, in 1980, Stanton Friedman, a former nuclear physicist, came across the 1947 news story and alleged it to be an alien spacecraft, sparking widespread outcry.

Government records later showed the aircraft was a top-secret government surveillance balloon used to detect echoes of Soviet nuclear-testing blasts.

But by then, people were convinced the government was hiding information about alien life, and UFOs had become a mini-industry with several themed attractions, such as the annual UFO festival and a museum, spread across town.

In 2005, a few miles from the crash site, McDonald's opened a restaurant shaped like a spaceship with neon lights.

But He loves the restaurant for more than just its exteriors.

""It has a gift shop,"" he said, adding, ""I mean, it's cool looking, but they have merchandise, which I think is super cool.""

The gift shop features Ronald McDonald in a spacesuit and alien statues.

He's final favorite is the Méqui1000 in São Paulo, Brazil, a spot that combines playful creativity with historical significance.

""It looks like the White House but decorated as a kindergartner's art project,"" He said, adding that the restaurant's façade undergoes multiple changes in a year and is usually adorned with vibrant artwork for promotional campaigns.

Méqui1000 also holds cultural significance; it was the 1,000th McDonald's in Brazil, one of 20 nations with over 1,000 McDonald's stores, according to Yahoo Finance.

""It's a huge market and an important location,"" He said.

The menu here also features items exclusive to Brazil, like the Super Mac, a fully loaded burger with lettuce, tomato, and onion, which is in a contrast to the simpler burgers popular in the US.

""Culturally, Americans want it [their burgers] cheap, fast, and straightforward, but in Brazil and other countries, people want their burgers a little more dressed up,"" He said.

Just days ago, it looked like the US would avoid a repeat of the government shutdown that took place in the fall.

Then, federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis.

In the span of just a few hours following the shooting on Saturday, the odds that the government will shut down later this week rose from roughly 10% to the high 70s on prediction markets like Polymarket and Kalshi.

That's because Democratic senators now say they won't vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS — the department that oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol — until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.

""What's happening in Minnesota is appalling —and unacceptable in any American city,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Saturday. ""Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included.""

There are only two ways out of this:

But even if lawmakers go with the second option, a short shutdown through the weekend is likely.

To avoid a government shutdown after midnight late Friday evening, the Senate would need to pass the six-bill package, which funds DHS, the military, various government agencies, and a wide array of federal grants, among other things.

Those six bills have already passed the House, and they've been stitched together into one larger package in the Senate.

The GOP may control the upper chamber, but they can't ignore Democrats. Due to the Senate's 60-vote ""filibuster"" rule, and the fact that Republicans hold just 53 seats, Democratic votes are necessary to advance most major bills, including this one.

Democrats are only opposed to the DHS bill, and Schumer has called on Republicans to work with Democrats to separate out the bills. But the GOP has balked so far at that idea.

Furthermore, even if the bills are separated, the House would have to vote on them again to send them to President Donald Trump's desk.

The House is out of session until next week, meaning a shutdown at least until then is highly likely.

Just months ago, the federal government shut down for 43 days, the longest shutdown in American history. There are a few reasons why this one wouldn't be as bad.

For one, it would only be a partial shutdown, because lawmakers have already passed several bills to fund the government through September 30.

SNAP and WIC payments would be unaffected, Capitol Hill staffers would still get paid, and national parks would likely remain open.

Additionally, the path out of a shutdown is more straightforward.

In the fall, Democrats were demanding changes to healthcare while holding all of government funding back. This time, Democrats are only objecting to the DHS funding.

That means it's plausible that the Senate would separate out the other five bills, the House would re-pass those bills next week, and the partial shutdown would only last a few days.

Still, the DHS bill doesn't just fund ICE and border patrol. It also funds the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

That raises the possibility of delays at airports and issues with disaster aid if the department goes unfunded for a long period of time.

Additionally, ICE will remain funded, even if the DHS bill doesn't pass for a long time.

While the current DHS funding bill contains an additional $10 billion for ICE, the agency also received roughly $75 billion in funding via the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" in July.

Unless lawmakers were to agree to rescind that funding — extremely unlikely given GOP control of Congress — that money's here to stay.

There's a new Chinese model gaining buzz among developers: Zhipu AI's GLM 4.7. That in itself is not new, but what did catch our attention was where it's becoming popular: the U.S., our own turf.

I first spotted Zhipu's post on WeChat, announcing that the new coding tool was seeing so much demand, it would start limiting access. A year after DeepSeek's R1 model shook the artificial intelligence landscape in the U.S., AI experts are saying that they're seeing Chinese AI models spreading around the world. I wanted to see if that was also true for Zhipu.

I reached out to the company, with no expectations of hearing back, just as DeepSeek has never responded to our requests. But Zhipu recently went public in Hong Kong, and its investor relations team is on top of the ball. They replied almost immediately, telling me that ""the user base of Zhipu GLM Coding Plan is primarily concentrated in the United States and China.""

American developers have always told us of the bias against using Chinese models — so for Zhipu to be gaining traction here suggested a real DeepSeek-like breakout moment.

Just last week, we were floored by the apps that Replit and Claude Code were able to produce in minutes. They felt like the frontier of AI, an example of how American innovation is leading the way. It's also creating a tangible shift, leading to a 60% surge in new app releases. But if a model out of China is just as powerful and easy to use, are they really six months behind like Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis says? And if they're cheaper and open source, what real moats do the American AI coding agents have? 

CNBC's Deirdre Bosa and I jumped on the chance to experiment with Zhipu, to see if the hype would match our successes with Replit and Claude. I've always found Chinese stock exchanges difficult to navigate and get data from, so we asked it to build a tracker for the biggest public companies in China. Zhipu whipped up an app more quickly than its American counterparts could, but its results were less polished.

We're naturally skeptical of claims from companies that tout usage without publishing metrics, so we checked in with some sources — people building in AI that would come across Zhipu if it really was making inroads here. It was quickly clear that Zhipu's GLM 4.7 is indeed a model gaining recognition in the U.S., though reviews are mixed.

One of the builders testing it is Tuhin Srivastava of Baseten, a platform that sits underneath AI applications and sees real-world model usage across enterprises. That matters even more now that Baseten just raised a new round with Nvidia participating, a signal that it's plugged into real, large-scale AI workloads. 

Watch the livestream with Srivastava and Bosa here starting at 2:30 p.m. ET on Monday.

In this article

Shares of Zoom popped 11% on Monday after analysts at Baird estimated that the company's investment in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic could be worth between $2 billion to $4 billion, depending on dilution assumptions. 

In May 2023, Anthropic announced a partnership with Zoom and revealed that Zoom Ventures had invested in the company. The companies did not disclose the value of the investment, but Zoom reported making $51 million in ""strategic investments"" that quarter, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Baird's analysts estimate that all, or at least the ""vast majority,"" of that investment went to Anthropic. The startup is currently valued at $350 billion, suggesting Zoom could see a return of roughly 78 times its investment, the analysts said. 

""While we (and the market) have been primarily focused on ZM's ability to gradually reaccelerate revenue growth and capture AI opportunities, the quieter, hidden gem might be its $51 million investment in Anthropic in 2023,""  the analysts wrote in a Monday note. 

Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. But as the pandemic subsided and many workers returned to in-person roles, Zoom's stock has tumbled from its highs.

The company's investment in Anthropic could prove to be a bright spot, Baird's analysts said.

""ZM is literally invested in Anthropic's Claude success, and as Anthropic IPO rumors accelerate, the investment could become even more meaningful,"" the analysts wrote.

BySandy Carter,

Contributor.

Somewhere between the third espresso, Taylor Swift, and my phone hitting a single digit battery, it hit me.  Davos 2026 was not about predictions anymore.  It was about things that are impacting our future. JPMorgan is live on Ethereum, a third of Gen Z wants an AI boss, and Quantum risk for blockchains!

The World Economic Forum (WEF) at Davos has always been where global anxiety becomes a catalyst. This year, technology dominated but broadened to impacting geopolitics and country competition. 

So what does any of this have to do with Taylor Swift?  When my Gen Z daugther picked me up from the airport and I tried to explain what I learned, she cut me off two sentences in. “Boring.” So I translated to her language and her fandom of Taylor Swift.

Here are ten moments that mattered.

Taylor re-recorded her albums to her own masters.  JPMorgan just did the same thing with money. 

The world's largest bank is now officially on Ethereum. JPMorgan's first real world asset product, the Onchain Net Yield Fund (MONY), is powered by JPM Kinexys. This is not a pilot or a proof of concept. It is a live, institutional blockchain infrastructure from the most traditional of traditional finance players.

Taylor writes her best songs after breakups.  Gen Z is writing theirs about human bosses.

Ana Kreacic, COO of the Oliver Wyman Forum, delivered her annual Davos report. Oliver Wyman's survey of 300,000 voices revealed a striking finding: one third (37%) of Gen Z respondents said they would prefer an AI manager over a human one. 

Their reasons? 

Consistency, transparency, and fairness. This generation is not rejecting leadership. They are rejecting unpredictability. In my discussions with Dr Efi Pylarinour, Global Fintech Thought Leader, she said that “they are not longing for a robot CEO. They are longing for the consistency, transparency, and fairness they rarely see in humans.”

Taylor moved from country to pop.  AI just moved from Tech to Geopolitics.

AI crossed a threshold at Davos this year. It is no longer simply a technology topic. It is an economic and geopolitical one, with trust and regulation dominating the tone across sessions and side conversations alike.

Elon Musk, in his first ever Davos appearance, predicted that AI could surpass any individual human by the end of this year.  By 2030, AI will be smarter than all of humanity combined. 

He painted a vision of ""abundance for all"" where robots outnumber people and the global economy explodes. 

But while Musk was outlining this utopia, Autodesk was laying off 1,000 employees, betting on AI to automate their jobs. The world's leaders are grappling with this very tension, pushing for ""trusted AI.""

Taylor hides Easter eggs in every album.  The quantum threat to crypto has been hiding in plain sight too. 

During Davos week, the Citi Institute released a deep dive on the quantum threat to blockchain, revealing that risk is unevenly distributed: Bitcoin has roughly 25 percent of coins exposed while Ethereum and Solana face far higher vulnerability over 65 percent.at Accenture.

Ronit Ghose, Managing Director, Citi Institute, told me that “Citi Institute believes the starting gun has been fired on a trillion dollar security race now underway for banks and blockchains to move to post quantum cryptography”

Taylor drops vault tracks to release when the world is ready.  The fix for quantum has been sitting in the vault too.  

The standards exist. NIST has published them. Regulators are pushing timelines. The problem is execution. Quantum readiness requires mapping exposure, prioritizing critical systems, enabling crypto agility, and executing multiyear migrations. This may be the largest cryptographic upgrade in human history, potentially exceeding the cost and complexity of Y2K.

In chatting with Steve Suarez, CEO of HorizonX and a contributor to the report, he noted that ""as the field matures, it's becoming increasingly clear that progress will depend on how effectively the ecosystem bridges advances in hardware with practical, deployable applications.  This will be the largest software upgrade in history with over 20 billion hardware devices that will need to be upgraded. 'The takeaway: social consensus and coordinated upgrades will determine which ecosystems survive the quantum transition intact.

The Accenture panel on Quantum was one of the best I saw. “The quantum conversation is moving from cryptographic circles to boardrooms. Companies need to act the same with Quantum as they do with AI,” Tom Patterson, Managing Partner at Accenture, told me.  “In AI they don't just try it out, they just do it. Quantum needs the same mindset.:

The Eras Tour features every version of Taylor performing together. Multi agent AI works the same way. 

Cognizant showcased their open source multi agent platform with a live demo.  Babak Hodjat, their Chief AI Officer explained to me “that the system is itself a multi agent system that designs and builds other multi agent systems through dialogue. 

The future Hodjat envisions? Agents that can merge responsibilities, split when overloaded, and form new connections spontaneously. The open source repo is live here.

Everyone talks about concerts, but the real money is made at the merch table. AI works the same way. 

One of the most interesting things I heard was the HFS research report. The report indicates that for every $2 spent on AI initiatives, enterprises should invest roughly $2.50 on data modernization, governance, and management. 

In addition, the report laid out the ideal length of time that an ideal Chief AI Officer should remain in office. The three year lifespan of the Chief AI Officer discusses the stabilize, focus, embed, and dissolve phases.

Leading AI companies like OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic are each spending roughly a billion dollars a year on human provided training data alone. The mantra has shifted from more data to better data, and that means humans in the loop at scale.

Taylor went from opening act to headlining statuiums. Crypto just did the same at Davos.

CZ, Binance co-founder and former CEO, and Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands, both spoke at official WEF sessions, a sign of just how far crypto has come from the sidelines. 

CZ predicted a Bitcoin supercycle in 2026 and revealed he is advising roughly a dozen governments on asset tokenization. He described a future where AI agents transact natively in crypto, and where traditional payment rails like Visa and Mastercard sit on top while stablecoins settle behind the scenes. 

Yat Siu was equally bullish, calling stablecoins a pillar of future financial growth and predicting the Clarity Act will pass this year, triggering a wave of US tokenization.

Taylor made music videos as important as the songs. World models are doing the same for AI, learning from video instead of just text.

The concept is straightforward: instead of predicting the next word like ChatGPT and its peers, world models predict what happens next in the physical world. They learn from video, simulation, and spatial data to build internal representations of how objects move and interact over time. 

Google, Nvidia, and Fei Fei Li's World Labs are all investing heavily. For leaders building on AI infrastructure, the question is whether the next breakthrough comes from scaling language models or from teaching machines to perceive physical reality.

Swifties trade friendship bracelets to show they belong to something bigger.  Davos just did the same thing for Web3. 

At the Davos Web3 House, leaders gathered to sign the Web3 Declaration, celebrating the progress made across the ecosystem over the past year. It was a moment of reflection in a week defined by forward momentum. Ajeet Khurana, the founder of the  Web Davos House, told me that “web3 has made such progress in 2026 that we wanted to drive more value around crypto, DePin, stablecoins, and more into the fabric of global companies.” 

Davos 2026 made one thing clear: the lines between AI, blockchain, quantum, and geopolitics are dissolving. The question is no longer whether these technologies will converge. It is whether organizations can move fast enough to keep up. Taylor Swift figured out how to stay ahead of every era.  Can you?

Build it and they will come—or so goes the old saying. In reality, if you build a blockchain-based social media network, then almost no one will come. The crypto world got another reminder of this last week when Farcaster, which raised a $150 Series A round in 2024, abruptly called it quits.

If you're unfamiliar, Farcaster was co-founded by early Coinbase employee Dan Romero and let users share various content via a Twitter-like timeline. The project had the lofty goal of breaking the data monopolies of platforms like Facebook by offering a decentralized alternative—one where users kept control of their data and identity.

Despite a $1 billion valuation and some influential backers, Farcaster never built a meaningful audience beyond an army of bots and a small clique of VC cheerleaders. Eventually, the founders acknowledged the obvious (that no one used Farcaster) and threw in the towel, but with a face-saving announcement that they had arranged a “sale” of the protocol to a third party. To his credit, Romero also announced he would return the $180 million he had raised to Farcaster's investors. 

So what happened? Some on X have pointed to the management team as the primary reason for Farcaster's failure, a claim that may or may not be justified. What is clear is that there has been little appetite in the market for a crypto social network. This is apparent from the failure of previous efforts, including the scammy BitClout network, and the recent decision by Coinbase's Base to focus on financial applications over social ones.

All of this reflects how people may love the idea of using a blockchain for data sovereignty but, in reality, they are going to seek out their social media fix on X or TikTok or Reddit. That's because those platforms are humming with millions of users while providing an interface that is far sleeker than what a crypto startup can conjure up. 

There may also be a bigger problem for those trying to build social and other applications on blockchain. Namely, the technology may simply not be cut out to do this—and that crypto should stick to what it's always been good at, which is finance.

Over 17 years or so, crypto has come up with three killer apps that have found massive product market fit: Bitcoin, stablecoins, and DeFi. All three are squarely in the realm of finance. Meanwhile, the idea of using blockchain to transform other industries like media or supply chains seems as far-off as ever—though there is renewed buzz about using decentralized technology to expand privacy.

As for Farcaster itself, it may stand as the high water mark for an earlier era of crypto that was defined by a popular book about data ownership called Read Write Own. As one observer noted on X: “With Farcaster losing its founders, Chris Dixon's Read Write Own era is over.  Crypto is for Internet Capital Markets. Period.”

Jeel, the innovation arm of Riyad Bank, has entered into a partnership with blockchain company Ripple to test new financial services built on distributed ledger technology. The collaboration will focus on cross-border payments and future digital asset use cases within Saudi Arabia.

Under the agreement, both sides will run technology trials inside Jeel's regulatory sandbox. The controlled environment allows financial institutions and technology providers to test new systems under regulatory oversight before broader market deployment.

The partnership comes as Saudi Arabia continues to expand digital infrastructure across banking and payments. Officials and financial institutions have linked these efforts to the country's Vision 2030 program, which aims to modernize economic systems and increase private-sector participation in technology-driven services.

Jeel and Ripple plan to evaluate whether blockchain-based tools can support faster international transactions, stronger transparency, and operational reliability while meeting regulatory requirements.

 

The initial focus of the partnership centers on international remittances and payment corridors. Cross-border transfers remain a core challenge for banks and corporate clients due to settlement delays, intermediary costs, and limited transaction visibility.

Jeel and Ripple will examine blockchain-enabled corridors designed to reduce friction in international payments. The testing phase will assess how Ripple's infrastructure performs when handling real transaction flows inside a sandbox setting.

Saudi Arabia plays a significant role in global remittance activity, both as a destination for expatriate workers and as a regional financial hub. Improving the speed and efficiency of outbound and inbound transfers remains a priority for banks serving corporate and retail clients.

The partnership aims to determine whether blockchain tools can support these goals while fitting into the country's regulatory framework.

 

Jeel operates its sandbox as a testing platform that balances innovation with regulatory discipline. The Ripple collaboration will run through this framework, allowing both companies to examine performance benchmarks and compliance standards at the same time.

Testing will include technical performance, transaction processing capacity, system stability, and data security controls. Regulatory alignment remains a central requirement throughout the process.

Executives at Jeel have said the sandbox model allows controlled experimentation with emerging financial infrastructure. The approach reflects a broader trend across the region, where regulators increasingly support structured testing environments for new payment systems and digital services.

For Ripple, participation in the sandbox offers access to a regulated testing environment tied directly to a major Saudi bank.

 

Beyond payments, the partnership will also examine digital asset custody and tokenization frameworks. These areas have gained attention across financial markets as institutions look for secure ways to manage blockchain-based assets.

Jeel and Ripple plan to test systems that support asset storage, transaction authorization, and operational controls. The goal involves identifying methods that meet security standards while remaining scalable for institutional use.

Tokenization, which converts traditional assets into blockchain-based representations, also forms part of the evaluation. Financial institutions view tokenization as a potential tool for improving settlement efficiency and asset management processes.

Any deployment in this area will depend on regulatory approval and performance results from the sandbox phase.

 

The partnership provides Ripple with direct access to Saudi Arabia's regulated financial innovation network. Through Jeel's institutional channels, Ripple will test its enterprise blockchain platforms within the national financial environment.

Ripple's regional leadership has described Saudi Arabia as an important market for digital transformation. The company views sandbox participation as an opportunity to demonstrate how its technology operates under regulatory oversight rather than in isolated pilot projects.

The collaboration also allows Ripple to assess local infrastructure requirements, regulatory expectations, and operational workflows unique to the Saudi banking system.

For Saudi institutions, working with an established blockchain provider offers exposure to enterprise-grade platforms already used in other regions.

 

Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 strategy places digital finance at the center of economic reform. The program encourages banks and technology firms to develop payment systems that support trade, investment, and financial inclusion.

Jeel's partnership with Ripple reflects that direction. By testing blockchain infrastructure within a regulated environment, the project fits into broader national efforts to strengthen digital financial services.

Authorities have emphasized the importance of maintaining financial stability while introducing new technologies. Sandbox programs provide a mechanism to meet both objectives.

The Ripple collaboration adds an international technology partner to this framework, connecting local banking innovation with global blockchain expertise.

 

Jeel operates as Riyad Bank's innovation arm, responsible for exploring emerging technologies and testing new financial products. The Ripple partnership builds on the bank's broader digital strategy, which includes upgrading payment infrastructure and expanding digital banking services.

Riyad Bank remains one of Saudi Arabia's largest financial institutions, serving corporate, retail, and government clients. Its innovation unit plays a role in evaluating technologies before large-scale deployment across the bank's operations.

Blockchain experimentation fits into this approach. Rather than adopting systems directly into production, the bank uses sandbox testing to assess risk, reliability, and regulatory impact.

This method reflects a cautious but structured approach to financial innovation.

 

Across the Gulf region, banks and regulators have increased interest in blockchain technology for payments, trade finance, and digital asset services. Several countries have launched regulatory sandboxes and pilot programs tied to digital currencies and settlement systems.

Saudi Arabia's financial authorities have taken steps to support controlled experimentation while maintaining oversight. The Jeel-Ripple partnership follows this pattern by combining international technology with domestic regulatory supervision.

The Middle East also plays a growing role in cross-border trade between Asia, Europe, and Africa. Payment infrastructure improvements remain tied to broader economic integration efforts.

Blockchain-based systems have attracted attention as tools that can reduce settlement time and operational complexity across borders.

 

The partnership highlights the growing role of fintech collaboration between banks and technology firms. Traditional financial institutions increasingly work with specialized providers rather than building all infrastructure internally.

Ripple brings blockchain expertise, while Jeel provides regulatory access and institutional integration. This model reflects how banks adopt new technology while maintaining control over compliance and risk management.

The arrangement also supports Riyad Bank's efforts to position itself as an active participant in digital finance development across Saudi Arabia.

Industry observers note that such partnerships often determine whether experimental technology transitions into mainstream banking operations.

 

Any expansion beyond sandbox testing will depend on regulatory approval and performance results. Saudi regulators continue to evaluate how blockchain systems fit within existing financial laws and consumer protection frameworks.

Issues such as data privacy, transaction monitoring, and asset custody controls remain central to these assessments.

The sandbox environment allows regulators to observe real-world performance without exposing the broader financial system to untested risk.

This oversight process plays a central role in shaping how digital finance evolves across the Kingdom.

 

Jeel and Ripple have not released a timeline for completing sandbox testing or moving into production deployments. The next phase will involve performance evaluation, compliance review, and operational assessment.

If results meet regulatory and institutional standards, the partnership could expand into live payment corridors or digital asset services offered through Riyad Bank's platforms.

Any such rollout would occur in stages and under continued regulatory supervision.

For now, the focus remains on testing, validation, and system evaluation.

 

The Jeel-Ripple partnership represents a structured approach to blockchain adoption in Saudi Arabia's financial sector. Rather than rapid deployment, the project emphasizes testing, compliance, and operational readiness.

Cross-border payments, digital asset custody, and tokenization remain complex areas that require both technical capability and regulatory coordination.

By using a sandbox model, Riyad Bank's innovation arm and Ripple aim to determine whether blockchain tools can meet institutional standards inside one of the region's largest banking markets.

The outcome of these tests will influence how quickly blockchain-based services move from controlled trials into everyday banking operations across Saudi Arabia.

Nifty Gateway, one of the earliest online marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), has announced it will shut down effective February 23 amid a sharp drop in activity.

Sign up for our daily newsletter.

The platform has already “entered withdrawal-only mode,” according to a notification on its website, which advises members: “Please withdraw your assets by this date.” After February 23, “you will no longer be able to list, purchase, bid on, or sell NFTs on Nifty Gateway. You will still be able to withdraw your NFTs and funds,” according to the site.

Nifty Gateway was founded in 2018 by twins Duncan and Griffin Cock Foster as a platform where NFTs could be easily bought and sold using cryptocurrency or fiat. In 2019, it was snapped up by cryptocurrency exchange Gemini, founded by another pair of twins Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, as its first-ever acquisition. At the time, the Fosters and Winklevosses believed NFTs would play a major role in the next era of the digital economy. And for a short time, they did.

In 2021, the platform reported $300 million in gross merchandise value, its profile boosted by its partnership with Sotheby's for the auction house's $17 million NFT drop with Pak.

“Since launching, Nifty supported dozens of innovative drops and brought new creative experiences to life,” Gemini noted in its recent announcement. “We are incredibly proud of the work the Nifty team has pioneered and grateful to Nifty Gateway's customers and artists for joining us on this journey.”

Interest in and prices of NFTs spiked during lockdowns, most prominently with Christie's first-ever sale of digital artist Beeple‘s The First 5000 Days, which soared to a final reported price of $69.3 million in 2021.

The boom saw a proliferation of NFT platforms, with major auction houses launching Web3 initiatives, from Sotheby's Metaverse to Christie's digital art department. Brands such as Louis Vuitton and Nike got in on the action; Bored Ape NFTs were trotted out on late-night talk shows.

However, the bubble has popped. As recently detailed by the Independent, the NFT market collapsed with estimated trading volumes dropping from a peak of $4 billion to roughly $800 million within a single year. It pointed to research that found that “95 percent of NFTs are now totally worthless.”

Christie's, which helped jumpstart the frenzy with its Beeple sale, quietly closed its digital art department last fall. The house “made a strategic decision to reformat digital art sales,” a spokesperson told Now Media at the time. “The company will continue to sell digital art within the larger 20th and 21st Century Art category.” In 2024, Sotheby's laid off most of its Metaverse and NFT team, retaining only three staffers.

By that point, digital platforms including Async Art, KnownOrigin, MakersPlace, and LG Art Lab had already shuttered. Analysis by DappRadar noted that the trading volume of art NFTs fell from a high of $2.97 billion in 2021 to $197 million in 2024.

Current Nifty Gateway users who hold an NFT and a balance of USD or ETH will be notified by Gemini on how to move their assets off the platform and onto the Gemini ecosystem, the company said. It added that NFTs will continue to be supported through the Gemini wallet. “This decision will allow Gemini to sharpen its focus and execute on the vision of building a one-stop super app for customers,” the announcement reads.

This has been years in the making. A few weeks ago, Zama announced its launch on mainnet with the first Confidential USDT (cUSDT) transfer on Ethereum. Over the last few days, the Zama Public Auction became the first production application built on the Zama Protocol, demonstrating real-world usage and scalability.

The Zama auction app was the most-used application on Ethereum on January 24th, above USDT, USDC, and Uniswap. It took Zama only 3 days to grow Total Value Shielded (TVS) above $100m, something that took other Ethereum-based privacy protocols multiple years. The protocol experienced no downtime, and was able to keep up with the throughput of Ethereum itself, proving that FHE is now production-ready and can be used at scale by anyone building a financial application on the blockchain.

The Zama ICO was done through a confidential sealed-bid Dutch auction.

After studying more than a hundred TGEs, we found that auctions offer the best balance of fair distribution, price discovery, and capital efficiency. In a Dutch auction, the clearing price isn't the highest bid, it's the lowest price at which a bid gets filled. Confidentiality is critical: when participants can see others' bids, price discovery becomes distorted as people react to one another rather than bidding what they truly believe.

Participants picked a price (public) and an amount (private). Nobody could see how much they were bidding for, not other bidders, not bots, not us. When the auction closed, the clearing price was calculated homomorphically, directly on encrypted data.

The auction ran from January 21–24, 2026.‍

The Zama Public Sale accounting for 12% of the initial supply and is handled in three segments:

The upcoming pre-TGE sale will give a chance to participants who did not get their bids filled in the auction to buy $ZAMA tokens at the auction clearing price, with a $10k participation cap.

Claiming opens February 2nd. $ZAMA tokens will be distributed as standard ERC-20 tokens, fully unlocked and immediately usable for paying encryption and decryption fees on the Zama Protocol.

All $ZAMA holders can stake their tokens on their choice of operators to earn rewards and help secure the Zama Protocol.

Using the Zama Portfolio, anybody can start to shield and send confidential tokens. 

Finally, blockchain gets its HTTPS moment, and the days of fully transparent transactions are behind us.

The Zama Public Auction became the first production application built on the Zama Protocol, demonstrating real-world scalability.

Entropy founder and CEO Tux Pacific says that, after four years and multiple pivots, the project was unable to find a scalable business model.

 Cointelegraph in your social feed 

Crypto start-up Entropy is closing down and handing funds back to investors, citing issues with scaling and struggling to find product-market fit.

Entropy founder and CEO Tux Pacific posted to X on Saturday that the crypto automations platform doesn't have a viable path forward after years of operation.

“After four years, several pivots, and two rounds of layoffs, I've decided to wind-up Entropy and return capital to our investors,” Pacific said. 

Entropy launched in late 2021 initially as a decentralized self-custody solution, with crypto venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz backing it alongside Coinbase Ventures as part of a $25 million seed funding round in June 2022.

Pacific said that over the second half of 2025, Entropy was developing a crypto automations platform integrated with artificial intelligence, in a similar fashion to mainstream workflow platforms such as Zapier.

However, Pacific said that “after an initial feedback request revealed that the business model wasn't venture scale, I was left with the choice to find a creative way forward or pivot once more.”

“After four hard years working in crypto, I decided that the best I could do has already been done: it was time to close up shop.”

Entropy's wind-up comes after the  a16z-backed decentralized social networking protocol Farcaster said on Thursday it would return $180 million in capital to investors amid a takeover by infrastructure provider Neynar.

Farcaster co-founder Dan Romero quashed rumours that the platform was shutting down via X, noting Neynar would steer the project in a more developer-focused direction, with Farcaster still having strong usage metrics.

Development of therapies for neuropsychiatric conditions is one of the greatest challenges of modern medicine. Common limitations of traditional small molecule drugs include poor efficacy, off-target side effects and difficult druggability of many targets. In this study, we report a different approach deploying small engineered single domain antibodies, known as nanobodies, for the treatment of depression, a prevalent neuropsychiatric condition. We develop highly selective nanobodies for a recently discovered glycine receptor mGlyR crucially linked to pathophysiology of depression. Using a mouse model of stress-induced depression, we show that non-invasive intranasal delivery of nanobody produces rapid and lasting anti-depressant effect. We solve an atomic structure of mGlyR bound to nanobody and use a variety of cell-based approaches to reveal the mechanism of mGlyR modulation and its impact on neural circuitry. These findings support development of biologics for the treatment of intractable brain disorders.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent neuropsychiatric condition that affects nearly 5% of the population in developed countries1. While there has been tremendous progress in treating depression, the efficacy of currently approved therapeutics is limited2. Exploring strategies and drug targets has been deemed a relevant goal for managing MDD3,4,5.

The molecular etiology of MDD is complex and not fully understood. Disbalance in neurotransmitter signaling is thought to trigger a range of maladaptive changes involving ion channels, kinases and second messengers, in particular cAMP, influencing synaptic communication and neuronal excitability6,7. These changes are precipitated by environmental factors such as stress, a major aggravating factor in MDD8. The neuronal circuits underlying the processing of emotional states and impacted by MDD are similarly complex and involve many structures, including the prefrontal cortex (PFC), a region heavily implicated in affective disorders and the effects of stress9.

MDD treatment has traditionally focused on the elements that mediate signaling by monoamine neurotransmitters targeted by a vast majority of currently approved antidepressants10. However, several recent medications also target GABA, glutamate and opioid receptors, highlighting the potential of other neurotransmitter systems in developing MDD treatments11,12. One such untapped system involves the neurotransmitter glycine. It is released by specific neurons and has distinct effects on neural circuits and the activity of neurons13,14. Glycine and its related naturally occurring compound taurine have been heavily implicated in mood regulation and depression15,16,17.

The effects of glycine had been thought to be mediated mainly by dedicated glycine receptor GlyR, an inhibitory ion channel18. Recently, a metabotropic receptor for glycine was discovered – mGlyR19. Formerly known as an orphan receptor GPR158, it exerts excitatory effects on neurons via modulation of the second messenger cAMP. The mGlyR is prominently expressed in the PFC, and its expression is regulated by stress20,21. The levels of mGlyR are markedly upregulated in patients diagnosed with MDD, and its knockout in mice produces antidepressant phenotype and stress resilience20. The mGlyR employs an extracellular Cache domain for glycine recognition19. The binding of glycine or taurine to the ligand-binding pocket in this domain changes the activity of the associated Regulator of G Protein Signaling (RGS) complex at the intracellular side. This influences G protein signaling to second messengers and ion channels, thereby eliciting cellular response19. Notably, loss of RGS regulation also produces antidepressant effects in mouse models22. Together, these observations point to mGlyR as an attractive target for developing anti-depressant therapies.

In this study, we explore the therapeutic relevance of targeting mGlyR as an antidepressant treatment. We develop a specific nanobody (Nb20) targeting the ligand-binding Cache domain of mGlyR, which mimics the effects of glycine. Through a series of studies, we show that Nb20 alters mGlyR function and its effects on neural circuits producing powerful antidepressant effects in mouse models when delivered in a non-invasive fashion.

Given the complete lack of selective chemical probes for mGlyR, we sought to obtain small protein ligands to alter mGlyR activity. The presence of extensive extracellular elements in mGlyR makes such a strategy attractive, considering recent success with other class C GPCRs23,24. We chose to generate single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) for their high affinity towards targets and emerging potential for therapeutic translation. Phage library prepared from a llama immunized with recombinant mGlyR was screened using HEK293 cell membranes containing mGlyR (Fig. 1a). After three rounds of enrichment and rescreening, 61 individual clones were chosen. Corresponding nanobodies were isolated following expression in E.coli and tested for mGlyR binding using a flow cytometry strategy (Fig. 1b). Three clones showed positive interaction with mGlyR-expressing cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). Of these, clone number 20 (Nb20) showed the most robust signal and was chosen for further studies.

First, we have used flow cytometry to characterize Nb20 binding to mGlyR. Cells transfected with Venus-tagged full length mGlyR were incubated with purified myc-tagged Nb20 and its interaction with cells was monitored by APC-conjugated antibodies against myc (Fig. 1b). Using this approach, we were able to detect robust labeling of majority of mGlyR-transfected cells with Nb20 when excess Nb20 was used in the assay (Fig. 1c). Control experiments with cells lacking mGlyR, Nb20 or both showed no labeling of cells with Nb20 (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 2a). Titration experiments with increasing concentrations of Nb20 showed saturable profile with EC50 of ~10 nM (Fig. 1d, e). The addition of mGlyR ligand glycine did not affect the binding of Nb20 with mGlyR (Supplementary Fig. 3). This interaction was specific to mGlyR, as we observed no Nb binding with other GPCRs, including related GPR179 and unrelated D1R (Supplementary Fig. 2b).

Next, we characterized the binding using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). In these experiments, we purified the recombinantly expressed extracellular portion of mGlyR (Ecto-mGlyR) tagged with an Fc tag and immobilized on the SPR chip via a mouse anti-human IgG CH2 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1f). Applying increasing concentrations of Nb20 showed robust binding to the immobilized Ecto-mGlyR with an estimated KD = 375 nM (χ2 = 1.07; KON = 4.19 × 104 ms−1 and a KOFF = 1.57 × 10−2 s−1 (Fig. 1g). The higher observed affinity of Nb20 in the cell-based applications, as compared to experiments with purified recombinant proteins, may be caused by an avidity effect that effectively enhances the binding to the low nanomolar level. Together, these data support the development of a selective affinity tool for mGlyR- Nb20.

To study the functional consequences of mGlyR interaction with Nb20, we analyzed the ability of mGlyR to modulate the activity of the GTPase-activating Protein (GAP) complex RGS7/Gβ5, through which mGlyR transduces its signals. To monitor GAP activity of the mGlyR complex, we studied its impact on the kinetics of G protein deactivation using a Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) assay (Fig.2a). This assay monitors changes in BRET signal upon interaction of Venus-Gβγ subunits with the masGRK3CT-Nluc reporter. Upon Gα deactivation, Venus-Gβγ dissociates from masGRK3CT-Nluc reporter, quenching the signal. As previously reported19, we found that the introduction of RGS7/Gβ5 accelerated deactivation of its substrate, Gαo (Fig. 2b, d). Application of Nb20 had no significant effect on either baseline Gαo deactivation or RGS7/Gβ5-assisted process (Fig. 2b, d). However, when mGlyR was co-expressed together with RGS7/Gβ5, Nb20 significantly decelerated Gαo deactivation (Fig. 2c, d), suggesting that it specifically inhibited the GAP activity of RGS7/Gβ5 through mGlyR. Dose-response studies showed that the IC50 of Nb20 on mGlyR is ~6 nM (Fig. 2e). In summary, these studies show that Nb20 serves as a selective inhibitor of GAP activity mediated by the mGlyR complex.

To gain insights into the mechanisms underlying Nb20-mediated modulation of mGlyR, we obtained a high-resolution structure of mGlyR in complex with Nb20 using cryogenic electron microscopy (CryoEM) both with and without RGS7-Gβ5 complex (Fig. 3a, b). Three-dimensional classification (3D) of the particles revealed two dominant 3D classes, Nb-20-mGlyR and Nb-20-mGlyR-RGS7/Gβ5. Subsequently, these classes were refined to resolutions of 3.49 Å and 3.89 Å, respectively, without applying any symmetry (Supplementary Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. 5). To improve the map, local refinements using a soft mask corresponding to ECD-Nb20 and TM-RGS7/Gβ5 were performed. The quality of the obtained maps exhibited higher resolution features in the TM region but relatively low resolution in the ECD and Nb20 binding regions. Nevertheless, these maps allowed us to construct the complete models of the mGlyR-Nb20 and mGlyR-RGS complexes, guided by known structures of mGlyR and the nanobodies (Supplementary Fig. 6).

We found that Nb20 was bound to the lateral side of the dimeric interface formed by two ligand binding Cache domains of the mGlyR dimer (Fig. 3c). The binding interface is predominantly mediated by the complementarity-determining regions 1 (CDR1) and possibly 2 (CDR2) of Nb20, establishing extensive contacts with the α2 helix and the loop between the β2 and β3 strands (residues 195–200) of subunit A, as well as a loop between the α1 and α2 helices (residues 140–153) of subunit B of mGlyR (Fig. 3d). The CDR2 of Nb20 interacts with a groove located at the dimeric interface between the two cache domains of the mGlyR receptor. Within the CDR2, the residue W58 lies in close spatial proximity to W162 from the α2 helix of subunit A of mGlyR, suggesting a potential interaction between these residues. Additionally, polar contacts may occur between R57 of Nb20 and E166 of subunit A, as well as between the backbone carbonyl of T59 Nb20 and N143 of the neighboring subunit of mGlyR (Fig. 3d). However, given the relatively low local resolution of the Nb20 and ECD regions, precise placement of side chains was not possible, and therefore these potential interactions should be interpreted with caution. We validated the binding mode of Nb20 by mutating and replacing all 6 critical residues in CDR1 and 9 residues in CDR2 regions with alanine and glycine (see Materials and “Methods”). This resulted in a complete loss of interaction of mutant Nb20 (Nb20*) with mGlyR (Supplementary Fig. 7). However, we can not exclude the possibility that these mutations may also affect the nanobody more globally. Notably, the ligand binding pocket is located adjacent to the binding groove of Nb20 (Supplementary Fig. 8a, b).

To determine whether binding to Nb20 indeed induces conformational changes in mGlyR, we first compared the Nb20-mGlyR structure to the apo structure of mGlyR alone. Global untethered superimposition of mGlyR-Nb20 on mGlyR-apo revealed conformational changes across various domains, including the Cache, stalk, and transmembrane (TM) domains (Supplementary Fig. 8c–e). Notably, the stalk domain exhibited pronounced movements, with deviations of up to 4.2 Å (Supplementary Fig. 8d). We next compared the transmembrane (TM) region in Nb20-bound complex structure with that of the two previously determined structures of mGlyR–RGS7–Gβ5 without Nb20 (PDBs: 7SHF and 7EWP). While the overall TM architecture is conserved across structures, Nb20-structure showed notable deviations in TM3–TM4 and the connecting loop, ranging from relatively minor ~1.1 Å (7EWP) to substantial ~5.5 Å (7SHF) (Supplementary Fig. 8f, h).

To pinpoint the precise conformational changes in the extracellular domain induced by Nb20 binding, we aligned the transmembrane (TM) domains (Fig. 3e). Anchoring the TM that way allowed us to observe dramatic conformational changes in the extracellular domain (ECD) upon Nb20 binding to the receptor. Specifically, in the Nb20-bound structure, the ECD translated by as much as 12 Å and rotated by approximately 7° in relation to the mGlyR-apo structure (Fig. 3f). These observations suggest that binding to Nb20 starts the wave of events that eventually remodel the cytoplasmic interface of the receptor involved in interaction with RGS7/Gβ5 and transduction of the signal. To test this model, we further compared the cryoEM structure of Nb20-mGlyR-RGS7/Gβ5 with previously solved mGlyR-RGS7/Gβ5 structures (PDB: 7SHF, 7EWP) (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Fig. 8f, h). In the mGlyR-RGS7/Gβ5 structures, the ECD domain was highly flexible, resulting in low-resolution features as observed in 7EWP25 or scattered density at relatively higher resolution in 7SHF26 structures. The binding of Nb20 appeared to improve ECD stability in the presence of the bound RGS7-Gβ5 module, yielding a relatively well-resolved density for ECD. Strikingly, comparison revealed that the density corresponding to the RGS domain, which typically wraps around Gβ5 from below, was poorly resolved in the Nb20-bound structure, suggesting that the RGS domain adopts a more flexible conformation compared to mGlyR-RGS7/Gβ5 structures, where this region was resolved at higher resolution. (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 8f, h). Even after local refinement and analysis at various contour levels, the RGS domain density remained poorly resolved, suggesting that this domain becomes highly flexible upon binding the Nb20 to ECD. Superimposition of Nb20-bound and free structures by the 7TM region suggested plausible changes. The DEP/DEX domain of RGS7, which directly contacts the receptor, adopted a distinct conformation in the Nb20-bound structure. Notably, the β3-hairpin loop becomes unresolved (Fig. 3g), which may affect the RGS complex. Nb20 binding appeared to shift CTH2 by 2.2 Å, induce a 1.2 Å displacement in RGS7, and 1.5 Å movement in the TM3-TM4 connecting loop, and up to a 5.5 Å (when compared with 7SHF) changes in the TM3, which serve as the contact site for RGS7 (Supplementary Fig. 8f, l). However, the exact side-chain orientation at these regions could not be resolved due to the low local resolution, limiting the structural analysis to the level of secondary structure elements. A high-resolution structure of RGS7-Gβ5 will be required to delineate the remodeling of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions following Nb20 binding. Although the Gβ5 in the Nb20-bound structure appears to shift by approximately 5 Å compared to its position in the structure without Nb20, this displacement should be interpreted cautiously, given the poorly resolved density for Gβ5 (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Fig. 8g). Together, structural studies suggest a model where binding of Nb20 to the extracellular ligand binding Cache domain of mGlyR may promote specific stabilized conformation of the receptor which possibly remodels its intracellular interaction with the RGS7/Gβ5, leading to a higher flexibility of its catalytic RGS domain, decoupling it from regulating Gα proteins, e.g. by changing its orientation towards the membrane where Gα protein are residing.

Our functional data indicate that Nb20 blocks the ability of mGlyR-RGS7/Gβ5 complex to regulate G protein signaling. Previous studies indicated that genetic deletion of either mGlyR20 or RGS722 produced a substantial antidepressant phenotype in mice and stress resilience. Therefore, we have next tested whether administration of Nb20 in vivo would have similar behavioral effects. Sequence analysis of llama-derived Nb20 reveals favorable immunogenicity profile likely making it suitable for in vivo applications in other species (Supplementary Fig. 9). Mice were injected, delivering either Nb20 or vehicle control into the brain (Fig. 4a) and evaluated in a panel of behavioral tests that generally assess various aspects of affective-like states 24 h later (Fig. 4b). We found that mice that received Nb20 buried fewer marbles in the marble burying test, had reduced immobility in the tail suspension and forced swim tests relative to control animals but their behavior in the elevated plus maze did not reach threshold for statistical significance when compared to untreated mice (Fig. 4b). Calculating overall emotionality score based on multiple measures confirmed that mice treated with Nb20 displayed prominent antidepressant-like phenotype (Fig. 4c). Remarkably, these behavioral differences between the groups persisted for at least two weeks following the treatment at which point anxiolytic effect slightly increased (Supplementary Fig. 10). To confirm the specificity of the effects, we used mutated Nb20* incapable of binding to mGlyR and found that treatment of mice with these nanobodies did not produce significant effects in any of the paradigms used (Supplementary Fig. 11). We further conducted a panel of tests to measure the effect of Nb20 extending the range of behavior al testing to better understand Nb20 actions. We found that treatment of mice with Nb20, but not inactive Nb20*, alleviated novelty-induced hypophagia, an approach behavior influenced by depression/anxiety-related affective states (Supplementary Fig. 12a). Interestingly, Nb20 further enhanced an ability of mice to recognize novel object suggestive of the positive effect in the cognitive domain (Supplementary Fig. 12b). Importantly, Nb20 treatment had no effect on locomotor activity (Supplementary Fig. 13a) or motor performance (Supplementary Fig. 13b) of mice.

To further explore the therapeutic utility of Nb20, we assessed its effects in a stress-induced depression model where mice are exposed to a chronic variable stress (Fig. 4d, Supplementary Fig. 14). In this study, Nb20 was also administered non-invasively through intranasal delivery, given the translational relevance of this method for treating depression27,28,29. Furthermore, the effects were benchmarked to the effects of rapid anti-depressant treatment with ketamine delivered the same way (Fig. 4d, e). Remarkably, we found that intranasal delivery of Nb20 produced a rapid and powerful antidepressant effect in stressed mice (Fig. 4F) with similar effects in males and females (Supplementary Fig. 15). The extent of this effect matched the antidepressant effects of ketamine across all behavioral paradigms. We did not detect the effect of Nb20 on either anxiety-related behaviors of stress-exposed mice or general motor activity (Supplementary Fig. 16). Neither did we observe Nb20 influencing the hedonic component in the sucrose preference task (Supplementary Fig. 16). Furthermore, Nb20 was able to normalize stress-induced elevation of corticosterone, prominent in female mice (Supplementary Fig. 17). Together, these results indicate that Nb20 produces antidepressant-like effects in a mouse model of stress-induced depression.

We finally sought to assess the impact of Nb20 on the activity of ex vivo intact neural networks by examining the intrinsic properties of layer II-III neurons in the prelimbic cortex, where mGlyR is prominently expressed29. Knockout of mGlyR or its inhibition with endogenous ligand glycine has been shown to increase the excitability of pyramidal neurons in layer II-III28, among other effects on synaptic physiology, which vary across different brain regions and neuronal populations30,31,32. Thus, blockade of mGlyR with Nb20 would be predicted to increase the excitability of layer II-III neurons. To test this hypothesis, we incubated brain slices with Nb20 for 10 min prior to recordings and compared excitability of layer II-III neurons with the untreated slices or slices incubated with control Nb20* nanobody deficient in mGlyR binding (Fig. 5a). Pre-incubation with Nb20 significantly increased the number of action potentials fired over the ramp while decreasing the amount of current necessary to elicit the first action potential (Fig. 5b–d) without changes in the resting membrane potential (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 18). In contrast, control Nb20* had no effect on neuronal firing, rheobase current or resting membrane potential (Fig. 5b–d, Supplementary Fig. 18). Together, these results indicate that inhibition of mGlyR with Nb20 increases excitability of layer II-III neurons in prelimbic cortex, in a manner similar to genetic loss of mGlyR or its inhibition by glycine.

In this study, we suggest that an immunotherapy solution could be potentially applied for the treatment of a major neuropsychiatric condition- major depressive disorder. Immunotherapies offer a high degree of specificity, low off-target and toxicity and high efficacy and have become a method of choice for treating cancer and autoimmune disorders33,34. Immunotherapies are also becoming increasingly applied for brain conditions, most successfully in managing neurodegenerative conditions35. Intriguingly, a few recent studies also indicate their potential utility for managing neuropsychiatric conditions36,37,38,39. In this work, we applied an immunotherapy strategy to effectively suppress depression-related behaviors in mice, thereby uncovering a fresh direction for therapeutic interventions for a significant health crisis. We recognize the limitations of modeling neuropsychiatric disorders in rodents. Ultimately, translation of our findings would require sequence optimization of the Nb20 to increase its brain penetrance, reduce antigenicity, as well pharmacokinetic studies finding preferred administration route before tolerability and efficacy clinical trials in humans. We further recognize that more work is required before our observations could be translated to humans, especially in the domain of characterizing the toxicity of the Nb20 as well as their on-target and potential off-target effects on neuronal physiology, as well as pharmacokinetic properties.

The key to our approach was to develop a single domain antibody, known as a nanobody, recognizing a discovered metabotropic receptor for glycine, mGlyR, as a target for developing antidepressants19. Its genetic knockout in mice results in a marked antidepressant phenotype and resilience to stress-induced depression20. Molecularly, mGlyR acts non-canonically by engaging the RGS7/Gβ5 complex rather than typical G proteins to transduce its signals. Glycine acts as a suppressor of mGlyR signaling, thereby relieving the inhibitory influence that RGS7/Gβ5 imposes on G proteins, disinhibiting them and allowing signal propagation19. Consistent with the inhibitory influence of glycine on mGlyR and mGlyR knockout being antidepressant, we find that our nanobody, Nb20, also inhibits mGlyR and produces an antidepressant effect. While we observe that Nb20 increases the excitability of layer II-III neurons in the PFC via mGlyR, the causality of this effect is uncertain. Nb20 likely modulates mGlyR on multiple neurons and regulates several processes to exert the anti-depressant effects and reverse the effects of stress. The contribution of mGlyR to these processes are not well defined and remains controversial20,30,31,32. Similarly, stress exerts a plethora of complex effects on neurophysiology by altering the expression and function of a number of molecules across the brain40,41. How inhibition of mGlyR by Nb20 alters the effects of stress on the brain circuitry to produce anti-depressant effects will require understanding the mechanisms by which stress impacts affective states, which remain incompletely understood. Defining the effects of Nb20 on the physiological properties of neurons and their responses to stress will be an important area for future exploration. Further work will also be needed to rule out the contribution of other targets which might be unintentionally engaged by Nb20 to produce anti-depressant effects.

Detailed structural and mechanistic studies show that Nb20 interacts with the ligand-binding Cache domain of mGlyR and inhibits the GAP activity of RGS7/Gβ5 towards its substrate Gαo. Thus, Nb20 serves as a synthetic antagonist specific for mGlyR. There is currently no structure of glycine-bound mGlyR, and future experiments will need to explore whether Nb20 taps into the mechanism of mGlyR antagonism utilized by its endogenous ligand glycine. Of further interest is the presence of the additional elements in the C-terminus of mGlyR, which play a critical role in allosteric potentiation of GAP activity of RGS7/Gβ542 but are not captured in our structure of the truncated receptor. Because Nb20 effectively inhibits full-length mGlyR and also induces prominent structural changes in the truncated mGlyR, it suggests that Nb20 inhibition, which results in repositioning of the RGS7/Gβ5, occurs independently of the allosteric potentiation conferred by the C-terminus of the receptor. Loss of the density for the catalytic RGS domain suggests increased flexibility of the region, which would disfavor regulation of its substrate Gαo strictly oriented on the membrane. How exactly Nb20 influences the conformation of the 7TM region and particularly its interface with RGS7/Gβ5 has not been fully resolved in this study, given the differences between the two previously reported ground state structures of mGlyR without Nb20. Additional structural work that captures intermediate conformations of the receptor complexes will be required to fully resolve the mechanism of RGS/Gβ5 modulation by mGlyR ligands such as Nb20 or glycine. It will also be interesting to determine the structural basis of allosteric potentiation of RGS7/Gβ5 by the C-terminus of mGlyR and how it is influenced by Nb20 and glycine. Future studies will also need to establish whether and how Nb20 and glycine affect alternative modes of RGS7/Gb5 engagement by mGlyR observed in other studies25.

Over recent years, nanobodies have been widely deployed as reagents for studying and manipulating GPCRs in the nervous system43,44,45,46. They show several key advantages that make them superb tools, including unsurpassed target selectivity, the ability to recognize distinct conformational states, stability, and relatively small size, which facilitates target access47. As a result, nanobodies are increasingly adapted for therapeutic applications to brain disorders39,48. The exciting potential of their therapeutic utility is fueled by multiple reports that nanobodies can efficiently reach their targets in the central nervous system. Several mechanisms likely enable this, including their active and passive transport across the blood-brain barrier, transcytosis and carrier-assisted delivery49,50,51,52. Intriguingly, we show that Nb20 targeting mGlyR shows in vivo antidepressant efficacy when administered intranasally to mice. These observations are similar to previous reports of effective intranasal nanobody delivery53,54 and suggest that they are readily uptaken by the olfactory neurons. Furthermore, the delivery of nanobodies may be further augmented in depression-related states known to disrupt the blood-brain barrier55. Overall, our studies support the efficacy of non-invasive nanobody-based therapies for brain disorders, at least in rodents, and suggest that it could be explored as a modality for the treatment of depression, in particular if it is accompanied by cognitive issues and unencumbered by anxiety.

All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines by NIH and the European Communities Council Directive 2010/63/EU. Animal studies are reported in compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. The Gpr158−/− mice were purchased from KOMP (Gpr158tm1(KOMP)Vlcg) and maintained on a C57/Bl6 background and bred as heterozygous pairs to generate Gpr158−/− and Gpr158+/+ littermates. After weaning, male and females were separately group-housed under standard conditions in a pathogen-free facility on a 12:12 light:dark hour cycle with access to food and water ad libitum. For the chronic variable stress paradigm, wild-type male and female adult (8-week-old) C57Bl/6 J mice (Charles River, Massachusetts) were habituated for one week before experimental manipulation. These mice were single-housed at room temperature (~24 °C) under a 12-h light/dark cycle (07:00-19:00) with ad libitum access to water and food, except during testing.

Dopamine D2 receptor (cDNA Resource Center: #DRD0200001), RGS7 (GenBank: AY587875), Gβ5 (GenBank: NM_016194), GαoA (cDNA Resource Center: #GNA0OA0000) in pcDNA3.1(+) were purchased from cDNA Resource Center (https://www.cdna.org). masGRK3ct-Nluc, Venus-156-239-Gβ1, Venus-1-155-Gγ2 were synthesized by GenScript in pcDNA3.1 + . pCMV5 plasmid encoding GαoA was a gift from H. Itoh (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan). GPR158 ectodomain (aa 1-417) was subcloned into a previously described Fc and 6xHis tagged vector32. Nanobody production was done using the pCANTAB vector (phage display) and promising candidates, including Nb20, were subcloned into pET28a. The complete sequence of Nb20 is as follows: MAEVQLQESGGGLVQAGGSLRLSCAASGSIGNIYIMGWYRQTPGPQRELVATIRTVRWTKYEDYADSVKGRFTISDDDAKNTVYLQMNSLKPEDTAVYYCNYKDYNAPSDGYWGQGTQVTVSSEPKTPKPQ.

The following chemicals were prepared: LEW (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH adjusted to 8.0 using NaOH), 2xYT (16.0 g/l tryptone, 10 g/l yeast extract, 5 g/l sodium chloride, Final pH 6.8 ± 0.2 at 25 °C, autoclaved).

One llama was immunized in strict accordance with good animal practices following the EU animal welfare legislation law with HEK293 cell membrane expressing mGlyR at Eurogentec (Belgium). Blood samples from immunized llama were harvested 87 days after immunization, and RNA from leukocytes was extracted using LeukoLOCK Total RNA Isolation system (Life Technologies #AM1923) accordingly to manufacturer instructions. Reverse transcription was performed on extracted RNA, and cDNA was amplified by PCR using 8 pairs of primers designed to amplify the variable heavy only domains (VHH) of non-conventional IgG2 and IgG3 and introduce NotI and SfiI cleavage sites, respectively (in bold in the following sequence).

Amplified cDNA was purified and digested with NotI and SfiI, following by ligation into the phagemid vector pCANTAB5 and electroporation of competent E. coli TG1 cells. Bacteria were grown in 2xYT broth containing 2% glucose at 37 °C under agitation until OD600nm reached 0.5. Subsequently, helper phage KM13 (2 × 1011 units) was added for 30 min at 37 °C without agitation. Infected bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 2xYT containing 120 µg/ml ampicillin and 50 µg/ml kanamycin. The phage library was grown overnight at 37 °C with agitation. Phages expressing a nanobody library were harvested and purified by centrifugation at 8000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatant was precipitated using 20% of PEG6000/2.5 M NaCl for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 8000 g for 15 min at 4 °C and pellet was resuspended in PBS-glycerol 15% and stored at +4 °C.

To obtain anti-mGlyR-specific nanobody clones, two steps of depletion were first performed. Library containing 1012 phage units was incubated in the first well of a MaxiSorp plate (ThermoFisher Scientific #441653) coated with 100 µg of HEK293 cell membranes mock-transfected for 1 h at RT, and supernatant was transferred to a second identically coated well for 1 h at RT in order to reduce non-specific binders. A last step of selection was performed using the remaining phages incubated on one well coated with 100 µg of cell membranes expressing mGlyR for 2 h at RT. After washing, bound phages were eluted with Tris 50 mM pH = 8, 1 mM CaCl2, Trypsine 1 µg/ml for 15 min at RT. Eluted phages were recovered and amplified with E. coli TG1 cells infected in 2xYT broth containing ampicillin and 2% glucose overnight at 30 °C with agitation. Next day, 2 × 109 units of helper phage KM13 (AKA VCSM13 Agilent Technologies #2002521) were added to the amplified TG1 cells for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation at 3000 g for 10 min at RT. Pellet was resuspended in 2xYT broth containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and 25 µg/ml kanamycin and incubated overnight at 30 °C with agitation. To separate TG1 cells and amplified phages, the overnight culture was centrifuged at 3000 g for 30 min at 4 °C and phages in the supernatant were precipitated for 30 min on ice using 20% PEG-6000/NaCl 2.5 M, followed by a centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellet was resuspended in PBS with 15% glycerol and stored at −20 °C, and the rest was used in the second round of panning selection as described previously. A total of 3 rounds of panning were performed to identify 61 individual clones. Each clone was produced directly from individual TG1 colonies induced by isopropyl-β−26-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for flow cytometry screening.

Individual nanobody cDNAs were fused with a c-myc and 8xhis tags at the C-terminus, subcloned into the pET28a vector using the in-fusion HD cloning kit (Takara Bio #102518) and sequenced. Freshly transformed E. coli BL21 DE3 (NEB # C2527H) with pET28a plasmid encoding nanobody was grown at 37 °C, shaking at 220 rpm in Terrific Broth (Kd Medical Inc #501018968) containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin until OD280nm = [0.6–0.8]. Protein expression was then induced by 1 mM Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and bacteria were grown overnight at 28 °C with shaking at 220 rpm. Bacteria were collected, centrifuged, and the pellet was lysed by sonication in LEW 1X at 4 °C. Periplasmic solution were harvested after centrifugation at 17,000 g, 30 min, 4 °C and purified on a Ni-IDA column (Macherey Nagel # 745160) according to manufacturer recommendations. Ecto-GPR158-Fc was produced in HEK293FT cells (supernatant) purified (Nickel column) dialyzed/concentrated (Amicon tube 30 kDa). Protein concentration in supernatant was determined using UV spectroscopy (Nanodrop).

The cryo-EM sample was prepared as described previously26. The protein sample, the purified Nb20-mGlyR-RGS7-Gβ5 complex, was prepared for cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) imaging. A total of 3.0 µL of the protein sample was applied to glow-discharged 200 mesh gold grids (UltraAufoil R1.2/1.3) inside an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fischer Scientific). The Vitrobot was maintained at 4 °C with 100% humidity. Prior to blotting, a blot force of 2, a blot time of 2 s, and a wait time of 20 s were applied to remove excess sample. The grids were then plunge-frozen in liquid ethane to preserve their vitrified state.

Cryo-EM imaging of the Nb20-mGlyR-RGS7-Gβ5 protein complex was performed using a 300 kV Titan Krios electron microscope equipped with a Gatan K3 Summit direct electron detection (DED) camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA) and a post-column GIF Quantum energy filter operating in counting mode. The microscope was calibrated to a magnification of 105,000, resulting in a nominal pixel size of 0.873 Å. A total of 6689 movies were collected, covering a defocus range of −1.5 to −2.0 µm. The total dose applied was 40 e^−/Å^2, achieved by using a dose rate of approximately 12.5 e^-/s/phys pixel per frame across 40 frames, resulting in a total exposure time of 2.5 s.

The mGlyR cryo-EM dataset was processed using56 and cryoSPARC57. The 6689 movies were initially motion-corrected for beam-induced motion using MotionCor258 within RELION. Motion corrected images were then imported into cryoSPARC57, where the patch Contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation tool was used for CTF estimation.

For particle picking, the TOPAZ algorithm, which employs a convolutional neural network algorithm implemented in CryoSparc, was used59. A training set of 1000 micrographs were used to generate a trained model, which was subsequently used for particle picking across the entire dataset, resulting in a total of 3,247,619 particles, which were then extracted from the micrographs with a box size of 340. The extracted particles underwent three rounds of reference-free 2D classification to discard poor-quality particles. The protein particles exhibiting favorable 2D class averages were combined and subjected to several rounds of ab initio and heterogeneous refinement. This iterative refinement process led to the generation of two subsetsone containing 91,859 particles corresponding to the Nb20-mGlyR-RGS complex, and the other consisting of 121,523 particles corresponding to the mGlyR-Nb20 complex. The final resolution of these subsets was estimated to be approximately 3.49 Å and 3.89 Å, respectively, using the gold standard Fourier shell correlation (GSFSC) method within cryoSPARC57. To improve the maps for ECD-Nb20 and TM-RGS7-Gβ5, focused refinement was performed using soft masks (0.001 threshold, 12-pixel padding, 3-pixel dilation) corresponding to each region. This focused refinement approach produced maps at 4.14 Å for ECD-Nb20 and 4.18 Å for TM-RGS7-Gβ5, enabling model building. EM density visualization was done in UCSF Chimera60.

The models of mGlyR-Nb20 and Nb20-mGlyR-RGS7-Gβ5 were built based on the previously determined structure of mGlyR (PDB ID: 7SHE and 7SHF) using COOT61. When building the model for mGlyR, the density corresponding to Nb20 was observed, indicating the presence of the bound nanobody. The shape and size of this density were consistent with the bound nanobody. The Nb20 model generated using the AlphaFold method was docked into the cryo-EM map and manually adjusted, built, and refined using COOT61.

The cryo-EM map of Nb20-mGlyR-RGS7-Gβ5 had a final resolution of 3.89 Å. The map exhibited well-resolved density for the transmembrane (TM) domain but relatively low density for RGS7, with the RGS domain missing from the maps. To build the atomic model of the Nb20-mGlyR-RGS7-Gβ5 structure, the mGlyR-Nb20 model generated in this study (from the same dataset) was used as a template. The model was docked into the map using UCSF Chimera and further manually adjusted, built, and refined in COOT.

In the Nb20-mGlyR-RGS7-Gβ5 map, the density for the RGS domain of RGS7 was poorly resolved and fragmented, making it challenging to build a reliable model. The TM domain of both the mGlyR-Nb20 and Nb20-mGlyR-RGS7-Gβ5 models underwent iterative manual building in COOT, followed by real-space refinement in PHENIX62. The Gβ5 and RGS7 regions were not resolved well, and therefore, these regions were docked into the map as rigid bodies. The RGS domain, which is not visible in the map, was not built and remains absent from the final model. Local rotamer fitting and restrained group ADP refinement were also performed. The resulting models were refined against both the unfiltered half maps and sum maps in real space using PHENIX. Structures were visualized, and figures were prepared in UCSF Chimera60, ChimeraX63,64 and PyMOL65. The data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1.

HEK293FT cells were obtained from ThermoFisher and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected using Metafectene Pro (Biontex, Germany) in 96 96-well plate following the manufacturer's instructions.

HEK293FT cells were seeded in a white flat-bottom 96-well plate (Greiner Bio-One) at 50,000 cells per well and transiently transfected using Metafectene Pro with the manufacturer's instructions. pcDNA3.1 plasmids coding for Dopamine D2R (1), mGlyR (1), RGS7 (1), Gb5 (1), Gao (2), Venus-1-155-Gγ2 (1), Venus 156-239-Gβ1 (1) and masGRK3ct-Nluc (1) were used to transfect cells (ratio in parenthesis). An empty vector (pcDNA3.1(+)) was used in order to normalize the quantity of transfected DNA. 24 h after transfection in DMEM complete medium supplemented with 0.1% of Matrigel (Corning), cells were washed with BRET buffer (Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) containing 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.1% glucose). Measurements of BRET between Venus-Gβ1γ2 and masGRK3ct-Nluc were performed to monitor the release of free Gβγ dimers after activation of heterotrimers containing Gα subunits in living cells, as described before66. Cells were incubated with 1 µM of Nb20 or with 100 µM of glycine or both when indicated and with the NanoLuc (Nluc) substrate at the manufacturer's instructions. In order to release Gαo and start deactivation of Gαo, 100 µM of dopamine and 100 µM of haloperidol were injected sequentially and automatically (t = 10 s and t = 25 s) by the plate reader (PHERAstar FSX, BMG Labtech), and dual-luminescence was measured at 475 ± 30 nm and 535 ± 30 nm. The BRET signal was determined by calculating the ratio of the light emitted by the Venus- Gβ1γ2 (535 nm with a 30 nm band path width) over the light emitted by the masGRK3ct-Nluc (475 nm with a 30 nm band path width). The average baseline value (basal BRET ratio) recorded prior to agonist stimulation was subtracted from the experimental BRET signal values, and the resulting difference (netBRET ratio) was normalized against the maximal netBRET value recorded upon agonist stimulation. The rate constants (1/τ) of the deactivation phases were obtained by fitting a one-phase exponential decay curve to the traces with Graphpad Prism 9.0. The kGAP rate constants were determined by subtracting the basal deactivation rate (kapp) from the deactivation rate measured in the presence of exogenous RGS protein.

HEK293FT cells were cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 1.106 per well and transfected with 2 µg of cDNA of mGlyR or empty pcDNA3.1+ in control experiments, using Metafectene Pro. 48 h after transfection, cells were mechanically detached by pipetting up and down, washed in PBS supplemented with 0.1% BSA, counted and incubated in PBS-0.1% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C under rotation. Nanobody-20 (Nb20) and 10 µl of anti-myc-APC conjugated antibody (R&d Systems #IC3696A) were added and incubated in the dark with rotation, at 4 °C for 1 h. After 3 washes, cells were analyzed in the LSR-II BD flow cytometer. A gating strategy to sort individual cells from debris and doublets was used as indicated in each figure. Sorted cells were measured for fluorescence in respective channels. Negative control conditions were used to set the positive threshold for APC (mock cells incubated with Nb and anti-myc-APC antibody), and for Venus (mock transfected cells). Acquired data were analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo).

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were performed on a Biacore X100 instrument at 25 °C using 1x HBS-EP+ (Cytiva) as a running buffer. A mouse anti-human IgG CH2 monoclonal antibody (Cytiva) was immobilized to a density of ~9500 response units (RU) on a CM5 sensor chip via standard NHS/EDC coupling methods (Cytiva). Subsequently, GPR158-Fc at 10 μg/mL was captured to ~1,800 RU on the active flow cell. A concentration series with two-fold dilutions (500–31.25 nM) of the nanobody Nb20 were injected using a multi-cycle method. The lowest concentration (31.25 nM) was repeated to confirm regeneration of the sensor chip. Biacore X100 Control Software 2.0.1 (Cytiva) was used to collect data, and Biacore X100 Evaluation Software 2.0.1 (Cytiva) was used to analyze data.

Electrophysiological recordings from layer II-III neurons of the prelimbic cortex were performed with mice of either sex aged between 4–12 weeks. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated. The brain was quickly removed and rested for 30 s in ice-cold oxygenated solution containing (in mM): 93 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 2 thiourea, 5 Na-ascorbate, 3 Na-pyruvate, 0.5 CaCl2·, 10 MgCl2, (adjusted to 7.3–7.4 pH with HCl). Coronal slices (300 μm thick) were cut on a vibratome (VT1200S, Leica), mounted on a porous membrane and incubated for 12 min at 34 °C in NMDG. Slices were then transferred to a modified HEPES ACSF containing (in mM): 92 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 20 HEPES, 25 glucose, 5 Na-ascorbate, 2 thiourea, 3 Na-pyruvate, (adjusted to 7.3–7.4 pH with NaOH) and allowed to recover for 1 h at room temperature. For recordings, slices were transferred to a submerged recording chamber where they were continuously perfused at 2 ml/min with oxygenated ACSF containing the following (in mM): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 18 NaHCO3, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, in presence of the following synaptic blockers: picrotoxin (100 µM), strychnine (1 µM), CNQX (20 µM), APV (50 µM). Pipets (3–5 MΩ) were pulled from P-1000 (Sutter Instruments, CA) and filled with an intracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 119 K-MeSO4, 12 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 0.4 Na-GTP, 2 Mg-ATP (280–300 mOsm, pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH). Slices were incubated with Nb-20, Nb-20* (1 µM), or ACSF and changes in neuronal excitability were assessed by counting the number of spikes evoked in response to a 1-s depolarizing ramp ranging from 0 to 200 pA with a 20-s intertrial interval. The Rheobase current was defined as the minimum current necessary to elicit the first AP. Acquisition was done using Clampex 10.7, MultiClamp 700B amplifier and Digidata 1440 A (Molecular Devices, CA). Data were analyzed with Clampfit 10.7.

No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. No specific randomization methods were used. Animals were randomly assigned to experimental groups depending on genotype. Experimenters were blinded to the treatment groups.

Intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration was performed according to a previously described method67. Mice were injected with 5 µl of purified and endotoxin-free nanobody solution in saline (1.92 mg/ml) of nanobody or 5 µl of vehicle. Behavioral evaluation was conducted starting 24 h after treatment over the course of three days. Marble burying was performed in the morning on day one, followed by the elevated plus maze in the evening. Tail suspension was done the next day, and the force swim test was performed on day three. The same sequence and timing of behavioral testing was repeated two weeks after treatment. For the intranasal (IN) administration, 24 h after the last stressor, mice received two treatments on the same day, separated by a 6-h interval. Each treatment involved the application of 10 µl of purified, endotoxin-free nanobody solution in saline (0.95 mg/ml) or racemic ketamine hydrochloride (20 mg/kg; VetaKet; Patterson Veterinary; Cat# 78925834) dissolved in saline, delivering 5 uL to each nostril, using a P-10 pipette.

The chronic variable stress (CVS) paradigm consists of daily exposure to one of three stressors over 21 consecutive days. All mice are exposed to one stressor per day, and the three stressors are repeated every three days. The times for each stressor vary from day to day to increase unpredictability. The stressors include restraint stress, where mice are placed in ventilated 50 mL conical tubes for 1 h in the home cage. The next stressor is foot shock, which is performed in shock boxes (6 mice can be simultaneously run). Mice receive 100 mild foot shocks at 0.4 mA for 1 h at random intervals. The final stressor is 30 min of predator odor exposure. 15 uL of TMT (Fisher Scientific; 501844430) is pipetted onto a cotton tip applicator and placed into a clean, empty standard mouse cage. The single housing is also considered an additional stressor on the mice. Termination criteria were used to determine whether mice should continue in the stress paradigm, including bleeding, excessive weight loss (>20% initial), and hunched or moribund phenotypes. Behavior was run 24 h after drug treatment in counterbalanced groups, and animals were numbered to maintain blinding in the manually scored tests. 48 h after the final behavioral test, mice were sacrificed.

Marble burying (MB) was conducted in a standard mouse cage (27 × 16.5 × 12.5 cm) with 5 cm corncob bedding and 20 glass marbles overlaid in a 4 × 5 equidistant arrangement. Background white noise (approximately 70 dB) was used during trials. The mouse was placed in the center of the cage, and testing consisted of a 30 min exploration period. The marbles, at least half-buried at the end of the trial, were counted as buried.

The splash test (ST) was performed using a 10% sucrose solution freshly prepared the day of the test (Sigma-Aldrich; S9378) and was sprayed onto the dorsal coat of the mouse (~0.35 mL per mouse), and placed into an empty, inescapable cylindrical Plexiglas container (121 cm in length and 15 cm in diameter). Mice were habituated to the cylinder for 5 min before spraying with sucrose solution and returning to the container. The behavior of the mouse was recorded for 5 min and later scored manually by blinded observers. The videos were scored for total grooming time. The scores of the observers are averaged to give final values.

The elevated plus maze (EPM) was performed using a black, plexiglass elevated plus maze (apparatus with two open and two enclosed arms, 33 × 6 cm, with a wall of 25 cm on the closed arm, elevated 60 cm from the floor; Med Associates, St. Albans, VT). Lighting for the maze was set at 200 lux in the center of the plus maze, 270 lux on the open arms, and 120 lux on the closed arms. Background white noise (approximately 70 dB) was used during trials. Mice were placed in the center of the elevated plus maze and left to explore for 5 min in a dim light condition. Mice were recorded using Ethovision XT, and the time spent in the open and closed arms, as well as the number of entries from the closed to the open arm, were calculated.

The tails of the mice were wrapped with tape that covered approximately 4/5 of the tail length and then fixed upside down on a hook. The immobility time of each mouse was recorded and tracked over a 6 min period using Ethovision XT. Automated tracking values were validated via manual scoring by a blind observer.

The Porsolt Forced Swim Test (FST) was conducted using a vertical clear glass cylinder (10 cm in diameter, 25 cm in height) filled with water (25 °C). The mice spent 6 min in the water, and immobility was scored. A mouse was regarded as immobile when floating motionless or making only those movements necessary to keep its head above the water. Automated tracking values were validated via manual scoring by a blind observer.

The behavioral paradigm used to calculate the emotionality score were performed in the following order: MB, ST, EPM, TST and FST. To obtain a comprehensive measure for emotionality, we used z-scoring methodology to integrate standard measures of anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors, as previously described68. The testing parameters analyzed were as follows: marble burying (number of marbles buried), elevated plus maze (time spent on open arm, number of entries into the open arm), tail suspension test (immobility) and forced swim test (immobility). For each parameter, the z-score for every individual animal was calculated using the previously described approach20. Briefly, for each parameter, the z-score of each individual animal was calculated using the formula \({{{\rm{{Z}}}}}=\frac{X-\mu }{\sigma }\), where X represents the individual data point, m represents the mean of the control group, and s represents the standard deviation of the control group. The emotionality score (ES) for each individual subject was first averaged within test, and then across each test to ensure equal weighting of all tests. \({ES}=\frac{{Z}_{{MB}}+{Z}_{{EPM}}+{Z}_{{TST}}+{Z}_{{FST}}}{{number\; of\; tests}}\). The mean emotionality score for each group is an average of the individual scores within each group for each experiment.

Novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) was measured in 24-h food-deprived mice, isolated in a standard housing cage for 30 min before individual testing. Three pellets of ordinary lab chow were placed on a white tissue in the center of each arena, lit at 80 lux. Each mouse was placed in a corner of an arena and allowed to explore for a maximum of 15 min. Latency to feed was measured as the time necessary to bite a food pellet. Immediately after an eating event, the mouse was transferred back to the home cage (free from cage-mates) and allowed to feed on lab chow for 5 min. Food consumption in the home cage was measured.

The experiments were conducted in 4 equal square arenas (50 × 50 cm) separated by 35 cm-high opaque gray Plexiglas walls. The light intensity of the room was set at 15 lux to facilitate exploration and minimize anxiety levels. The floor was a white Plexiglas platform (View Point, Lyon, France), spread with sawdust. The room was equipped with an overhead video camera connected to a computerized interface, allowing visualization and recording of behavioral sessions on a computer screen in the adjacent room. The experimental paradigm lasted for 2 days (3, 4). On day 1, the animals were placed in an arena for a 15 min-habituation session with two copies of an unfamiliar object (T-shaped plastic tubing, 1.5 × 3.5 cm). These objects were not used later for the recognition test. On day 2, the recognition test was performed, consisting of 3 trials of 10 min separated by 2 intertrial intervals of 5 min, during which the animals were returned to their home cage. On the first trial, or familiarization phase, the mice were presented with two copies of an unfamiliar object. On the second trial, or place phase, one of the two copies was displaced to a novel location in the arena. On the third trial, or object phase, the copy that had not been moved on the previous trial was replaced by a novel object. Stimuli objects used in all previous experiments were Lego bricks, plastic rings, dice or marbles (size 1.5–3 × 2–3 cm). The identity of the objects, as well as the spatial location in which these objects were positioned, was balanced between subjects. The number of visits and the time spent exploring each object were scored manually on video recordings. A visit was acknowledged when the nose of the mouse came in direct contact with an object. A percentage of discrimination was calculated for the number of visits and time exploring the objects as following: exploration of displaced or novel objects / total exploration. The discrimination ratio during the familiarization phase was arbitrarily calculated for the object located in the right upper corner of the arena.

Locomotor activity was monitored at 15 lux either in open fields placed over a white Plexiglas infrared-lit platform. Locomotor activity was recorded via an automated tracking system (Ethovision, Noldus, Wageningen, Netherlands).

The apparatus (UgoBasile, Germonio, Italy) was set to accelerate from 4 to 40 rpm in 5 min. On day 1, mice were habituated to rotation on the rod at 4 rpm, until they were able to stay more than 180 s. On day 2, mice were tested for three daily trials (60 s intertrial). Each trial started by placing the mouse on the rod and beginning rotation at a constant 4 rpm-speed for 60 s. Then the accelerating program was launched, and the trial ended for a particular mouse when falling off the rod. Time stayed on the rod was automatically recorded.

Mice were euthanized by rapid decapitation 24 h after treatment with Nb20 or vehicle/PBS (48 h after last stressor). Trunk blood was collected in Eppendorf tubes and allowed to clot for 30 min. Serum was isolated after 2000 g centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. Corticosterone levels were measured using a commercially available ELIZA kit (ThermoFisher #EIACORT) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Amino acid sequence of nanobodies was analyzed using NetMHCIIpan version 4.0 to predict binding affinities to MHC class II molecules69. The sequence was submitted in FASTA format to the online tool, and binding predictions were generated for a comprehensive panel of MHC class II alleles. Binding strength was categorized based on percentile ranks, with published thresholds identifying strong, weak, and non-binders.

The functional data shown represent the average ± SEM of at least 3 individual experiments each performed in triplicate and expressed as means ± standard error means (s.e.m). For the GAP assay, cells with the same transfection conditions were compared in their treatment and a two-way ANOVA test was performed. The non-linear regression curve was used to fit the dose-response curve, giving the IC50 value. For the flow cytometry binding assays, cells transfected with an empty vector were used as a control, and the non-linear regression curve was used to fit the dose response curve, giving the EC50 value. For the SPR, calculation of association (kon) and dissociation (koff) rate constants was based on a 1:1 Langmuir binding model. For the mouse experiments, Marble Burying, Splash Test, Tail Suspension, Elevated Plus Maze and Force Swim Test, comparisons were by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett or Kruskal-Wallis post hoc tests. Assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance were studied using Shapiro–Wilk tests and Levene's tests, respectively. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. Mean values with s.e.m. are shown. For the ELIZA, a one-way ANOVA test was performed to compare the control treatment with the treated condition. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. Mean values with s.e.m. are shown. For the electrophysiology experiments, changes was assessed in a nonparametric t-test; the Wilcoxon test. Values of *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 and ***P < 0.001 ***P < 0.0001 were considered to be statistically significant. Calculations, graphs and statistics were generated using GraphPad Prism 9 software (San Diego, CA, USA).

Pseudomonadota (formerly Proteobacteria) are prevalent in the commensal human gut microbiota, but also include many pathogens that rely on secretion systems to support pathogenicity by injecting proteins into host cells. Here we show that 80% of Pseudomonadota from healthy gut microbiomes also have intact type III secretion systems (T3SS). Candidate effectors predicted by machine learning display sequence and structural features that are distinct from those of pathogen effectors. Towards a systems-level functional understanding, we experimentally constructed a protein–protein meta-interactome map between human proteins and commensal effectors. Network analyses uncovered that effector-targeted neighbourhoods are enriched for genetic variation linked to microbiome-associated conditions, including autoimmune and metabolic diseases. Metagenomic analysis revealed effector enrichment in Crohn's disease but depletion in ulcerative colitis. Functionally, commensal effectors can translocate into human cells and modulate NF-κB signalling and cytokine secretion in vitro. Our findings indicate that T3SS contribute to microorganism–host cohabitation and that effector–host protein interactions may represent an underappreciated route by which commensal gut microbiota influences health.

Host-associated microbiota influences human health in complex, genotype-dependent ways. Especially the human gut microbiome, which is dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Pseudomonadota1 (formerly Proteobacteria2), can alter the risk of diverse conditions, including metabolic disorders, and autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases3. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Most studies have focused on metabolites, extracellular microorganism-associated molecular patterns, or community-level microbiome properties4. However, the role of intracellular bacteria–host protein interactions is largely unexplored. The potential impact of such interkingdom protein interactions is illustrated by viral proteins in asymptomatic or non-acute infections, which can influence cellular signalling and cell physiology and thereby contribute to complex diseases in a likely host-genetics dependent manner5,6,7,8.

In bacteria, the type III secretion system (T3SS) is a well-characterized apparatus for delivering proteins into eukaryotic cells. The T3SS is a highly conserved ‘needle and syringe'-like machinery found in Pseusomonadota to inject bacterial proteins into host cells9. T3SS and their substrate effectors have been studied almost exclusively in human and plant pathogens such as Yersinia, Pseudomonas or Salmonella, for which protein translocation is a key pathogenic strategy. In the host, translocated effectors manipulate cellular processes including cytoskeletal dynamics or immune signalling to ensure bacterial survival and promote transmission9. Thus, the T3SS has traditionally been framed as a virulence determinant.

Insights from plant and insect systems challenge this pathogen-centric view of the T3SS. Many commensal and beneficial microorganisms for these hosts deploy T3SS or analogous machinery to translocate proteins that promote symbiosis or fine-tune host immunity10,11,12. Effector–host protein–protein interaction maps in plants further reveal that both pathogenic and mutualistic microorganisms converge on central host signalling nodes, suggesting conserved principles by which injected proteins can modulate eukaryotic biology across diverse symbioses12,13,14.

Despite the emerging broader conceptual importance of protein injection and cross-kingdom protein interactions in diverse microorganism–host systems, it is unknown whether analogous mechanisms operate in the healthy human gut. Here we investigate the distribution, diversity and host interactions of T3SS and their effectors in commensal Pseudomonadota from human guts. By integrating comparative genomics, structural prediction, functional assays and host protein interaction networks, we uncover an underappreciated layer of direct, protein-mediated communication between commensal microorganisms and the human host, with implications for immune modulation, microbial competition and complex disease biology.

We first analysed reference genomes of Pseudomonadota strains from healthy gut and stool samples isolated, for example, by the human microbiome project15. Using EffectiveDB16, a widely used tool for secretion system identification, we detected complete T3SS in 44 of the 77 genomes (Supplementary Data 1). To expand the scope, we analysed genomes of 4,752 phylogenetically diverse strains of the human intestinal bacteria collection (HiBC)17, Broad Institute–OpenBiome Microbiome Library (BIO–ML)18 and Global Microbiome Conservancy (GMC)19. Of the 568 Pseudomonadota genomes, 449 (79%) have complete T3SS (Extended Data Fig. 1); similar proportions have T4SS (315) and T6SS (474), which may also inject effectors into host cells among other functions20 (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 2). Together, 527 of the 568 Pseudomonatoda genomes (92%) have at least one host-directed secretion system. Because culturing can bias taxon representations, we also screened 16,179 high- and intermediate-quality Pseudomonadota metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs)21,22,23, finding complete T3SS in 770 (5%) MAGs (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 3). Notably, T3SS were only detected in Gammaproteobacteria, but not in Beta- or Epsilon-proteobacteria (except in Helicobacter strains), and were especially common among Escherichia (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Data 3). Among the T3SS-positive (T3SS+) species, 24 matched representatives in two cohorts of the Weizmann Institute of Science24: 59.4% of individuals in the Israeli and 47.1% in the Dutch cohort harboured potentially T3SS+ species in their gut microbiome at 0.80% and 0.48% relative abundance, respectively, with Escherichia coli being the most common. These observations indicate that T3SS+ strains are common members of the human gut microbiota and motivated our further investigation.

Source data

Using three complementary machine-learning models25,26,27, 3,002 effector candidates were confidently predicted in the T3SS+ reference genomes (hereafter: strain effectors) (Supplementary Data 4) and 182 in the 770 T3SS+ MAGs (meta-effectors) (Supplementary Data 4). Because T3SS effectors are classically associated with pathogenicity, we compared these candidate effectors to 1,195 T3SS effectors of known pathogens28. Only 17 out of 3,002 (0.5%) strain effectors and 6 out of 182 (3%) meta-effectors showed high sequence similarity to those of pathogens (≥90% across ≥90% length) (Supplementary Data 5). To find weak similarities, we performed iterative jackhmmer29 searches against ~124 M non-redundant bacterial sequences from UniRef90. Yet, even with this sensitive approach, significant similarity to pathogen effectors was found only for 155 commensal strain effectors (~5%) and 42 meta-effectors (22.5%) (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1).

As effectors can be structurally related despite sequence divergence, we clustered AlphaFold30-predicted tertiary structures using FoldSeek31 for a structural comparison. Surprisingly, homogeneous clusters with effectors from only commensal strains or pathogens were highly overrepresented, whereas mixed clusters II and III, reflecting common structures of effectors from pathogens and commensal strains, were depleted (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Data 6; P << 0,0001, empirical P values). Meta-effectors clustered exclusively with strain effectors, albeit close to random expectation. All results were robust over varying FoldSeek parameters and when considering only vertebrate or human pathogens (Supplementary Data 6). Thus, candidate effectors in T3SS+ strains from healthy human guts markedly differ from pathogen effectors in both sequence and structure.

We analysed all candidate effectors from the strains for annotated domains. Besides 860 proteins without any identifiable domain, among the most common finds were the diguanylate cyclase, GGDEF domain (PF00990) (58 effectors), and EAL domain (PF00563) (50 effectors), none of which was found in pathogen effectors (Supplementary Data 5). Cyclic diguanylate is a known second messenger in bacterial signal transduction, and the EAL domain is thought to be a diguanylate phosphodiesterase, thus opposing the effect of the cyclase32. Furthermore, we observed a PAS-fold domain (PF08447) in 32 effectors, which can function as a ligand-binding sensor32 and in some effectors co-occurs with a guanylate cyclase domain. As cyclic dinucleotides recently emerged as important immune regulators in all kingdoms of life33, the observation that two domains acting on the same second messenger occur at high frequency among the commensal effector candidates makes a role for this signalling molecule in interkingdom communication plausible.

A key question is whether commensal candidate effectors get injected into human cells by T3SS. To enable functional studies, we cloned open reading frames (ORFs) encoding effectors from 18 bacterial strains (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Data 7 and 8). The generated human microbiome effector ORFeome v1 (HuMEOme_v1) contains 910 sequence-verified, full-length ORFs representing 746 strain effectors and 164 meta-effectors (Supplementary Data 7). Cloning failure mainly resulted from failed PCR amplification without indications of toxicity. Using Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica sv. Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) as a model, we established a nano-luciferase-based injection assay34 fusing an 11-amino acid Nano-Luc HiBiT tag to the C terminus of candidate effectors expressed in bacteria. HeLa cells stably expressed the complementary LgBiT fragment, so that effector injection reconstitutes functional nano-luciferase. Specificity was ensured by inclusion of the T3SS-defective ΔsctV mutant for all tests. Benchmarking with six pathogen effectors demonstrated effective translocation of four. Among 97 tested candidate effectors from 11 strains, 32 were specifically and significantly injected (Fig. 1e, Extended Data Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Data 10). The slightly higher success rate for the positive controls probably reflects phylogenetic diversity and missing chaperones and cofactors. Thus, although some false effector identifications cannot be excluded, overall, our pipeline reliably identified bona fide T3SS substrate effectors from commensal strains in healthy human guts.

Next, we assessed the functionality of T3SS in the commensals. Of the 11 strains with at least one T3SS-injectable effector, 6 could not be tested due to antibiotic resistance or transformation failure. Whereas the two E. coli strains yielded no signals, Citrobacter pasteurii and Phytobacter massiliensis showed occasional signals suggesting sporadic activation of the T3SS. By contrast, Edwardsiella tarda reproducibly and significantly injected three out of four tested effectors into HeLa cells (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Data 10). Notably, only one, Eta_3, was also positive in the Salmonella system, supporting the notion that missing cofactors may have caused false negatives in the first experiment. Overall, these data demonstrate that functional T3SS are present in strains from healthy human guts and can deliver identified effectors into human cells.

Next, we explored possible functions of the commensal effectors by systematically mapping their physical interactions with host proteins using our multi-assay mapping pipeline35 (Extended Data Fig. 2). Screening all cloned effectors against the full human ORFeome9.136 identified 1,067 interactions constituting the human-microbiome meta-interactome (HuMMI) main dataset (HuMMIMAIN) (Fig. 2a). Three repeat screens with 290 effectors and 1,440 human proteins yielded 39 interactions (HuMMIRPT) and indicated a sampling sensitivity of ~32% for the main screen (Fig. 2b), matching previous studies37. Lastly, we addressed how sequence similarity affects effector interaction profiles. We grouped effectors with ≥30% sequence identity (Supplementary Data 11) and experimentally tested them against the union of their interactors from the main screen. The resulting HuMMIHOM dataset contains 394 interactions, of which 181 are non-redundant. Altogether, HuMMI contains 1,255 unique verified interactions between 286 effectors and 426 human proteins (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Data 11).

Source data

To experimentally assess data quality, we assembled a positive control set of 67 well-documented binary interactions of pathogen effectors with human proteins (bacterial human literature binary multiple (bhLit_BM-v1)) and a negative control set of random effector–human protein pairs (bacterial host random reference set (bhRRS-v1)) (Supplementary Data 12). Benchmarking our yeast-two-hybrid (Y2H) assay with these, alongside established human reference sets (hsPRS-v2 and hsRRS-v2)38, indicated an assay sensitivity of 13% and 17.5%, respectively, matching previous observations35,37,38 (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Data 13). No negative control scored positive, demonstrating the reliability of our system. Next, we assessed the biophysical quality of HuMMI using the yeast nanoluciferase-two-hybrid assay (yN2H)38 benchmarked against the four reference sets. Across thresholds, sets with bacterial proteins yielded fewer positive-scoring pairs than the human sets (Extended Data Fig. 2). As this included the negative controls and no effector toxicity was observed, prokaryotic proteins appear harder to test in this assay system, reinforcing the need for tailored reference sets. The 172 randomly selected HuMMI interactions were statistically indistinguishable from the positive control sets (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Data 14). Thus, the biophysical quality of HuMMI is on par with well-documented literature interactions.

We aimed to demonstrate that interactions can occur within the human cell environment. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments in HEK293 cells (RRID: CVCL_0045, DSMZ) using Flag-tagged effectors and negative control Flag–GFP as baits and detecting the MYC-tagged human interaction partner by western blot. Of 32 pairs including 4 positive controls, 18 pairs and 3 controls yielded meaningful data, while 10 could not be evaluated due to unspecific binding of the human protein (3) or poor expression (7). Only one of the control pairs was positive, whereas 13 of the 18 candidate pairs yielded detectable bands specifically in the effector immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 2). Together, these results demonstrate that HuMMI contains biophysically reliable interactions that are robustly detectable in different assays and occur in human cellular environments. Importantly, functional effects may go in both directions and while in most cases effectors probably perturb the host cell, intracellular immune receptors may also recognize effectors to then initiate defence responses.

We started the functional exploration by analysing the topology of the microorganism–host interaction network (Fig. 2f,g). The degree distribution of HuMMIMAIN shows that numerous human proteins interact with multiple effectors, often from different species (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Data 11). Random sampling demonstrates highly significant effector convergence on few host interactors (Fig. 2h), a phenomenon linked to the functional importance of the targeted host proteins as shown in plant–pathogen systems13. Moreover, interactions of human proteins with effectors from four bacterial strains are highly significant and unlikely to result from random processes (Fig. 2i and Supplementary Data 11). Thus, 60 human proteins are subject to effector convergence, highlighting their potential importance for microbiome–host interactions. To explore overlap with pathogen effectors, we extracted 265 high-quality binary interactions between 217 human proteins and 80 effectors from 17 pathogenic strains from IntAct39 (Supplementary Data 15). We found a numerically low, albeit significant, number of 12 human proteins targeted by both groups (P = 0.014, Fisher's exact test, odds ratio = 2.26), of which 3 are subject to convergence by commensal effectors (P = 0.067, Fisher's exact test, odds ratio = 3.37, Supplementary Data 11). Although limited by sample size, experimental differences and the non-systematic nature of the pathogen data, these findings support both overlap and lifestyle-dependent specificity in commensal and pathogenic effector targeting40.

Many inference approaches assume that sequence similarity implies functional and interaction similarity, and such similarity could also underlie convergence. However, in the homology clusters of the systematically tested HuMMIHOM (Fig. 3a), we found that sequence and interaction similarity are only poorly correlated; instead, sequence similarity merely defines an upper limit for interaction similarity. For instance, cluster 3 contains 7 effectors sharing >90% sequence similarity, yet their interaction profile similarities range from identical to complementary (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Data 16). Conversely, clustering effectors unrelated in sequence and structure by their pairwise interaction similarity in HuMMIMAIN identified substantial overlap outside homology clusters (Extended Data Fig. 3), suggesting that dissimilar effectors can have similar functions in the host. Thus, host effector function as measured by protein-interaction profiles is largely independent of overall sequence similarity.

Source data

To gain structural insights and potential functional leads, we modelled effector–host protein interactions using AlphaFold-Multimer, obtaining predictions for 123 pairs (10%). For proteins with multiple interactors, we classified interfaces as ‘same' (≥60% shared contacting residues), ‘different' (<10% overlap) or ‘overlapping' (Fig. 3d,e and Extended Data Fig. 3). For instance, Mmo_5 binds to TPD52L1 and BORCS6 via the same interface, whereas Pfa_4 interacts with NOTO and LBX1 with different interfaces, possibly enabling simultaneous interactions with both (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Data 17).

Analogously, Pse_2 and Pfa_9 bind to the same interface of TCF4, whereas Yen_2 targets a different part of the protein (Fig. 3e). Identical interface binding was more frequent on human proteins than on effectors, suggesting the importance of targeting functions linked to specific domains. Mapping the binding interfaces to domain annotations strengthened this hypothesis, as even effectors binding via different interfaces may target the same domain (for example, the DNA-binding domain of LBX1). More commonly, however, effectors with different interfaces bind to distinguishable parts of the host protein. Efe_11 and Kpn_9 bind the same interface in the TRAF2 E3 ubiquitin ligase domain, whereas Pem_8 targets the C-terminal MATH domain of TRAF2, which mediates trimerization and receptor binding. Similarly, on REL, Pma_4 binds the DNA-binding and Yen_11 the dimerization domain.

Beyond large interfaces, many interactions are mediated by short linear motifs (SLiMs) in intrinsically disordered regions that bind to specific protein pocket-forming domains41. As AlphaFold often misses such interactions42, we used the orthogonal mimicINT approach to identify SLiM–domain interactions, which matches interaction pairs to known SLiM–domain templates43 (Fig. 3f). This identified putative interfaces for 54 HuMMIMAIN interactions involving bacterial host-like SLiMs binding to human domains (Supplementary Data 18), of which 51 passed at least one (Fig. 3f, P = 0.0137, exp. P value) and 22 passed two stringency criteria (Extended Data Fig. 3, P = 0.0005, exp. P value). Some of the matched motifs encompass phosphorylation sites that interact with kinases or phosphorylation-dependent binding domains such as SH2 domains. Conversely, although several commensal effectors encode predicted enzymatic domains (Supplementary Data 5), using an analogous approach we found no case in which these engage cognate substrate motifs on host proteins, and only a single effector-domain–SLiM match consistent with known docking specificity: the calcineurin-like phosphoesterase domain (PF00149) of Efe_1 and the canonical LxVP docking motif in VAC14. The largest group of 23 interactions involved PDZ domains in human proteins binding PDZ-binding motifs (PBM) in the C terminus of the bacterial interaction partners. PDZ domain-containing proteins commonly mediate functions important for microorganism–host interactions including cell–cell adhesion, protein trafficking and immune signalling44. To experimentally validate these interfaces, individual and tandem PDZ domains from 13 human proteins and C-terminal peptides from 16 interacting bacterial effectors were tested via the quantitative in vitro interaction holdup assay 45. Of 23 Y2H pairs, 16 (70%) showed at least one PDZ–peptide interaction, thus validating the mode of interaction (Fig. 3g and Supplementary Data 19). In three instances, two PDZ domains arranged in tandem were required for the interaction, suggesting that some Y2H pairs might have been missed by the holdup method due to untested combinations. As for the predicted globular interfaces, for human proteins with multiple PDZ domains, different effectors often target different domains, demonstrating specificity and functional specialization (Fig. 3g). Thus, while overall effector sequence similarity does not correlate with interaction profiles, structural modelling showed that some effectors target similar interfaces and domains, suggesting shared functions, whereas others bind distinct domains pointing to functional specialization.

We explored effector target functions using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Data 20). Among the most enriched functions was ‘response to muramyl dipeptide (MDP)', a bacterial cell wall-derived peptide. Intriguingly, the MDP receptor, NOD2, is a major susceptibility gene for Crohn's disease46, a gut autoimmune disease with a strong aetiological microbiome contribution46. Central immune signalling pathways are also enriched, namely, the NF-κB and the stress-activated protein kinase and Jun-N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathways. Remarkably, five significantly targeted convergence proteins belong to the NF-κB module (Extended Data Fig. 3), one of the evolutionarily oldest immune pathways in animals47. Using the Recon3D human genome-scale metabolic model48, we further found significant enrichment for metabolic enzymes among the human interactors (P = 0.0001, Fisher's exact test); however, beyond glycerophospholipid metabolism, no metabolic subsystem stood out (Supplementary Data 20). Finally, we compared commensal-targeted functions to those of pathogens (Supplementary Data 20). Some pathways were common to targets of both groups, such as ‘NF-κB signalling', whereas others are specific to commensals including ‘collagen biosynthesis' and ‘response to muramyl dipeptide'. These findings reinforce the notion of lifestyle-dependent specificity and functional overlap in the molecular interactions of commensals and pathogens with the human host.

Terms (#) show the number of represented terms. The lowest and highest odds ratios observed for the represented group are indicated by light shaded areas of bars. Black line indicates odds ratios for shown representative terms. White triangles indicate functions also enriched in pathogen targets. b, Genetic predisposition for traits and diseases enriched among human genes encoding effector-interacting proteins in HuRI (α = 0.05, Fisher's exact test; n = 349). The odds ratio in a and b estimates the effect size of significant function/trait (two-sided Fisher's exact test FDR < 0.05) and is calculated as the odds of function-annotated/trait-associated human genes encoding effector targets to function-unannotated/trait-unassociated human genes encoding effector targets in the target set, divided by the same ratio in the HuRI set (see Methods). c, Disease groups for which genetic predisposition proteins are enriched in network neighbourhoods of effectors of the indicated strains. Trait node size corresponds to number of significantly targeted traits in that group as indicated in the legend. Thickness of strain–group edges reflects the number of underlying significant effector–trait links (α < 0.01 and odds ratio > 3, two-sided Fisher's exact test). d, Specific diseases underlying the ‘immunological' group in c. Node size reflects the number of underlying effector–trait associations as indicated in the legend. Precise P values and n for all tests are provided in Supplementary Data 23.

We wondered whether perturbations by commensal effectors could influence non-infectious human diseases, starting our analysis at the network level. Genetic variants, but also viruses, contribute to complex diseases by often subtly altering intracellular networks and disease-relevant functions. We first explored whether commensal effectors target proteins that are genetically relevant for diseases and other traits. We used ‘causal genes' identified from genome-wide-association studies (GWAS) by the Open Targets initiative49 to identify the encoded ‘disease proteins', and unified traits by the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO)50 (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Data 21). The strong enrichment for ‘immunoglobulin isotype switching' is intriguing as the evolutionarily older IgA antibodies have important roles in shaping the gut microbiome51. Effector targets are also associated with cancers and immune diseases, such as psoriasis, asthma, allergies and systemic lupus erythematosus, although none of these predominantly affect the gut. Given the abundance of immune-related measurement traits, it is possible that the effectors systemically perturb immune signalling and thereby contribute to lung and skin diseases. Alternatively, convergence proteins such as REL or TCF4 (Fig. 2f,h) may also be targeted by local microbiota in skin or lung tissues. Supporting this, 26% of HuMMI effectors are detectable in skin microbiome samples, suggesting that commensal effectors are shared across ecological niches (Supplementary Data 22).

In addition to disease proteins being direct targets, we previously discovered that relevant genetic variation often resides in their protein interaction neighbourhood13,35. To explore these, we performed short random walks in the binary human reference interactome (HuRI)36 and defined ‘neighbourhood' as proteins visited significantly more often in HuRI than in degree-preserved randomly rewired control networks. In these neighbourhoods, we assessed disease-protein enrichment using Open Targets, aggregated nominally significant associations at the strain level, and summarized them by disease group (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Data 23). Most disease groups we found are known to be affected by the gut microbiome3. Among immune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was enriched (nominal P = 0.0008, Fisher's exact test), particularly Crohn's disease(nominal P = 8.5 × 10−5, Fisher's exact test) but not ulcerative colitis (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Data 23). As for direct targets, neighbourhoods also harboured susceptibility for skin and lung diseases such as asthma and psoriasis. Considering the microbiota's relevance for metabolic disorders, effector targeting of neighbourhoods affecting high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL, respectively) cholesterol levels (nominal P = 0.006 and P = 0.008, respectively, Fisher's exact test) and several diabetes-related traits is notable (Supplementary Data 23). Together, these findings suggest that commensal effectors modulate host immune signalling and the local metabolic and structural microenvironment. As the targeted proteins and neighbourhoods are genetically associated with several diseases, modulation of their functions by effectors may contribute to disease aetiology.

We sought to experimentally verify that commensal effectors perturb some of the identified pathways and functions. We focused on NF-κB signalling, which is central to many diseases and emerged repeatedly in our study. Using a dual-luciferase assay35 in HEK293 cells (RRID: CVCL_0045, DSMZ), 5 out of 26 commensal effectors significantly activated NF-κB activity in the absence of stimulation (Fig. 5a,b and Supplementary Data 24), while 3 effectors reduced NF-κB activity under strong TNF stimulation (Fig. 5b, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 24). Next, we assessed whether the effectors modulate NF-κB signalling in unstimulated Caco-2 cells and after pro-inflammatory stimulation (Extended Data Fig. 4). Consistently, Cpa_12, an ABC domain-containing effector, reduced secretion of several cytokines with and without stimulation (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Data 25). Other effectors enhanced cytokine responses, particularly IL-6 and IL-8, only after Pam3CSK4 stimulation, but not after TNF or flagellin stimulation (Fig. 5d, Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 25). Pam3CSK4 mimics TLR1/2 activation by triacylated lipopeptides abundant in Gram-positive Bacteroidetes, while flagellin mimics TLR5 activation by Gram-negative Pseudomonadota52. Thus, commensal effectors exert complex effects on intracellular immune signalling.

Fold changes were calculated using pseudo-counts from healthy controls (Supplementary Data 26).

Given the genetic and functional links between commensal effectors and IBD, we wondered whether clinical data support a potential role of effectors in the disease. Hypothesizing that causal involvement in IBD aetiology may be reflected in altered effector prevalence, we analysed a metagenome study with over 800 individuals with IBD (504 Crohn's disease, 302 ulcerative colitis) and 334 healthy controls53. Focusing on effectors with physical interactions in HuMMI, 64 effectors were significantly more prevalent in individuals with Crohn's disease compared with healthy controls, whereas effectors were less common in individuals with ulcerative colitis (Fig. 5e,f and Supplementary Data 26). These opposing trends were unexpected as Pseudomonadota abundance reportedly increases in both IBDs46,54. Some hypotheses for mechanisms underlying this observation emerged from HuMMI: effectors from K. pneumonia, E. coli and E. fergusonii, all highly prevalent in Crohn's disease, interact with the Crohn's disease susceptibility protein COG6, which directly interacts with the ulcerative colitis susceptibility gene RTP5 (Fig. 5g). Similarly, Efe_13 of E. fergusonii binds the Crohn's disease susceptibility protein TNIP1, which functions in NF-κB signalling and interacts with two genes associated with ulcerative colitis. Other enriched effectors show indirect links to Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis proteins via shared interaction partners (Fig. 5g). While the mechanistic relevance of these interactions requires future studies, these direct and indirect connections to IBD disease proteins invite speculation that they may cause a homeostatic shift that increase the risk for Crohn's disease while decreasing the same for ulcerative colitis.

T3SS are traditionally viewed as hallmarks of pathogenicity, yet in plants and insects they mediate a wider range of functions including beneficial interactions55. Our findings extend this observation to the human gut, revealing that T3SS are unexpectedly common among commensal Pseudomonadota. In particular, E. coli, which resides close to the intestinal epithelium56, frequently encodes complete systems. Although not detected in commensal beta- or delta-Pseudomonadota, divergent systems may have escaped current detection tools, thus underestimating their true distribution. Functional assays validated our predictions and revealed regulatory complexity: C. pasteurii and P. massiliensis showed inconsistent T3SS activation, whereas E. tarda reliably injected effectors into human cells. Using S. Typhimurium as a heterologous host that robustly initiates the T3SS, we confirmed translocation of 32 effectors from 11 species, indicating that many commensals harbour host-directed secretion capability. The regulatory diversity of T3SS activation is consistent with the idea that, in contrast to pathogens such as S. Typhimurium, commensals may require highly specific host or environmental cues to activate secretion. Whether human epithelial or immune cells, akin to plant hosts57, can actively signal to commensals to induce T3SS, or whether secretion primarily reflects stress responses of potential pathobionts, remains an important area for future investigation.

Interpreting T3SS functionality in the human gut requires moving beyond species-level labels such as ‘commensal' or ‘pathogenic', which often obscure substantial within-species diversity. As observed in other host kingdoms58, these categories are fluid: E. coli includes both highly pathogenic lineages (for example, EPEC or EHEC) and harmless or beneficial ones, such as the probiotic E. coli Nissle 191759. In our analyses, strains isolated from apparently healthy individuals were considered commensals, whereas strains encoding known virulence effectors28, including P. aeruginosa and Salmonella spp., were designated pathogens. Importantly, between these poles lie opportunistic pathogens whose infectious potential emerges only in specific environmental or host-related conditions. A key question is therefore whether commensal T3SS primarily support opportunistic pathogenicity, or whether they have adaptive functions in the non-pathogenic lifestyle. Multiple lines of evidence from our study support the latter.

Comparative sequence, structure and host-target analyses revealed that commensal and pathogen effector repertoires are largely distinct, supporting a model in which commensal T3SS are adapted for cooperative rather than pathogenic interactions. Homotypic clustering of effector structures and depletion of mixed commensal–pathogen clusters suggest that commensal effectors follow separate selective trajectories. The domain analysis supports this, revealing many domains found only in commensal effectors possibly to support a non-pathogenic lifestyle. Notably, numerous effectors involved in cyclic diguanylate synthesis or degradation were identified, often paired with PAS sensor domains suggesting environmentally responsive functions. Intriguingly, several effectors from Gram-negative commensal Pseudomonadota potentiated Pam3CSK4-induced TLR1/2 signalling, suggesting that T3SS may modulate host responses to Gram-positive Bacteroidetes and thereby influence interphyla competition within the gut ecosystem.

Despite substantial divergence in effector structures, commensal and pathogen effectors exhibited both shared and unique host interactions within the meta-interactome. Although these comparisons are limited by the availability of hypothesis-driven interaction datasets for pathogen effectors, the observed patterns parallel findings in plant systems, where effectors from mutualists and pathogens converge on some common host targets while also interacting with proteins critical for distinct outcomes40. Across systems, convergence on a subset of host proteins emerges as a signature with biological importance13,40. These convergence proteins therefore emerge as key nodes in host–microorganism interactions and understanding their role in commensal versus pathogenic contexts is a promising entry point for understanding how pathogenicity emerges and how balanced immune responses are ensured.

The interaction–structure models provide leads for dissecting effector mechanisms. Targeted host protein domains can indicate which processes an effector may perturb and, when mediated by a corresponding motif, whether the effector may get post-translationally modified, as seen for H. pylori CagA60. Conversely, post-translational modification of host proteins is a common mechanism of pathogenicity61. A manual analysis matching the mimicINT workflow, however, revealed no clear cases in which these engage cognate host substrate motifs and only a single example consistent with known docking specificity. Whether this reflects differences between commensal and pathogen effectors, or the prevalence of functional mimicry without sequence similarity61, or merely limitations of our approach, remain to be clarified. Post-translational modification of effectors by host enzymes may either enhance effector function or act in host defence, such as by targeting foreign proteins for degradation. The latter would, however, be expected to select against motif retention. Thus, while biochemical directionality from host domain to effector SLiM is plausible, the available evidence suggests that such modifications predominantly support the lifestyle of the injecting bacterium. When commensals act as pathobionts and contribute to non-communicable diseases, such interactions may become intervention targets.

Analysis of host pathways targeted by commensal effectors indeed revealed enrichment for proteins and genetic variation implicated in immune disorders, cancers and metabolic traits. Notably, commensal effectors target network neighbourhoods associated with Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis, and physically and functionally interact with key members of the TNF–NF-κB signalling axis. Consistent with these molecular data, T3SS effectors were enriched in the microbiomes of individuals with Crohn's disease while being depleted in ulcerative colitis. This pattern mirrors the differential clinical response to anti-TNF therapy, which is highly effective in Crohn's disease but not in ulcerative colitis. Understanding whether and how commensal effectors directly contribute to Crohn's disease risk or flares, and whether they may even confer protection in ulcerative colitis, are compelling questions for future mechanistic studies with potential therapeutic implications.

Together, our data position host-directed secretion as an underappreciated mode of communication between the human microbiota and its host. By integrating genomic, structural, functional and systems-level analyses, we provide an initial map of the commensal T3SS meta-interactome and establish a framework for exploring its roles across microbial niches, host genotypes and disease states. These findings broaden the conceptual boundaries of T3SS biology and highlight the need to examine secretion systems not only as virulence factors but also as potential modulators of mutualism, competition and host physiology within the human gut.

Reference genomes for Pseudomonadota strains isolated by the human microbiome project from human guts and available from DSMZ (via BacDive), ATCC (atcc.org) or BEI (beiresources.org) were identified and cross-referenced with GenBank (release 229), yielding 77 matches, and subjected to T3SS identification, along with 92,143 and 9,367 MAGs, respectively, from two different meta-studies21,22 that were at least 50% complete and less than 5% contaminated. Prediction performance of EffectiveDB16 was evaluated by fivefold cross-validation with five repeats using simulated MAGs of 0–100% completeness and 0–50% contamination (in 5% steps) by random sampling genes from the test set. A performance-improved re-implementation of the EffectiveDB classifier (https://github.com/univieCUBE/phenotrex, trained on EggNOG 4.0 annotations62) was used with a positive prediction threshold of >0.7.

For 770 T3SS+, MAGs protein coding sequences for 474,871 representative proteins were identified using prodigal (v.2.6.3)63 and CD-HIT (v.4.8.1, parameters: ‘-c 1.0')64. A total of 61,115 proteins were encoded by 44 T3SS+ culture collection genomes. Three machine-learning tools (EffectiveT3 v.2.0.1, DeepT3 v.2.025 and pEffect27) were used to predict T3SS signal or effector homology. Predictions were integrated using a 0–2 scoring scheme: 2 for perfect score (pEffect >90, EffectiveT3 >0.9999, DeepT3: both classifiers positive prediction); 1 for positive prediction at default thresholds (pEffect >50, EffectiveT3 >0.95, DeepT3: one classifier); 0 for negatives. Sequences with a sum score above 4 were regarded as potential effectors. Sequences lacking start/stop codons or containing transmembrane regions (TMHMM 2.0) were excluded. Proteins were clustered using 90% sequence identity (CD-HIT parameters: ‘-c 0.9 -s 0.9') to reduce redundancy. Effector clusters with diverse effector-prediction scores were removed (full data in Supplementary Data 1 and 2).

T3SS were analogously predicted for 4,753 strains from the human gastrointestinal bacteria genome collection (HBC)17, Broad Institute–Open Biome Microbiome Library (BIO–ML) and Global Microbiome Conservancy (GMC)18,19. To obtain phylogenetic relationships for T3SS+ strains, concatenated bac120 marker proteins from GTDB-Tk (v.2.1)65 were used. T3SS+ genomes were matched to Weizmann Institute of Science representative genomes of the human gut24 with FastANI v.1.0 using average nucleotide identity (ANI) values >95% (ref. 66). The relative abundance of the 10 matching representatives was identified across 3,096 Israeli and 1,528 Dutch individuals24.

Effectors were aligned using the Needleman Wunsch algorithm and were considered ‘homologous' in HuMMIHOM using mutual sequence identity of ≥30% over 90% of the common sequence length (Supplementary Data 11).

Sequences of 1,195 known pathogenic T3 effectors were obtained from BastionHub28 (29 August 2022), and sequence similarity between commensal and pathogenic effector sequences was assessed using BLAST (v.2.10)67. For each commensal effector, the pathogen effector with the highest sequence similarity was considered as the best match and used to calculate alignment coverage. Additional significant similarities were identified using iterative sequence searches against ~124 M non-redundant bacterial sequences from UniRef90 (January 2024) with Jackhmmer29. For each commensal effector, we ran five iterations using inclusion and comparison E-value thresholds of <10−5 (Supplementary Data 5).

Protein domain annotation for effectors was carried out using the standalone version of InterProScan (v.5.75-106.0), using Pfam v.37.4 as reference. Amino acid sequences in FASTA format were used as input across three datasets: effector proteins from commensal bacterial strains (n = 3,002) and MAGs (n = 186), human and vertebrate pathogen effectors obtained from BastionHub, and all reviewed human proteins from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot reference proteome. Pathogen effectors were classified on the basis of the host annotation (human, vertebrate) of the corresponding species or strain, as provided by PHI-base68 and BV-BRC69. InterProScan used (translated) protein sequences (Supplementary Data 4) with default parameters. Domain hits with an E-value < 10−5 were considered significant.

Domains identified as significant in commensal effectors were used as reference for comparative analysis and evaluated for their presence in pathogen effectors and human proteins, applying the same annotation criteria and significance threshold. All domain annotation results, including individual hits across datasets and the comparative summary, are provided in Supplementary Data 5.

Structures of pathogen and commensal effectors were compared using FoldSeek70. Effector structures were downloaded from the AlphaFold DB when available; otherwise, a model with >95% sequence identity and >90% sequence coverage was selected as representative. Clustering was performed by setting bidirectional query coverages (qcov) at 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9, and E-value thresholds at 0.001, 0.01 and 1 using FoldSeek Cluster's greedy set cover algorithm. To assess the statistical significance of the obtained cluster distributions, we performed label permutation tests (n = 10,000) while keeping the graph's topology intact. The clustering analysis was run for all commensals against three sets of pathogen effectors: all pathogens (895 structures from human, vertebrate and plant pathogens), human and vertebrate pathogens (536 structures) and human pathogen effectors only (488 structures) (Supplementary Data 6).

For PCR cloning, genomic DNA or bacterial stocks were obtained from culture collections: ATCC (via LGC Standards, Wesel, Germany, or ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), DSMZ (Leibniz Institute DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) and BEI resources (Manassas, VA, USA) (Supplementary Data 9). Live strains were cultured according to supplier protocols and DNA was extracted using the NucleosSpin Plasmid mini kit. Effectors were cloned into pENTR223.1 by nested PCR to add Sfi sites and by restriction enzyme-based cloning using standard protocols, and verified by Sanger sequencing. Effectors identified from MAGs and effectors for the PRS were synthesized by Twist Bioscience. For experiments, effectors were moved into pDEST-DB (pPC97, Cen origin), the pDEST-N2H-N1 and -N2 and pMH-Flag-HA by Gateway LR reactions.

For bacterial injection assays, effector ORFs were cloned into a modified bacterial expression plasmid based on the pEYFP backbone (BD Biosciences, 6004-1). The EYFP sequence (positions 217–1,407) was removed and replaced with (1) SfiI and XbaI restriction sites for directional cloning of effector ORFs, (2) a 3× Flag epitope tag, (3) the HiBiT tag coding sequence VSGWRLFKKIS (Promega), and (4) the E. coli rrnB transcriptional terminator (pLac_FL_HiBiT). PCR-amplified effectors were ligated into pLac_FL_HiBiT at SfiI and XbaI restriction sites (primers in Supplementary Data 7). The positive control SipA was amplified from a pT10-based plasmid (pMIB6433)34. Cloning was verified by analytical PCR.

Electrocompetent S. enterica sv. Typhimurium (wild-type SB300 and ΔsctV mutant SB1751)34, E. tarda (ATCC 23685), C. pasteurii (DSM 28879) and P. massiliensis (DSM 26120) were generated in-house and electroporated with effector encoding plasmids using a Gene Pulser Xcell Electroporation System (Bio-Rad) at 2.5 kV and 200 Ω for ~5 ms. Transformed strains were cultured overnight in LB medium with ampicillin for subsequent use in injection assays.

The injection assay was adapted from ref. 34. HeLa cells stably expressing LgBiT (HeLa-LgBiT) were grown using standard conditions (DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 37 °C, 5% CO2) for 24 h before infection. S. Typhimurium strains carrying pLac_FL_HiBiT effector constructs were cultured overnight in LB supplemented with 0.3 M NaCl and ampicillin. Edwardsiella tarda, C. pasteurii and P. massiliensis strains were cultured with 200 μM IPTG to induce effector expression. Overnight bacterial cultures were added to the HeLa-LgBiT cells at a multiplicity of infection of 50 and jointly incubated for 1 h (Salmonella) or 1.5 h. After media replacement, extracellular luminescence was quenched by addition of 1× DarkBiT peptide (Promega, CS3002A02) for 50 min. Luminescence was measured after addition of 25 μl fresh Nano-Glo reagent (Promega, N2012) using a SpectraMax ID3 microplate reader (1,000 ms). Each strain was tested with four technical replicates and five biological replicates performed on separate days. Luminescence values from technical replicates were averaged to obtain a single value for each biological replicate. Luminescence fold-change was calculated by dividing the average signal from the effector-expressing strain by that of the mock control separately for wild-type and ΔsctV strains. To assess effector translocation, fold-change values were statistically compared between wild-type and mutant strains for Salmonella and against the negative control (SipA in ΔsctV) for E. tarda, using Wilcoxon rank-sum test (Supplementary Data 10).

Proteins were separated by 10% or 15% SDS–PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, 1620177) and blocked in blocking solution (5% non-fat dry milk in 1× PBS) for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Blots were done with mouse anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, F1804, 1:5,000), rabbit anti-Myc (Abcam, ab9106, 1:1,000), followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-mouse: sc-516102; anti-rabbit: sc-2357, both 1:5,000) for 1 h each with three washes with blocking solution or PBST, respectively. Signal was detected with SuperSignal West Femto Substrate (Thermo Scientific, 34094) according to manufacturer instructions. Blots were imaged using the Intas ChemoStar imaging system.

A multi-assay interactome mapping pipeline was used37 (Extended Data Fig. 2). In the initial screening by Y2H, candidate effectors fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DB-X) were screened against 17,472 human proteins fused to the Gal4 activation domain (AD-Y). Before screening, DB-X ORFs were tested for autoactivation by mating against AD-empty plasmids. Autoactivators were excluded. In the primary screen, DB-X strains in Y8930 (MATα) were mated on yeast extract peptone dextrose (YEPD) agar (1%) plates against minipools of ~188 AD-Y in Y8800 (MATa) representing the human ORFeome collection (v.9.1)36. After 24 h, yeasts were replica-plated onto selective media lacking leucine, tryptophan and histidine (SC-Leu-Trp-His), containing 1 mM 3-AT (3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) (3-AT plates) and replica-cleaned after 24 h. After 48 h, colonies were picked and then grown for 72 h in SC-Leu-Trp liquid medium for secondary phenotyping using the same selective +SC-Leu-His + 1 mM 3-AT + 1 mg l−1 cycloheximide plates to identify spontaneous autoactivators. Clones growing on 3-AT plates but not on cycloheximide plates were processed for sequence identification using a modified Kilo-seq procedure35: ORFs were amplified and tagged by PCR using a universal ‘term' reverse primer (5'-GGAGACTTGACCAAACCTCTGGC) and Gal4-AD and -DB specific forward primers with position barcodes (Supplementary Table 11) and a TruSeq P7 sequence (0.2 µl DreamTaq DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher, EP0702), 3 µl 2 µM term primer, 3 µl forward primer, 2 µl yeast lysis). For every 96-well plate, 5 µl from each well were pooled, purified with 24 µl magnetic beads (magtivio, MDKT00010075) and eluted in 25 µl TE buffer. The DNA concentration of each pool was quantified by the QuantiT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay kit (ThermoFisher, P7589) using a lambda DNA dilution series (50–0.390625 ng μl−1), then diluted to 1–2 ng μl−1 and tagmented with 0.25 µl TDE enzyme (Illumina Tagment DNA TDE1 Enzyme and Buffer kit, 20034197). A second PCR added plate-specific Nextera i5/i7 indices (Supplementary Table 11) (8 µl tagmented DNA, 0.2 µl DreamTaq (ThermoFisher, EP0702), 1 µl 10 µM i5/i7 primers), followed by bead cleanup (80 µl beads per 100 µl PCR, eluted in 30 µl). Libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq v.2 kit (Illumina, MS-102-2002) and demultiplexed with bcl2fastq2 (v.2.20.0.422) by Illumina.

Finally, haploid yeasts of the DB-X and AD-Y candidate interaction pairs were mated individually and tested four times on selective plates using empty AD and DB plasmids as negative controls. Growth scoring was performed using a custom dilated convolutional neural network35. Pairs scoring positive in at least three out of four repeats qualified as bona fide Y2H interactors. The AD-Y and DB-X constructs were again identified by Illumina sequencing. All interaction data are provided in Supplementary Data 11.

To identify reliably documented interactions between bacterial effectors and human proteins for our control set, we queried the IMEx consortium protein interaction databases71 for pairs supported by multiple evidence and at least one experiment detecting direct interactions. We manually recurated the corresponding publications and identified 67 well-documented direct interactions between 29 T3 effectors and 64 human proteins, described in 38 distinct publications constituting bhLit_BM-v1. To assemble bhRRS-v1, we randomly paired T3 effectors from bhLit_BM-v1 with human proteins in HuRI (Supplementary Data 12). Effector ORFs were cloned into Entry and experimental plasmids as described above. Human hsPRS/RRS-v2 ORFs were taken from hORFeome9.1 (ref. 36) and verified by end-read Sanger sequencing.

yN2H was used to independently validate the quality of the HuMMI dataset38. A total of 200 interaction pairs were randomly picked from HuMMI; all ORFs (Supplementary Data 14) were transferred by Gateway LR reactions into pDEST-N2H-N1 and pDEST-N2H-N2, and transformed into haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y8800 (MATa) and Y8930 (MATα) strains. Protein pairs from all datasets were randomly distributed across matching 96-well plates. Luminescence from reconstituted NanoLuc for each sample was measured on a SpectraMax ID3 (Molecular Devices) with a 2-s integration time. The normalized luminescence ratio (NLR) was calculated by dividing the raw luminescence of each pair (N1-X N2-Y) by the maximum luminescence value of one of the two background measurements. All obtained NLR values were log2 transformed and the positive fraction for each dataset was determined at log2 NLR thresholds between –2 and 2, in 0.01 increments. Statistical results were robust across a wide range of stringency thresholds. Supplementary Data 14 reports the results at log2NLR = 0. Reported P values were calculated by Fisher's exact test.

We evaluated whether N-terminally Flag-HA-tagged effector, or negative control Flag-GFP, co-immunoprecipitated the human proteins carrying an N-terminal MYC tag. Transfections for test and control pairs were always processed in parallel. HEK293 cells (RRID: CVCL_0045, DSMZ) were seeded in 10-cm dishes at a density yielding 60–70% confluency on the day of transfection. Plasmid DNA and X-tremeGENE transfection reagent (Roche) were mixed at a ratio of 1:2 (µg DNA:µl reagent) in serum-free DMEM. Per dish, 10 µg plasmid DNA (consisting of 3 µg effector- or GFP-encoding plasmid, 3 µg plasmid encoding the human protein and 4 µg empty vector) was diluted in 500 µl serum-free medium, followed by the addition of 20 µl X-tremeGENE reagent. The mixture was inverted twice, incubated for 15 min at room temperature and then added dropwise to the culture dish containing cells in complete growth medium. Cells were incubated under standard culture conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 24 h before downstream analysis.

For cell lysate preparation, all steps were performed on ice. Culture medium was aspirated, and cells were washed three times with ice-cold 1× PBS by rinsing and aspirating sequentially. Cells were lysed directly on the plate by adding 1 ml NP-40 lysis buffer per plate (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) NP-40 and 2.5 mM EDTA, with Roche complete protease inhibitor). Cells were detached using a rubber policeman and transferred to a 1-ml centrifuge tube. Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and cleared by centrifugation at 30,000g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and the protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad); the lysate was immediately used.

For immunoprecipitation experiments, 1 mg of cleared lysates of each sample was diluted into a final volume of 750 µl, and then 50 µl of an NP-40 buffer equilibrated with 20% anti-Flag M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich, A2220) slurry was added. Samples were rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. For washing, the tube was centrifuged at maximum speed for 30 s, the supernatant aspirated and 1 ml NP-40 wash buffer added, followed by a brief inversion. After three washes, the beads were resuspended in 50 µl NP-40 buffer, 50 µl Laemmli loading buffer was added, and the beads were heated at 98 °C for 10 min and briefly centrifuged before analysis. For analysis, 10 µl of cleared lysates and 15 µl of all immunoprecipitates were loaded on SDS–PAGE and processed through western blots as described above.

The completeness of an interactome map is an important parameter that enables assessment of overlap and how complete a given biology is covered by the map. The framework incorporates assay sensitivity (that is, the proportion of interactions the assay can detect), sampling sensitivity (that is, saturation of the screen) and search space, describing all pairwise protein combinations. For the meta-interactome studied here, the search space cannot reasonably be estimated due to the uncertainty of T3SS-containing microorganisms in all human guts and the resulting inability to define that dimension of the problem.

Assay sensitivity (Sa) was assessed using the effector bh_LitBM-v1 (54 pairs) and bhRRS-v1 (72 pairs) as well as the human hsPRS/RRS-v2 (60 and 78 pairs, respectively) for benchmarking. All reference sets were tested four times using the Y2H screening pipeline (Supplementary Data 13). To assess sampling sensitivity (Ss), a repeat screen was conducted. A total of 288 bacterial effectors were screened 4 times against 5 pools comprising 1,475 human proteins. A saturation curve was calculated as described37. In brief, all combinations of the number of interactions of the four repeats were assembled and the reciprocal values calculated. From these, a linear regression was determined to obtain the slope and the intercept. Reciprocal parameters were calculated and the Michaelis Menten equation was used with modified variables: analogous to increasing substrate concentrations in enzyme reactions, repeat screens progressively drive the screen to saturation91. Hence a saturation curve was predicted using Ni(R) = Nimax × R/Km + R, with Ni representing the interaction count after R repeats, Nimax the saturation limit and Km the Michaelis constant. Overall sensitivity emerges from both sampling and assay limitations and was calculated as So = Sa × Ss.

To estimate the significance of effector convergence, we performed a permutation test by randomly sampling with replacement 979 target nodes from HuRI36 (n = 8,274). In each iteration, we counted the number of unique targets, and the distribution from 10,000 random permutations was used to compute the z-score for the observed 349 targets. A P value was obtained from the z-scores using the ‘pnorm()' R command and multiplied by 2 for a two-tailed test. To avoid overestimation and increase stringency, we restricted the analysis to Y2H positive proteins in HuMMIMAIN and HuRI. To assess interspecies convergence, we used a conditional permutation test that preserves the strain contribution. Each iteration generated 18 samples corresponding to the observed number of targets for each strain (Supplementary Data 11). For every protein, the frequency of selection across all strains was recorded as its convergence value. On the basis of 10,000 iterations, we derived the convergence value distribution, calculated z-scores and obtained the P value using the pnorm() R function. Significance was observed from four strains onward (P < 0.004), and proteins targeted by at least four strains were considered to show interspecies convergence.

To investigate the relationship between the effector sequence and the interaction profile similarity, we calculated the pairwise Jaccard indices for all effector pairs within each homology cluster. The index was defined as the ratio of shared to total human targets. Pairs with fewer than three targets were excluded.

To analyse the interfaces of effector–host interaction pairs, all identified pairs were subjected to structural prediction using AlphaFold v.2.3.1 with the following options: –model_preset=multimer, –db_preset=full_dbs, –max_template_date=2023-12-19, –num_multimer_predictions_per_model=1, –enable_cpu_relax and –use_precomputed_msas. Predictions were not generated for pairs whose combined length exceeded 2,500 residues. The predicted aligned error (PAE) matrix was extracted from the AlphaFold pickle output using alphapickle v.1.4.1 (https://github.com/mattarnoldbio/alphapickle, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5752375). To assess confidence, we used the confident contacts count (CCC), which is the number of residue–residue contacts72 with PAE < 4 Å. Each putative interface residue was assigned a PAE value. When a residue was in contact with multiple residues on the partner protein, the minimum PAE value among those contacts was used. Structure predictions were considered confident when the CCC was ≥5.

Protein sequences (Supplementary Data 17) were converted from single-letter aa notation to three-letter residue annotation, and residue identifiers were assigned to match their positions in the AlphaFold PAE matrix. Only human proteins targeted by at least two bacterial effectors were retained. Residue contacts were extracted and matched to PAE coordinates, and pooled PAE values defined the 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th percentile thresholds. Contacts with PAE values equal or below the threshold were retained, and the corresponding human and bacterial residues and total retained contacts were recorded. This procedure was repeated for the 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th percentiles, and the resulting subsets were merged into the main dataset.

Interface similarity between bacterial effectors targeting the same human protein was assessed using the Jaccard index across all PAE thresholds. For each targeted human protein, all interacting bacterial effectors were identified, and all possible effector–effector combinations were generated. At each threshold, the Jaccard index was calculated as the number of overlapping human interface residues divided by the total number of unique residues in both interfaces. Indices were classified as distinct (Jaccard index ≤ 0.1), overlapping (0.1 < Jaccard index < 0.6) or same (Jaccard index ≥ 0.6). Analogous calculations were performed to analyse interfaces of human proteins targeted by the same bacterial effector.

Domains were assigned to the interacting human proteins using InterProScan v.5.75 with InterPro release 106.0, run through the EBI web server. Domain coordinates, descriptions and confidence scores were retrieved. The number of interface residues within each domain boundary (n_interface_residues_in_domain) was then counted, along with the total residues in the predicted interface (n_residues_in_interface), the percentage of interface residues in the domain (IF%), the number of residues in the domain (Domain_length) and the proportion of the domain length relative to the full protein length (Domain%).

We used as mimicINT43 input, a representative set of effectors identified in isolated strains (2,300 sequences clustered at 90% identity) and all effectors identified in MAGs (186). mimicINT detects domains in effector sequences using the signatures from the InterPro v.81.0 database73, retaining matches with an E-value < 10−5. For motif detection, mimicINT uses definitions available in the ELM database74. The IUPred 1.0 algorithm75 was employed to detect motifs in disordered regions with both short and long models (motif disorder propensity = 0.2 (ref. 76), minimum size = 5). The interface inference step used the 3did database77 for domain–domain templates and the ELM database (2022 release) for motif–domain templates. Two scoring strategies were applied. First, domain binding specificity within the same family was accounted for by computing a profile HMM-based domain score41 (stringency threshold = 0.3). Second, given the degenerate nature of motifs41, mimicINT uses Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the probability of a SLiM occurring by chance, by shuffling disordered regions of the input sequences to generate N randomized proteins. Effectors were first grouped by strain, with MAG-derived effectors assigned to the closest strain. Disordered regions were shuffled 100,000 times using two backgrounds: same-strain effectors (within-strain shuffling) and full effector set (interstrain shuffling). Motif occurrences in each effector were compared to those in the shuffled sequences, retaining only those with an empirical P < 0.1 in both backgrounds. To assess whether the number of inferred interface-resolved interactions exceeded random expectation, the analysis was controlled using 10,000 degree-controlled random networks generated from the human interaction search space (Supplementary Data 18).

For the reverse analysis of bacterial domains interacting with SLiMs in the human proteins, the annotated bacterial domains were matched to domains in the ELM templates. For interactors of the so-identified effectors (Efe_1, Pfa_18, Pre_16, Pst_8, Vfu_32), we identified disordered regions as above and screened these for motifs matching the templates in the ELM database, yielding the reported example.

Holdup is a biochemical assay used to validate the interface predictions involving PDZ domains. A total of 54 human PDZ domains and 11 tandem constructs were recombinantly expressed as His6-MBP-PDZ constructs in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS and purified by Ni2+-affinity columns using 800 µl of beads (Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow immobilized metal affinity chromatography, Cytiva) per target. After elution, purified proteins were desalted using PD10 columns (GE healthcare, 17085101) into 3.5 ml 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole buffer. Protein concentrations were determined using A280 nm on a PHERAstar FSX plate reader (BMG LABTECH), and purity assessed by SDS–PAGE and capillary electrophoresis; 4 µM stocks were stored at −20 °C. Biotinylated peptides (10-mer) corresponding to the C-terminal sequences of effectors were synthesized by GenicBio Limited; the N-terminal biotin was attached via a 6-aminohexanoic acid linker, and all peptides were >95% pure (HPLC and MS). Peptides were solubilized in dH2O, 1.4% ammonia or 5% acetic acid, aliquoted at 10 mM and stored at −20 °C.

For the assay, 2.5 µl of streptavidin resin (Cytiva, 17511301) was incubated in a 384-well filter plate (Millipore, MZHVN0W10) for 15 min with 20 µl of a 42 µM peptide solution. The resin was washed with 10 resin volumes (resvol) of holdup buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM imidazole, 5 mM dithiothreitol), incubated for 15 min with 5 resvol 1 mM biotin and washed three times with 10 resvol of holdup buffer. Individual PDZ domains were added to wells, incubated for 15 min, and unbound PDZ recovered by centrifugation into 384-well black assay plates for fluorescence readout. Concentrations were quantified by intrinsic Trp fluorescence, and fluorescein/mCherry was used for peak normalization. Binding affinities and equilibrium dissociation constants were calculated as previously described45, using the mean PBM concentration. Raw values and statistical analysis are provided in Supplementary Data 19.

Functional enrichment of effector targets was assessed using the ‘gost()' function in the ‘gprofiler2' R package (v.0.2.1)78 with HuRI as the background (custom_bg), excluding electronic annotations (exclude_iea = TRUE), with Benjamini–Hochberg correction (correction_method = ‘fdr'). Functional categories were drawn from Gene Ontology biological process terms (GO:BP), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, and the Reactome pathways database (sources = c(‘GO:BP', ‘KEGG', ‘ REAC')). Odds ratios and fold enrichments were calculated to estimate effect sizes, where the odds ratios was the ratio of odds in the target set to those in the HuRI background, and fold enrichment compared observed to expected annotated targets. Expected values were based on random sampling from the HuRI background (GO:BP = 6,988; KEGG = 3,250; Reactome = 4,592) (Supplementary Data 20). Similar analyses were performed for functional enrichment analysis of human proteins targeted by pathogens (Supplementary Data 20).

We assessed enrichment of targeted enzymes across metabolic subsystems using the human genome-scale model Recon3D48. Recon3D is a curated static model of human metabolism that lacks post-translational and allosteric regulation. Ligases and kinases were excluded to focus on metabolic enzymes. For each of the 95 Recon3D subsystems, enrichment was tested using the ‘phyper()' R function, with inputs corresponding to annotated and unannotated targeted enzymes and BH false discovery rate (FDR) correction. OR and fold enrichment were calculated as described for functional analyses (Supplementary Data 20).

Associations of effector targets and convergence proteins with human disease genetics were tested using a two-sided Fisher's exact test. Disease-causal genes were obtained from the Open Targets genetic portal (access date 23 August 2022), which integrates variant-to-gene distance, quantitative trait loci co-localization, chromatin interactions and variant pathogenicity79. The portal's machine-learning model assigns each locus-to-gene (L2G) score to genes in loci identified in GWAS to identify the most probable causal gene. Genes with L2G ≥ 0.5 were considered causal as recommended80. Ensembl identifiers were converted to gene symbols using the biomaRt R package (v.2.60.1, Bioconductor 3.19), and Fisher's exact test was implemented in R (fisher.test), stats v.4.2.2 using default parameters on 2 × 2 contingency tables comparing causal gene presence in query and background sets. HuRI protein encoding genes were used as the background, and targets or convergence proteins as the query sets. FDR correction and OR and fold enrichments were calculated as done for functional enrichment (Supplementary Data 21).

We implemented a random walk with restart (RWR) algorithm, RWR-MH81, to explore the network neighbourhood of 338 human proteins targeted by 243 commensal effectors in HuRI36 (HuMMIMAIN). Human targets were used as seeds, with the restart probability of 0.7 generating a ranked list of proteins. Statistical significance was assessed by random walks in degree-preserved randomized networks. We generated 1,000 random networks from HuRI and computed RWR scores for each protein, retaining as network neighbour only those with empirical P < 0.01.

For each set of significant neighbourhood proteins, we tested for enrichment of Open Targets causal genes (L2G ≥ 0.5) linked to traits supported by at least three causal genes. Enrichment in each strain neighbourhood was assessed using two-sided Fisher's exact test with BH correction. No associations were significant (FDR < 0.05). We therefore focused on 400 associations with nominal P < 0.01 and odds ratio > 3. Disease categorizations were refined to reflect aetiology; Sjogren syndrome, eczema and psoriasis were grouped as immunological rather than eye or skin traits, and osteoarthritis as musculoskeletal/connective tissue rather than metabolic traits. For Fig. 4d, related asthma and psoriasis terms were merged (Supplementary Data 23).

HEK293 cells (RRID: CVCL_0045, DSMZ) were maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS, 100 U ml−1 penicillin–streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. IKKβ (pRK5-Flag) and A20 (pEF4-Flag) served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Cells (1 × 106 per 60 mm dish) were transfected with 10 ng NF-κB reporter plasmid (6× NF-κB firefly luciferase pGL2), 50 ng pTK reporter (Renilla luciferase) and 2 µg bacterial ORF in pMH-Flag-HA using the calcium phosphate method. After 6 h, medium was replaced. To assess NF-κB inhibition, cells were treated for 4 h with 20 ng ml−1 TNF (Sigma-Aldrich, SRP3177) at 24 h post transfection. Lysates were analysed using the dual-luciferase reporter kit (Promega, E1980) with a luminometer (Berthold Centro LB960 microplate reader, software: MikroWin 2010). NF-κB induction was determined as firefly/Renilla luminescence. P values were calculated using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's post hoc comparisons followed by FDR correction. Raw values and statistical analysis are provided in Supplementary Data 24.

Protein expression was analysed by western blot as described above with following modifications: blocking solution contained 0.1% Tween-20. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in 2.5% BSA in PBST, washed and probed with anti-mouse secondary antibody in PBST for 1 h at room temperature (1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs, RRID:AB_2340770). Primary antibodies used were: anti-β-actin (1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, RRID:AB_626632), anti-Flag M2 (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich, RRID:AB_259529) and anti-HA (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich, RRID:AB_514505). Signals were detected using LumiGlo reagent (CST, 7003S) and chemiluminescence film (Sigma-Aldrich, GE28-9068-36).

Caco-2 cells (RRID: CVCL_0025) were maintained in DMEM glutamax medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Experiments in Fig. 5c were performed by transfecting Caco-2 cells using 40,000 MW linear polyethylenimine (PEI MAX) (Polysciences) at a ratio of 1:5 pDNA:PEI. Cells were exposed to the transfection mixture for 16 h, washed, recovered for 6 h and then sorted (BD FACSAria III cell sorter, BD Biosciences). After 24 h recovery, cells were activated for 48 h using a stimulation mix containing 200 ng ml−1 phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (P8139, Sigma-Aldrich), 100 ng ml−1 lipopolysaccharide (L6529, Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 ng ml−1 TNF (130-094-014, Miltenyi Biotec). During activation, proliferation was monitored in the Incucyte S3 Live Cell Analysis system (Essen BioScience). Cytokine levels were determined using the human inflammation panel 1 LEGENDplex kit (Biolegend). We performed three biological repeats, each with three or four technical repeats. Statistical significance was tested on the average of the technical replicates using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's post hoc comparisons. Experiments in Fig. 5d and Extended Data Fig. 4d were performed by transfecting cells using the 4D-Nucleofector system (Lonza). Collected cells were resuspended in SF nucleofector solution, added with 0.6 µg plasmid, and pulsed (code DG-113) and plated in DMEM + 5% FBS. Cells were allowed to recover overnight and then rested in culture medium for 24 h. Cells were stimulated with 10 µg ml−1 Pam3CSK4 (tlrl-pms, Invivogen), 1 µg ml−1 flagellin (tlrl-stfla, Invivogen) or 100 ng ml−1 TNF (130-094-014, Miltenyi Biotec) for 24 h. We performed five biological repeat experiments with three technical repeats each. For each experiment, pooled supernatants were analysed using the Human Anti-virus Response Panel V02 (BioLegend). The data were analysed using Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's post hoc comparisons. Raw and statistical summary data are available in Supplementary Data 25.

Metagenomic assemblies from the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multiomics DataBases (IBDMBD)53 and from the skin metagenome82 were downloaded, and protein repertoires predicted using Prodigal (option: -p meta)83. Effectors were compared to the metagenomic protein repertoires using DIAMOND 0.9.24 (options: >90% query length, >80% identity). For analyses in Fig. 5, samples were grouped into individuals with ulcerative colitis (n = 304), Crohn's disease (n = 508) and the controls without IBD (n = 334). Binary presence and absence vectors for each effector across the sample were generated and the prevalence of each effector in patients compared to the controls was assessed using Fisher's exact test, implemented within the SciPy 1.9.3 Python 3.10.12 module, and FDR corrected using BH correction. Differences in prevalence distributions between healthy and either patient cohort were estimated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, implemented in the ‘wilcox.test()' R function. We used fold change as the measure of effect size in Fig. 5e, calculated as prevalence in the test group divided by prevalence in the healthy group. To avoid division by zero, we applied a small pseudo-count to the healthy cohort data for individuals with 0% prevalence. The pseudo-count was equivalent to half a case in the healthy cohort (n = 334 individuals), ensuring minimal influence on results while enabling calculation of fold change. Statistical details are provided in Supplementary Data 26.

Data were subjected to statistical analysis and plotted in Microsoft Excel 2010 or Python or R scripts. For comparison of normally distributed values, we used one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). For comparison of values not passing the normality tests, we used either Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's correction for multiple-group comparisons or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for two-group comparisons as indicated. Enrichments were calculated using Fisher's exact test with Bonferroni FDR correction. All statistical evaluations were done as two-sided tests. Generally, a corrected P < 0.05 was considered significant. GO, KEGG and Reactome functional enrichments were calculated using the gprofiler2 R package with the indicated background sets. For the disease target enrichments and neighbourhood associations, no associations were significant after multiple hypothesis correction, which is why nominally significant associations calculated by Fisher's exact tests were used for Fig. 4c,d. All raw values, n and statistical details are presented in Supplementary Data as indicated in figure legends and in Methods.

Wind and solar power needs to expand rapidly if we are to replace fossil fuels by 2050. Credit: Ke Zhuang/Getty

On 28 October 2025, United Nations secretary-general António Guterres acknowledged that the totemic goal of the Paris climate agreement is going to be missed: “The truth is that we have failed to avoid an overshooting above 1.5 °C in the next few years”1.

Approaching 1.5 °C: how will we know we've reached this crucial warming mark?

Approaching 1.5 °C: how will we know we've reached this crucial warming mark?

Guterres was merely stating the obvious. In 2024, Earth's global mean surface temperature averaged 1.55 °C above pre-industrial levels2, and the average for 2023–25 is 1.48 °C, perilously close to the limit. Keeping to the Paris target now looks impossible by any realistic measure. Yet this moment should not invite despair. Instead, it demands an urgent reframing of how climate progress is measured and mobilized.

The world today looks very different from that in 2015 when the Paris goal was framed. Although emissions are still rising and global actions on climate change are slow, a lot of progress has been made. Clean energy is expanding rapidly and decarbonization, not fossil fuels, is the new ‘business as usual'. In the first three quarters of 2025, growth in clean electricity generation outpaced that in energy demand for the first time, implying that fossil fuels are being displaced (see go.nature.com/3jvqzcb).

We argue that the main focus of climate action in 2026 and beyond should be on accelerating the clean-energy revolution. And the rate at which clean energy displaces fossil fuels in the global economy should become the key measure of climate progress. Here we describe how such progress can be tracked and incentivized using a metric we call the clean-energy shift. Unlike chasing intangible temperature targets, cleaning up the energy sector is a more-focused battle that the world can win.

To move forwards, climate scientists and policymakers must first accept that the Paris 1.5 °C target has outlived its usefulness. Although initially valuable as a unifying focus for international efforts to increase mitigation, continuing to emphasize a failed temperature target might produce more harm than good.

One reason is the difficulty of determining when and whether the world has crossed the line. Forecasts suggest that Earth is likely to exceed the 1.5 °C threshold around 2028, for instance (see go.nature.com/4pf95x6). But in the terminology of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), “exceedance” of 1.5 °C refers to the midpoint of a 20-year period at that level3. Confirmation would therefore not come until a decade after the fact.

Environmental treaties are paralysed — here's how we can do better

Environmental treaties are paralysed — here's how we can do better

Such a target, requiring years of expert interpretation to assess, could never have great salience for decision makers. And it challenges public understanding because, by definition, no person experiences global average temperatures. Moving to a higher number when 1.5 °C is crossed, such as 1.6 °C or 1.7 °C, would only make climate target setting seem arbitrary and unrooted in scientific evidence.

More concerningly, the emphasis on keeping Earth's temperature below 1.5 °C might serve to justify risky interventions in the climate system. For example, injecting vast amounts of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere through ‘solar radiation modification' could be one of the few remaining ways to bring 1.5 °C back into reach. But it might also alter precipitation patterns or result in a burst of warming if the programme were suddenly halted.

More complex temperature targets won't help. Discussions have begun around the concept of ‘overshoot', in which the planet's average temperature would be brought back to 1.5 °C by 2100 after a period exceeding that level4. But its achievement would be even harder to pin down. While in overshoot, no one can be sure whether it is permanent or temporary. A successful return to 1.5 °C could be confirmed only at the end of the century.

Any approach based on projections to 2100 is unlikely to inspire public interest or political action because the goal is so far off. It is hubristic to think that researchers can predict accurately how emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence will affect the climate, or how Earth's climate system itself will respond to unprecedented conditions.

Instead, we propose that policymakers focus on rapidly building the clean-energy systems that can deliver the safer climate and thriving economies that populations demand. These goals are already agreed. For example, in 2023 at the UN Conference of the Parties (COP) 28 climate summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, countries called for a tripling of renewable-energy capacity globally by 2030 and the transition away from fossil fuels to reach net zero by 2050. Whereas delegates at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, in 2025, struggled to agree to phase out fossil fuels, support for accelerating clean energy is almost universal.

To fulfil this mandate, the world needs one clear number with which to measure climate progress during a transition that ends the use of fossil fuels. We think the most promising metric is one we term the ‘clean-energy shift'. Building on a concept initially proposed by Bloomberg New Energy Finance founder Michael Liebreich (see go.nature.com/3zr5y1), we define it as the growth rate in clean-energy generation minus the growth rate in total energy demand for a given time interval.

This metric emphasizes that clean-energy supply must expand faster than overall energy demand for decarbonization. When the percentage growth of clean-energy supply exceeds the growth in total energy use, fossil fuels get squeezed out of the system. By contrast, simply measuring clean energy share is insufficient, because fossil fuels might also rise overall to meet extra demand.

For example, if clean-energy grows by 6% each year and total energy demand grows by 3%, the clean-energy shift is +3%, meaning that clean energy is displacing fossil energy as a share of total energy generation. The bigger the number, the faster the exit from fossil fuels.

Clean-energy shift measures progress in a positive way5, towards a 100% clean economy, rather than negatively towards net zero. This would reduce the political resistance that arises from the perceived economic sacrifice of limiting emissions. Chasing the number zero will never motivate politicians concerned about economic development. Framing decarbonization as a story of building clean-energy industries and jobs is more appealing. The metric points to policies that are politically feasible, economically desirable and already advancing rapidly technologically, including solar, wind, batteries, geothermal, hydro and nuclear — without picking winners.

The power of pursuing this approach is evident in recent energy trends. Between 2018 and 2020, the annual percentage growth of clean-energy generation rose sharply, driven by rapid additions of solar, wind and storage capacities. Total global energy demand also grew, but at a slower rate, implying that growth in clean-energy production began eating into the share of fossil fuels. If this clean-energy shift can be increased further, the world would see a peak and then a steady decline in fossil-fuel use and related emissions. Indeed, data from China suggest the nation's emissions peak could come as soon as this year6.

It is up to policymakers to determine how high the clean-energy shift should be. For example, to eliminate fossil fuels by 2050, the metric would need to rise substantially, from around 4% over the past five years, and keep climbing through the 2030s and 2040s. This means that clean-energy generation must continue its current rapid growth, rising several percentage points faster than total energy demand each year.

Although challenging, trends in solar, wind and storage deployment suggest that this acceleration is achievable — although it will require expanded manufacturing capacity, grids built to integrate renewable technologies, continued reductions in battery costs and political will.

To achieve global decarbonization by 2050, policymakers need short-term milestones. We suggest they might set global targets of clean-energy shifts in five-year intervals — like rungs on a ladder, each climbing closer to a safe climate. It should be noted that the intervals are non-linear in terms of added capacity: because clean-energy shift is a percentage-growth metric, the higher rungs reflect increasingly rapid rates of clean-energy expansion, rather than a constant yearly addition.

Encouragingly, the world has already climbed the first two rungs. We calculate an average shift of about 3.4% during 2014–19, rising to about 5.7% in 2024. The next rungs would need to sustain or increase these numbers to enable a fossil-fuels exit by 2050. Lower numbers would mean fossil fuels staying longer as part of the energy mix.

Climate change is devastating mining of minerals needed to fight it

These intervals can be aligned with the five-year timelines used by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) policy process, such as major COP agreements, reviews of ‘nationally determined contributions' and ‘global stocktakes' of progress towards the Paris goals for emissions reductions.

The clean-energy shift metric also respects long-established UN principles of equity and accountability, including the concept of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities' in climate policy. The metric would not be a legally binding top-down number but the upward product of the collective efforts of all countries, which would continue to determine their own energy policies.

Individual countries can use the metric to track their own progress. And several major emitters already include clean-energy targets in their Paris commitments. For example, India met its 50% non-fossil power capacity goal five years ahead of its 2030 target. China has more than doubled its wind and solar capacity over the past three years. The European Union currently has about one-quarter of its energy consumption supplied by renewable sources, which it has mandated should rise to 42.5% within five years.

No metric can cover everything. And the clean-energy shift excludes emissions from sources other than fossil fuels, such as greenhouse gases resulting from deforestation, soil cultivation or wildfires. But the climate damage caused by fossil fuels is unique in its scale — comprising 90% of the carbon dioxide problem (38 of 42 gigatonnes in 2024)7.

The energy efficiency of heat engines (gas and steam turbines) for electricity production and propulsion is determined by the Carnot cycle and scales with operating temperature. Commercial nickel- and cobalt-based superalloys melt near 1,500 °C and rapidly lose mechanical strength beyond 1,000 °C. Refractory metals melt well above 2,000 °C but have inherent manufacturability challenges that are barriers to adoption, such as high ductile-to-brittle transition temperatures. Using density functional theory-guided design, we demonstrate tailored local lattice distortions that promote phase-stable, non-equiatomic refractory concentrated solid solutions with both high ductility and strength. We exemplify this for single-phase, body-centred cubic Nb4Ta4V3Ti that exhibits castability, excellent room-temperature tensile yield strength (∼1 GPa) and ductility (approaching 20% uniform strain), and exceptional high-temperature tensile strength (500 MPa at 1,000 °C). These findings illustrate a path for designing materials that hold great potential for advancing next-generation technologies such as Generation IV fission reactors, first-generation fusion-plasma reactors, and more efficient gas turbines for electricity generation and propulsion.

This isn't just another Intel chip launch. Far from it. For years, most updates to Intel's laptop chips have been nothing more than modest performance increases over the previous year. That's not the case with the long-awaited arrival of Panther Lake.

It's a chip design announced almost five years ago as part of the company's ambitious rescue plan to get back on track. Intel's CEO at the time (and mastermind of the grand plan), Pat Gelsinger, called the technology the “cornerstone of the company's turnaround strategy.” Now, I have a laptop in front of me with this Panther Lake chip inside, officially known as the Intel Core Ultra Series 3. Having tested it myself, I'm left extremely impressed. I'm not sure if the Series 3 will redeem Intel's recent foibles, but these chips certainly feel like a big win for a company that really needs one.

To succeed with the Core Ultra Series 3, Intel at least needed to fulfill the promises it made when the chips were announced last year. Namely, battery life and efficiency equivalent to its predecessor (Lunar Lake) with improved performance. That alone has been a major hurdle for the kind of x86 processors Intel has always made. The company has also boldly claimed that its higher-powered silicon for gaming laptops will do the opposite: maintain the performance of last year's chips with added efficiency for better battery life. That is, yet again, another tall order.

I tested the Core Ultra X9 388H, representing the top of the range of the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 line of chips. The chip was tested in a 16-inch Lenovo IdeaPad reference unit. These are both 16-core CPUs, and it is broken dow nto four performance cores, eight efficiency cores, and four low-power efficiency cores.

Interestingly, this is actually two fewer performance cores than the Core Ultra 9 285H, though it gets confusing as to which chip from the Intel Core Ultra Series 2 this chip is the successor to. In other words, there's no exact one-to-one here in terms of comparing price and performance. Here's a sampling of the scores it posted in my testing.

As you can see, this new Intel chip now sit at the top of the stack in terms of multi-core performance, outside the M4 Pro. Coming back with a chip that outperforms Apple's latest M5 by this much is no easy feat, but Intel pulled it off. The same is true in the graphics department, where Intel has taken the lead in integrated graphics.

The Core Ultra 7 258V listed above was tested in the Dell 14 Plus, though, which is a smaller laptop than the Lenovo. As you can see, the Core ultra X9 388H easily surpasses the current-generation M4 MacBook Air.

But Intel still can't compete on single-core performance against Apple, and that's where the improvement is the most modest. Across the board, it's also not as fast as the M4 Pro or M4 Max, which still have the edge in every category, though the difference in multi-core performance between the X9 and the M4 Pro is only 14 percent. Apple's M5 Pro and M5 Max are just around the corner, too. I'd also love to test the Core Ultra X7358H against upcoming processors in next-gen laptops like the Snapdragon X2 Elite Enhanced, but I don't have them on hand yet for comparisons.

The graphics really stand out, though. For once, the inclusion of the “X” branding in the name actually feels worthwhile. The X9 chip (a well as the X7) use a B390 GPU, representing the top of the line in Intel's architecture (outside of discrete desktop graphics cards). You get 12 Xe cores in the X7 and X9 configurations, the only difference between the two being clock speed. Intel claimed that Panther Lake graphics were 77 percent faster than in the previous-gen Lunar Lake laptops, and while I didn't quite see that much of a jump, it's hard to get a direct apples-to-apples comparison with laptops.

Either way, as you can see above, Intel has pulled off a huge move forward in integrated graphics. Big numbers are what you want in benchmarks, yes, but as always, how that translates into an actual product you buy is what matters.

There are two useful applications for putting stronger graphics in an otherwise basic, thin-and-light laptop. First, it speeds up all types of tasks, whether that's video editing or local artificial intelligence inferencing, without having to deal with a thicker, more expensive device.

Speaking of AI, the neural processing unit (NPU) has gotten a lot less attention this time around, but it's still capable of 50 TOPS (trillions of operations per second). That's falling behind the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2's 80 TOPS—then again, the NPU hasn't proven itself to be all that exciting just yet in average laptop use. It's the GPU performance that really has the potential to change what this class of thin-and-light laptops can do.

Non-gaming Windows laptops with discrete GPUs still aren't as common as they should be, get poor battery life, and often cost too much. That has left a space for the MacBook Pro to dominate without any real competition. While it still depends largely on laptop manufacturers, they at least now have access to chips that can handle the performance and efficiency.

Gaming is the most obvious advantage of improved graphics. The laptop I tested isn't a conventional “gaming” laptop, and yet, the power of that B390 makes gaming not only possible, but actually enjoyable. The device I tested bears a lot of resemblance to the IdeaPad Pro 5i, a 16-inch laptop that had an RTX 4050 when it launched in 2024. The Core Ultra X9 388H really has room to breathe in the newer reference version I tested; its gaming performance is really impressive. Cyberpunk 2077 can hit a comfortable 55 frames per second (fps) at native medium graphics settings—and that's without any upscaling and frame generation. That's solid for a laptop not marketed for gaming at all.

When you do need higher frame rates than what this system can natively produce, such as in Marvel Rivals, Intel has XeSS upscaling, frame generation, and a low-latency mode. The Lenovo machine only got around 36 fps natively at medium graphics settings in that title, but after I turned on the XeSS 2.0 Quality setting, that jumped up to 54 fps without much of a downgrade in image quality. The combination of XeSS frame generation and low latency can push the frame rates even higher to use the full extent of this display's 120-Hz refresh rate without reducing input lag.

Here's the thing: This is a fairly large laptop. While I don't have official specs on it yet, the Lenovo reference device is around the same size as the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but the slight wedge shape makes it thicker by the hinge. It is already the size of a machine that could squeeze in a discrete graphics card, and as powerful as the Core Ultra X9 388H is, it's still a solid 25 percent behind even an older graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 4050, as well as Apple's M4 Pro.

I love the idea of not needing a dedicated gaming device to play games, and this device sells that idea best over the Lenovo reference design. But as gaming laptops get trimmer and MacBooks push forward into gaming, Intel's success here feels like less of a revelation than I thought it would. Even the top-of-the-line X9 chip is still 26 percent behind the performance of an RTX 4050 in a laptop, and that's the lowest-tier GPU from three years ago.

Presumably, we'll get thinner laptops that can make use of this chip, but we'll have to see how the performance shapes up. As of now, the main benefit you're getting here isn't performance, it's battery life. Laptops with discrete graphics generally get poorer battery life, while this larger Lenovo machine got well over 20 hours of local video playback. For the first time, it finally feels like Apple has a competitor within striking distance of its MacBook Pro—at least when it comes to not having to always make a trade between performance and battery life.

A lot of what makes the performance of these chips so important is how they were made. They're built on Intel 18A, the latest process node manufactured in the company's new fab in Arizona. The facility isn't just another chip plant. It was hailed as an attempt to bring back advanced chip manufacturing to the states, largely funded by the CHIPS Act. And don't forget an $8.9 billion investment in Intel from the US government, which gained a 10 percent equity stake in the company.

Intel 18A is also a return to form in that the previous-gen Core Ultra Series 2 was partially manufactured by TSMC. This was a big deal at the time—an admission of just how far behind Intel had fallen versus the competition, especially in battery life. While it allowed those chips to be more competitive with Apple and Qualcomm in terms of efficiency and battery life, it was a bitter pill to swallow, no doubt. Notably, they didn't move the needle in performance from the Core Ultra Series 1 chips.

The Core Ultra Series 3 reverses that water-treading trend for Intel, positioning itself well against the likes of Qualcomm and Apple. Based on the number of laptops embracing the new chips announced at CES, the company hasn't lost its dominance and remains the primary choice for Windows laptops. In that way, 18A and Core Ultra Series 3 feel like a success so far, at least in terms of delivering competitive performance in consumer laptops.

What happens in the long run is harder to say. The grand architect, former CEO Pat Gelsinger, for whom 18A was such a linchpin, is no longer at the company. The cloud AI boom is surging around Nvidia, and Intel is mostly missing out. But I do know this: Panther Lake is Intel's biggest success in years and should restore some confidence in its future.

The tech world often feels like a series of high-stakes marriages that end in messy, expensive divorces. We are currently witnessing the honeymoon phase of what might be the most consequential “marriage of convenience” in a decade: Apple and Google closing the deal to bake Gemini into the iOS ecosystem.

For those of us who have watched these companies for decades, this feels like a repeat of a movie we've seen before, and the ending usually involves one partner walking away with the house while the other wonders what happened to their furniture.

Let's talk about why Apple picked Gemini — and why this partnership could end badly. We'll close with my Product of the Week: Artlist.io. I've been using it for months, and it's impressive.

Apple has a problem that money can't immediately solve: it's late to the AI party.

While Apple Intelligence has been marketed as a privacy-first, on-device solution, the reality is that on-device models — typically ranging from 3 billion to 7 billion parameters — simply cannot handle the heavy lifting required for the next generation of digital assistants. Apple needed a partner with a “frontier model,” and it needed one that could scale to two billion devices without melting down.



On-device AI can handle quick tasks, but cloud-scale models like Gemini do the heavy lifting.

Google Gemini, particularly its higher-end tiers, has emerged as the most logical fit. While OpenAI's ChatGPT holds the mindshare crown, Google has consistently shown strength in multimodal AI and the infrastructure needed to run it at scale. Google owns the data centers, the fiber, and the specialized TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) clusters required to run these models at a global scale.

For Apple, Google is the “best” partner for now because Gemini is built to be a platform, not just a chatbot. It integrates with everything from Google Maps to Workspace, providing ecosystem-level utility that a standalone assistant experience often can't match as cleanly. If Siri is ever going to become more than a glorified egg timer, it needs a brain that understands the world, not just a dictionary.

As I watch this deal unfold, I can't help but think back to 2014, when Apple and IBM announced a massive partnership aimed at “transforming enterprise mobility.” At the time, I had hoped that Apple would finally take the enterprise seriously by leveraging IBM's deep-tissue connection to the corporate world. It was supposed to be a match made in heaven: Apple's user experience combined with IBM's big data and analytics.

However, like many Apple partnerships, it never lived up to the hype. MobileFirst didn't land, the sales teams didn't align, and eventually the two companies drifted apart. Apple got what it wanted — a foot in the door of the Fortune 500 — and then proceeded to ignore IBM's needs. IBM, like many before it, realized that being Apple's partner often means being Apple's subordinate.

History is littered with the carcasses of companies that thought a partnership with Apple would be their ticket to the big leagues. From the AIM alliance with IBM and Motorola in the 1990s to the more recent fallout with Intel and the strained relationship with Goldman Sachs over the Apple Card, there is a recurring theme: Apple partners until it can replicate.



Apple's history with partners like IBM and Intel hints at how the Gemini alliance could end.

Many companies eventually regret partnering with Apple because Apple's primary goal is total vertical integration. It doesn't want to rely on your technology; it wants to use your technology to bridge the gap until it can build its own.

For Google, this is a dangerous game. Google is currently providing the “intellectual engine” for the iPhone, but in doing so, it is helping Apple maintain its ecosystem dominance — dominance that directly competes with Google's Android platform.

Interestingly, Apple and Microsoft currently share a common vulnerability: neither fully controls the core AI stack they are betting their futures on. Microsoft is inextricably tied to OpenAI, a partnership that has become increasingly strained and complicated as OpenAI seeks its own path. Apple is now tied to Google.

Neither Apple nor Microsoft has a great reputation for making partnerships work as equals. They are both Alpha companies that demand control. By relying on third-party AI, both have admitted that their internal R&D failed to keep pace with the generative AI revolution. This creates a precarious foundation where the most important feature of their operating systems is owned by someone else.

This partnership is a strategic masterstroke for Apple in the short term. It allows them to move against a weakened Windows ecosystem that has struggled to make Copilot+ PCs a must-have upgrade for consumers. By bringing Gemini's power to the iPhone, Apple effectively nullifies the AI advantage that Google's Pixel and Samsung's Galaxy devices held.

However, it also exposes Apple to massive long-term risk. Google isn't just a supplier; it's the “frenemy” extraordinaire. By integrating Gemini so deeply into iOS, Apple is giving Google a front-row seat to how iPhone users interact with AI.

While Apple maintains its “Private Cloud Compute” standards to protect data, the “intelligence” still belongs to Mountain View. If Google decides to prioritize certain features for Android, or if the partnership sours over revenue-sharing disputes, Apple could find its “intelligence” suddenly lobotomized.



If history is our guide, this partnership will follow a predictable path:

Phase 1: The Honeymoon. Siri will get exponentially better, iPhone sales will stabilize, and Google will collect billions in licensing fees.

Phase 2: The Friction. Apple will begin poaching key AI talent and attempt to shrink Gemini's footprint in favor of its own evolving “Ajax” models.

Phase 3: The Divorce. Once Apple feels its on-device and private cloud models are “good enough,” it will relegate Google to a secondary “extension” or drop it entirely, just as it did with Google Maps and Intel chips.

Google, however, is more resilient than IBM or Intel. It owns the “search economy” that fuels Apple's services revenue. This makes the divorce much more complicated and potentially much more litigious.

The Apple-Google Gemini deal is a brilliant move for a company that found itself behind the 8-ball in the AI race.

For now, it gives Apple the best-in-class tools it needs to keep the iPhone relevant in an AI-first world. But for Google, it's a deal with the devil; feeding the very beast that seeks to replace it eventually.

In the tech industry, a partnership with Apple is often the first step toward becoming a case study in what not to do. We'll see how long it takes for the “cosmic arithmetic” of this deal to stop adding up.





As the generative AI market becomes increasingly crowded, creators are facing a new kind of fatigue: managing a dozen subscriptions for specialized tools. Artlist.io has addressed this head-on by evolving into a sophisticated single front end for multiple AI rendering applications. Instead of forcing users to jump between browser tabs for video, stills, and audio, Artlist provides a unified command center for the industry's most powerful engines.

The core advantage of Artlist's approach is its role as a curated aggregator. In the current landscape, AI capabilities change weekly; the model that produced the best hyper-realistic water physics yesterday might be eclipsed by a new release tomorrow.

By integrating titans like Sora 2 Pro, Kling 2.1 Master, and Google's Veo 3.1, Artlist lets creators choose the specific “brain” that best fits their project without leaving the platform.

This unified access is more than just a convenience—it's a hedge against obsolescence. If a new model like Flux 2.0 Pro becomes the gold standard for high-fidelity stills, Artlist users can pivot instantly, leveraging the same workflow and interface they already know.

Artlist simplifies the messy economics of AI compute through a transparent monthly credit model. Rather than paying a flat “unlimited” fee that often comes with hidden throttles, users buy a pool of credits — typically starting at 16,500 and scaling up to 120,000+ per month.

This model offers granular control over production costs. For example, a 4-second clip of 1080p video using Sora 2 Pro might cost 3,800 credits, while a high-resolution still via Nano Banana Pro sits at 400 credits. This allows freelancers and agencies to bill accurately and shift their focus between media types — heavy on voiceovers one month and video-intensive the next — without managing multiple billing cycles.

Artlist recently launched a new user interface that feels professional and “editor-first,” moving away from the chaotic, experimental look of many standalone AI tools. It is intuitive and fast, but the platform still has room to mature.

The next logical evolution for Artlist would be context-aware tool selection. Currently, a user must manually select whether to use Kling, Sora, or Veo. If the UI could read a prompt — for example, “a cinematic slow-motion drone shot of the Swiss Alps” — and automatically suggest or select the engine best optimized for “cinematic physics,” it would transition from a simple front end to a true AI creative director.

Reducing the “technical choice” burden would allow creators to stay entirely in the flow of their vision.

Artlist.io is my Product of the Week because it successfully tames the fragmented AI frontier, providing a stable, professional, and commercially licensed ecosystem for the modern content creator. I'm looking forward to seeing how they advance it in the future!

Claude users will now be able to call up interactive apps within the chatbot interface, thanks to a new feature announced by Anthropic on Monday.

In keeping with Anthropic's enterprise focus, the launch apps are mostly workplace tools, including Slack, Canva, Figma, Box, and Clay, with a Salesforce implementation expected soon. In each case, the app will enable a logged-in instance of the service that's accessible to Claude, enabling users to send Slack messages, generate charts, or access cloud files, depending on which apps have been enabled.

“Analyzing data, designing content, and managing projects all work better with a dedicated visual interface,” Anthropic said in a blog post announcing the feature. “Combined with Claude's intelligence, you can work and iterate faster than either could offer alone.”

The new feature is available to Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise subscribers, but not free users. Eligible users can activate the tools at claude.ai/directory.

The system is similar to OpenAI's Apps system, which launched in October and also enables interactive third-party tools. Both systems of app integrations are built on the Model Context Protocol, an open standard introduced by Anthropic in 2024. MCP launched support for apps in November, drawing on work from both companies.

The new apps will be particularly powerful when integrated with Claude Cowork, an all-purpose agent tool launched by Anthropic last week. Built on top of Claude Code, Cowork lets users assign multi-stage tasks that draw on large and open-ended datasets — tasks that would have previously required terminal commands. Combined with the new apps feature, Cowork could be granted access to cloud files or ongoing work projects. For example, Cowork could update a marketing graphic in Figma or use new data from the company's Box instance. 

Apps are not available in Cowork at launch, but Anthropic said the integration would be “coming soon.”

Agentic systems can be unpredictable, and Anthropic's own safety documentation for Cowork encourages users to monitor the agent closely and not grant any unnecessary permissions.

“Be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records,” the company recommends. “Consider creating a dedicated working folder for Claude rather than granting broad access.”

Skylight, a TikTok alternative built on open source technology, is benefiting from concerns that arose over TikTok U.S.'s change in ownership last week. The startup, a maker of a short-form, vertical video app similar to TikTok, says it has now topped over 380,000 users and is continuing to grow after a busy weekend.

Launched last year and backed by Mark Cuban and other investors, Skylight's mobile app is built on the AT Protocol, the technology that also powers the decentralized X rival, Bluesky, which now has north of 42 million users. 

Skylight, co-founded by CEO Tori White and CTO Reed Harmeyer, offers a built-in video editor, user profiles, support for likes, commenting, and sharing, and the ability for community curators to create custom feeds for others to follow.

The app now has over 150,000 videos uploaded directly to the platform. It can also stream videos from Bluesky because of its AT Protocol integration. 

Harmeyer said Saturday that 1.4 million videos were played on the app the day before, up 3x over the past 24 hours. The app had also seen signups increase more than 150%. Other noteworthy stats include over a 50% increase in returning users, over 40% rise in video played on average, and over 100% increase in posts created.

This surge was likely triggered by concerns over TikTok's change in ownership and its unfortunately timed technical glitches. 

TikTok had announced on January 22 the establishment of the TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC, designed to comply with Trump's executive order requiring the company's U.S. operations be sold to a group of American investors. TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance will now own less than 20% of the new entity.

The deal was a result of increased tensions between the U.S. and China, which led to concerns that TikTok could be a threat to national security, both by collecting data on U.S. citizens and through algorithmic influence. Now, however, some of TikTok's users are more worried about the new American investors and their allegiance to Trump. 

Those concerns grew to a head when TikTok pushed out an updated privacy policy, which includes permission to track users' GPS coordinates, among other things. Users also pointed to language in the privacy policy that said the app would track immigration status. Although that language was not new, and its inclusion has to do with adherence to state privacy laws, some users began encouraging people to delete the app. 

While it's unknown how many TikTok users actually followed through, what is clear is that some people sought out alternatives. Over the weekend, Skylight's CEO Tori White said the app added around 20,000 new users and is continuing to grow. So far this January, the app has seen around 95,000 monthly active users. 

White credited the app's more open and customizable nature as the force behind its growth. 

While Skylight has made notable gains, it's still overshadowed by TikTok and its 200 million monthly active U.S. users. Still, Skylight's founders believe their approach provides an opening for growth. 

“We've seen what happens when one person dictates what's pushed into people's feeds,” White told TechCrunch. “Not only does it harm a creator's connection with their followers, but the entire health of the platform. That's why we built Skylight Social on open standards. We wanted creator and user power to be guaranteed by the technology. Not an empty promise, but an irrevocable right.”

Nvidia said on Monday it has invested $2 billion in CoreWeave to hasten the data center company's efforts to add more than 5 gigawatts of AI computing capacity by 2030.

The chipmaker, already an investor in CoreWeave, said it had bought the company's Class A shares at $87.20 per share. As part of the deal, CoreWeave and Nvidia plan to together build “AI factories” (data centers) that would use the chipmaker's products. 

CoreWeave will also integrate Nvidia's products across its platform, including the new Rubin chip architecture (set to replace the current Blackwell architecture), Bluefield storage systems, as well as the chipmaker's new CPU line, Vera. 

The deal is a strong show of support for CoreWeave, which has come under scrutiny over the past few months for raising billions in debt to continue building out its data center operations. The company had $18.81 billion in debt obligations as of September 2025, according to PitchBook data, and it reported revenue of $1.36 billion in the third quarter.

The company's CEO Michael Intrator has defended its business model (funding operations by raising debt with its GPUs as collateral), and has addressed concerns of circular deals in the AI industry by saying companies have to “work together” to address a “violent change in supply and demand.”

The company has managed to successfully ride the AI wave since its transition from a crypto mining company to a provider of data center services for AI training and inference. And since its IPO in March last year, it has been busy fleshing out its technology stack with a slew of acquisitions. It acquired Weights & Biases, an AI developer platform, in March, and then soon after bought reinforcement learning startup OpenPipe. In October, it agreed to acquire Marimo (an open source Jupyter notebook competitor) and Monolith, another AI company. It also recently expanded its cloud partnership with OpenAI.

The company currently counts several hyperscalers as customers, including OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft.  

As part of the deal, Nvidia will also help CoreWeave buy land and power for data centers, and work with the smaller company to include its AI software and architecture within Nvidia's reference architecture to sell to cloud businesses and enterprises. 

CoreWeave's shares were up more than 15% following news of the deal.

For Nvidia, arguably the biggest benefactor and driver of the AI boom, the deal is the latest of several dozen investments in the past year as the company does its best to continue fueling the precipitous pace of investment in, and development of, the nascent technology.

In that example I saw this in the console:    before - 2.41+26.29+24.87+71.28+59.2+77.57 - 261.62kb
    after  - 2.45+22.4 +22.66+60.6+51.99+77.57 - 237.67kb

So roughly a ~10% compression improvement, neat!

Also note that lightweight encodings are built into the format, and different tiles can even be encoded in a completely different way. So you have to use heuristics to find the best combination of encodings and often you need to make a trade off between tile size and decoding performance. It is still early days for MLT, but all this means there are a lot of possibilities for optimization. In fact, AWS is again financing work on MLT this year, with a focus on optimization.Lastly, when benchmarking tile size, it is good to look at actual usage patterns instead of size of the total tile set. Nobody is zooming into a random spot in the ocean, for example. ;-)

What makes it modern are the ideas behind it: the column-oriented layout, support for lightweight encodings such as FSST and FastPFOR and support for pre-tessellation. Also, enabling doing more computations on the GPU instead of the CPU, which are made possible thanks to modern graphics APIs like Vulkan and Metal. I agree that it is better to be specific about these things (if that is your gripe with it), but there's only so many characters that fit into a title. ;)

2) It's an optimization/advancement. There are some pain points in the older version that 10 years of experience can fix in a newer format.3) Attention, funding. Technically, they're at the leading edge of open source.

What were the major pain points? Compression ratio and speed seem like two of them. (Thanks for answering the elementary questions.)

Everything else pretty much derives from this, e.g. yeah, OSM did not suddenly go all in on former mapbox stuff only because the company started keeping updates behind a paywall, OSM continues to be as tool-agnostic as ever.

It's the easiest way to escape from web mercator projections with no real downsides that I have discovered yet. Also, there is a built-in control if you want to offer a button to toggle between web mercator view, and globe view, since it's all just rendering changes.

reply

I think Apple Maps has a pretty reasonable compromise here of transitioning from a globe to Mercator as you zoom, but this is a less nice UI with a mouse as you need to click to rotate the globe instead of pointing and zooming only. I don't think there's anything in this data that would make that unachievable – you just need to reproject the vector data a bit as you zoom out – but it takes some tricky mathematics to get right and so hasn't been done yet.

Web Mercator != Mercator.I suggest most people on this thread need to go away ask the question ""What's the difference between Web Mercator and Mercator"".

There is a whole science behind map projections and Google ignored it entirely when they created Web Mercator, which was a hack to divide the world into a quad tree. It was vaguely clever and utterly stupid at the same time.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20140607003201/http://earth-info...

According to The Register, the company achieves this by using a larger matrix and a much higher clock speed.

“On chip, there is a single photonic sensor that is 1,000 by 1,000 in size,” Neurophos CEO Patrick Bowen told the publication. This is about 15 times larger than the usual 256 x 256 matrix used in most AI GPUs. Despite that, the company was able to make its optical transistor around 10,000 times smaller than what's currently available. “The equivalent of the optical transistor that you get from Silicon Photonics factories today is massive. It's like 2 mm long,” Bowen added. “You just can't fit enough of them on a chip in order to get a compute density that remotely competes with digital CMOS today.”

The company's first-generation accelerator will have ""the optical equivalent"" of one tensor core, at around 25 square mm in size. This pales in comparison with Nvidia's Vera Rubin chip, which is reported to have 576 tensor cores, but the difference is how Neurophos is using the photonic die. But aside from its larger 1,000 x 1,000 Matrix tile size, the startup's first OPU, which it calls the Tulkas T100, will operate at a cool 56 GHz — much higher than the 9.1 GHz world record achieved on an Intel Core i9-14900KF and the 2.6 GHz boost clock on the Nvidia RTX Pro 6000. This allows it to beat Nvidia's AI GPUs despite appearing to be underpowered on paper.

More importantly, Bowen says that it built its optical transistors using current semiconductor fabrication technologies, so it could potentially tap fabs like Intel or TSMC to mass produce them. Nevertheless, the chips are still in the testing phase and are not expected to enter volume production until 2028. It also needs to address challenges, like the need for massive amounts of vector processing units and static memory (SRAM).

Photonics is a new frontier that many companies are paying attention to. Nvidia already uses Spectrum-X Ethernet photonics switch systems in its Rubin platform, while AMD is set to develop a $280 million hub, specifically geared toward researching silicon photonics. Either way, it appears that this latest development is just a new wrinkle on the photonics frontier, and we should expect many more developments to come as the technology matures.

It may be a grim time for building a new PC due to the ever-growing expense of RAM kits, SSDs, and graphics cards, but that makes it super important to look after what you've already got and keep your PC maintained and in tip-top condition. Apart from the normal tasks of cleaning out your case's dust filters, don't forget to replace the aging thermal paste on your CPU or GPU if everything starts to run a little hotter. Dropping to its lowest-ever price on Amazon, Arctic's MX-6 thermal paste (4g) is now only $5.99, down $6 from its previous $11.99 price tag. Checking the Amazon price checker CamelCamelCamel, we can see that this new $5.99 price point is an all-time low for this product.

Arctic's MX-6 thermal paste is a very popular choice for enthusiasts looking to add a premium cooling solution to their very important CPUs and GPUs. Thermal paste provides a way of getting a good thermal contact between the integrated heat spreader (IHS) of the processor and the cold plate of your cooler. A lot of coolers come with a default paste already applied, but this isn't always the best option, and temperatures of CPU operations can be improved with more heat-conductive thermal paste options.

Keep your CPU running at peak performance with an application of Arctic's MX-6 thermal paste between your CPU and chosen cooling option. Coming in a syringe applicator, it's super simple to apply the thermal paste to your CPU. 

There is a new Arctic MX-7 thermal paste available, and it boasts better performance, but it's also a fair bit more expensive than this deal. Also, this particular product is available directly from Arctic via Amazon, and not a third-party reseller, so you avoid possible forgeries.

We haven't reviewed Arctic's MX-6 thermal paste, but we have tested the previous MX-4 and MX-5 products, and they both appeared high up in the benchmarking charts. Arctic's MX-6 thermal paste is our recommended pick for runner-up in the best premium thermal pastes, with Thermal Grizzly Duronaut being the top pick. The price of the Thermal Grizzly Duronaut (6g) is $19.99, which gives you an idea of how good the price on this Arctic MX-6 really is.

In patients with obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) but not diabetes, berberine was safe but did not reduce visceral adipose tissue or liver fat. 

“Despite its neutral effect on adiposity in our study, berberine produced modest reductions in key atherogenic lipids (LDL-C, apoB) and systemic inflammation (hs-CRP). These findings are promising for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and extend prior evidence of the cardiometabolic benefits of berberine to diabetes-free individuals with obesity and MASLD, an understudied population with a metabolic high risk,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Lubi Lei of Fuwai Hospital, National Center for Cardiovascular Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing. It was published online on January 16, 2026, in JAMA Network Open.

Study limitations included a small proportion (4.4%) of missing measurements for liver fat content due to uninterpretable images. Also, the results of the secondary and exploratory analyses on LDL-C, apoB, and hs-CRP, as well as subgroup analysis of hs-CRP, were presented without adjustment for multiplicity and should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects

Patient perspectives about a palliative care outreach intervention for adults experiencing homelessness are overwhelmingly positive, according to a qualitative, descriptive study of the Palliative Education and Care for the Homeless (PEACH) program in Toronto.

“While previous research suggests persons experiencing homelessness emphasize symptom management needs at the end of life, our findings also underscored unmet primary care, medical supply, and psychiatric needs,” wrote lead author Alexander R. Levesque, MD, of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto, and coauthors.

PEACH is a mobile-, street-, and shelter-based program with a team of palliative care physicians, psychiatrists, social workers, and nurses working with people experiencing homelessness across Toronto. The team collaborates with health and social service organizations to deliver palliative and psychiatric medical care, help secure housing, cover healthcare and medication gaps, and connect patients with publicly funded home healthcare supports. 

The data were published January 15 in JAMA Network Open. 

The researchers recruited 14 program participants (12 males and two females) with terminal conditions, most of whom lived in shelters or social housing and had been referred to the program by physicians. Participants' ages ranged between 20 and 70 years, and their duration of contact with PEACH ranged from 3 to 69 months (mean duration, 18 months) before the study. 

Using a descriptive, qualitative framework, the researchers conducted semistructured, one-on-one interviews to understand participants' experiences. Interviews were conducted in person when possible or by phone between May 1, 2023, and November 30, 2024. The major themes that emerged were life before PEACH, outreach and community care, medical needs, social needs, relational care, and constructive feedback.

These interviews elicited mainly positive feedback about the program, “with many participants crediting the intervention with improving, and in some cases, saving their lives,” noted the authors, many of whom were somehow connected with the PEACH program.

“The thing that surprised us most was that everyone we interviewed kept coming back to the relational care part of PEACH,” Levesque told Medscape News Canada. “We thought that many clients would emphasize how the PEACH team helped with things like pain control, mental health needs, or housing, so it was surprising that most clients felt that the thing that really set the PEACH team apart was the compassionate, holistic approach they took to providing care.” 

“All participants described severe hardships before PEACH, including homelessness, incarceration, serious illness, bereavement, and trauma,” noted the authors. Before PEACH, most participants had systemic healthcare barriers, including long waits, limited access to medications, dismissive treatment, and stigmatization, they added.

Participants described PEACH as having “a low-barrier referral process, often initiated by allied health professionals or case workers,” wrote the authors. They also highlighted the value of receiving medical care in their community setting, “addressing challenges related to mobility, disability, finances, and navigating healthcare spaces.”

In terms of medical needs, many participants felt PEACH addressed severe symptoms such as pain and psychiatric needs that had gone untreated because of systemic barriers and stigma. Harm reduction was also mentioned in terms of the encouragement of safer and reduced substance use.

Moreover, many participants stated that PEACH helped them with social needs such as financial questions, housing, and nutrition.

Finally, all participants mentioned relational care, referring to the program's overall approach, said Levesque. “One of the main aspects of relational care highlighted by respondents was the PEACH program's compassionate, holistic approach. Respondents described the PEACH team as being warm, approachable, and caring, and contrasted that with their past experiences with the healthcare system where they often felt people were impersonal and not interested in forming trusting relationships with them.” 

One of the important findings was participants' appreciation for having their psychosocial and palliative care needs met at the same time, said Levesque. “We think that this lesson could apply to any type of outreach team: being prepared to provide care and services outside what may be expected to meet the needs of this population,” he added. “We hope that our results will be informative to other current and future palliative care outreach teams, as well as outreach teams more broadly.” 

Commenting on the study for Medscape News Canada, Devora Keller, MD, MPH, director of clinical services and program operations for the National Health Care for the Homeless Council in Nashville, Tennessee, said the study “gives voice and visibility to a marginalized population that is often overlooked: individuals experiencing homelessness with serious and life-limiting illnesses.” Keller was not involved with the research. 

“It also raises awareness about the impact of a life-sustaining and dignity-enhancing care model that exists only in a few places in North America, while providing an intimate look into individuals' personal experiences in accessing services and navigating serious illness,” she added.

“I hope that having insight and understanding into how palliative care outreach teams directly enhance care for individuals experiencing homeless by hearing their reflections will encourage others to duplicate this model of care to support individuals within their own communities.” 

As a clinician who has worked closely with a street-outreach-based palliative care team in San Francisco, Keller said that the themes “resonated with my clinical experiences and the reflections of my own patients. The detailed accounts about the important role that these teams play in care navigation and care coordination underscore the immense challenges that people experiencing homelessness face in navigating critical illness and end-of-life care. The PEACH team's relationship-based, person-focused care and programmatic emphasis on both medical and psychosocial needs provides a critical template for programs considering developing a palliative care street outreach program.”

Funding for the study was not reported. Levesque reported receiving grants from the Canadian Institute of Health Research Canada Graduate Scholarship Master's program outside the submitted work. Keller reported no relevant financial relationships.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","Road to World Cup 2026: USMNT's Five Best Players of the Week—Ranked","https://www.si.com/soccer/road-to-world-cup-2026-usmnt-s-five-best-players-of-the-week-ranked-1-26-26","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:23:14 GMT","

The penultimate week of January saw intense weather cast a cold and snowy shadow over much of the continental United States, even as U.S. men's national team players saw their form heat up across Europe. 

While MLS clubs took on preseason challenges in warmer destinations, plenty of American players had strong weeks in European action, taking starring roles in promotion battles, the Champions League and more. 

With such consistent performances unfolding each week, USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino's decisions for a March roster and World Cup squad have become even more challenging—no doubt, though, a welcome problem to have. 

Here, Sports Illustrated ranks the top five performances of the week from American players across the globe. 

There is a very realistic scenario that Aidan Morris cracks the USMNT roster for the World Cup and will be looking ahead to a Premier League debut season by the tournament's end. 

While the 24-year-old former Columbus Crew academy product may not be putting up flashy attacking numbers—he has no goals and two assists in 23 matches with English Championship side Middlesbrough—he has been one of the most consistent players in the league. 

This week saw him continue to thrive in a midfield pivot alongside 23-year-old English midfielder Hayden Hackney, where he finished all 33 of his attempted passes through a 61-minute showing in a 4–0 win over Preston North End. 

Middlesbrough now sit second in the Championship in an automatic qualification spot and just three points behind table-topping Coventry City. 

The USMNT's center back pool has immense depth and Mark McKenzie is making his case to start in the likely back three at the World Cup with his recent form in Ligue 1 with Toulouse. 

This season, the 26-year-old has played 19 games, including his current streak of eight straight 90-minute performances across Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France. He is playing on the right side of a back three, a role that could be transferable to Pochettino's setup. 

While continuing to stand out defensively this weekend, McKenzie helped Toulouse to a 2–0 win over Brest on Sunday, chipping in with an assist on Pape Demba Diop's opening goal, while ending the 90-minute shift with seven clearances and eight recoveries. 

One of the most important players to the USMNT ahead of the World Cup, Chris Richards scored in his 100th appearance for Crystal Palace in a 3–1 loss to Chelsea in Sunday's Premier League action. 

While the result saw the Eagles fall to 15th in the table, it was another solid performance from the American central defender as his club enters the final chapter of the Oliver Glasner managerial era. In addition to his first goal of the season, Richards made five defensive contributions and continued to grow into his left center back role. 

Next week, he and Crystal Palace look to snap an 11-game winless streak across all competitions when they take on 17th-place Nottingham Forest. 

Johnny Cardoso's efforts have started to pay off in more consistent performances with Atlético Madrid and this week saw the 24-year-old play 72 minutes in a 3–0 win over Mallorca, a side battling relegation. 

After arriving from Real Betis in the summer, Cardoso had struggled to integrate himself into Diego Simeone's setup at the beginning of the season, but he has now started three of the team's last four matches.  

Against Mallorca, the midfielder had 54 touches and six defensive contributions in a midfield pairing alongside 22-year-old Spanish midfielder Pablo Barrios. Cardoso didn't get on the scoresheet, but he  had five passes into the final third and completed three long passes, according to FotMob. 

That consistent showing came off another promising performance in midweek, as he did not misplace a pass in a 34-minute substitute appearance in Champions League action against Galatasaray.

Pochettino has a crowded player pool of American midfielders, but consistent minutes and strong showings from Cardoso should see him in the March camp and likely in the World Cup squad. 

Since Luciano Spalletti took over as Juventus manager on Oct. 30, 2025, Weston McKennie's stock and form has only risen, and this week was no different across Champions League and Serie A action. 

In the Bianconeri's midweek win over Benfica, he played one of his best games of the season, scoring his fifth goal of the campaign across all competitions while also creating two chances and chipping in with two recoveries in a right midfield role. 

The win lifted Juventus to 12 points through seven Champions League league phase matches, putting them 15th in the table as they enter the final matchday against fellow American Folarin Balogun and Monaco.

The 27-year-old native of Little Elm, Texas followed his thrilling midweek performance with another strong showing in a 3–0 victory over Napoli on Sunday, where he took on a more attacking role and helped lead his team's frontline, which saw goals from Jonathan David, Kenan Yıldız and Filip Kostić. 

Beaming with form and versatility, McKennie could prove to be one of the most important players this summer, despite once looking like a potential rotational player in Pochettino's setup.

Former United States goalkeeper Brad Friedel believes it is too early for Christian Pulisic to consider joining the MLS, claiming it would be a poor decision for both parties.

Pulisic has not played club football in his native country, starting his professional career with Borussia Dortmund before representing Chelsea and AC Milan.

Since he joined Milan ahead of the 2023-24 season, only Lautaro Martinez (58) has directly contributed to more goals than Pulisic (50 – 31 goals, 19 assists) in Serie A.

The 27-year-old will be hoping to lead the USMNT at their home World Cup this summer, where they will face Paraguay, Australia and a qualifier in the group stage.

Pulisic stated his desire to one day play in MLS, but Friedel insisted that it is not a move he should consider in the near future.

""In the future, yes,"" Friedel told GOAL if he wants to see Pulisic in MLS.

""It's like this – just from a U.S. fan standpoint, I want as many of the best players for the national team playing at the highest level of competition they can, because that will make sure that the national team competes stronger against the world's elite.

""I like it when players don't know when their next contract is coming, they always have the next young player pushing to take their spot, they have to always get better. 

""If somebody came in like your Weston McKennie and your Christian Pulisic, they would have so much power at an MLS club, I would worry that they wouldn't be focused on just getting better.

""Eventually I would love to see Christian and Weston and Tyler [Adams] come back and all these guys finish their careers in MLS. That would be great. But in the peak of their career, I don't think MLS is there yet.""

USMNT Star's Potential Christian Pulisic-Type Leap Comes With a Risk

Fulham have reportedly made a bid to bring U.S. men's national team striker Ricardo Pepi to the Premier League despite his serious arm injury.

Pepi got 2025–26 off to a scintillating start, scoring 11 goals in 22 appearances for PSV Eindhoven. The 23-year-old then broke his arm in January and been on the long road to recovery since—a process that is expected to take two months. 

The injury was not enough for Fulham to deter their interest in the American forward. According to ESPN, the Cottagers submitted a €32 million ($38 million) offer for Pepi's services.

The English outfit previously saw its €28 million ($33.3 million) bid rejected by PSV back in December. The reigning Dutch champions are thought to be looking for around €35 million ($41.6 million) for their attacker, who joined the club in 2023.

While many American stars are currently making a name for themselves throughout Europe, so few players of the current generation have impressed in the Premier League apart from Christian Pulisic. The USMNT captain bid farewell to Borussia Dortmund and joined Chelsea ahead of the 2019–20 season and went on to make history.

Pulisic made 145 appearances in his four seasons at Stamford Bridge, scoring 26 goals along the way. The winger won three trophies with Chelsea, including the 2020–21 Champions League title, a piece of silverware that came with a place in the competition's record books —Pulisic became the first American player to ever play in a Champions League final, and only the second to lift the trophy after Jovan Kirovski.

His time in a blue shirt was not always so blissful as that night at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto, Portugal. Recurring fitness struggles, inconsistent minutes and a carousel of managers and attacking personnel marred Pulisic's days at Chelsea, so much so that he eventually transferred to AC Milan ahead of the 2023–24 season.

Still, Pulisic—and now Antonee Robinson and Chris Richards—proved today's crop of impressive Americans can thrive in what is considered the most competitive league in the world, laying the groundwork for someone like Pepi to try and replicate their successes.

Should PSV and Fulham come to an agreement before the January transfer window closes for Pepi, the No. 9 is gambling big with his future. After all, prior to his injury, he was in the form of his life in the Netherlands, undoubtedly gaining the attention of USMNT boss Mauricio Pochettino. 

A move to the Premier League takes most players time to adjust, especially ones working their way back to full match fitness. Returning to play for a new team in a much more difficult league after so much time on the sidelines is a massive challenge, one that could ultimately harm Pepi's chances of logging consistent minutes at this summer's 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

Just look at what happened to Gio Reyna—the midfielder was regarded as one of the most exciting American talents, and between injuries and a horrible stint at Nottingham Forest, he saw his place in the Stars and Stripes' squad almost completely disappear. 

Transferring to the Premier League five months before the World Cup is a risk for Pepi, who was looking like a surefire option to at minimum serve as Folarin Balogun's backup next summer. A failure to return to his goalscoring form and play consistent minutes at Fulham could incite Pochettino to look at other options, leaving Pepi as nothing more than an afterthought in the biggest tournament of his career.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","USWNT Abroad: Phallon Tullis-Joyce shines as Man United climb WSL table, Sam Coffey debuts for Man City","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/uswnt-abroad-sam-coffey-phallon-tullis-joyce-six-saves-americans-man-city-man-utd-/blt81703c8247327b83","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:57:00 GMT","

GOAL breaks down the key moments from USWNT players abroad, including a dominant performance from Tullis-Joyce for Manchester United.

As the U.S. Women's National Team cruised to a 6-0 win over Paraguay on Saturday in sunny Los Angeles, several key members of Emma Hayes' wider player pool were busy competing overseas. With January camp overlapping a FIFA competition window, the USWNT roster was made up exclusively of NWSL-based players, leaving many of the program's European contingent to continue their club seasons abroad.

In England, the Women's Super League title race remained tightly packed, with Americans on both sides of a marquee matchup between Chelsea and Arsenal. USWNT forward Alyssa Thompson and center back Naomi Girma featured for Chelsea against Arsenal defender Emily Fox, as the Blues hosted the Gunners in a match with major implications at the top of the table. Despite Chelsea generating chances, Arsenal came away with a 2-0 victory, powered by a standout performance from Beth Mead.

The result tightened the race behind league leaders Manchester City, who maintained their grip on first place over the weekend. City also welcomed a new American into the fold, as USWNT midfielder Sam Coffey made her debut after completing a January move. Coffey came on late in City's 2-1 win over London City Lionesses, helping see out the result as City extended their lead atop the WSL standings.

Elsewhere in England, goalkeeper Phallon Tullis-Joyce continued her strong run of form for Manchester United, playing a key role in a 4-1 win over Aston Villa. In France, young midfielder Lily Yohannes and veteran Lindsey Heaps were both involved as OL Lyonnes rolled to a 5-1 victory over Marseille in the Coupe de France Féminine.

From Thompson's duel with Fox to Coffey's first minutes in Manchester and another steady outing from Tullis-Joyce, GOAL takes a closer look at how USWNT players fared across Europe over the weekend.

It wasn't just an off day for Alyssa Thompson, who repeatedly found herself in promising positions in front of goal - Chelsea simply couldn't make their chances count. Hosting Arsenal, the Blues had an opportunity to close the gap on league leaders Manchester City, but defeat instead left their title hopes facing a steeper climb.

Arsenal, meanwhile, arrived at Kingsmeadow without a road win over Chelsea since 2018, making the result all the more surprising. The opening half was cagey, with Chelsea struggling to convert possession into clear looks in the final third, while Arsenal proved more clinical when their chances arrived.

Thompson, who has four league goals this season, entered the match firmly on Arsenal head coach Renée Slegers' radar as one of Chelsea's primary attacking threats.

“She's a really, really good player,” Slegers said ahead of the match. “She's made a great impact for Chelsea and really shown herself in the WSL, so we'll have to look out for her.”

Despite a lively start, Thompson was ultimately limited to only a handful of chances in a match that may have turned on a single decisive touch in the box.

Coffey's dream was to play abroad, and it became a reality over the weekend when she suited up for Manchester City for the very first time. Coffey, a staple midfielder on the USWNT squad made headlines when she left Portland Thorns FC in the NWSL, inking a deal with Man City Women through 2029. 

Over the weekend, Coffey didn't earn a start, but came on in the second half at the 76th minute for Man City, helping them go nine points clear of Chelsea in the WSL, in their 2-1 result at London City.

“[Manchester City] is a club with so much history, so much success, so much influence in the city,"" Coffey said after her signing. ""Manchester is not somewhere I've been before, but there's something about it that I felt I was led to and called to. I think it's also a place that has proven its investment in women's soccer and being a part of this movement that is going on. Seeing the facilities, the support the team gets, and all the efforts they are putting in for the women's side is such a huge and positive side and something I'm honoured to be a part of.”

Coffey is now part of a top-table team, Man City, who lead the WSL with 36 points in 12 wins. 

Tullis-Joyce turned in another strong performance over the weekend, making six saves as Manchester United rolled past Aston Villa 4–1 in WSL play. The win lifted United into fourth place in the table on 25 points, just one behind Arsenal.

The USWNT goalkeeper has enjoyed a standout season for United, tallying 31 saves and four clean sheets as she continues to establish herself as a reliable presence at the club level. While Tullis-Joyce hasn't appeared for the U.S. since April 2025, her performances for Hayes' side during that stretch were enough to firmly place her among the top goalkeepers in the current pool.

“I feel strongly about Claudia [Dickey] and Phallon [Tullis-Joyce] at this time,” Hayes said ahead of the USWNT's friendlies against Paraguay and Chile, when asked about the goalkeeper picture.

Fox was injured last weekend, so there wasn't clarity whether she'd be fit for the weekend match against Chelsea. To the Gunners' benefit, Fox was healthy and sharp coming out and keeping the Blues scoreless. 

Fox helped Arsenal defeat Chelsea on the road, 2-0, and in the second half made a critical cross that was just short of her teammates to finish, and forced Chelsea goalkeeper Hampton to step up big, with just 15 minutes left of the game. 

Fox has been a stalwart for Arsenal this season and will lace up to face Leicester City on Sunday. ","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The U.S. is expecting at least 5 million international visitors, not to mention the millions of soccer fans at home, to be on the move during the six-week tournament

From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing. Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.

At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.

The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.

More than half a billion ticket requests have been made for World Cup 2026 games, which will be hosted by cities across the United States, Canada and Mexico, FIFA reported this month.

The U.S. is expecting more than 5 million international visitors, not to mention the tens of thousands of soccer fans here at home, who will not only pack stadiums but also flood fan zones from coast to coast, including in New York, Los Angeles, Kansas City and Atlanta, over the six-week tournament, which kicks off on June 11.

This once-in-a-generation opportunity also brings a nationwide, multifaceted rollout of security measures to prepare for potential threats ranging from drone incursions to cyberattacks. 

However, some human rights advocates have expressed fears that the Trump administration will use law enforcement operations around the World Cup to target migrants as part of the White House's aggressive deportation policy. 

“Under the Trump administration's policies, immigration enforcement at major sporting events can tear families apart and could expose people fleeing persecution to life-threatening danger,” Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. 

And there is also trepidation from fans traveling from abroad after the Trump administration broadened its visa ban to 75 countries. 

Despite announcing the FIFA Priority Appointment Schedule System, or FIFA PASS, which will expedite visa processing for individuals cleared by the Department of State, FIFA fans from around the world are still questioning whether or not they'll be allowed to enter and travel within the U.S. without federal harassment, according to the BBC. 

The Department of Homeland Security announced earlier this month that it plans to invest $115 million in counter-drone technologies to protect World Cup games, and also events celebrating the country's 250th anniversary this year.

The funds will be managed by a new DHS office that will focus on buying and deploying drone and counter-drone tech.

“Drones represent the new frontier of American air superiority,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement.

FEMA, which is under the umbrella of DHS, said in December that it had allocated $350 million to the 11 states hosting World Cup matches. That money is earmarked for the purchase of counter-drone tech. 

While most drones are more disruptive than they are overtly dangerous — though there have been cases of falling devices causing serious injury to people on the ground — the war in Ukraine has proven that even relatively inexpensive, commercially available racing drones, outfitted with explosives, can be used as potent weapons. 

U.S. officials reportedly see the potential threat of a drone attack as more than a fringe possibility. 

Last week, leaders from the military, law enforcement, and local governments gathered to participate in ""tabletop exercises overwhelmingly focused"" on drone attacks at World Cup events, where large numbers of people will be gathered in places at predetermined times.

Politico reported about the war games that local and state law enforcement agencies in the U.S. have been “encouraged to purchase equipment that can jam inbound drones or redirect them to their origin,"" and to seek reimbursement for their purchases through a $500 million federal grant program. 

The World Cup is larger than it has ever been. In all, 48 teams are competing in more than a dozen cities across three North American countries. Like the rest of the world, the World Cup relies more on automated systems and digital technologies today than it ever has in the past. 

That means that cyberthreats are more of risk factor than ever before. 

""The more we build out these things and automate and scale larger — more days, more games, more teams — the more we have to find a way to do that efficiently, and they're not scaling out the human labor force to do it,"" Chris Grove, director of cybersecurity strategy for Nozomi Networks, a provider of cybersecurity for operational technology told Dark Reading, a cybersecurity news site.

""They're building with technologies and processes and things, automated ticketing access controls, and being able to do a lot more with less."" 

Digital threats aren't just a theorized vector for malicious behavior; there is precedent. Following the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, analysts found a router that had been compromised and could have been used to disrupt communications during the games, including all streaming services carrying the events. 

In 2024, the Olympic Games in Paris were subject to at least 140 cyberattacks, but thanks to French preparation, there were no outages to the games, according to Dark Reading.

Grove warned that this year, as a result of heightened political polarization in the U.S., there will likely be an increased likelihood of ""hacktivists"" targeting the World Cup to make statements. 

""I think there's more potential and concern for disruption around hacktivists this time around than four years ago,"" he says. ""Four years ago was just a different political and social landscape."" 

Donald Lane, a former Secret Service agent, told the U.S. Sun that while physically attacking an event has become more difficult thanks to increased surveillance and threat-detection technology, malicious actors have found plenty of vulnerabilities through the use of remote access. 

“Bad actors are realizing they can cause a lot of destruction by accessing these things remotely, which can be just as devastating as a physical attack,"" he told the outlet. 

Targeting systems that manage electricity, gas, and water are all possible options for potential bad actors. 

Little information has been released about the specific steps to ramp up cybersecurity ahead of the World Cup but a House Committee task force — focused on the World Cup and 250th anniversary celebrations — has indicated that it is among the chief areas of concern.

Last summer, Andrew Giuliani, who is leading the White House Task Force on the World Cup, announced that the federal government was pouring more than a billion dollars into security for the tournament, calling it ""one of the largest commitments of safety resources ever made for a single event."" 

 ""This includes $625 million through the FIFA World Cup Grant Program and is directed to support law enforcement, supporting everything from training and exercises to cybersecurity and emergency response,' he said. 

Securing the physical locations of games will fall largely to a combined force of federal, state and local law enforcement. 

Kansas City has already started its preparations, naming Kyle Postell, as the city's director of safety & security. Postell is a former Secret Service agent and will oversee security preparations alongside local law enforcement. 

World Cup hosting cities will likely see increased police presence, controlled traffic corridors, and the presence of state and federal law enforcement as has been seen before during major events like the Super Bowl. 

After a New Year's Day vehicle attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people in 2025, police used reinforced “drop and stop” metal barriers ahead of the Super Bowl in the city. 

The barriers used in New Orleans advertise the ability to stop a 2,430 pound (1102 kg) vehicle moving at 30 miles per hour (48 kph) without the need for an anchor. 

Cities across the U.S. have been investing in similar barriers since the New Year's Day attack. West Palm Beach spent $800,000 in 2025 to protect its pedestrian-heavy downtown events, according to WPTV. San Antonio did the same in 2025, but used two-ton stone barriers to block vehicle entry to its Market Square, News 4 San Antonio reports.

In addition to securing the actual venues, the U.S. is also preparing for non-American travelers who come from cultures where public transportation is more the norm. Giuliani said that the federal government is working with public and private partners to ensure foreign visitors have safe and reliable transportation to and from events.

""The Department of Transportation is very aware that Americans travel differently from Europeans and South Americans, and we are working shoulder-to-shoulder with FIFA, host cities, airlines, Amtrak, rideshare companies, and public transportation networks to keep fans moving safely and efficiently,"" Giuliani said in December. 

Michael Donnelly, Georgia's TSA federal security director, said officials at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, in host city Atlanta, are preparing for a massive influx of foreign and domestic travelers. 

""It's going to be an extremely, busy time when we have games,"" he told Fox 5 Atlanta. ""So we'll be preparing like every game is a Super Bowl."" 

He said that the TSA would be utilizing unspecified ""new technologies"" to help with screening and expedite wait times as travelers arrive.

The Trump administration's aggressive anti-immigration policy – which has seen nearly 3 million people deported and thousands arrested by masked ICE agents and held in detention centers – appears to have left foreign visitors wondering what welcome awaits them in the U.S. 

In December, Giuliani was asked by reporters if Trump will rule out ICE raids at World Cup games. He said Trump would not. 

“The one thing, and I've known the president for 25 years, the president has not ruled out anything that will make American citizens safer,” he said. 

In January, Lebanese diplomat and FIFA fan Mohamad Safa, announced he'd canceled his World Cup tickets because of the Trump administration's draconian anti-immigration policies. 

“I cancelled my World Cup tickets. The ICE may decide that I am a gang member, and I'll be locked in prison for a year with no charges, no hearing, no trial, no right to consult a lawyer, no phone call,” he wrote in a post on X. “The US is not safe to visit.”

The Department of Homeland Security proposed a rule in January that would expand the personal and social media information travelers are required to provide DHS officials when traveling to the U.S. on the waived visa program. 

The waived visa program applies to citizens of many European countries and other American allies. The DHS proposal means those visitors may be subjected to expanded scrutiny.

If implemented, the new proposal would give Homeland Security the ability to screen travelers' social media posts for any sign of ""anti-American"" sentiment, even if they aren't seeking long-term stays in the U.S. 

Trump has said that he ""can't wait to welcome soccer fans from all over the globe” but has already banned visa applications for visitors from 21 nations including Iran, Brazil, Colombia, and Egypt — which all have teams in the World Cup or competing to qualify for the event. 

While exceptions have been made for World Cup teams, their immediate families, and coaching staff, the same cannot be said of their supporters.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned soccer fans that just because they bought a ticket to a game doesn't mean they're getting into the U.S. “A ticket is not a visa and it doesn't guarantee admission to the U.S.,"" he said. 

Trump's immigration crackdown is a concern for domestic fans as well. In July, an asylum seeker in the U.S. took his children to a Club World Cup soccer tournament final and was arrested by ICE, detained for three months, and was then deported to a country where he felt he could be killed, according to Human Rights Watch. 

In May, two months before the incident, HRW sent a letter to FIFA asking for “immediate action” to address potential risks to fans posed by U.S. immigration policies. 

FIFA responded on June 3 that it “expects … host countries take measures to ensure that any eligible persons who are involved in the Competition are able to enter the respective countries,” and “is actively working on this matter with relevant authorities.”

Liam Rosenior has made his first signing as Chelsea manager since replacing Enzo Maresca at the helm. The 41-year-old has enjoyed a bright start to life at Stamford Bridge, winning four of his first five games in charge of the Blues in all competitions. Rosenior is also working hard on shaping his squad and has added an exciting young talent to the ranks in west London.

Chelsea have won the race to sign Sheffield Wednesday teenager Yisa Alao. The 17-year-old also attracted interest from Manchester United and Liverpool but has opted for Chelsea in a transfer worth around £500,000 plus add-ons. Chelsea confirmed the transfer in a statement on the club's website: ""Chelsea is pleased to announce the signing of Yisa Alao, with the left-back agreeing a contract with the Blues until 2028. The 17-year-old came through Sheffield Wednesday's academy and made his senior debut for the Owls in August. Alao has since played four more games, starting Wednesday's recent FA Cup tie against Brentford and Championship match against Portsmouth. Welcome to Chelsea, Yisa!""

Alao has said his goodbyes to Sheffield Wednesday with a post on social media that read: ""10 years, endless memories, from the staff, to my teammates, to the fans, forever grateful. Thank you Sheffield Wednesday.""

The club's administrators also posted an update regarding his sale: ""The transfer includes a substantial upfront payment, along with further protections to ensure the club benefits should Yisa go on to fulfil the potential he has shown. These include performance-related payments and a significant sell-on arrangement. All financial terms will remain undisclosed.

""Our responsibility is to act in the best long-term interests of Sheffield Wednesday and its creditors. This transfer balances immediate value for the club with protection for the future, should Yisa's career develop as we all hope.""

Alao has only made five senior appearances so far in his career, meaning it may be a while before Chelsea fans see him in the first team. The teenager is expected to start off with the club's under-18 or under-21 squads or even potentially go out on loan in order to continue his development with regular minutes, per The Athletic. Alao is known for being an attack-minded full-back and has come all the way through the academy at Sheffield Wednesday. He made his debut as a 16-year-old against Bolton in the Carabao Cup and also played in the FA Cup this season as Wednesday were beaten by Premier League side Brentford.

Commentary positions drenched as Barcelona's newly-refurbished stadium springs huge leaks in absolute deluge during Oviedo clash","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/video-camp-nou-chaos-commentary-positions-drenched-barcelona-refurbished-stadium-huge-leaks-oviedo/bltafcfdeb48175f387","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 09:10:34 GMT","

There has been more chaos at Camp Nou, with commentary positions and media facilities at Barcelona's newly-renovated stadium getting drenched during a La Liga clash with Real Oviedo. As the heavens opened in Catalonia, those looking to cover the game were given a soaking - with their working conditions becoming almost impossible to operate in.

Barca returned to the top of La Liga when playing host to rock-bottom Oviedo. They toiled for long periods of that contest, with the two sides heading into the interval locked at 0-0. Class eventually shone through on the day.

Dani Olmo fired the Blaugrana in front within 10 minutes of the restart, before Brazilian winger Raphinha quickly added a second as he calmly clipped the ball over Oviedo's onrushing goalkeeper.

Teenage wonderkid Lamine Yamal then proceeded to steal the headlines as he scored an acrobatic volley to put the seal on a 3-0 victory - a result that has lifted Barca back above Clasico rivals Real Madrid in the Spanish top flight.

The game started in relatively calm conditions, but the weather took a turn for the worse before the final whistle blew. Torrential rain pummelled Camp Nou during the closing stages - leading to many fans leaving early.

Those calling the contest for radio and television, alongside those looking to post updates for social media and online publications, had no choice but to see the game out. Their life was made more difficult than it needs to be.

That is because the roof above their heads sprung a serious leak. Laptops and recording equipment were drenched as water tumbled onto seats in the stands. Camp Nou only reopened a couple of months ago after undergoing a serious, and very expensive, facelift.

Barca are taking their overall capacity up to 105,000, but are currently welcoming a little more than 45,000 spectators through the gates. An elaborate project, which has spanned more than two years, is supposed to be completed in June.

Further work will be required on roof structures, with fans comparing Camp Nou in its current state to a “spa”. Barca are not the first club to experience such difficulties, with Premier League giants Manchester United facing leakage problems of their own.

Supporters posted videos of water flowing down steps inside Old Trafford during a meeting with Arsenal in 2024. The Red Devils were able to carry out some quick repairs and have announced plans to construct a new stadium of their own - which could come with a £2 billion ($2.7bn) price tag.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

During the Australian Open, ATPTour.com will bring fans insight into the leaders of key statistical categories, showing how performances throughout 2025 all added up to successful seasons and the promise of more good times ahead in 2026.

Jannik Sinner could do it all in 2025 and the data backs it up. Whether points were decided in a flash or forged through punishing baseline exchanges, the Italian consistently came out on top, showcasing a completeness that defined his season.

Sinner led the Tour by winning 56.9 per cent of rallies lasting 0–4 shots, underlining his ability to strike early and dictate with authority from the first ball. At the other end of the spectrum, he was just as effective when patience was required, topping the Tour by winning 58 per cent of rallies of nine shots or more.

2025 Rallies Won of 0-4 Shots

2025 Rallies Won of 9+ Shots

The numbers illustrate a player comfortable winning points on his own terms. Armed with heavy, precise groundstrokes, Sinner was relentless in extended exchanges, absorbing pressure before turning defence into attack. Yet when opportunities arose to shorten points, he wasted little time, stepping inside the baseline to finish with conviction.

That versatility proved pivotal across a trophy-laden campaign. From first-strike tennis on faster courts to grinding out victories in physical battles, Sinner's adaptability helped separate him from the field and reinforced his status as one of the Tour's most complete operators.

The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings won majors at the Australian Open and Wimbledon, defended his title at the Nitto ATP Finals, lifted an ATP Masters 1000 trophy in Paris and clinched ATP 500 titles in Beijing and Vienna.

Jessica Pegula knocked out defending champion Madison Keys in an all-American fourth round at the Australian Open and will face fellow American Amanda Anisimova for a semifinal spot.

Jessica Pegula brought Madison Keys' title defense to a close Monday at the Australian Open, earning a 6-3, 6-4 win that sets up another all-American Top 10 meeting on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz against Amanda Anisimova in the quarterfinals. 

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Something had to give in the fourth head-to-head meeting between the two Billie Jean King Cup teammates, close friends and The Player's Box podcast co-hosts. Keys, who won her first Grand Slam singles title in Melbourne last year, brought a 10-match winning streak into the contest after three victories this year, while Pegula entered the match 3-0 in Round of 16 appearances at the tournament.

In 1 hour, 18 minutes, the No. 6 seed advanced, improving to 8-2 in Grand Slam fourth-round matches. The 2024 US Open finalist broke Keys' serve four times and neutralized the No. 9 seed's primary weapons, returning more than 70% of her opponent's serves and committing just 13 unforced errors against 14 winners. Keys finished with 28 unforced errors, as Pegula surged to a 6-3, 4-1 lead she never relinquished.

A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen)

""I've been playing really well, seeing the ball really well, hitting the ball really well this whole tournament, and I wanted to stay true to that and lean on a couple of things that I felt like she would do,"" Pegula said afterwards in her on-court interview.

""I felt like I came out doing it pretty well and got a couple of quick points for her early on. When I had that lead, I tried to stick with that lead as much as I could ... and tried to focus on what I needed to do and the patterns to look out for.""

A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen)

The win continued Pegula's strong track record at the Australian Open -- and against fellow Americans. Since a loss to Keys in the Round of 16 at the 2023 US Open, Pegula is 28-3 against her compatriots, including a 13-1 mark over the past 52 weeks.

That run will be tested again in the quarterfinals, where Pegula faces No. 4 seed Anisimova. She defeated China's Wang Xinyu 7-6(4), 6-4 later Monday to reach the last eight, advancing to the quarterfinals or better at all four Grand Slams in her career. She enters the matchup 0-3 against Pegula.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Wang had earlier upset No. 24 seed Jelena Ostapenko and No. 13 seed Linda Noskova, but was unable to add a third seeded win against Anisimova. The first 12 games of the match went with serve before the two-time major finalist took control in the tiebreak, winning four of the final five points, including three winners.

Anisimova was broken only once in the 1-hour, 42-minute victory, coming in her opening service game of the second set after she had converted her fourth break point of the match. She broke again to move ahead 2-1 and was never threatened again, dropping just two points across her final four service games.

""I think the fact that I've been in the Round of 16 three time, and making that step further is pretty special,"" Anisimova said. ""And yeah, I love playing in Australia. So just being here an extra day, an extra match, is exciting.

""I've been honestly enjoying every second out there. I feel like I'm handling, like, the pressure and expectation that I'm trying to not really think about, but I think that just means a lot more to me that I've been able to really handle that well this week.""

She also came from 5-2 down in the second set of her 6-1, 7-5 second-round win over compatriot Ashlyn Krueger.After famously retooling her serve ahead of winning the Australian Open a year ago, Keys said she continued to tinker with her game in her return to Melbourne—a commitment she hopes will serve her now and into the future.""I'm really proud of myself for being very clear-headed and trying to problem-solve, and I think overall there were a lot of really, a lot of positives from this tournament, and some kind of strides forward,"" she said.""I think that I was open to trying new things, open to trying to implement some of the things that we have been working on, and that's not always the easiest thing to do, especially here, just coming back and having that extra layer of pressure.""But for all of those things, I'm super proud of myself for. Then there is a handful of things that I'm going to go back and keep practicing, and I have 11 more months of the year to try to implement them into my game.""

Pegula won a battle of Player's Box podcast co-hosts, dethroning defending champion Keys while defending her favorite dessert.ByDavid KanePublished Jan 26, 2026 copy_link

Published Jan 26, 2026

MELBOURNE, Australia—We knew what was on the line for Madison Keys coming into her Australian Open fourth round with Jessica Pegula—a slice of cheddar apple pie—but Pegula waited for her on-court interview to reveal what had been in store for her had she lost to her good friend on Monday.“I was going to have to wear a Travis Kelce Kansas City Chiefs jersey,” Pegula told CoCo Vandeweghe after a 6-3, 6-4 win over the defending champion. “That definitely gave me extra motivation today.”Pegula and Keys light-heartedly hyped their Round of 16 clash as the first match between two podcast co-hosts—the two share hosting duties with Jennifer Brady and Desirae Krawczyk on *The Player's Box*—but the bet became more serious for the former, whose family has more than a mere emotional stake in the National Football League.

“Yeah that was bad,” Pegula told me when I asked about the bet in her post-match press conference. “[Madi] was, like, ‘Mine's worse.' I was, like, ‘What are you talking about? My family owns the Bills. This team has owned us in the postseason. Absolutely not, by far worse.'“I saw Iva Jovic in the locker room before I went on, and she was, like, ‘If you lose, that's way worse wearing the Chiefs jersey.' I'm, like, ‘Yeah, all she has to do is eat a piece of pie. What is the big deal?' Yeah, I think that was really some extra motivation, because that would have been a tough moment for me.”The final details of the bet are yet to be hashed out, but Pegula believes Keys will take her sweet-savory lumps courtesy of Brady in Orlando.

“I don't think Madi is going to go out of her way to get this pie or cheese, so I think it's going to be a Jenny task,” joked Pegula after reaching a ninth career Grand Slam quarterfinal.“People eat apples with cheese,” she continued emphatically. “It's not that big of a deal. It's definitely not as bad as it sounds. We got off to a bad start because I randomly said it in a recording, and everyone freaked out, because someone pulled up a picture, and if you Google it, it looks really bad. They also Googled it, looked like it was a Kraft single piece of cheese.“I was, ‘Okay, no, get like a good cheese.' Don't put a Kraft, the plastic thing and just put it on there and, like, that sounds really bad. So, you've got to get a good cheese. It's not as bad as everyone thinks.”Pegula knows good tennis in addition to good cheese in Melbourne, breezing into the last eight with the loss of just 17 games. A disappointed but philosophical Keys gave Pegula her props after the match.

“Jess does a really good job at taking time away,” said Keys, who felt Pegula was “dictating play” on Rod Laver Arena. “She redirects incredibly well, so it's kind of a catch-22 sometimes with her, because it's almost like the more pace you give her, the quicker the ball is coming back at you.“I think another thing that I don't think she always gets as much credit for is she hits a lot of very deep balls, so you can't really do a whole lot with them, or if you do, you kind of have to take a little bit more of a risk just because she does a really good job of kind of pushing people off of the baseline as she's slowly taking her baseline…So, I think that's always been, I think, in my opinion, her superpower.”Where Pegula's consistency has regularly taken her to this stage at a major tournament since 2021, it's only recently the No. 6 seed has begun to more regularly factor beyond the quarterfinals—a narrative Pegula sees as more media-driven than anything else.“I mean, the fact that I'm putting myself in that many positions I feel like is a feat in itself. I didn't really quite understand that,” said Pegula, a US Open finalist in 2024 and a semifinalist in 2025.

Looking to make her first major semifinal outside of Flushing Meadows, she will face fellow American Amanda Anisimova, guaranteeing at least one U.S. woman into the final four.“I think that's great for American tennis,” said Pegula.“Yeah, it's been pretty crazy how well the women have been doing and how many top-ranked girls there are. I'm just happy to be a part of that conversation.”Although for Pegula, any conversation that isn't about Kansas City is probably a great one.

Isack Hadjar: 'Pretty productive' first day at Barcelona shakedown

Wheatley 'very excited' to be in Barcelona despite short running of Audi car on day 1

With pre-season testing fast approaching, Lawrence Barretto outlines how the Barcelona Shakedown will unfold.

With the winter break firmly in the rearview mirrors and several of the teams having already completed a first run of their car during a filming day or released imagery of their new livery and machines, attention is now turning to the next step – the Barcelona Shakedown.

Right, then. Talk to me. What's the Barcelona Shakedown?

It's an opportunity for teams to run their car without limitations like a maximum of 200km of running on promotional tyres that is permitted during filming days, so they can start checking parts on the new machines work as expected.

OK, you've got me hooked. Tell me more...

Well, firstly – this is a first chance to stress-test their race machines in real life rather than in the world of simulation. If they have already done a shakedown, that would have focused on system checks and to make sure a car that has been bolted together for the first time does what they thought it would do.

If they didn't, the early running in Barcelona will be focused on that. Barcelona then offers teams a chance to put some mileage on the cars, on the parts and on the power units – and see how those elements react in reality.

OK, that makes sense. So, when does it start?

I'm glad you asked. It'll kick off on January 26 and run until January 30. That makes it a five-day event but teams will only be permitted to run on three days. They can choose when they run.

Why is that the case?

This gives teams flexibility to run when it's convenient for them. Some might choose to run one day, then use the next day to work on the car or wait for new parts and then run on day three. Others might want to wait and run on day two or even the final three days to give them extra days to work on their project.

It also gives teams the chance to react to bad weather. If the forecast is rainy or snowy on one particular day, they are perhaps better off waiting for a clearer day to maximise the mileage they can gather.

Can we watch it?

Unfortunately not. This is a closed event and very much what it says on the tin – it's a shakedown.

The main focus of this event is for teams to get mileage on the cars and start to learn about how it works, how the various parts react and where they need to improve. It won't be about chasing performance – that'll come in Bahrain, providing they are all in good shape.

However, I've got good news. There will be a daily highlights video, short interviews from the key protagonists – drivers and team principals – and clips on social media plus teams will be posting their own stuff and we'll have supporting coverage across Formula1.com, too.

Lovely. So when does Official Pre-Season Testing begin?

That'll be next month and, once again, Bahrain plays host. Last year, F1 had just one pre-season test at the desert track. This year, there are two – given the scale of the changes to the regulations. Both tests are three days apiece.

Test one starts on February 11. There's a four-day gap before test two starts on February 18. This is when things start to ramp up.

Beyond the teams using the running to learn about the cars, there'll be plenty for the drivers to swot up on, too, with a greater set of tools – like boost, overtake and recharge – to attack and defend on Grand Prix weekends. That makes this running even more important than usual.

It's likely that the car some teams bring to the first test in Bahrain will look different to the one seen in Barcelona – with some also likely to bring new bits to the second Bahrain test.

It's also very possible some teams will bring an update package for the first race in Australia, which takes place March 6-8 while others will bring the car they plan to race in Australia to Barcelona and spend the nine days of running really getting to know their car while giving them scope to check out everyone else's innovations in case they missed something.

That means getting a sense of the pecking order will be trickier than ever.

Can we watch the tests in Bahrain?

You can! The last hour of each day of running in the first Bahrain test is set to be streamed live. There will also be an assortment of content to keep you in the loop across Formula 1's channels – F1.com, F1's social media and F1 TV.

Then for test two – when things get serious and we start to see a pecking order start to form as teams chase performance – you'll be able to watch every minute of every single day on a full live broadcast. There will be a suite of analysis content, too.

Oh, I like the sound of that. And then what happens?

It'll be a final push to get the cars ready for their debut race weekend in Australia – the first of 24 Grands Prix weekends that will culminate in a finale in Abu Dhabi.

Isack Hadjar: 'Pretty productive' first day at Barcelona shakedown

Wheatley 'very excited' to be in Barcelona despite short running of Audi car on day 1

After running during the opening morning of the Barcelona Shakedown, Valtteri Bottas has been reflecting on how he has found his time with the Cadillac team so far.

Valtteri Bottas has given an insight into the type of team he has found during his early experiences of working with the new Cadillac outfit, having gained some mileage in their 2026 car at the Barcelona Shakedown.

After being announced as part of the American squad's driver line-up – alongside Sergio Perez – back in August of last year, Bottas embarked on his first day with the team in December, where he spent time with colleagues and underwent a seat fit.

Now, several weeks on, the Finn has got behind the wheel of the outfit's first-ever F1 car during the Barcelona Shakedown, where the team have joined most of their competitors in stress-testing their 2026 machines.

As well as being a new era for Cadillac, it also marks the beginnings of Bottas' return to the grid, having spent 2025 on the sidelines as a Mercedes reserve driver.

“It's great to be back, also with this brand-new team in the sport – it's a really, really unique situation,” Bottas explained after the opening morning of the Barcelona Shakedown. “I really enjoyed getting back on track – this was the first time I drove this car, so it's just good to be out there.

“Obviously performance-wise I wouldn't say much yet – the main thing is we've got some running done. At the end we got a little bit longer run in, so these are the first steps of debugging and getting everything to work better.”

Reflecting further on the first morning of action in Barcelona, the 36-year-old continued: “It was cold! Early morning, it's quite hard to get the tyres to work here, as we know. As the temperature picked up things got a bit better.

“We had some issues throughout the day. Like I said, it's debugging – that's why we're here, and it seems like every team had some issues. It's just now really figuring out those and then getting more and more running each day. But, like I said, it's just great to be here and in the car.”

Bottas went on to assess how he has found his early experiences of working with Cadillac, with the Finnish racer praising the squad for the work they have put in so far as they prepare for their debut season in the sport.

“I really enjoy everything so far with the team,” he explained. “Everyone is looking at things with fresh eyes, with a different angle. We have lots of experience from different teams, and everyone has been working so hard to be here.

“Starting from zero, it's a bigger challenge than what the other teams had, I think. So I'm very proud of everyone so far and I'm enjoying it.”

In terms of the challenge posed by the new regulations – and what the plan will be for the remainder of the Barcelona Shakedown – Bottas said: “It's definitely a big difference to before. The cars handle different; we have a bit less load, especially in the high-speed corners.

“The PU, you have so much more torque out of the corners, but then you have the battery to manage. And again, for Ferrari this is the first proper day of running with their power unit, so naturally there's a learning curve. Still lots to learn, lots to improve, but it's quite a challenge for every team.

“The priority list now is get more laps each day – I think I got a bit more than 30 laps today, some of them just installs and stuff. We need to get some proper running in, get the mileage in and make sure we get a reliable package for race one.”

Laura Lancaster and Nick Pepper are leaving the studio, while Netflix alum Blair Fetter joins as head of genre series. 


							By 

	Rick Porter


Television Business Editor


	A few months into his time as head of global television for Amazon MGM Studios, Peter Friedlander is undertaking a significant reorganization of the TV team.


	Under former head Vernon Sanders, Amazon MGM's TV division had been structured around wholly owned series and co-productions. Starting “immediately,” Friedlander wrote in a memo to staff Monday, the studio will switch to genre-based teams for both development and current programming: drama and comedy, worldbuilding (i.e., fantasy, sci-fi and other “genre” series), animation and unscripted.

	Laura Lancaster and Nick Pepper, who had headed the co-production and wholly owned teams previously, are departing their roles but are in talks to enter producing deals at Amazon MGM, Friedlander noted. Netflix alum Blair Fetter will join Amazon MGM on Feb. 2 as head of worldbuilding and genre series, reporting to Friedlander. Newly hired unscripted head Jenn Levy and animation head Melissa Wolfe will continue to lead those groups; Fetter, Levy and Wolfe will all report directly to Friedlander.

	The studio is currently searching for an executive to lead the drama and comedy team; in the meantime, Kara Smith, Michael McDonald, and Jen Chambers will oversee comedy, drama and YA programming and report to Friedlander. 


	“By organizing around these specialized genres with dedicated leadership, we will move faster, make sharper creative decisions, and continue to build groundbreaking series that define the future of television,” Friedlander wrote in his memo (read it in full, below).

	











	Friedlander joined Amazon MGM Studios in early October after 14 years at Netflix, where he was one of the longest-serving creative executives at the company. The reorg brings Amazon MGM's structure into line with many other studios whose development and current teams run along genre lines.


	Fetter was most recently head of spectacle series at Netflix and has worked on series including Stranger Things, Ozark and The Queen's Gambit, among others. Deadline first reported the news.


	Friedlander's memo is below.


	All,I'm writing to announce a new organizational structure for the Scripted Series team at Amazon MGM Studios, designed to accelerate our mission of delivering exceptional original television that captivates audiences worldwide. Effective immediately, we are transitioning from our current structure—split between Wholly Owned and Co-Productions—to a streamlined, genre-based organization (drama & comedy, worldbuilding, animation, and unscripted). Both Development and Current will reside in this new framework, which will provide greater clarity, specialized expertise, and clear ownership across our entire portfolio. As part of this evolution, Laura Lancaster and Nick Pepper will be transitioning out of the organization. Producing deal conversations are underway. Nick and Laura have been invaluable builders of our scripted series slate, and we are deeply grateful for their significant contributions to our success.

Nick was the driving force behind the critically acclaimed Prime Video series Overcompensating and the upcoming titles Tomb Raider, Elle, Young Sherlock, and Carrie. In addition, Nick has built a bold and distinctive animation slate, including Secret Level, Hazbin Hotel, Helluva Boss, and two of Critical Role's premium campaigns, Vox Machina and Mighty Nein.With this transition, I'm pleased to announce that Blair Fetter is joining Amazon MGM Studios as Head of Worldbuilding & Genre Series, reporting to me starting February 2nd. Blair brings outstanding experience from Netflix, where he oversaw Spectacle Series and was essential to the success of shows such as Stranger Things, Ozark, The Queen's Gambit, Death by Lightning, BoJack Horseman, The Haunting of Hill House and 3 Body Problem. His ability to discover and develop expansive worlds paired with his commitment to high-quality storytelling makes him an ideal addition to my leadership team. Tom Lieber and Matt King will report to Blair, continuing to focus on our Worldbuilding genre programming.As previously announced, Jenn Levy has joined as Head of Unscripted and Documentary Television. Melissa Wolfe will continue as Head of Animation, now reporting directly to me. For our Drama, Comedy, and Young Adult programming, Kara Smith, Michael McDonald, and Jen Chambers will report to me on an interim basis until we finalize the structure and put in place a new Head of Drama & Comedy Series. With these changes, Lauren O'Connor, Head of Global IP, will now report directly to me.

Ryan Murphy shows us his sweet side.


							By 

	Tony Maglio



	It's a love story, FX-on-Hulu viewers, just say yes.


	FX has set the premiere date for the inaugural season of Ryan Murphy‘s newest anthology series, Love Story, which is focused on JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette. The debut is timed to Valentine's Day, which is a pretty good scheduling peg. That said, no one wants a Saturday series, so Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette will bow on Thursday, Feb. 12. The season's first three episodes will launch that evening on FX and Hulu (and on Disney+ internationally) beginning at 9 p.m. ET. After that, one new episode of the subsequent six will air/stream each week.

Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette is inspired by Elizabeth Beller's book Once Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. Paul Anthony Kelly will play JFK Jr. and Sarah Pidgeon will portray Bessette.


	“It was a love story that captured the attention of the nation: John F. Kennedy Jr. was the closest thing to American royalty. The country watched him grow from a boy to a beloved bachelor and media sensation,” the FX press release, which I guess doubles as a logline, reads. “Carolyn Bessette was a star in her own right. Fiercely independent and with a singular style, she rose from being a sales assistant to an executive at Calvin Klein, and became a trusted confidante of its eponymous founder. John and Carolyn's connection was immediate, electric and undeniable. As their love story unfolded on a national stage, the intense fame and media attention that came along with it threatened to rip them apart.”

	











	JFK Jr. and Bessette-Kennedy died in 1999 when his single-engine airplane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near Martha's Vineyard. Bessette's sister Lauren Bessette also died. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined the cause of the accident to be spatial disorientation while flying over the ocean at night. In its most basic sense, the pilot loses their sense of up and down.


	The series also stars Grace Gummer as Caroline Kennedy, Naomi Watts as Jackie Kennedy Onassis, Alessandro Nivola as Calvin Klein, Leila George as Kelly Klein, Sydney Lemmon as Lauren Bessette) and Constance Zimmer as Ann Marie Messina.


	OK wait, so here's the actual logline: “Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette charts the complex and heartbreaking journey of a couple whose private love became a national obsession.”


Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette is created by Connor Hines and executive produced by Murphy, Nina Jacobson, Brad Simpson, Connor Hines, Eric Kovtun, Nissa Diederich, Scott Robertson, Monica Levinson, Kim Rosenstock, D.V. DeVincentis and Tanase Popa. Max Winkler executive produced and directed the pilot episode; the series is produced by 20th Television.

The LP is Rocky's third album to top the tally.

	Gil Kaufman



	There's nothing like having a partner who supports you every day in every way. Just ask A$AP Rocky, who got the ultimate shout-out from Rihanna when his long-awaited Don't Be Dumb album debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 album chart this week.

	“Just me here to let yall know my baby daddy got the NUMBER 1 ALBUM!!! Aaahhhhhh hah! DONT BE DUMB!!!,” Rihanna wrote on X. The dynamic duo share three children together, sons RZA Athelston and Riot Rose and five-month old daughter Rocki Irish.

	Rocky's Don't Be Dumb — which debuts atop the list dated Jan. 31 — is the MC's third No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart and his first in more than a decade. Rocky was previously at the chart summit in June 2015 with AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP and in 2013 with LONG.LIVE.A$AP. 


	And while fans have been waiting a decade for a follow-up to Rihanna's Anti album with no end in sight, on an episode of The Joe Budden Podcast last week, Rocky said he's open to having more kids with RihRih in the future. “Listen, man, whatever God give me, it's a blessing,” he said of their growing family. “I ain't gon' hold you, though. We got our hands full right now. We got a football team right now. I'm about to catch up to Nick Cannon, you s–tin' me? Yeah, I got three joints, man.”

	











	And though the couple have a very long way to go to catch up with Cannon — who has 12 children with six different women — Rihanna also hasn't been shy about hinting at a further expansion of their young family. Earlier this month under a post shared by influencer Montana Rose Brown captioned, “Deciding whether to get hot and sexy or get pregnant in 2026,” RiRi chimed in with what sounded like a tease aimed at Rocky. “Wait! So i'm not crazy then? Bet,” she wrote.

""I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability,"" he wrote.


													By
												

	Michael Saponara



	Ye (formerly Kanye West) issued yet another apology, as Yeezy took out a full-page ad in the Jan. 26 edition of The Wall Street Journal, which saw him apologize to the Jewish community for his antisemitic hate speech in recent years.


	West also addressed the Black community, as well as “those I've hurt” due to his erratic behavior and outlandish declarations. The Chicago native cited his well-documented 2002 car crash, during which he broke his jaw, as causing some brain damage that may have led to his behavior.

	











	“Twenty-five years ago, I was in a car accident that broke my jaw and caused injury to the right frontal lobe of my brain,” he wrote. “At the time, the focus was on the visible damage — the fracture, the swelling and the immediate physical trauma. The deeper injury, the one inside my skull, went unnoticed.”


	West explained that the brain injury wasn't properly diagnosed and led to mental health issues such as bipolar disorder. (A 2023 case report titled “Bipolar Disorder Due to Traumatic Brain Injury” published by the National Institutes of Health noted that “people with TBI are 1.28 times more likely to have bipolar disorder,” especially if the injury happened between the ages of 11 and 15. The report also noted that “it is believed that TBI causes brain inflammation, which can lead to mental health issues.”)

	











	“Bipolar disorder comes with its own defense system,” he added. “Denial. When you're manic, you don't think you're sick. You think everyone else is overreacting. You feel like you're seeing the world more clearly than ever, when in reality you're losing your grip entirely.”


	Ye continued: “I said and did things I deeply regret. Some of the people I love the most, I treated the worst. You endured fear, confusion, humiliation and the exhaustion of trying to love someone who was, at times, unrecognizable. Looking back, I became detached from my true self.”


	Digging deeper, West addressed his use of the swastika, which he had put on Yeezy merchandise. Some of the “disconnected moments” led to memory lapses that he claims to still be unable to recall.


	“In that fractured state, I gravitated toward the most destructive symbol I could find, the swastika, and even sold T-shirts bearing it,” he wrote. Ye noted in his ad that he's “committed to accountability,” and emphatically stated that he's “not a Nazi” and has “love for Jewish people.”


	“One of the difficult aspects of having bipolar type-1 are the disconnected moments — many of which I still cannot recall —  that led to poor judgment and reckless behavior that oftentimes feels like an out-of-body-experience. I regret and am deeply mortified by my actions in that state, and am committed to accountability, treatment and meaningful change,” he wrote. “It does not excuse what I did, though. I am not a Nazi or an antisemite. I love Jewish people.”


	The Anti-Defamation League called Ye's apology “long overdue” in a statement shared with Billboard. “Ye's apology to the Jewish people is long overdue and doesn't automatically undo his long history of antisemitism — the antisemitic ‘Heil Hitler' song he created, the hundreds of tweets, the swastikas and myriad Holocaust references — and all of the feelings of hurt and betrayal it caused,” an ADL spokesman said. “The truest apology would be for him to not engage in antisemitic behavior in the future. We wish him well on the road to recovery.”

	











	Ye also detailed how he fell into a “manic episode” that saw him destroy his life early last year, to the point he questioned if he wanted to live anymore.


	“I am so sorry to have let you down. I love us. In early 2025, I fell into a four-month long manic episode of psychotic, paranoid and impulsive behavior that destroyed my life,” he revealed. “As the situation became increasingly unsustainable, there were times I didn't want to be here anymore.”


	West added he has discovered a “newfound” clarity in life, along with an “effective” regimen of medication mixed with therapy and exercise to continue to make strides in his battle. He closed with an ask — not for sympathy, but for patience moving forward.


	“As I find my new baseline and new center through an effective regime of medication, therapy, exercise, and clean living, I have newfound, much-needed clarity. I am pouring my energy into positive, meaningful art: music, clothing, design, and other new ideas to help the world,” he concluded. “I'm not asking for sympathy, or a free pass, though I aspire to earn your forgiveness. I write today simply to ask for your patience and understanding as I find my way home.”


	Ye's series of antisemitic remarks in 2022 led to companies such as Balenciaga, Universal Music Group, Adidas and Gap all cutting ties with him. He also met with Rabbi Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto in November 2025 to take responsibility and apologize to the Jewish community. 


	On the music side, West is preparing to release his next album, which is titled Bully. He's slated to make his return to the stage as well later this month with a pair of shows (Jan. 30, Jan. 31) in Mexico City.

Hulu has set April 8 for the premiere of The Testaments, the forthcoming sequel series to The Handmaid's Tale, based on Margaret Atwood's novel of the same name. 


	Created by Handmaid's Tale showrunner and executive producer Bruce Miller, the coming-of-age story is set in the dystopian theocracy of Gilead more than 15 years after the events of The Handmaid's Tale, that finds a new generation of young women grappling with the bleak future that awaits them. Handmaid's Tale lead Elisabeth Moss also serves as an executive producer.


	It will premiere with the first three episodes on April 8, followed by one new episode weekly thereafter. The series will be available on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+ for bundle subscribers in the U.S. and on Disney+ internationally.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Per the official logline, the series follows young teens Agnes, dutiful and pious, and Daisy, a new arrival and convert from beyond Gilead's borders. As they navigate the gilded halls of Aunt Lydia's elite preparatory school for future wives, a place where obedience is instilled brutally and always with divine justification, their bond becomes the catalyst that will upend their past, their present, and their future.


	Principal cast includes Ann Dowd, Chase Infiniti, Lucy Halliday, Mabel Li, Amy Seimetz, Brad Alexander, Rowan Blanchard, Mattea Conforti, Zarrin Darnell-Martin, Eva Foote, Isolde Ardies, Shechinah Mpumlwana, Birva Pandya, and Kira Guloien.


	Miller executive produces along with Warren Littlefield, Moss, Steve Stark, Shana Stein, Maya Goldsmith, John Weber, Sheila Hockin, Daniel Wilson, Fran Sears, and Mike Barker, who will also direct the first three episodes. The Testaments is produced by MGM Television.

Lauren Sánchez and Jeff Bezos are painting the town red — and silver — in Paris.

The former journalist, 56, and her billionaire husband, 62, kicked off Haute Couture Week on Monday, attending the Schiaparelli and Dior Spring 2026 fashion shows in the City of Light.

Sánchez cut a striking figure in a fire-engine red skirt suit at the first show of the day, (accidentally?) coordinating with front-row seat-mate Anna Wintour, who arrived in a red-striped coat.

Sánchez accessorized with matching red suede pumps and red-tinged sunglasses. She added a standout alligator Schiaparelli handbag adorned with the house's signature surrealist face motif, complete with gilded lips and nose.

If she placed an order off the runway, it wouldn't be the first time: she wore a corseted gown from the Spring 2025 collection to kick off her lavish Venice nuptials to Bezos in June of last year.

The Amazon founder, meanwhile, complemented his wife at the runway show in a sleek all-black ensemble, but more striking was his new silver beard, which he's been growing out this winter.

Later the same day, the pair arrived hand-in-hand at Jonathan Anderson's Dior couture debut. Sánchez switched to a blue-gray fur-trimmed skirt suit while Bezos opted for navy.

The fashion week appearances come as the couple prepares to serve as primary donors for the 2026 Met Gala on May 4. 

They'll join secondary sponsors Saint Laurent and Condé Nast in funding the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute exhibition “Costume Art.”

In between shows, Sánchez was photographed out for lunch with Wintour, who has publicly defended the pair amid criticism of their Met sponsorship.

“I think Lauren is going to be a wonderful asset to the museum and to the event,” the Vogue global editorial director told CNN. “We're very grateful for her incredible generosity.”

The philanthropist has also been making the rounds at Paris hotspots like Siena restaurant, where she had dinner Sunday night in an athleisure black catsuit paired with a cropped white fur coat.

The Bezoses have become fixtures on the fashion circuit. In October, they attended Paris Fashion Week, where they caught new Chanel creative director Matthieu Blazy' debut show under the French fashion label and sat front row at Balenciaga.

Cardi B was pumped after her boyfriend, New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, secured his spot playing in this year's Super Bowl.

The rapper braved the bitter cold to attend the Patriots game against the Denver Broncos in Colorado on Sunday. The Patriots won the AFC Championship Game 10-7, meaning they're now headed to the Super Bowl.

Cardi, rocking long green hair and an all-black leather outfit, was on the field after the win and yelled excitedly.

“We're going to the Super Bowl!” she cheered in a video the NFL posted on Instagram. “Oh my God!”

She also shared footage of Diggs getting interviewed after the game on her Instagram Stories, proudly shouting, “That's my baby!”

Diggs was emotional, wiping away tears.

“They can't hold us down forever, man” Diggs said to his fellow teammates. “God is good!”

Cardi also posted a video of her hyping up Diggs' mom, Stephanie Diggs, asking her how she felt after the big win.

“My side hurts,” Stephanie hilariously responded.

The “Bodak Yellow” rapper of course showed off her game day outfit, which consisted of a custom Jagne curve-hugging lace corset look, Amina Muaddi boots and a Hermès Birkin bag. Cardi was prepared for the cold, as the stunning outfit covered her entire body, including her hands.

Cardi and Diggs were filmed hugging on the field after the Patriots clinched the win. Cardi, who put a fur coat over her outfit, beamed with a huge smile on her face as they rocked side to side. 

The couple shared a kiss that knocked off her celebratory baseball hat, which Diggs, 32, then sweetly replaced.

Diggs, who has six kids, welcomed a baby boy with Cardi in November 2025. The rapper, 33, hit back at fans who criticized her relationship with Diggs last month.

“I can't change s–t. I can't go back in time,” she said. “I already had a baby. Y'all want me to put my baby back in my p—y?”

“You want me to leave my man and f–k yours? What y'all want me to do?” she added.

The Gorgas bared their toned beach bodies during a Florida getaway over the weekend.

Melissa Gorga flaunted her taut tummy in a striped bikini and flip flops while out in Miami on Sunday with her husband, Joe Gorga, in photos obtained by Page Six.

The 46-year-old completed her coastal look with a straw bucket hat and black Prada sunglasses.

She later covered up her bathing suit bottoms with a white mesh skirt.

Joe, for his part, put his muscular figure on display in watermelon-patterned navy board shorts, which he paired with a pink cap and white slides.

The “Real Housewives of New Jersey” stars each gave their Instagram followers a glimpse of their sunny vacation.

Melissa posted a cheeky snap to her Story, captioned, “Just waiting on dem girls.”

She followed this up with footage of herself out to eat with “Real Housewives of Miami” star Larsa Pippen and more pals.

As for Joe, the 51-year-old posed with Jonathan Cheban during their “dinna [sic] in Miami.”

He and Melissa have been married since 2004 and share three children — daughter Antonia, 20, son Gino, 18, and son Joey, 15 — who did not appear to join them on the trip.

More than two decades into their marriage, the couple revealed the racy secret to their success on Page Six's “Virtual Reali-Tea” podcast: “Touch[ing] each other.”

During the 2023 sitdown, Joe explained, “You've got to do it. … [Otherwise], you walk around and you become roommates. I don't want a roommate that costs me a lot of money.”

The pair's relationship struggles, however, have been documented on “RHONJ,” with Melissa admitting to a “rough year and a half” in a 2021 interview.

“We've hit a couple of bumps in the road and we're honest about it and we're fighting for it,” she told Page Six at the time. “It's not easy. It's really not easy. It's not.

“We're one of the longest standing ‘Housewives' couples,” Melissa proudly acknowledged. “So whatever we're doing, I'm going to pat us on the back.”

The duo have also butted heads onscreen with Joe's sister, Teresa Giudice — but the family members finally reconciled in October 2025 after a years-long feud.

The Gorgas even spent Christmas with Giudice, 53, and her girls last month.

“It's kind of nice to do it without the cameras, I have to be honest,” Melissa said on “Reality Hot Seat” in December 2025. “We need this time, this healing moment.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Rachel McAdams and Sam Raimi make a loopy desert-island mess of Send Help","https://www.avclub.com/send-help-review","Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:13:21 GMT","

Linda Liddle (Rachel McAdams) is a minor mess. She's clearly beyond capable at her job as an accountant—or rather, as she repeatedly clarifies, part of the Strategy And Planning department at a consulting firm where various execu-bros think of everyone they don't golf with as some variation on their secretary. But she wears unfashionable shoes and unflattering sweaters. She makes chummy work jokes that already aren't funny before stumbling over her stage-whisper delivery. She brings her lunch from home, and when a bit of tuna fish gets stuck just below her lip before intercepting her new boss Bradley Preston (Dylan O'Brien) for a quick bit of self-promotion, it's not just a casual character note. The camera goes in ultra-close on her mouth, capturing the grotesquerie, and equally close in on Bradley's eyes, alight with horror at the sight of a somewhat older woman who hasn't dolled herself up for him. That's the Sam Raimi touch, baby.

So too, of course, is a jump-scare hallucination of a ghoulish figure. So is a hand jutting out from the earth. And so are the soakings of blood and other fluids in Send Help, Raimi's first R-rated movie in a quarter-century. But those hallmarks come later. The extreme close-ups are just the warning shots, the signs that Raimi is back and ready to mess around. Send Help is his messiest such mess-around since Drag Me To Hell (which somehow squeaked by with a PG-13), and at times feels like a less supernatural companion piece to the most socially conscious of his pure horror films.

Both movies' heroines are bedeviled by their desire to climb the corporate ladder, and the rigged demands placed upon them by their imposing male bosses. Bradley, son of the old boss who promised Linda a substantial promotion, is especially enervating in that regard; we see him behind closed doors (despite his “open-door policy”) blithely telling a subordinate that he'll instead hand Linda's promotion to one of his bros, and ship her out of the main office, to boot. (He really doesn't like tuna. Or, we can infer, women he's not attracted to.) To placate her, he offers more rigged gamesmanship: She can join a corporate trip overseas, help out with crunching numbers, and then wait to be told that, somehow, it simply wasn't enough.

Instead, their plane crashes into the ocean, in a short sequence staged much as you might expect Sam Raimi to stage a plane crash where most of the victims have been painted as wholly unsympathetic: a slapstick midair torture chamber. Linda and Bradly wash ashore on an unknown island, Linda saves her injured boss's life, and the balance of power between them begins to shift.

Bradley requires some direct instruction about this change. O'Brien plays him as a bro version of a Raimi boob complete with Looney Tunes grunts and growls of frustration that would make his spiritual (and, via one brief photograph, on-screen) father Bruce Campbell proud, and Bradley's first instinct is to keep treating Linda as an underling. As such, he continues issuing the kind of asinine non-suggestion directives (like explaining that Linda should build a larger fire) that anyone who has ever held a corporate office job will recognize as typical orders from on high. Linda, who happens to be obsessed with Survivor, lands on this island with surprisingly vast knowledge about obtaining water, food, and shelter. As with her job, she's done the homework; unlike her job, the satisfaction of this work gives her an extra glow. Her hair even flowers into island curls. The movie follows the multitude of tensions that develop as the pair spends more time together without rescue, nursing conflicting ideas about how to handle their predicament.

To explain further would risk spoiling the movie's give and take—though what's genuinely unpredictable about Send Help isn't the literal plotting, where several turns, however satisfying, are obviously telegraphed. No, Raimi and the screenwriters instead keep the audience off-balance by getting playfully coy about who or what we should be rooting for in this situation. Linda is the more obviously sympathetic party, but as fun as it is to see her take charge—to see McAdams literally go ham by hunting a fearsome wild boar—Raimi has thornier gender politics than will allow an uncomplicated dose of Good For Her cinema. Early on, he's unsparing about depicting Linda as an awkward dork, even going so far as to give her a barely-sublimated attraction to her handsome, younger boss. When Bradly ungratefully accuses her of playing “homemaker” on the beach, he's being deeply condescending, and the movie knows this. Yet there's a growing sense that the filmmakers don't entirely disagree, either.

So alongside Linda's old-fashioned and thwarted idea that simply working with dedication and skill at her job will result in her ultimate reward, the movie plants an even-older-fashioned hint that she might well enjoy serving as some '60s-style combination of coworker, subordinate, and domestic partner. On the island, she can become the Work Wife who won't be ignored. Drag Me To Hell saw fit to specifically and moralistically punish a young woman for giving in to the demands of capitalism, by unleashing a wronged hag upon her; in this case, the potentially compromised heroine threatens to turn into that classic blood-soaked, Raimi-approved shrieking hag herself. Both movies depict men behaving in a venal and immoral fashion, nonetheless overshadowed by (or at least in competition with) the unladylike transgressions of women's base designs. It seems possible that Raimi's view of womanhood—damsel in distress, evil hag, or hag in distress—may be somewhat limited.

As with Drag, this doesn't ruin the fun. If anything, it gives the movie an exploitation-friendly edge that many contemporary thrillers are far too self-congratulatory to even consider. Besides the fact that Send Help doesn't attempt anything as simple as a single, gendered sympathy flip, putting McAdams in the lead role changes the potentially regressive calculus of Linda Liddle. McAdams and O'Brien both give performances that could be described as interestingly caricatured while still managing to find a surprising emotional range from scene to scene. That's especially true of McAdams, who locates genuine hurt and anguish whenever Linda seems ready to heel-turn, and also breaks bad with abandon when required. Linda becomes an indelible and complicated character in a way that the lead of Drag Me To Hell never quite achieves.

Send Help doesn't merge Raimi's fever-pitch flourishes with human frailties, whether dramatic or comic, quite so well as Spider-Man 2 or Army Of Darkness. It's also not as wild a mayhem machine as some of his earlier genre workouts. As only his second non-IP movie since the original Spider-Man, it's actually a reminder of how relatively few horror thrillers he's made with this kind of semi-realistic grounding (that nonetheless doesn't prevent the camera from careening around the sometimes soundstage-like environment when called upon). As much as some of the imagery feels like Raimi playing the hits, Send Help also suggests a later-career shift for the filmmaker, one where his comic-book throwbacks run into (or over?) contemporary obstacles without losing their go-for-broke loopiness. It can get messy. Good for him.

Highguard set a new speed run record before it even came out: no game's discourse turned exhausting faster than this shooter. Seven weeks ago nobody outside of Wildlight Entertainment knew it even existed, but after a single trailer reveal at the end of a farcical “awards” show, suddenly everybody had a deeply held opinion about it. The conversation around Highguard went from 0 to absolutely insufferable in 150 seconds, and it's somehow only gotten worse in the weeks since, on all possible sides. From the too-cool cynicism of players tired of live service “forever games,” to the blind corporate boosterism of ostensibly journalistic enterprises, very little of the conversation around it has been constructive or well-considered—and none of it had anything to do with Highguard as an actual game. You know, those things you play—the things we're theoretically talking about when we talk about games. 

Highguard's out today, free for anybody on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Last week, journalists and critics spent a few hours with the game, which has been described as a “raid shooter” by its creators. What they played, and what you can download for yourself today, doesn't seem like something that should've caused such controversy—either the instant dismissal of “gamers” or the wagon-circling of the media. Highguard arrives as a thoroughly competent squad shooter with a well-defined structure distinct from other entries in this space, and a financial approach that should avoid the most exploitative aspects of live-service gaming.

Highguard's primary in-game focus is the raid. Two teams of three vie to destroy their opponents' base, and they do that by breaking through its defenses and strapping a bomb to key targets. Each base has a health meter that starts at 100 and goes down after certain crucial actions; if that number ever gets reduced to zero, it's game over. It's effectively a way to keep score. If you bomb a base's heart, a well-fortified spot deep inside the base, you destroy the whole fortress completely and immediately win the match; there are two other spots that are easier to get to and quicker to sabotage that will destroy the base when they're both bombed, or do significant damage whenever one is successfully blown up. 



That raid is the heart of Highguard, but it's the last in a regular sequence of phases that repeats until one team wins. You've got to build up to the raid. At the start of a game, you'll spend a minute reinforcing your base, making certain walls impregnable by normal weapons or abilities. The map between bases then opens up, and you'll have two minutes to collect as many armor and weapon upgrades as you can; they're strewn about the countryside in easily spotted treasure chests, and to let you grab as much as possible, you can immediately call a mount that will zip you across the countryside. You can also use this time to mine vesper, a blue crystal that dots the landscape, and that can be used at Trader Flynn's storefronts to buy armor and weapon upgrades. During this phase, you'll see a giant swirling purple cloud somewhere on the map; beneath that cloud, the mystical sword known as the Shieldbreaker will appear at the end of the supply phase's two minutes. Fighting over the Shieldbreaker will be the first serious action you're likely to see in a match, and whichever team can get it to the other's base first will start the raid. If the raiding team isn't able to destroy the base's heart or both of the other two targets within a set amount of time, the sequence begins again, with the raided base's health reduced by however much it was damaged, and all newly acquired weapons and armor getting a level boost. If the team being raided is able to prevent the raiders from blowing up any of the three targets, they'll inflict damage on the raiding team's base, basically letting you score on defense. This cycle repeats until one base's health is finally reduced to zero, which ends the game. 

That concept of base health, and the various ways damage can be done to it, opens up the possibilities of a match. If one team dominates, destroying a base on its first possession of the Shieldbreaker, a game of Highguard can take as little as seven minutes. If two teams go back and forth, though, swapping possession of the Shieldbreaker and raiding each other's base in alternating rounds, it can take over a half-hour. One match we played did exactly that. We traded off on raids, blowing up one target each time, until eventually winning on our second raid at a total time of 32 minutes; our base had only 10 hit points left. 

This all gives Highguard a more overtly sports-like feel than most online shooters. Get the thing you're fighting over (in this case, a glowing blue sword instead of a ball or puck) into the other team's turf, and then win a tense scrum in the end zone (planting a bomb and preventing the defenders from defusing it before it blows) to score. It really does feel a bit like football; fighting over the Shieldbreaker on the open map resembles a drive down the field, with the ever-present chance of a turnover, and the raid is a smashmouth goal-line stand to keep the other team from scoring. Although raiding a base immediately does damage to it, keeping them from blowing up a target is like blocking the extra point kick, with the added benefit of scoring if you pull it off (in the form of dealing damage to the rival base through a successful defense).

﻿

That raises the obvious question of Highguard as an esport—something that Wildlight doesn't want to discuss at the moment. They've revealed no plans for any kind of officially organized tournament component, but admit that the possibility is obviously there—and that they'd love to see high-level pros take a crack at their game. 

Highguard launches with eight playable characters, called “wardens.” Each one has one “tactical” ability, a useful skill with a relatively short cooldown meter, and one “ultimate,” which packs a considerable punch but takes much longer to generate. In addition to these magical superpowers, they're also proficient with a variety of firearms—this is a shooter, after all. They can all freely use any of the armor and weapons scrounged up during the stockpiling phase, but are better suited at different roles based on their abilities. It's fairly standard stuff, your tanks and supports and healers and strikers, and that familiarity—combined with a few high-profile failures in this live-service “hero shooter” genre—drives much of the negativity around the game. People might generally complain about the overreliance on intellectual property in entertainment today, but creating something new will always be riskier than adapting a presold concept, as with 2024's breakout hero shooter hit Marvel Rivals. And it doesn't help that, although Highguard's eight launch wardens aren't exactly stock types, it isn't hard to see some of the inspirations that influenced their development, which can make them seem a little generic at first. Every game starts with dialogue between teammates, revealing their personalities, and there appears to be at least a little bit more depth to some of them than initially evident, but it takes time to see where and how they fit in as actual characters instead of formulaic stand-ins.

A new warden will be added during every two-month season, with six scheduled through the rest of 2026. New bases, maps, and weapons will also be released each season, along with various character skins. Outside of cosmetic items, Wildlight plans on all these additions to be free for players, so nothing that actually impacts gameplay will require a purchase. They also promise there'll be no lootboxes and no randomized purchases, and that content won't be removed or available for a limited time only; once it's released, it'll be available for future players, too. If they stick to all of this, it should ensure that Highguard feels less predatory in its monetization than certain other live service games. 

Wildlight clearly thought carefully about how to do something different in what is a very crowded market. The overtly sports-informed back-and-forth nature of a Highguard match makes it stand out compared to other “hero shooters,” and their announced approach to monetization seems to treat consumers with respect. That said, exhaustion with this style of game is real, and the negative buzz around Highguard is palpable—so much so that Wildlight regularly addressed it throughout its preview event, taking blame for releasing what they now call a bad trailer that didn't do a good job of explaining the game. Bad reveal aside, the core of this game is strong, and Highguard itself should stand a chance at success, if enough players look past the anti-hype and give it a chance.

When Rob Reiner cast Kathy Bates in “Misery,” there was a sense that lightning had struck twice. Not just because Bates was unknown as an actor, but because Reiner truly understood how to use a performer's perceived softness as its own weapon of suspense. The legendary film from 1990 hinges on Bates' all-consuming transformation into Annie Wilkes, a mousy woman dismissed by the world only to reveal her vindictive nature when the rules collapse.

Sam Raimi's “Send Help” operates in a similar register with a crucial, modern twist. Rachel McAdams is not a secret waiting to be unearthed. She's an Oscar nominee (“Spotlight”), a romantic icon (“The Notebook”), and one of the great comedic villains of the 21st century (“Mean Girls”). Casting her opposite Dylan O'Brien in a two-hander survival horror-comedy might sound, on paper, like a miscalculation. Dropping a full-blown movie star into a role that demands humiliation, restraint, and a willingness to look foolish can backfire. But here, it's a multiplying factor, and McAdams' star power doesn't flatten “Send Help” but electrifies it.

 








Related Stories Paul Feig on Channeling His Inner Hitchcock and Sergio Leone for the Hit Thriller ‘The Housemaid' ‘Gail Daughtry and the Celebrity Sex Pass' Review: David Wain Delivers One of His Funniest Films Ever 

The most purely enjoyable Raimi film in years, the upcoming desert island debacle from 20th Century Studios is an ideal synthesis of the director's career thus far. It's got the gruesome ingenuity from his breakout debut, “The Evil Dead,” fused with the pop-comic precision that made him a revolutionary force for Sony's original “Spider-Man.” Ghastly without being grim and morally queasy without being mean, “Send Help” delivers its biggest laughs and gasps through brilliantly managed physical suffering. That includes what may be Raimi's finest puke gag since “Drag Me to Hell,” and a vintage gross-out approach to black comedy that's executed with the confidence of someone who knows where to draw his line in the sand. 

 










Meet Linda Liddle (McAdams), a long-suffering corporate underling dragged on an international business trip after getting passed up for a promotion. Her new boss, Bradley Preston (O'Brien), is a passive-aggressive tyrant with “American Psycho” instincts. But boundless entitlement and a gift for micromanagement can't save him when their plane crashes in the Gulf of Thailand. He and Linda are the only two survivors, and with HR nowhere to be found, that fact immediately flips their dynamic. The kind of boss who would crawl inside your abdomen instead of turning down the air-conditioning, Bradley suddenly can't function without Linda. What's worse, he's got a bum leg and couldn't outrun her (or any other threat) if he tried.

Raimi and screenwriters Damian Shannon and Mark Swift (“Freddy vs. Jason,” “Friday the 13th,” “Baywatch”) waste no time turning the island into a pressure cooker. At first, the setting feels pulled from grounded survival dramas like “Cast Away” or “The Impossible.” But Linda, armed with decades of “Survivor” knowledge and the quiet competence of someone who's always cleaning up other people's messes, thrives with cartoonish joy. Shortly after washing ashore, she builds shelter, starts a fire, collects water, goes fishing, and adopts a breezy efficiency that borders on smug. Soon, she's carved her name into a cup and woven herself a backpack: territorial gestures that mirror the small ways she once claimed space in the office.

 










Simultaneously, Bradley collapses in the absence of capitalism. He refuses to eat, complains about sunburn, and rejects the reality of the hell he's living in with relentless tenacity. His attempts at survival are so inept they feel like a self-own, and the jungle's creatures (rendered with goofy digital effects that are visually consistent enough to feel acceptable) seem to exist solely to punish him. The longer the torture goes on, the more “Send Help” starts to resemble Linda's wish fulfillment. Caught somewhere between “Office Space” and “I Spit on Your Grave,” it's a workplace nightmare stripped to its rawest, most relatable revenge components.

That's where McAdams becomes indispensable. As Linda Liddle (a name that even sounds cut from the same cloth as Annie Wilkes), she's still an impossibly luminous presence. Introduced trudging around her sad little apartment in an oversized robe, talking to a pet cockatiel, McAdams can't hide who audiences know her to be. Even after colliding with Bradley on his first day as CEO and promptly spitting a tuna fish sandwich on him, Linda remains quietly glamorous and adorable. But McAdams' performance is so rigorously committed that dissonance becomes the point and her oceanside glow-up steers the film's second half. 

 










Like Anne Hathaway's Andy Sachs in “The Devil Wears Prada,” Linda could sacrifice more of her dignity for her boss. But on some level, she chooses not to, and that restraint makes the island's psychological games all the richer. Trapped but still killing it, Linda isn't just retaliating; she's recalibrating a balance that's been wrong for years. When Bradley and his C-suite cronies mock her “Survivor” audition tape on the flight over, hot tears stream down Linda's face. But by the time she's standing over Bradley's body on the beach, she's radiant with capability, embodying a reversal of audience expectations that's both satisfying and clever. In the end, McAdams' sexiness isn't incidental, but integral to how she's been misjudged.

To his credit, O'Brien never overplays Bradley as the monster. Instead, he's indifferent and greedy, brandishing a laziness that's suffocating and a demeanor that's innately manipulative. He's the kind of man who thinks he's charming because his employees can't say no to him, and Raimi shows strong tonal control in how much he lets Linda punish him — allowing Bradley's torment to feel earned rather than sadistic, even as he blubbers, vomits, and otherwise pays dearly. The parable that follows him could be ripped straight from “Tales from the Crypt,” offering a bold outline to a campy grudge match that shines brightest in its ethically gray framing. 

 










“Send Help” walks a treacherous line between cruelty and catharsis and, despite the dicy subject matter, somehow never tips into nihilism. The violence is sharp, and the comedy is clean, with Raimi observing his world's details with a hunter's precision. Whether it's Linda's skin warming into a confident tan, or Bradley's expensive dress shoes growing thick with grime, Raimi almost seems to sit alongside us, gently suggesting whose side we're on and when. Conversations between Linda and Bradley play like a high-stakes battle of wits, but their director is never so far away as to make the match feel lawless.

The result — labor satire that hits without feeling like a prestige think piece — is uncanny in its timeliness. Linda's isolated, bachelorette existence and the casual judgment she faces for it mirrors a world that's increasingly hostile to women who choose to be single (though her backstory proves more complex than that). If “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” proved Raimi could juggle infinite self-referential, superhero jokes, “Send Help” applies that same dexterity to a more universally funny concept. In an era where originality struggles to be rewarded, this feels like a genuine studio win for genre fans. 

The opposite of an endurance test, Raimi's latest ultimately leaves you in a sense of glee. Crescendoing into a perfect punchline (one that satisfies whether you see it coming or not), Raimi doesn't pull punches — but he doesn't swing aimlessly either. Rather, he meets the audience's blood lust with the rare survival thriller you wish would go on longer. Yes, the glossy aesthetic occasionally dulls the impact of the director's more tactile sensibilities, and a few script contrivances stretch believability. Still, these are quibbles, not cracks, and they're easy to ignore.

 










Wickedly lovable with the potential to be timeless, “Send Help” is controlled delirium microwaved on high heat. At 66, Raimi reminds us who he was when he made horror-comedy history with “Evil Dead II,” and more importantly, why his voice still matters. Watching McAdams snarl and strategize, you can practically imagine how much fun Raimi would've had handing her a chainsaw in the '80s. He still splatters her with blood here, proving it's never too late for the right collaboration, and that neither he nor McAdams should ever be underestimated.

From 20th Century Studios, “Send Help” is in theaters January 30.

The Grammy Awards return this Sunday, February 1, and will once again be hosted by Trevor Noah. It's the comedian's sixth—and, according to him, final—time leading the ceremony. Topping this year's list of nominees is Kendrick Lamar, with nine nods, including appearances in three categories he won in 2025: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Rap Performance. For the second-most nominees, it's a three-way tie between Lady Gaga, Jack Antonoff, and Mayhem producer Cirkut, who have seven apiece.

Whether any of these artists comes home with a golden gramophone, though, remains to be seen. To find out, you'll have to watch this year's main ceremony, which will be broadcast live from Los Angeles' Crypto.com Arena, beginning at 8 p.m. EST on CBS and Paramount+. In the meantime, check out our predictions for who should and will win in key categories at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards.

Will Win: ROSÉ, Bruno Mars: “APT.”

Should Win: Lady Gaga: “Abracadabra”

Come Grammys season, ubiquity usually trumps all else; the more beaten into the cultural short-term memory, the better. In those terms, the 2026 Record of the Year race appears tight. Promo for Chappell Roan's latest loosie “The Subway” has been plastered across its namesake public transit system all year. Lady Gaga's “Abracadabra” premiered during last year's Grammys. Bad Bunny, one of the biggest artists in the world right now, will bring “DtMF” to the Super Bowl halftime show on February 8. And not only has Doechii's single “Anxiety” been floating around for years, it's all but pre-existing IP, lightly reworking a Gotye song that won this category in 2013.

But if there's one contender that was completely inescapable in 2026, it's “APT.” Even with Academy darlings like Kendrick Lamar, SZA, and Billie Eilish in the mix, “APT.” is the kind of “even Grandma's getting into it” pick Grammy voters love to laud. Bruno Mars is also a frequent flier in the Record of the Year category and Rosé's BLACKPINK beginnings fit the Grammys' recently-peaked interest in Korea's star-making machine. (If “APT.” takes the statuette, she'll be the first K-pop artist to win the category.)

But if it's top-to-bottom production and performance the Grammys are allegedly after, “Abracadabra” should win. The MAYHEM single doesn't exactly warrant a Lifetime Achievement nod. But after a decade of the Academy pointedly rewarding Gaga's more traditionalist work, seeing her clinch her first Record of the Year for a song sharing more DNA with “Swine” than “Shallow” would be extremely satisfying. —Hattie Lindert

Should Win: Bad Bunny: Debí Tirar Más Fotos

Will Win: Lady Gaga: Mayhem

Is it just me or is this Album of the Year field padded out—even more than usual—with releases that have little to no chance of actually winning? Man's Best Friend and Swag are both impressive feats of pop craftsmanship, but feel minor compared to their older siblings; the inclusion of Let God Sort Em Out says more about Pharrell's cultural cachet than it does Grammy voters' taste for coke rap; and if it seems like GNX and Chromakopia came out literal years ago, that's because they did.

Leon Thomas' Mutt is the only record on this list I haven't heard, which, based on the last five years of winners, means he has a solid 20% chance of taking home the trophy, but really, this is a two-horse race. In one lane, Lady Gaga, who successfully married her classic theatrics with a newfound air of hard-won grace in the rollout around Mayhem. In the other, Bad Bunny—never quite a Grammys darling, but a perennial presence in the awards' Música Urbana categories. Debí Tirar Más Fotos is Benito's most musically audacious project and his most expressly political. As the Trump administration threatens to send ICE agents to his Super Bowl Halftime Show, the Recording Academy has the rare chance to throw its weight behind an artist at the exact moment when his work is as urgent, ambitious, and necessary as it's ever been. —Walden Green

Will Win: Kendrick Lamar & SZA: “Luther”

Should Win: Sabrina Carpenter: “Manchild”

Blurb: Surprised the Record of the Year and Song of the Year categories are roughly indistinguishable? Welcome to the Grammys. Although the former category technically focuses on production while the latter highlights songwriting, every year the winners for each end up looking like a spot-the-difference game. Much like my high-school's lacrosse coach, Grammy voters love to play favorites (how else does a buzzer-beater 2024 Billie Eilish single that received next to no FYC promotion end up in competition?) But that's not much of a divining rod this year, with so many familiar faces (Eilish, Bruno Mars, Lady Gaga) against each other. Although the Academy invited the Latin Recording Academy to join their ranks this year, it's unclear how many of these members will actually get a vote, which could put Bad Bunny's well-deserving but all-Spanish “DtMF” at a disadvantage. And the surprise KPop Demon Hunters smash “Golden” might eke out a win, but it's a surer thing elsewhere on the ballot.

My money is on Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther.” It spent the most time atop the Hot 100, Jack Antonoff had a hand in it, and it's far less incendiary than the track that rightfully cinched Lamar this category last year. But if we're heading for another Antonoff-happy Grammys, he should be recognized for Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild,” the best distillation of the newly-minted superstar's delightful shtick yet and certainly the tightest lyrical showing here. If the Grammys can shower noms on Antonoff's less-impressive layups (looking at you, The Tortured Poets Department), they ought to recognize his slam dunks, too. —Hattie Lindert

Should Win: Addison Rae

Will Win: sombr

Infamously and inevitably, the Best New Artist category highlights artists who have been around for years and, oftentimes, already have multiple albums to their name. Even with that caveat, this year's batch feels noteworthy for the fact that three artists—Alex Warren, Addison Rae, and sombr—released a debut album within the Academy's designated eligibility window.

Turns out going viral is no longer the secret to fast-tracked financial wins, but also the path to Recording Academy recognition. Of course, it's largely out of an artist's hands: For Katseye, it barely took a year, during which the international girl group transcended K-pop corner stardom and entered crossover earworm success thanks to “Gnarly,” while it took a decade for the Marías' seductive dream-pop and dual-language lyrics to catch fire on TikTok. Olivia Dean and Leon Thomas sit squarely in the middle with two albums that take different approaches to R&B: The former indulges in classic soft-rock flair; the latter cuts straight to the chase with stuttering hi-hats and deeper vocal runs.

All of which is to say the playing field is fairly even at this point, except for the ample weight in Rae and sombr's corners. Addison is a breathy dose of aughts pop tricks cashing in on the unabashed influences of today, from Lorde to Arca and beyond. Not only does Rae have stamps of approval from Charli XCX and Lana Del Rey, but she's still on the mind of girls and gays who refuse to leave the club—or, at the very least, take off their headphones. Don't be surprised if voters are too planted on their couches to spot her influence. Instead, they've likely clocked how omnipresent sombr is, from his drab Saturday Night Live performance to his hit singles stuffing thick classic-rock basslines under gaudy disco vocals. It's all just generic enough to earn a vote. —Nina Corcoran

Should Win: Dijon

Will Win: Cirkut

In recent years, the formula for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical success has been no secret: Simply be Jack Antonoff, undisputed category daddy from 2022-24. If that is too big an ask, your best bet might be to hew to the Antonoff mold, as 2025 winner Dan Nigro did. By forming a songwriting partnership with a household name (in his case, Olivia Rodrigo), a producer can become synonymous with their success and save voters the trouble of asking tricky questions like what it means to be a great producer in a vacuum. This year's award, then, is destined to break from custom. Though each nominee has a formidable résumé of A-list collaborators, none has an instant co-writing association with a single Academy darling.

Dan Auerbach nearly fits the bill, but his flagship project, Black Keys' No Rain, No Flowers, picked up zero nominations outright, and his recent production for the likes of Miles Kane and Moonrisers barely moves the needle. Blake Mills, a third-time nominee in the category, has oodles of goodwill but a recent slate—Lucy Dacus, Perfume Genius, Japanese Breakfast—that has similarly failed to grab voter lapels. A win for Sounwave, solely based on his co-production of Kendrick Lamar's GNX, would feel generous for the least characterful album of Lamar's career. And while Dijon ought to clinch it on maverick factor alone—both for his own Baby songs and those he exported to Justin Bieber's Swag—it feels like the year of Cirkut. With seven nominations overall, the Canadian superproducer's résumé lands one banger after another: Lady Gaga's “Disease” and “Abracadabra” have basic muscle memory on their side, and his productions for the Weeknd, Jade, and Ed Sheeran showcase his Academy-baiting ease in sliding between pop pizzazz and radio-friendly mush. —Jazz Monroe

Should Win: Lady Gaga: Mayhem

Will Win: Lady Gaga: Mayhem

Now here's one that Lady Gaga can and should run away with handily. Let's break it down. “Pop”: She last won Best Pop Vocal Album in 2011 for The Fame Monster, which reshaped pop music in its image, and Mayhem is arguably her best full-length project since. “Vocal”: Nobody has pipes like Gaga, and a decade-and-a-half of training for the stage and screen has made her a more dynamic, expressive singer. “Album”: Sure, after 17 tracks, Mayhem limps to the finish line a bit, but show me a stronger run of pop singles (and could've-been singles) from this year's eligibility period than “Disease” into “Abracadabra” into “Garden of Eden” into “Perfect Celebrity.” It's hard to imagine even last year's winner, Sabrina Carpenter, standing a chance against the grande dame herself. —Walden Green

Should Win: FKA twigs: Eusexua

Will Win: PinkPantheress: Fancy That

Best Dance/Electronic Album is geared to reward albums that shimmy right up to the border between marquee electronic music and widescreen pop. This is particularly true given how the dance categories are divided: While tracks are split into Best Dance Pop Recording and Best Dance/Electronic Recording, no Best Dance Pop Album award exists. Had that category been invented this year, you would imagine it was made for PinkPantheress. The UK producer-songwriter seamlessly integrates silky pop hooks into retro productions that would have slotted neatly into an HMV Dance rack in the late 1990s. Yet this now feels like the true zeitgeist, a pop record if ever there was one.

Fancy That might deserve to take this category, too, even if FKA Twigs's dazzling return-to-form Eusexua feels like a more radical pick. Relative to the Recording Academy's dire track record in recognizing innovation, it is mildly heartening to see that Skrillex remains in favor after veering into more adventurous sounds; his latest mashes together a furiously hectic, tour-de-brute-force of dance underworlds with a reinvention of his trademark EDM pugilism. Unsurprisingly, no such reinvention is forthcoming from festival-lineup autofills Rüfüs Du Sol or two-time Grammy winner Fred Again… Knowing the Grammys, however, Fred fatigue might just work in his favor: The populist producer has demonstrated an impressive ability to build dancefloors in the middle of the road without getting knocked down—just the sort of bravery the Academy tends to reward. —Jazz Monroe

Should Win: Hayley Williams: “Mirtazapine”

Will Win: Turnstile: “Never Enough”

The best rock songs should make you acutely aware of the blood pumping through your veins. That might explain how Amyl and the Sniffers ended up with a well-deserved nomination this year thanks to “U Should Not Be Doing That.” No matter how palatable the fiery Australian punk band has become, watching singer Amy Taylor parade around in assless chaps and wag her tongue reminds you what unpredictability looks like.

Surprisingly, the rest of the nominations are even more memorable. The old guard nod goes to Linkin Park for “The Emptiness Machine,” a striking pick because of what's missing—the late Chester Bennington's iconic, belatedly revered vocals. Yungblud's live rendition of the Black Sabbath classic “Changes” gets an emotional charge usually absent from his melodramatic shtick due not to the faithfulness with which he delivers it (though that's appreciated for once), but the massive crowd wistfully singing along in Ozzy's absence.

It's funny that two of the best bandleaders in rock known for freeform dance moves and a comfortability howling on the mic, Hayley Williams and Brendan Yates, are facing off with their own tight-knit pop-rock songs. “Never Enough” is Turnstile's grand return and a continuation of Glow On in sound. With a split vote, Turnstile could pull ahead through sheer radio airplay alone. It's not a shame, per se, but it does make Hayley Williams' single that much punchier by comparison. Williams sing-screams her way through “Mirtazapine,” an ode to the medication that helps us overcome depression, with enough vehemence and maniacal laughter to get you jumping along. —Nina Corcoran

Should Win: Wet Leg: Moisturizer

Will Win: The Cure: Songs of a Lost World

All five artists up for Best Alternative Music Album have earned nominations in the past, two of whom—Bon Iver and Wet Leg—won in this exact category. There's the personification of millennial indie-rock's big breakthrough now settling into its yacht-rock groove with SABLE, fABLE, the punk-goes-pop star going solo on her own terms with Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party, and the shapeshifting rapper who intentionally counteracts hip-hop's stylistic stereotypes with the ‘80s dance-indebted Don't Tap the Glass. In fact, everyone here already has a Grammy except for the Cure, whose music has influenced generations—and likely their fellow nominees. Why wouldn't their long-awaited, perpetually delayed, comeback album Songs of a Lost World win? At the bare minimum, it would eradicate the go-to ammo for damaging the Recording Academy's credibility: You're telling me the Cure never won a single award?

And yet, if we're not looking at the past, Wet Leg should bring home the trophy. Even with the relentless accolades behind their previous album, they aren't an easy shoo-in—most of all because Moisturizer is less immediate, slower-paced, and more nuanced than their self-titled debut. In allowing lead singer and guitarist Rhian Teasdale to get lost, Wet Leg found a stronger, more affecting side of themselves as a band. If the Alternative Music categories at the Grammys remain one of the few spots for younger artists to shine, then Wet Leg's Moisturizer speaks to what's popular in the present moment while demonstrating where the next generation of alternative artists might veer tomorrow. —Nina Corcoran

Should Win: Tyler, the Creator: “Sticky” [ft. GloRilla, Sexyy Red & Lil Wayne]

Will Win: Clipse, John Legend, Voices of Fire, Pusha T & Malice: “The Birds Don't Sing”

It's an annual tradition to mock the mainstream jetsam you find in Grammy rap nominations, but 2026's Best Song nods are far less embarrassing than years' past, with some worthy contenders: Tyler, the Creator's cross-generational posse cut, “Sticky”; Kendrick Lamar's beat-flipping hyphy single, “TV Off”; and GloRilla's rowdy hype anthem, “TGIF” (Glo actually appears twice in this category, thanks to her guest spot on “Sticky”).

While Tyler may deserve the gold—not only for smarty pairing himself with Glo, Sexyy Red, and Lil Wayne but for coaxing a far better verse out of Weezy than anything he did on Tha Carter VI—expect voters to play it safe, skipping Doechii's überviral “Anxiety” for the most heartfelt song in Clipse's catalog. The rap veterans' “Birds Don't Sing” is a middle-of-the-road tearjerker about their mother's passing and includes a hook by 13-time Grammy winner John Legend. It's as close to Grammy bait as you can get in a rap category.—Alex Suskind

Should Win: Perfume Genius: Glory

Will Win: Bad Bunny: Debí Tirar Más Fotos

A new Grammys category is an exciting proposition because it lets today's voters create their own value system without the burden of decades of precedent. Although based on the inaugural class of Best Album Cover nominees, I could not possibly tell you what those values are. Beige, maybe? That's what the inclusion of Wet Leg's Moisturizer (great album) and Djo's The Crux (not-so-great album) would indicate. Meanwhile, Tyler, the Creator's noir-indebted portraiture serves more as stand-in for the entire visual universe that the hip-hop auteur built around Chromakopia. (I'm also partial to the deluxe cover.) Eric Rojas' photography for for Debí Tirar Más Fotos—a striking visual metaphor for the influx of U.S. tourism dollars into Puerto Rico during the 20th century—more than earns its nod here, but it's the presence of Perfume Genius that's most surprising, and makes me think he's got a genuine shot at a win. From his striking early music videos to his scores for modern dance, Mike Hadreas would be a pacesetting standard-bearer for this category's future. Also, that waist is just undeniable. —Walden Green

King Tuff has a new album on the way, and it's called Moo. The Vermont garage rocker also known as Kyle Thomas will put out the follow-up to 2023's Smalltown Stardust on March 27 via his own new label, MUP Records, and Thirty Tigers. He's also shared a music video for the record's lead single and opening track, “Twisted on a Train,” and a poem that “further highlights the various uses and features of MOO.” Check those both out below.

“I wrote and recorded the whole dang song in the span of a few hours, which was basically the opposite of how I had been working in the computer,” Thomas said of “Twisted on a Train” in a press statement. “Spending hours moving waveforms around like a zombie, comping vocals, second guessing, trying to make things sound not lifeless, trying to make anything sound good at all, took months. But here on the tape it was so much more alive. More like painting or collaging. More like making actual music. Every move I made stuck like super glue. It was effortless. It was pure joy.”

After releasing Moo, Thomas will kick off a North American tour in support of the album. Scroll down to see all of his upcoming shows.

							By 

	Jon Blistein



	Sly Dunbar, the legendary Jamaican drummer who helped steer reggae‘s modern evolution while providing the backbeat to countless recordings, has died. He was 73.


	Dunbar's wife, Thelma, confirmed his death to Jamaican newspaper The Gleaner. “About seven o'clock this morning I went to wake him up and he wasn't responding, I called the doctor and that was the news,” she said. An exact cause of death was not given, though Dunbar had reportedly been ill for some time. 


	“Yesterday was such a good day for him,” Thelma said. “He had friends come over to visit him and we all had such a good time. He ate well yesterday … sometimes he's not into food. I knew he was sick … but I didn't know that he was this sick.”


	Dunbar was just 15 when he joined his first band and recorded his initial song. It marked the start of a prolific and deeply influential career, with Dunbar earning worldwide acclaim for his work alongside bassist Robbie Shakespeare (who died in 2021). It's been estimated that, over the decades, Sly and Robbie played on more than 200,000 recordings, including the original tracks, remixes, and the numerous songs that have sampled their work.

	











	As the rhythm section (and production duo) Sly and Robbie, the pair played on reggae classics by Black Uhuru, Jimmy Cliff, and Peter Tosh, developing a reputation that would garner them work with the likes of Bob Dylan, Grace Jones, and the Rolling Stones. Sly and Robbie also released numerous albums of their own, and played a crucial role in pushing reggae into the future with their adoption of electronic instruments and more syncopated rhythms. 

	











	Lowell Fillmore Dunbar was born May 10, 1952 in Kingston, Jamaica. Dunbar, in a 2021 interview, credited his sisters with filling his childhood home with Otis Redding, Booker T. & the MGs, and Sly and the Family Stone (it was his love for the latter than led to him being nicknamed “Sly”). But Dunbar was inspired to become a drummer after hearing Lloyd Knibb play with the Skatalites. Before he had a kit of his own, he played on his desk at school, as well as cans. At the age of 13, he successfully convinced his mother to let him abandon school to pursue music.

	Dunbar's first gig was with a band called the Yardbrooms, while his first recording session took place with Lee “Scratch” Perry and his backing band the Upsetters, during which they cut, “Night Doctor.” In 1969, Dunbar played on the album Double Barrel by Dave and Ansell Collins, with the song's hit title-track going to Number One in the U.K.


	In 1973, Shakespeare saw Dunbar play at a nightclub and was immediately taken with his prowess. He recommended Dunbar for a studio session, and the pair hit it off. “The first time we played together I think it was magic,” Dunbar said in 2009. “We locked into that groove immediately. I listen to him and he listens to me. We try to keep it simple.”


	Soon, Dunbar and Shakespeare were playing with the Revolutionaries, the house band for Jamaica's Channel One studio, while also touring and recording with Tosh. Additionally, the so-called Riddim Twins formed their own production company, Taxi, and spent the Seventies working with major reggae acts like Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown, and Barrington Levy. A big part of their success was their pioneering of the “rockers” rhythm, which allowed them to inject more syncopation and energy into the already popular and omnipresent “one drop” rhythm.


	Aside from Shakespeare, Dunbar played on some of the most lauded songs in the genre's history, including Junior Murvin's “Police and Thieves” and Bob Marley's “Punky Reggae Party.”

	In 2021, Dunbar explained how the rockers beat was partly inspired by all the funk and disco he and Shakespeare were listening to during the late Seventies, as well as their tour with Tosh (opening for the Rolling Stones) in 1978. During that run, Dunbar said, the pair “discovered our fears, and we had to change and try to get some energy in reggae because the one drop was a bit light playing indoors in a big arena, a big stadium… When we come back to Jamaica, now, we started experimenting with the open snare thing with the Black Uhuru, and the snare came alive.” 

	











	That more energetic sound defined Sly and Robbie's work with Black Uhuru, with whom they linked in the late Seventies as both rhythm section and producers. With Sly and Robbie's backing, Black Uhuru released several successful albums, including Red, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, and Anthem, which won the inaugural Grammy for Best Reggae Album in 1985.


	Black Uhuru's success also led to greater recognition — and more work — for Sly and Robbie, as both producers and session musicians. They worked on several albums with Jones, including her 1981 genre-smashing classic, Nightclubbing, and played on three Dylan records, including 1983's Infidels. They also recorded with Mick Jagger, the Stones, Yoko Ono, Jackson Browne, Joe Cocker, Ian Dury, and Carly Simon. Sly and Robbie released several albums of their own, too, including 1987's seminal Rhythm Killers. 


	During the Eighties, Dunbar started incorporating electronic drums and samplers into his work. Speaking at a Red Bull Music Academy lecture in 2008, Dunbar said most Jamaican drummers were “scared” of drum machines, while he found them fascinating. “I just want to make beats and it's cool to sit and program something you're feeling,” he said. “But most drummers won't program anything. Out of all of them, I'm the only one who'll program. They think they don't need it, they're great drummers, and nobody would ask them to program. It's another way of recording, so I wanted to get into it.”


	With this new technology, Dunbar also helped usher reggae's evolution into dancehall. While the genre had been bubbling up for several years, in the early Nineties, Sly and Robbie created the wildly influential Bam Bam riddem with just a guitar loop and Banghra-influenced programmed drums (there's no bass on the track). The riddim served as the foundation for several early dancehall hits, including Chaka Demus and Pliers' “Bam Bam” and “Murder She Wrote, “as well as Nardo Ranks' “Them a Bleach.” 


	Sly and Robbie went on to make more dancehall hits with artists like Shabba Ranks, Simply Red, Cutty Ranks, and Beenie Man. They also continued their wide-ranging production work, partnering with artists like No Doubt, Sinéad O'Connor, and Marianne Faithful. In 1999, Sly and Robbie won their second Grammy for Best Reggae Album, this time taking home the prize for their own LP Friends.

Speaking in 2012, Dunbar summed up his approach to drumming, tying it back to his endless curiosity and desire to always be innovating .“When I see the red light, I go for it,” he said. “I take chances and have a different thing.

	











	“I try to be different but I'm not putting down other drummers because I respect all drummers and look up to them a lot,” he added. “But I think for me to come to the marketplace and make a statement I have to find something that people will like and people will enjoy, so I'm always on the searching side of things. I'm still searching, I'm looking, I listen every day for ideas.”

	David Fear



	You wouldn't call it an elephant in the room necessarily. But for decades, when people talked about Marianne Faithfull, they had a nagging tendency to focus on a single aspect of her life — the one that reduced the singer/songwriter/Swingin' Sixties icon to a footnote in someone else's career. Broken English knows this. This documentary on the late, great artist, which made its U.S. premiere last night at Sundance after debuting in Venice last year, is well aware that Faithfull's association with other famous folks too often overshadowed her own accomplishments. So it goes out of its way early on to address this head-on.


	“A career spanning six decades,” Tilda Swinton says, sitting at a desk and speaking into a microcassette recorder, “over 30 albums, a vast stream of adoring collaborators, from Paul McCartney to Metallica to the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra, a Grammy nomination for [her 1979 album] Broken English, the Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres awarded by the French government … She survived overdoses, addictions, cancer, and more recently, a coma brought on by Covid.”

	











	A brief pause. “And yet, to the world at large, she's still just Mick Jagger's girlfriend,” she adds. “Well, fuck that.” Fuck that, indeed.




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	It's worth noting that Swinton is one of several actors playing employees of the Ministry of Not Forgetting, a fictional institution meant to evoke memories of vintage British bureaucratic organizations of the 20th century; you keep expecting the theme to Brazil to play every time the movie cuts to the cluttered offices inhabited by these clerks. According to Swinton's nameless administrator, Faithfull is the ministry's first subject to receive a deep-dive report. One of her underlings, an eager-beaver new recruit (George MacKay) in the records department, is the case manager. Faithfull herself candidly answers most of his questions — she greets the sight of the infamous “Naked Girl at Stone's Party” tabloid headline with a curt “I'm not gonna go there” — while dressed in a suit and tie and sporting an oxygen tube in her nose. Occasionally, musicians ranging from Beth Orton to ex-Savages singer Jehnny Beth stop by to perform a song. Watching Courtney Love and Thurston Moore tear into “Times Square” feels like a gift from the heavens.

	Documentarians Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, who also gave us the ruminative Nick Cave portrait 20,000 Days on Earth (2014), use this as an elaborate framing device, the sort of oddball choice that doesn't feel necessary yet also doesn't detract from the goal at hand. Broken English is a corrective, allowing Faithfull to set numerous records straight and a handful of female artists like Sienna Guillory and Sophie Fiennes to call out the rampant misogyny she faced in the media (cue a damning montage of sexist questions asked by clueless chat-show hosts). But it gives the brightest spotlight to a singular hyphenate who went from honey-voiced ingenue to gravelly éminence grise, Top-of-the-Pops poster child to post-punk cabaret act, cautionary tale to canon-worthy survivor. The woman lived lives, plural.


	It's all here. The first flush of fame with “As Tears Go By,” still one of the greatest Sixties baroque pop songs of all time. The association with the Stones. Her Zelig-like ability to be everywhere history was happening, and her friendships with everyone from Allen Ginsberg to Joan Baez (who sings with the teenage Faithfull while Bob Dylan types away in the background in Don't Look Back). Her marriage to British gallerist John Dunbar, who makes an appearance and affectionately nuzzles with his ex. Her turn onstage as Ophelia in Hamlet opposite Anthony Hopkins, which is where she began experimenting with heroin. The fall, the rise, and the spectacular comeback that was her 1979 masterpiece Broken English — an album of foul-mouthed lyricism and hard-won street romanticism that not only gives the doc its title, but as Faithfull herself said, described her to a T. The same artist who graced the Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus is also seen reciting poetry and turning Pirate Jenny into the real hero from The Threepenny Opera.

	And there's Faithfull, watching her past paraded before her with an amused smile and a sense of high irony still intact. No tears go by on Marianne's part as she reminisces, though you're a stronger person than we are if you don't choke up at the documentary's closing number. Swinton is reading about the necessity for female artists to control their own narratives when she drops her Greek-chorus character and stares directly into the camera. Faithfull died before we could finish this, she says. But she recorded a final performance for the film. We've been listening to her comment on her work and watching others interpret her music. Now she's going to let her voice be heard one last time.

	











	The song is “Misunderstanding.” Faithfull's old friends Warren Ellis and Nick Cave are there to accompany her. “Misunderstanding is my name/What I am is not a game,” Faithfull croons. There were already decades of joy and sorrow and rage and acceptance in the way she sang the tune on 2018's Negative Capability, but it all feels multiplied a hundredfold as she winds through the words here. When she goes up a note at the end of “Such a shame, no way to live/But hard to get away from,” it's enough to crack you in half.

Welcoming fresh talent to the roster, Strangelove introduces HASKELL with his new single “Ice” – a release that feels purpose-built to signal the label's tougher, more decisive evolution.

If you've been paying attention to contemporary house over the past few years, HASKELL is a name that's steadily become harder to ignore. His catalogue already reads like a who's who of respected dance imprints, with releases on Toolroom, Nervous Records, Myth Of NYX, IN/Rotation and now Strangelove. Among those highlights sits a particularly hot collaboration with label bosses Mark Knight and Gene Farris, a moment that placed HASKELL firmly on the radar of DJs and industry heads alike. Rather than resting on that milestone, he's continued to build momentum with a clear focus on club functionality and long-term consistency.

“Ice” arrives as his first outing on Strangelove, and it couldn't be better timed. As the label sharpens its sound for 2026, the track embodies exactly what that shift represents – leaner arrangements, firmer grooves and a confident refusal to overcomplicate the dancefloor. From the first bars, “Ice” establishes a cool, controlled pressure: rolling low-end, crisp percussion and a restrained sense of tension that rewards patience rather than chasing instant drops. It's music designed for peak-time moments that don't need to shout to command attention.

There's a maturity to the production that reflects where HASKELL is at in his career right now. This is an artist who understands space, rhythm and restraint – qualities that have become hallmarks of his recent output. His records aren't about chasing trends; they're about serving DJs with tools that work across rooms, systems and set times. “Ice” slots effortlessly into that philosophy, balancing toughness with clarity and offering enough personality to stand out without sacrificing versatility.

That balance has been key to HASKELL's rise within the UK circuit, where he's built a strong reputation through regular appearances across the country. Over the past year, that reach has expanded further into Europe, with shows that have introduced his sound to wider audiences while reinforcing his reputation as a dependable selector. Whether in the studio or behind the decks, his approach remains focused and methodical – a quality that's increasingly valued in a crowded scene.

Interestingly, that mindset didn't originate in the club. Before committing fully to music, HASKELL spent years competing at international level in rugby, an experience that continues to shape how he works today. The discipline, routine and physical awareness required at that level translate naturally into his creative process. There's an understanding of rhythm that goes beyond BPMs – an intuitive sense of momentum, timing and endurance that mirrors the flow of a well-constructed DJ set. It's no surprise that his tracks feel built to last across long nights rather than burn out quickly.

For Strangelove, “Ice” represents more than just a strong single. It's a statement of intent. As the label moves into a bolder, edgier chapter for 2026, aligning with artists like HASKELL signals a commitment to club-first music that values substance over hype. His consistency, work ethic and clear sense of direction make him a natural fit for where the imprint is heading.

For listeners who may not yet be familiar, this release is an ideal entry point. HASKELL isn't chasing reinvention with every record; instead, he's refining a sound that's grounded, functional and confident. “Ice” captures that perfectly – cool under pressure, precise in execution and unapologetically focused on the dancefloor.

With serious momentum behind him and a growing catalogue that continues to deliver, HASKELL's first release on Strangelove feels like the beginning of an important new chapter for both artist and label. If this is the tone-setter for what's coming next, 2026 is already shaping up to be a strong year.

An exhibition at Kunstmuseum Basel frames the ghost as a ‘call to attention' that interrupts temporal continuity and insists upon the unfinished work of history

Tracing its subject from 1777 to the present via more than 160 artworks and ghost-related artefacts across nine rooms, Ghosts: Visualizing the Supernatural poses a deceptively simple question: ‘What do ghosts have to say to us?' It's a simple premise but it risks collapsing a history of spectres, psychological disturbance and cultural superstition into a generalised metaphor for human projection. 

A sheet-draped mass, resembling the traditional burial shroud, acts as the mascot for the exhibition. We first encounter the form in Katharina Fritsch's Gespenst und Blutlache (1988), a narrow two-metre-high apparition positioned in the entranceway to the first room, where the nineteenth-century projection-based illusion ‘Pepper's Ghost' – developed by scientist John Henry Pepper – manifests another draped figure, underscoring the theatrical mechanics of Victorian apparitions. What follows is a broad chronology of artistic interpretations of spirits through the centuries, from Benjamin West's painterly depiction of an early ghostly narrative (Saul and the Witch of Endor, 1777) to William H. Mumler's spirit photographs, such as Mary Todd Lincoln with the Spirit of Her Husband, President Abraham Lincoln (1870–75). Here the show positions ghostly presence somewhere between transcendental experience and antiquated scientific experiment. 

As the exhibition shifts from spirit documentation to the interior turmoil of psychic disturbance, the line between observed phenomena and the evidence of a disturbed individual become unhappily blurred. Twentieth-century anthropologist Eric Dingwall's ‘Ghost Hunting Kit' scans sinisterly alongside the drawings of visionary spiritualists Georgiana Houghton, Madge Gill and Maria Hofman, artists who correspond to Hans Prinzhorn's notion of the ‘schizophrenic master' in his book Artistry of the Mentally Ill (1922). The bodily fragmentation in these images suggests that attempting to visualise the supernatural overwhelms the capacity of known or received norms in artistic form.

From exemplars of the haunted psyche, Ghosts then pivots to contemporary artists drawing overt inspiration from outsider art. Rachel Whiteread's Poltergeist (2020), a white shed in tatters made from white-painted iron and wood, mirrors the torn-apart furniture of Urs Fischer's Chair for a Ghost: Urs (2003), both linking psychic fracture to physical disturbance. A subsequent room surveys twentieth- century approaches, ranging from René Magritte's paper cutout ghoul The Comical Spirit (1928) and Toyen's The Pink Specter (1934) to Mike Kelley's Ectoplasm Photographs (1978/2009). Particularly incisive here is Rosemarie Trockel's Der direkte Draht zum Jenseits (1988), a minimalist Ouija board that situates the waning of religious belief alongside modernist scepticism: a wire line linking the letters ‘JA' and ‘NEIN' signals Trockel's resentment of the numinous. In the final rooms, the show zooms in on the haunted-house motif. Shown alongside Corinne May Botz's Haunted Houses series (2000–10) – photographs and texts from haunted sites across America – is Cornelia Parker's PsychoBarn (Cut-Up) (2023), a deconstructed replica of the Bates Motel from Hitchcock's Psycho (1960).

The thin line that Ghosts draws between the inspired, the pathological and madness, and its critique of Spiritualism's extractive tendencies, might have been more apparent through more cross-historical pairings and juxtapositions in what is otherwise a chronologically organised show. Throughout, Ghosts frames the ghost as a ‘call to attention' that interrupts temporal continuity and insists upon the unfinished work of history, best exemplified in three paintings of Hamlet's ghostly oedipal encounter by Eugène Delacroix, William Blake and a copy after Henry Fuseli. The writer Mark Fisher's reading of hauntology as the return of lost futures suggests that ghosts do not simply represent the past, but the persistence of what could have been. In tracing a sheet-draped form across centuries, yet only examining it cursorily as a site of reenacted trauma or the unheimlich, Ghosts misses an opportunity to interrogate the spectral as both historical residue and political metaphor.

Jaxon Smith-Njigba spoke on the Seattle Seahawks' 31-27 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship.

Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay faced criticism for his decision-making in the NFC Championship loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Sunday night.

There were a few plays that caught the attention of NFL fans and pundits as the Seahawks narrowly edged the Rams, 31-27.

The first came on his timeout usage late in the game. McVay took a timeout before Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold found Cooper Kupp to convert a third down with 3:20 left. He took another timeout after the play as he appeared to be getting ready to challenge the spot of the ball. But after a discussion with officials, McVay didn't challenge the play.

The Rams eventually stopped the Seahawks and got the ball back with 31 seconds left. But the team couldn't muster up a comeback.

McVay also faced scrutiny for his decision to have the team go for it on fourth down on their first drive of the fourth quarter. Matthew Stafford led the team on a 14-play, 84-yard drive that ended with a turnover on downs. If Los Angeles took the points, it would have only been a one-point game.

SUPER BOWL LX: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE GAME

""There are a lot of people that are gonna say, ‘Analytics,' and ESPN analytics will say, ‘Go.' At some point, understand the momentum of the game. Understand how it goes,"" ESPN analyst Booger McFarland said on ""NFL Primetime."" ""In that situation, if you're Sean McVay, you bring (Harrison) Mevis out there, you kick the field goal. Now, you put the pressure back on Seattle's offense.

""Now, if you're Seattle's offense, if you go three-and-out and you give the ball back, we don't need to drive for a touchdown. We got a kicker that can kick a 50-yarder and we're on turf so we don't have to worry about the footing. So, now the pressure goes back to Seattle's offense to keep the football.""

McFarland added, ""You can win with field goals.""

The ESPN analyst was far from the only one who questioned McVay's play calls.

McVay was extremely disappointed with the result and said he firmly believed his team would be celebrating at Lumen Field.

""I'm pretty numb. ... I think the finality of all of it when you don't allow yourself to even think about anything other than just advancing, I felt like we were going to be the team on that podium and we weren't, and you give Seattle the credit, but I love this group and I'm never really short on words, and I am right now,"" he said.

Much like office snacks and flashy holiday parties, corporate wellness programs have always struck me as a bit of a scam — nice to have, but not at the expense of my job, salary, or a decent healthcare plan. Maybe that makes me a cynic, but in the zero-sum world of corporate budgets, if it comes down to layoffs vs. avocados, I'm fine skipping the avocados. Unfortunately (or fortunately), I'm not the one making those decisions.

Workplace wellness programs have exploded over the past decade or so, with companies rolling out a suite of subsidized perks, such as gym discounts, mental health apps, and other benefits aimed at attracting and retaining workers. The pandemic upped the ante even more — in the face of a tight labor market and a hyper-stressed workforce, plenty of business leaders looked around and thought, ""Well, a Zoom meditation session can't hurt, right?""

Now, the ground is shifting. Corporations aren't cutting their wellness programs altogether, but they are taking a hard look at what they're paying for. They're cutting excessive, underutilized benefits, scrutinizing ROI, and shifting to more cost-effective, targeted products. They're trying to support employee well-being amid economic uncertainty and rising healthcare costs — without breaking the company piggybank.

Your job still wants to help you out with the gym, but it would rather you hit up Planet Fitness than Equinox. And, if it figures you've given up on your New Year's resolution to exercise already, it doesn't want to waste money on a benefit you'll never use.

In the 2010s, the millennial-driven flurry of ""work-life balance"" chatter nudged companies to invest more in the life end of things. A low-interest-rate environment made such spending easy to justify. Perhaps a smaller player couldn't compete with the tech giants' lavish perks, but many of them did pour money into products and services they hoped might support employee health and morale, to varying degrees of success.

""I don't know that anybody's told me that it's paid off. I mean, I don't hear companies saying, 'Our well-being program has been our secret to success,"" says Josh Bersin, global industry analyst and CEO of The Josh Bersin Company, a consultancy. ""So it does not surprise me that this got really overbuilt and overhyped.""

Now that companies are tightening their belts again, many of these ancillary perks are on the chopping block. Wellness is a fairly straightforward place to make spending reductions, as it falls in the optional category. Returns are hard to track, employee uptake is limited, and costs often balloon.

Data Ramp Capital shows companies using its expense management platform have reduced wellness benefits for employees to $1,103 a year per worker in 2025 from $1,366 in 2023, a 20% decline. In turn, employees have upped their usage of budget-friendly apps such as Classpass and Wellhub and shifted toward lower-cost gyms.

""Benefits are being cut, and then as those benefits are being cut, people are spending at cheaper places on average,"" says Ara Kharazian, an economist at Ramp.

The cuts to these side benefits come as the cost of companies' major healthcare expenditure — the insurance they provide for their employees — continues to rise. Annual family premiums for employer insurance coverage increased by 6% to nearly $27,000 in 2025, per the Kaiser Family Foundation, and are expected to hit $30,000 this year. Employers say that controlling healthcare costs is their primary benefits objective, according to a recent MetLife survey, outweighing productivity, loyalty, and attracting talent.

""What they're doing in light of really large increases is they are going through every benefit,"" says Todd Katz, head of US group benefits at MetLife.

Cesar Carvalho, the CEO of Wellhub, which gives employees access to a network of gyms, studios, and classes, says one of the main appeals of his business is its price point, especially in this environment. ""The value proposition of the company is very simple, they pay $2-$5 per employee per month, and that's it,"" he says.

If I had to make a bet, I would guess that you, the reader, do not fully understand the various wellness-related perks your job offers. That's OK! Neither do I! Companies have been spending a lot of money on corporate wellness — by one estimate, nearly $95 billion worldwide this year — without always checking whether it's effective.

One 2023 Deloitte survey found that 68% of workers don't use the full value of their company's well-being resources because the programs are too ""time-consuming, confusing, or cumbersome"" to access. A separate 2025 survey from Sapients Insights Group, a research and advisory firm, found that under a third of workers access their company's digital wellness platform monthly. Much of this stuff hasn't proven very impactful anyway: A 2024 study out of Oxford University in the UK found that employer offerings such as well-being apps, relaxation classes, and financial coaching generally didn't make workers better off. The exception: providing opportunities to volunteer. (Resilience and stress management training actually had a negative impact.)

Zachary Chertok, a senior research manager for employee experience at IDC, a market-intelligence firm, tells me that spending on physical and mental well-being is growing more strategic. Decisions around these products and services have historically been ""top down and driven by internal company initiatives,"" he says. Essentially, someone in the C-suite or in HR decides there's going to be a wellness push, picks out whatever app(s) to implement it, and everyone moves on. Now, companies are getting smarter at identifying and spending on what's actually being used rather than what isn't. What this looks like in practice is businesses enlisting vendors that offer a potential suite of services or a central hub to manage a set of offerings, rather than contracting with a bunch of ad hoc programs. The model lets them choose which options they do and don't want to include and, over time, decipher what employees are using to refine the offer.

""As wellness spend matures, companies are thinking more about individual use and engagement cases and how spend can be mapped to it,"" Chertok says. New platforms that collect data on what people are using and what they aren't, he adds, helps ""connect the dots on what is actually having an impact and working.""

Essentially, if my work wellness platform realizes I'm never going to download the mental health app, it will stop bugging me about it, and if enough people do the same, it will alert my employer to drop the benefit.

Employers don't do all of this extra investing out of the kindness of their hearts. They do it because they think healthier employees will reduce their healthcare costs, take fewer sick days, and be more productive. That, in turn, saves the company money on their end of the insurance bill. From the employee perspective, it results in an awkward arrangement. For people who use the perks, the benefits are a plus, but workers can also feel like their bosses are simply trying to slap a band-aid-sized app onto a much larger problem of stress, burnout, and overwork.

A mindfulness workshop scheduled in the middle of the workday doesn't help an employee who's so overwhelmed they don't have 20 minutes for lunch. It also fosters animosity, as they wonder exactly who among the ranks actually has time for that. The way to build a healthy workplace culture is for the workplace to be holistically healthy: a financial health app doesn't do much if you're severely underpaid, a gym membership is useless if you're working 11-hour day, a video about stress management doesn't help you figure out how you're going to manage your new, sky-high insurance premiums.

""I think most people would rather have it go into their medical benefits because that's the big cost,"" Bersin says.

Business Insider is giving us ClassPass this year, and I am excited to use it — assuming I don't forget, which, TBD. We lost the reimbursement fitness benefit that came with our health insurance last year, which was more financially advantageous. I remind myself this benefit is an extra, not a requirement, and I hope my bosses know I'm OK if they cut it. I can learn to run outside.

On January 15, 2026, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (the “ICO”) published updated guidance on international transfers of personal data (the “Guidance”), designed to make it easier and more efficient for organizations to navigate cross-border data flows under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”).

The Guidance introduces a ‘three-step test' to help organizations determine whether their international data transfers are considered “restricted” under the UK GDPR and provides worked examples to assist organizations with their determination. In particular, the test states that organizations should consider the following before undertaking any international transfers of personal data: 

The ICO has also expanded the Guidance to set out distinct roles and responsibilities for organizations making international transfers, and now also provides a brief guide, quick reference FAQs, and a glossary on the subject.

The ICO's press release indicated that the updates form part of a broader project to develop ICO guidance. Future enhancements will include further guidance on transfer risk assessments, more detailed information on the International Data Transfer Agreement and cloud services, as well as the introduction of an interactive tool to help organizations assess restricted transfers. Case studies and examples reflecting the realities of global data transfers are also expected.

Ordinary matter—including particles such as protons and neutrons—accounts for only about one-sixth of all matter in the Universe. The rest is dark matter, which does not emit or absorb light but plays a fundamental role in galaxy and structure evolution. Because it interacts only through gravity, one of the most direct probes is weak gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by intervening mass. Here we present an extremely detailed, wide-area weak-lensing mass map covering 0.77° × 0.70°, using high-resolution imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope as part of the COSMOS-Web survey. By measuring the shapes of 129 galaxies per square arcminute—many independently in the F115W and F150W bands—we achieve an angular resolution of \(1.00\pm 0.0{1}^{{\prime} }\). Our map has more than twice the resolution of earlier Hubble Space Telescope maps, revealing how dark and luminous matter co-evolve across filaments, clusters and underdensities. It traces mass features out to z ≈ 2, including the most distant structure at z ≈ 1.1. The sensitivity to high-redshift lensing constrains galaxy environments at the peak of cosmic star formation and sets a high-resolution benchmark for testing theories about the nature of dark matter and the formation of large-scale cosmic structure.

Accurate projections of heating and cooling demands are crucial for advancing towards the sustainable development goals. Here we present a global dataset of heating degree days (HDDs) and cooling degree days (CDDs) for 3 levels of global mean temperature rise above pre-industrial conditions—1.0 °C (2006–2016), 1.5 °C and 2.0 °C—regardless of the pathways leading to these warming scenarios. The dataset comprises 30 gridded maps (0.883° × 0.556° resolution) characterizing climate variability through 5 statistical metrics per variable and scenario over a representative 10-year period. The dataset reveals a widespread decline in HDDs and a pronounced, nonlinear increase in CDDs, with the most significant shifts in climate intensity and adaptation needs emerging early in the warming trajectory. Furthermore, using the ‘middle-of-the-road' Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2-4.5 as a reference, the dataset indicates that the population experiencing extreme heat conditions (exceeding 3,000 CDDs) is projected to nearly double if the 2.0 °C threshold is reached, increasing from 23% (1.54 billion people) in 2010 to 41% (3.79 billion) by 2050, with the largest projected populations affected in India, Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and the Philippines. This HDD–CDD dataset provides a robust foundation for integrating climate information into sustainability planning and development policy.

The global gridded dataset of HDDs and CDDs under the three climate change scenarios (1 °C, 1.5 °C and 2 °C) is available in the Oxford University Research Archive (ORA) repository at https://doi.org/10.5287/ora-w4qpqy522. Five maps are available for HDDs and CDDs per scenario: mean, median, 10th percentile, 90th percentile and standard deviation. The complete list of maps for each global warming level is provided in Extended Data Table 1. The spatial resolution is 0.833° × 0.556° (longitude latitude) over the land surface. Further data are available from the authors on request.

The code to calculate HDDs and CDDs from the temperature ensemble is available via Github at https://github.com/lizanafj/cdd_hdd_mapping. The code for data visualization and statistical analysis is available via Github at https://github.com/lizanafj/python_examples_with_CDDandHDD_files. Examples of how to use the Python code are provided in Supplementary Note 7.

An analysis of Danish national healthcare registry data found that adults with type 2 diabetes who initiated treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors had a slightly lower risk of developing diabetic foot problems than those taking GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs).

At 6 years of follow-up, patients in the intention-to-treat analysis who initiated SGLT2 inhibitors had a similar risk for lower-limb amputations compared with those who initiated GLP-1 RAs (0.8% vs 0.7%, respectively; relative risk [RR], 1.16).

However, patients in the SGLT2 inhibitor group had a lower risk for peripheral neuropathy (3.8% vs 4.9%; RR, 0.78) and a modestly lower risk for any foot disease (10.8% vs 12.0%; RR, 0.90) than those who initiated GLP-1 RAs, the authors reported.

Frederik P.B. Kristensen, MD, PhD, of Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark, and colleagues published the findings in January in Annals of Internal Medicine.

In an interview with Medscape Medical News, Kristensen noted that the analysis was intended to inform treatment selection. Both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are known to lower glucose, body weight, plasma lipid levels, and blood pressure, and have been shown to reduce cardiorenal risk and mortality in randomized cardiovascular outcome trials and target trial analyses.

“We know that optimizing weight, blood pressure, and lipid management may reduce the risk or slow the progression of both ischemic and neuropathic foot disease,” Kristensen noted. “However, evidence regarding the comparative effect of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs on diabetic foot disease has been sparse.”

The findings also add to the body of evidence supporting the safety of SGLT2 inhibitors, following concerns raised in 2016 by results from the CANVAS trial of canagliflozin. At that time, an increased risk for lower-limb amputations was reported, prompting the FDA to add a boxed warning to the drug's label. 

Subsequent studies, including the CREDENCE trial, did not demonstrate an increased amputation risk with canagliflozin. In 2020, the FDA removed the boxed warning, although information related to amputation risk observed in the CANVAS trial remains in the label's warnings section. 

For the current analysis, Kristensen and colleagues used Denmark's national health registries, which leverage unique personal identifiers assigned to all residents within the country's tax-supported universal health system. This enabled a large population-based comparison of patients initiating SGLT2 inhibitors vs GLP-1 RAs. 

The authors noted several potential limitations, including restriction to patients within the Danish healthcare system. They also observed that patients who initiated SGLT2 inhibitors tended to have healthier lifestyles and lower baseline obesity rates than GLP-1 RA users. 

Additionally, any potential adverse effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on lower-limb amputation risk may have been masked by low medication adherence and frequent switching to GLP-1 RAs. Overall, 40% of SGLT2 inhibitor users and 32% of GLP-1 RA users discontinued their initial treatment.

Rodica Busui, MD, PhD, an endocrinologist and professor of medicine at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, who was not involved in the study, told Medscape Medical News that she welcomed the focus on neuropathy and diabetic foot issues, which have historically been understudied.

Busui has extensive experience in preventing diabetic foot complications and amputations, and previously served on the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) Diabetic Foot Consortium. She also serves on the board of directors of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and spearheaded the ADA's Amputation Prevention Alliance. 

Busui emphasized that, as with any observational study, the findings should be interpreted cautiously.

“The study design for analyzing this type of real-world data is very sound,” Busui said. “It's important, however, that these types of analyses are done because they are hypothesis-generating and hopefully can stimulate more studies that can test and confirm the findings.”

She noted that the observed benefit associated with SGLT2 inhibitors was driven mainly by a modest reduction that emerged only after 3 years of follow-up.

“It's promising, but the benefit was small and driven just by neuropathy,” Busui said. “They did not see a significant impact with respect to foot ulcers and amputations, which are, in fact, much stronger outcomes down the line.”

Still, she added, the findings may provide clinicians with additional information when selecting diabetes treatments. The ADA's 2026 Standards of Care emphasize a “person-centered shared decision-making approach,” which considers cardiovascular and kidney effects, weight, comorbidities, cost, access, and tolerability.

“All these nuances need to be considered,” Busui said.

Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter believes that fans should avoid traveling to the United States for the World Cup this summer.

The 89-year-old cited Mark Pieth, an anti-corruption expert and law professor who chaired the Independent Governance Committee to oversee FIFA's reform process from 2013 to 2016.

In a recent interview with Swiss newspaper Der Bund, Pieth said that President Donald Trump's international aggression and violations within the U.S. made it too risky for fans to travel from abroad.

""If we consider everything we've discussed, there's only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA!"" Pieth said.

""You'll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don't please the officials, they'll be put straight on the next flight home. If they're lucky.""

Blatter approvingly quoted Pieth in a post on X, adding: ""I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup.""

The United States will serve as the co-host for the World Cup alongside Mexico and Canada, with the tournament running from June 11 to July 19.

Trump's aggressive posture toward Greenland recently led to calls for a boycott from European countries.

There has also been widespread criticism at home as federal agents have killed two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis, Minnesota this month.

The Trump administration's immigration crackdowns have led to fears that foreign visitors may stay home for the World Cup. Fans from Iran and Haiti are already unlikely to visit due to their inclusion among 39 countries whose citizens are banned from entry.

""The country itself is in a state of tremendous turmoil,"" Pieth said. ""What we're witnessing domestically – the marginalization of political opponents, the abuses by immigration authorities, and so on – doesn't exactly entice a fan to travel there.

""The U.S. is in a similar security situation to Mexico. In Mexico, it's the drug cartels threatening violence; in the U.S., it's a state that's becoming increasingly authoritarian.""

Blatter served as FIFA president for 17 years before he was forced out in the wake of a corruption scandal that erupted in 2015. He has frequently been critical of his replacement, Gianni Infantino.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

After a fortnight that began with 128 players and a wide-open draw, the Australian Open arrives at its quarterfinals with a familiar favorite, a first-time teenager and little margin left for error.

Coco Gauff was just 17 when she advanced to her first Grand Slam quarterfinal.

""Oh my God,"" she thought to herself. ""I'm so close to winning.""

She lost that 2021 Roland Garros match to Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets.

""Plenty of people make the quarterfinals in their career and didn't win,"" Gauff told reporters at Melbourne Park on Sunday. ""That's just how I thought at that age. Now I just treat every match like I'm the furthest away from the trophy, even if I'm in the final.""

This Australian Open fortnight began with 128 players, bursting with high hopes and aspirations. But after Monday's WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz action, we're down (under) to a truly elite eight. 

Iva Jovic, 18, is the gatecrasher here. This is her first major quarterfinal, but she's not approaching this one with the wide-eyed wonder of the American teenager that came before her.

Asked if she felt like she was playing with house money, Jovic shook her head.

""I don't really feel like there is a lot of house money or [an] underdog mentality that I'm feeling,"" she said coolly. ""Because I don't feel like I have been playing anything outside of my comfort zone or outside of my normal level.

""I have come from two other tournaments where I was playing every day and winning a lot of matches. So this week, and the level that I'm showing right now, doesn't really feel much different than that.""

As we enter quarterfinal play, the top five seeds are all still in contention in Melbourne, including four Americans and a two-time champion.

We take a closer look at these sterling matchups, with thoughts from writers Greg Garber and Brad Kallet.

Head-to-head: 0-0

What's at stake: Sabalenka -- who has played three tiebreaks in her past four sets -- is trying to get to her fourth consecutive final in Melbourne. Jovic has won more matches this year (11) than any woman. Both players are making Martina Hingis kinds of history: Sabalenka has reached eight consecutive major quarterfinals on hard courts, the first player to do that since Hingis made 13 straight between 1996-2002. And Jovic dropped an opening bagel on Yulia Putintseva in the fourth round, the youngest to do that in a major since … Hingis, in 1998.

Garber's take: When we discussed some emerging storylines a month ago, one of the topics was which American outside the Top 10 has the most potential. I went with Jovic, Brad, so hey, at least I got something right. She's been terrific, but I can't see her beating Sabalenka in this spot.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Kallet's take: It's incredible that Jovic is the last teenager standing, considering how well Mirra Andreeva and Victoria Mboko have been playing. The 18-year-old American has looked phenomenal all week, picking up a signature win over Jasmine Paolini, but she's yet to face a player with the power and pace of Sabalenka. The World No. 1 has been challenged in some sets of late, but she's yet to drop one all week. In fact, she hasn't dropped a set all season. I agree that Sabalenka gets it done.

Head-to-head: Gauff leads 2-1

What's at stake: It's another generational collision with nearly a decade between these two. At 21, Gauff is playing in her third straight quarterfinal at the Australian Open, the youngest to pull that off since Maria Sharapova from 2005-08. Svitolina, 31, is in her 14th Grand Slam quarterfinal but has progressed to the semifinals only three times.

Garber's take: Gauff suffered some lapses in her past two matches, going the distance with Hailey Baptiste and Karolina Muchova. Svitolina blistered Andreeva with a forceful 6-2, 6-4 win. Nevertheless, I see Gauff digging in and winning this one. She's increasingly dangerous when she's closing in on the finish line.

A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports)

Kallet's take: Yep, Gauff has had a tricky last couple matches, and it's a great sign that she's held her nerve (and her serve) to return to the quarters yet again. But Svitolina has quietly had a brilliant start to the season, winning the title in Auckland -- and beating Jovic in the process -- before winning all eight of her sets in Melbourne. The 6-2, 6-4 win over Andreeva, who had been red hot, was a statement. I'm picking the veteran to take this one in a tight three-setter.

Head-to-head: Pegula leads 3-0

What's at stake: Pegula is into her fourth Australian Open quarterfinal after dethroning her best pal, Madison Keys, in the fourth round. She hasn't been to this stage in Melbourne since 2023, and another win will net her best result ever at the Slam. She'll have to get past another American to get there -- and another tremendous power player. Anisimova is seeking her third straight major final.

Garber's take: At the age of 31 (she turns 32 next month), Pegula continues to produce some of her best tennis. She looked rock solid in her 6-3, 6-4 win over Keys. Pegula has now won 13 of her past 14 matches against fellow Americans -- and has never lost to Anisimova (3-0). That said, I like the way Anisimova is tracking, building on last year's breakthrough success. Anisimova in three.

A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports)

Kallet's take: You're right, Greg -- Pegula looked great against Keys, and hasn't really been challenged all tournament. The wins have looked routine. Save for a tiebreaker in her last match, Anisimova has looked similarly in control. I don't put a ton of stock into their head-to-head -- their most recent match was a year and a half ago, and Anisimova is a different player now. I agree that Pegula -- so consistent and so gritty -- pushes it to three, but Anisimova prevails.

Head-to-head: Swiatek leads 6-5

What's at stake: Swiatek is seeking her second straight (and third overall) semifinal in Melbourne, in her somewhat quiet quest for the career Grand Slam. It's incredible that she's only three matches away from accomplishing that feat. Rybakina, who hasn't dropped a set through four matches in Melbourne, is back in the quarterfinals for the first time since making the final here back in 2023.

Garber's take: There have been a couple of bobbles for Swiatek along the way -- a tough opening tiebreak against qualifier Yuan Yue and a 6-1 dropped set to Anna Kalinskaya. Rybakina has yet to drop a set. The 6-5 head-to-head doesn't reveal much, but … Rybakina won their last meeting, at the WTA Finals in Riyadh. And in their only previous match in Melbourne, in 2023, Rybakina was a 6-4, 6-4 winner.

A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports)

Kallet's take: That WTA Finals match you're referencing, Greg, was quite memorable for how quickly it turned. Swiatek won the first set fairly handily, and then Rybakina came right back to win 12 of the next 13 games. Prior to that match, Swiatek had beaten the former Wimbledon champ four straight times in 2025. This feels like a pick'em between two veterans and champions, but I'm going with Swiatek to narrowly escape in three.

Plus, Alex Warren's ""Ordinary"" ties for the longest Radio Songs reign and Ella Langley's ""Choosin' Texas"" tops Streaming Songs.

	Gary Trust



Bruno Mars' “I Just Might” adds a second week at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song launched a week earlier as his 10th career leader, and his first to debut in the top spot.


	“I Just Might” introduces the superstar's album The Romantic, due Feb. 27. The single also crowns the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot R&B Songs charts for a second week each.


	Meanwhile, “Ordinary,” by Mars' Atlantic Records labelmate Alex Warren, claims a 27th week at No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart, tying Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” for the longest command in the ranking's history. “Ordinary” holds at No. 5 on the Hot 100.


	Plus, Ella Langley's “Choosin' Texas,” at No. 6 on the Hot 100, ascends to No. 1 on the Streaming Songs chart.


	Check out the full rundown of this week's Hot 100 top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated Jan. 31, 2026) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, Jan. 27.

Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.

  


	“I Just Might” tops the Hot 100 with 17.1 million official streams and 40.8 million radio airplay audience impressions and 9,000 sold in the United States Jan. 16-22.


	The single slips a spot to No. 2 on Streaming Songs; jumps 12-9 on Radio Songs, becoming Mars' 21st top 10; and posts a second week at No. 1 on Digital Song Sales.


	Mars has now topped the Hot 100 for two or more weeks with eight of his 10 career No. 1s (led by a 14-week reign as featured on Mark Ronson's “Uptown Funk!” in 2015). Of artists with 10 more No. 1s, his 80% rate of leading for multiple weeks is the highest among solo males, padding his lead over Michael Jackson. Among all acts, he ties Janet Jackson for second-best, after Mariah Carey's 89% mark.


	Here's a look at the staying-power percentages of all acts with 10 or more Hot 100 No. 1s:




	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” adds a 27th week at No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart (63.4 million in audience), matching Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” for the longest rule, dating to the ranking's start in December 1990.


	Here's an updated rundown of the longest-leading Radio Songs No. 1s:




	“Ordinary” is steady at No. 5 on the Hot 100 following 10 weeks at No. 1 beginning last June. It previously set the records for the most weeks spent atop the Adult Pop Airplay chart (30) and Pop Airplay (16). (Warm-weather reminder: It also wrapped at No. 1 on the 2025 Songs of the Summer chart.)


	Ella Langley's “Choosin' Texas” rises a spot to No. 1 on Streaming Songs (18 million streams). The singer-songwriter earns her first leader on the all-genre list.


	The track retreats to No. 6 from its No. 5 Hot 100 high, as it leads the Hot Country Songs chart for a ninth week.


	Olivia Dean's “Man I Need” climbs two places to a new No. 2 Hot 100 best.


	Taylor Swift's “The Fate of Ophelia” falls 2-3 on the Hot 100 after a career-best 10 weeks at No. 1 starting in October and HUNTR/X's “Golden” descends 3-4 following eight weeks at the summit beginning last August.


	Sombr's “Back to Friends” returns to its Hot 100 high (8-7) and tops the multimetric Hot Rock & Alternative Songs chart for a 14th week.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Kehlani's “Folded” lifts 9-8 after hitting No. 7; Djo's “End of Beginning” drops 7-9, off its No. 6 peak; and Swift's “Opalite” holds at No. 10, after reaching No. 2.

	As his administration struggles to deal with the fallout from the latest Minneapolis shooting, Donald Trump has gone back to raging about polls.


	Even before a federal agent shot and killed Alex Pretti, Trump's support on one of his key issues, immigration, was falling and in negative territory in a number of surveys.


	Trump posted on Truth Social, “Fake and Fraudulent Polling should be, virtually, a criminal offense. As an example, all of the Anti Trump Media that covered me during the 2020 Election showed Polls that were knowingly wrong. They knew what they were doing, trying to influence the Election, but I won in a Landslide, including winning the Popular Vote, all 7 of the 7 Swing States, the Electoral College was a route, and 2,750 Counties to 525. You can't do much better than that, and yet if people examined The Failing New York Times, ABC Fake News, NBC Fake News, CBS Fake News, Low Ratings CNN, or the now defunct MSDNC, Polls were all fraudulent, and bore nothing even close to the final results.”

	Trump appeared to be referencing not the 2020 election, which he lost, but the 2024 election. In the latter, many polls showed the race very close, and within the margin of error, up until the end. Some post-election analyses showed that pollsters underestimated support for Trump, but not by much.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The final Real Clear Politics average was 48.7% for Harris and 48.6% for Trump, per an NBC News analysis. The final result was 49.8% for Trump and 48.3% for Harris. The most contested swing states — Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan — also were tight and well within the margin of error, per NBC News.

	











	Trump added, “Something has to be done about Fraudulent Polling. Even the Polls of FoxNews and The Wall Street Journal have been, over the years, terrible! There are great Pollsters that called the Election right, but the Media does not want to use them in any way, shape, or form. Isn't it sad what has happened to American Journalism, but I am going to do everything possible to keep this Polling SCAM from moving forward!”


	News polling is protected by the First Amendment, but Trump has sought to litigate those who were off. He sued pollster Ann Selzer and the Des Moines Register over a 2024 pre-election poll showing him behind in Iowa, yet he went on to win the state. His lawsuit cited an Iowa consumer law, and his state litigation is pending.


	Last week, following a poor New York Times/Siena Poll, Trump said he would sue the publication, adding a claim to a defamation lawsuit he filed last year. The poll showed that 49% of those surveyed said that the country was worse off under Trump, versus 32% who said better.


	Charlie Stadtlander, a spokesman for the Times, said in a statement last week, “President Trump likes polls that appear favorable to him and dislikes polls that do not. But whether a poll is good or bad for the president has no bearing on our methodology. We aim to produce the most reliable survey of public opinion possible, and our polls have been widely cited for their rigor.”


	Pretti was killed on Saturday by one or more federal agents. The Trump administration claimed that the 37-year-old nurse “wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” But bystander videos quickly disputed that claim. Even though Pretti was carrying a firearm, analyses from CNN, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post concluded that an officer took what appeared to be Pretti's gun from him before he was shot.


	The shooting of Pretti has led to national outrage, with Democrats vowing to withhold votes on Department of Homeland Security funding and conservative voices, like The Wall Street Journal editorial page, calling for a pause in ICE operations.


	Earlier on Monday, Trump announced a move that has led to speculation of a shake up among those leading his immigration crackdown. He said that he would be sending his border czar, Tom Homan, to Minnesota, calling him “tough but fair.” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Homan would be managing ICE operations on the ground, a move that seemingly undercuts the role of Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
