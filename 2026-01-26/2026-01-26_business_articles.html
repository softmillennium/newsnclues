                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Zoom popped 11% on Monday after analysts at Baird estimated that the company's investment in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic could be worth between $2 billion to $4 billion, depending on dilution assumptions. In May 2023, Anthropic announced a partnership with Zoom and revealed that Zoom Ventures had invested in the company. Baird's analysts estimate that all, or at least the "vast majority," of that investment went to Anthropic. The startup is currently valued at $350 billion, suggesting Zoom could see a return of roughly 78 times its investment, the analysts said. "While we (and the market) have been primarily focused on ZM's ability to gradually reaccelerate revenue growth and capture AI opportunities, the quieter, hidden gem might be its $51 million investment in Anthropic in 2023,"  the analysts wrote in a Monday note. Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. But as the pandemic subsided and many workers returned to in-person roles, Zoom's stock has tumbled from its highs. The company's investment in Anthropic could prove to be a bright spot, Baird's analysts said. "ZM is literally invested in Anthropic's Claude success, and as Anthropic IPO rumors accelerate, the investment could become even more meaningful," the analysts wrote.

Then, federal agents fatally shot Alex Pretti in Minneapolis. That's because Democratic senators now say they won't vote to fund the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS — the department that oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol — until reforms to immigration enforcement are made.

There are only two ways out of this: To avoid a government shutdown after midnight late Friday evening, the Senate would need to pass the six-bill package, which funds DHS, the military, various government agencies, and a wide array of federal grants, among other things. Those six bills have already passed the House, and they've been stitched together into one larger package in the Senate. Due to the Senate's 60-vote "filibuster" rule, and the fact that Republicans hold just 53 seats, Democratic votes are necessary to advance most major bills, including this one. But the GOP has balked so far at that idea. There are a few reasons why this one wouldn't be as bad. For one, it would only be a partial shutdown, because lawmakers have already passed several bills to fund the government through September 30. Additionally, the path out of a shutdown is more straightforward. In the fall, Democrats were demanding changes to healthcare while holding all of government funding back. This time, Democrats are only objecting to the DHS funding. Still, the DHS bill doesn't just fund ICE and border patrol. That raises the possibility of delays at airports and issues with disaster aid if the department goes unfunded for a long period of time. Additionally, ICE will remain funded, even if the DHS bill doesn't pass for a long time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Michael Burry, the investor made famous by his bet against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis, disclosed that he has been buying shares of one-time meme darling GameStop. I expect I am buying at what may soon be 1x tangible book value / 1x net asset value," Burry said in a Substack post published Monday. Shares of GameStop surged nearly 8% Monday following the news. Burry, who recently closed his hedge fund Scion Asset Management, said his investment is a long-term value play rather than a wager on renewed meme-stock speculation. GameStop was at the center of a meme-stock frenzy that erupted roughly five years ago, when retail traders coordinating on online forums drove the shares to extraordinary heights and forced massive short-covering by hedge funds. "I am not counting on a short squeeze to realize long-term value," he wrote. I am willing to hold long-term, and I am excited to see where this goes. I am fifteen years his senior, but not too old to be patient." The stock has since given back most of those gains as trading activity normalized and speculative interest waned. Still, GameStop has taken advantage of periods of elevated investor interest to raise billions of dollars through equity offerings, leaving it with a substantial cash pile. "Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons," Burry wrote. "He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business." The video game retailer began buying bitcoin last year in a similar move made famous by MicroStrategy. Cohen said at the time that the decision to buy bitcoin is driven by macro concerns as the digital coin, with its fixed supply and decentralized nature, could serve as protection against certain risks. "I do not know about this Bitcoin thing, but I cannot argue with what has been done so far," Burry said. Just last week, Cohen snapped up 1 million shares of GameStop, according to disclosures filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a Jan. 21 SEC filing, he noted that it's "essential" for the CEO of a public company to buy shares with his or her own personal funds "in order to further strengthen alignment with stockholders."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A massive winter storm is battering the US, bringing heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain to millions of Americans. At least 18 people have died from weather-related causes, according to the Associated Press. As snowfall picked up in New York City, Mayor Zohran Mamdani announced schools would operate remotely on Monday due to the weather. "I encourage other employers to do the same, just to keep people off the roads and think about this," she said. Here's where else the storm is set to hit. Heavy snow is continuing to fall across large parts of the northeastern US. The Great Lakes region is also set for a fresh wave of snow, travelling south from Canada, the NWS said Monday. ET on Monday, extreme cold weather warnings are in effect for parts of 18 of the contiguous states, including Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri. In Arkansas, some areas recorded around seven inches of snowfall through Friday night into Saturday. Much of the Northeast remains under Winter Storm Warnings, including parts of New York, Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut. Major cities in the weather system's path include Atlanta, Charlotte, Richmond, Washington, DC, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston. Moving forward, the NWS said heavy snowfall is likely to lead to "widespread travel disruptions and closures" that could last several days. On Monday, over 4,900 flights were canceled as of around 11:30 a.m. ET, with all three New York airports canceling more than 40% of flights. Boston Logan was the worst-affected airport on Monday, canceling 61% of flights. Monday's disruption followed the worst single day of flight cancellations since the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 11,500 US flights canceled on Sunday, according to data from flight-tracking website FlightAware. Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Texas and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International were the worst-affected airports on Sunday, per flight-tracking site FlightAware. Washington DC's Ronald Reagan National Airport said airlines had cancelled all flights on Sunday. ET, the airport said that with precipitation ending, flight operations "should gradually increase beginning on Monday." Many airlines are waiving rebooking fees for flights to and from affected regions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As our family's primary vacation planner, I've found we get the most mileage out of cruises. The "most things included" pricing is easy on our budget, and we like the wide range of activities and dining options. Still, I managed to make a rookie mistake with our most recent seven-night Western Caribbean Princess cruise. However, I had a moment of panic when we boarded the Regal Princess weeks later and got a first look at our stateroom. Despite the initial shock, we quickly realized our 222-square-foot cabin could indeed sleep four people. Our steward told us there were two additional beds stored in the ceiling that he would pull out every evening. On the bright side, we had sufficient sleeping space, and my kids didn't have to share a bed. Our steward set up the beds each evening while we were at dinner and put them up again after breakfast. Despite being small, the beds were comfortable, and we all got decent sleep. Casualties included one head bump (me, the first night) and one kid stepping on my legs when he skipped the ladder. On the bright side, having a small balcony (albeit one with an obstructed view of the ocean) meant we had easy access to natural light, fresh air, and a bit of extra space, which made a difference. In the end, we got a good enough discount on the room that I didn't mind a little extra inconvenience. Though I would've liked a bigger bed and more room, our small stateroom didn't stop us from enjoying the cruise. We were only in the room to sleep and shower, and after a day or two, the bunks didn't feel like a big deal. This was the first time my kids had sailed on Princess, and our postcard-sized digs didn't affect how we felt about the cruise overall. Looking back, I can see what led me to choose the wrong cabin for our family. While booking with a sales rep on a previous cruise, I got caught up in the moment and the good deal. On cruises I've been on with Disney and Carnival, cabins that sleep four are configured differently, with a queen bed and a couch that converts into bunks across the room. I should've asked more questions and watched fellow cruisers' cabin tour videos online before booking anything. By the time we'd boarded, our cruise was full, and even if a larger cabin had been available, it would've cost more. Next time, I'd be more prepared, or just book my cruise at home, where it'd be easier to review the details on my own. At the end of the day, even though I should have known better, I couldn't help but laugh at myself.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft announced the next generation of its artificial intelligence chip, a potential alternative to leading processors from Nvidia and to offerings from cloud rivals Amazon and Google. The Maia 200 comes two years after Microsoft said it had developed its first AI chip, the Maia 100, which was never made available for cloud clients to rent. Scott Guthrie, Microsoft's executive vice president for cloud and AI, said in a blog post Monday that, for the new chip, there will be "wider customer availability in the future." Developers, academics, AI labs and people contributing to open-source AI models can apply for a preview of a software development kit. Microsoft said its superintelligence team, led by Mustafa Suleyman, will use the new chip. The Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on for commercial productivity software bundles and the Microsoft Foundry service, for building on top of AI models, will use it as well. Cloud providers face surging demand from generative AI model developers such as Anthropic and OpenAI and from companies building AI agents and other products on top of the popular models. Data center operators and infrastructure providers are trying to increase their computing prowess while keeping power consumption in check. Microsoft is outfitting its U.S. Central region of data centers with Maia 200 chips, and they'll arrive at the U.S. West 3 region after that, with additional locations to follow. The chips use Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s 3 nanometer process. They rely on Ethernet cables, rather than the InfiniBand standard. Nvidia sells InfiniBand switches following its 2020 Mellanox acquisition. Microsoft said each Maia 200 packs more high-bandwidth memory than a third-generation Trainium AI chip from Amazon Web Services or from Google's seventh-generation tensor processing unit. Microsoft can achieve high performance by wiring up to 6,144 of the Maia 200 chips together, reducing energy usage and total cost of ownership, Guthrie wrote. In 2023, Microsoft demonstrated that its GitHub Copilot coding assistant could run on Maia 100 processors. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday said he had canceled all Treasury Department contracts with the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, one of whose employees leaked the tax records of President Donald Trump, and the billionaires Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, to media outlets. Booz Allen Hamilton's stock price dropped by more than 10% on the heels of the Treasury Department's announcement. The department said it currently has 31 separate contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, totaling $4.8 million in annual spending and $21 million in total obligations. "President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans' trust in government," Bessent said in a statement. "Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service," he said. The department noted that between 2018 and 2020, Booz Allen employee Charles Edward Littlejohn "stole and leaked the confidential tax returns and return information of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers." Littlejohn, 40, pleaded guilty in October 2023 to one count of disclosure of tax return information. He admitted leaking Trump's tax records to The New York Times. He was sentenced to the maximum term of five years in prison in January 2024. CNBC has requested comment from Booz Allen. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As an American who's traveled to 44 countries over the last 30 years, I've seen my fair share of unforgettable places. Even dining at restaurants felt affordable, making it easy to try local specialties, including babi guling, a traditional whole roasted pig.

Plus, I could easily find international cuisine alongside local dishes. I often went to Milk & Madu, which served American-style food like pizza and burgers. I also loved spending mornings at cafés in Canggu, sipping smoothies and enjoying breakfast bowls. One of the main things that makes Bali truly special is its people. But here, everyone I met was warm, welcoming, and genuinely kind. For example, I used an app called Grab, similar to Uber, where drivers can pick up passengers on their motorbikes or in their cars. I was wary about riding on the back of a stranger's bike, but the friendly drivers I had across several rides quickly made me feel at ease. Plus, I found an amazing community of digital nomads, creatives, and expats who decided to trade their office jobs for laptops in cafés. As an American living abroad, this made me feel at home. It gave me a sense of familiarity in a new environment and made it easier to connect, since there was no language barrier. During my time in Uluwatu, I met another nomad, and a simple conversation turned into spending the next few days together exploring. Another thing I loved about Bali was the diverse range of activities available. For example, in Ubud, I wandered through the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary, where ancient temples sit under jungle canopies. There were signs everywhere warning visitors to hold onto their belongings, and for good reason. The sanctuary is home to over 1,260 monkeys, who I saw climbing railings and jumping between statues. On the opposite end of the spectrum, I also visited Alas Harum, a tourism destination in Tegallalang with lots of opportunities for adventure. Here, I flew out on a giant swing that went over rice fields. Every destination I've visited has shown me new ways of living, but in Bali, I experienced a way of life that felt joyful, balanced, and connected. Plus, the tropical, warm, and consistent weather didn't hurt either.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a second fatality in confrontations with immigration officers in Minnesota on Saturday, business leaders took to social media to have their say. Microsoft's chief scientific officer posted a screenshot of a statement from Alex Pretti's parents with the caption "Anguish and pursuit of truth" on X on Sunday. Former Meta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun replied "Murderers" to footage of the shooting circulating on Saturday. He has since reposted anti-ICE tweets and pushed back against users who criticize his stance. LeCun has regularly shared posts critical of the Trump administration on social media. Paul Graham, cofounder of startup accelerator Y Combinator, wrote in a post on X on Saturday: "If someone had predicted before the last election that if Trump won, federal officers would be shooting Americans in the streets, he'd have been dismissed as an alarmist." Anthropic cofounder Chris Olah wrote on X that he typically doesn't comment on politics, but recent events "shock the conscience." I immigrated to the United States — and eventually cofounded Anthropic here — believing it was a pillar of these principles," he wrote, adding: "I feel very sad today." The Minnesota Chamber of Commerce distributed a letter on Sunday signed by more than 60 CEOs of Minnesota-based companies, including professional sports teams. The letter called for an "immediate de-escalation of tensions" and for state, local, and federal officials to "work together to find real solutions." Khosla Ventures' Keith Rabois posted on X "no law enforcement has shot an innocent person. Rabois is a self-proclaimed contrarian whose political opinions have courted controversy in recent years. Two colleagues — Ethan Choi and Vinod Khosla — disagreed with Rabois on X. Khosla described the video of Pretti's death as "macho ICE vigilantes running amuck empowered by a conscious-less administration." Choi said Rabois' post did not represent the VC firm's view. Don't know how you could really see it differently. Sad to see a person's life taken unnecessarily," Choi wrote. Ackman said that the United States had reached a point where "there are only two sides to every issue and every incident." "It is almost as if the governor of Minnesota called for protesters to intervene in ICE enforcements in an incendiary manner," he said, tagging Walz. "Inciting the people to rise up against law enforcement is guaranteed to end badly, and now we have seen the tragic consequences." Ackman later donated $10,000 to a GoFundMe set up for Pretti's family after being asked to do so in a post on X by Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. That said, I don't agree with the gofundme that he is an American hero, but his loss is tragic for him and his family." Like Ackman, billionaire LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman is perpetually online, posting frequently on social media. The Democratic donor has been largely quiet this weekend, though he has reposted comments from other people, including one that called ICE "out of control." In another post that Hoffman amplified, an X user called out "chronically online tech leaders" for suddenly falling quiet. "There is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities and executing civilians in the streets," Dyer wrote on X. Jeff Dean, Google DeepMind's chief scientist, wrote in response to a video of the shooting circulating on X: "This is absolutely shameful." "Agents of a federal agency unnecessarily escalating, and then executing a defenseless citizen whose offense appears to be using his cellphone camera," he wrote. "Every person, regardless of political affiliation, should be denouncing this." Minneapolis police confirmed that Alex Pretti, who was filming federal agents when they wrestled him to the ground, was legally carrying a gun. Border Patrol officials said Pretti had threatened them with the gun, but multiple videos of the incident show that agents had already disarmed and subdued Pretti when he was shot. Jason Calacanis, a prominent investor and entrepreneur who is these days perhaps most known as one of the hosts of the popular "All-In" podcast, blamed the country's political leaders in a post on X on Sunday. "Once again, I will remind everyone that our leaders are failing us," he wrote. "True leadership would be to calm this situation down by telling these non-peaceful protesters to stay home while recalling these inadequately-trained agents." He later posted that "all of this violence" could be avoided by fining businesses that hire immigrants who are not in the country legally. Cristina Cordova, the chief operating officer at Linear, a product management software company, called the incident "indefensible" in a post on X. "Those who defend this don't care about law or order. David Marcus, cofounder and CEO of crypto payments company Lightspark, wrote on X in response to the incident: "The number of people who can hold two thoughts at the same time is dwindling at a dangerous rate." "It's not because these anti-ICE protests are mostly inorganic and designed to generate this chaos, or that protesters show up with loaded guns that you can't also be totally appalled by citizens being shot dead on our streets," added Marcus, who is also a former president of PayPal. "Let's just remember we're all Americans for a second." Kath Korevec, the director of product at Google Labs, has called on X users to support their local immigration organizations. Korevec said that she is calling her "congressmen and women and asking them not to approve ICE funding without major reform to how the organization is run." Not looking away, even when it's hard," she added. Josh Miller, the cofounder and CEO of The Browser Company, wrote on X that he has been hesitant to speak on politics — but that this moment was no longer political. Before The Browser Company, Miller sold his startup, Branch, to Facebook. He then left Facebook for the federal government, becoming the White House's first director of product under former President Barack Obama. Miller responded: "10 shots in the back of an American citizen who worked as an ICU nurse at the veterans hospital in town. And our Secretary of War cheers them on from Twitter. OpenAI's robotics head, Caitlin Kalinowski, responded on X, citing the Constitution. Before working at OpenAI, Kalinowski was Meta's head of AR Glasses Hardware.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're planning to buy your first home in 2026, you may want to check out some medium-sized metros east of the Rocky Mountains, where affordability is king and economies are growing. That's where Realtor.com identified the 10 best cities for first-time homebuyers to purchase this year. These locations offer affordable home prices relative to income, robust amenities like quality shopping and daycare along with  a large percentage of young residents ages 25 to 34, according to Realtor.com — all things that first-time homebuyers may have on their wish list. Other places on this list — like Little Rock, Arkansas — are southern capital cities and cultural centers. Most buyers in all these cities finance their home purchases with some type of mortgage, according to Realtor.com data. And many first-time homebuyers have unique needs when choosing a lender, including down payment assistance, exceptional customer service, and a robust loan selection. On top of that, regional lenders offer unique expertise in local markets and customer values. For example, Huntington Bank will pair you with a local expert to find the best product for you — including local down payment assistance and other financial resources. Below, CNBC Select compiled our picks for the best mortgage lenders for first-time homebuyers looking to move to the cities on this list (or similar areas), based on the needs of this specific cohort. Why we think it's best for a low-down-payment mortgage: Rocket Mortgage is one of the largest lenders of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans — government-backed mortgages that require a minimum down payment of 3.5%, much lower than most conventional mortgages, which typically require 5%. With this loan, qualifying first-time homebuyers (borrowers who meet credit and employment requirements and make less than 80% of the area median income) can put down as little as 1%. Rocket will provide these borrowers with an additional 2% up to $7,500. Apply online for personalized rates; fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are available. Other pros for Rocket Mortgage: Excellent customer service rankings from J.D. Some downsides to consider: Rocket does not have branches, so if you're keen on doing your banking in person, Rocket may not be for you. Why we think it's best for Rust Belt Buyers: Huntington Bank, a Columbus, Ohio-based bank has a well-known presence and reputation in the Rust Belt. Each prospective homebuyer will be paired with a local expert who knows the ins-and-outs of the regional housing and mortgage landscape, according to Huntington's website. It also says these experts will determine whether the borrower qualifies for local first-time homebuyer programs, such as the State Bond Down Payment Assistance program. Huntington offers mortgages that require a minimum down payment of 3%. Other pros for Huntington Bank: It has 1,000 branches in 14 states, including Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Minnesota — a relatively large physical footprint, so you can walk in and talk to a loan expert. Power and the Better Business Bureau for customer satisfaction. Some downsides to consider: Huntington doesn't post its rates and terms on its website, so it may be hard to compare them during your preliminary search. It also doesn't have branches in upstate New York, which is often considered part of the Rust Belt. But don't worry, New Yorkers, we have you covered below. Why we think it's best for buyers in New York State: Based in Albany, New York, Homestead is known for its strong customer service reviews and local expertise. It offers several programs geared toward first-time homebuyers, including HomeReach, which provides down payment assistance for borrowers taking out an FHA loan, allowing them to put 0% down. Apply online for personalized rates; fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are available. Other pros for Homestead Funding Corp: Homestead offers a $5,000 on-time closing guarantee if it doesn't close your loan by the contracted date. Plus, it has an excellent customer service record, including an average of 4.98 out of 5.0 stars across over 4,300 reviews on Zillow. It also has an A+ rating from the BBB. Some downsides to consider: Homestead exclusively works in the mortgage space, so you'll have to do your other banking separately. It offers several products for low- and moderate-income homebuyers. Apply online for personalized rates; fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are available. People can sign up for a membership fee of  $10.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most McDonald's locations around the world follow a familiar design: red-and-white branding topped with golden arches. But some stand out for their distinct architecture and unique backstories. From a glass-covered restaurant in Batumi, Georgia, to one built over an ancient Roman road in Italy, the fast-food chain has found unique ways to blend with the local surroundings while maintaining its individuality. In his book, "McAtlas: A Global Guide to the Golden Arches," which was released in November 2024, author and photojournalist Gary He captured the essence of some of these locations while explaining what makes each one special. When it came to picking his top locations, he had clear favorites. Every time Priyanka publishes a story, you'll get an alert straight to your inbox!

The McDonald's in Sälen, Sweden, tops He's list of best locations. Nestled in one of Sweden's biggest ski resorts, Lindvallen, this spot offers a unique "ski-thru" experience. It allows skiers to grab a Big Mac without leaving their skis. The restaurant opened in 1996 and operates daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. during ski season. "The air is so clean and crisp — it's like being on top of the world," He told Business Insider, adding, "When I visited, it wasn't even busy. He said it took him six hours to travel from Stockholm, with three transfers — first, from a train station at Borlänge Centralstation to a bus, and then 48 stops later, another bus — but the journey was worth it. The restaurant opened on October 8, 1990, in Shenzhen's special economic zone. On its first day, it welcomed over 40,000 customers despite a seating capacity of 460, the South China Morning Post reported. At first, it was used as a passenger plane and then as a crop duster, an agricultural aircraft that sprays pesticides on crops from the air. "The airplane location in Taupo is iconic," said He. Then, in 1980, Stanton Friedman, a former nuclear physicist, came across the 1947 news story and alleged it to be an alien spacecraft, sparking widespread outcry. But by then, people were convinced the government was hiding information about alien life, and UFOs had become a mini-industry with several themed attractions, such as the annual UFO festival and a museum, spread across town. But He loves the restaurant for more than just its exteriors. "It has a gift shop," he said, adding, "I mean, it's cool looking, but they have merchandise, which I think is super cool." The gift shop features Ronald McDonald in a spacesuit and alien statues. He's final favorite is the Méqui1000 in São Paulo, Brazil, a spot that combines playful creativity with historical significance. "It looks like the White House but decorated as a kindergartner's art project," He said, adding that the restaurant's façade undergoes multiple changes in a year and is usually adorned with vibrant artwork for promotional campaigns. Méqui1000 also holds cultural significance; it was the 1,000th McDonald's in Brazil, one of 20 nations with over 1,000 McDonald's stores, according to Yahoo Finance. "It's a huge market and an important location," He said. "Culturally, Americans want it [their burgers] cheap, fast, and straightforward, but in Brazil and other countries, people want their burgers a little more dressed up," He said. Editor's note: This story was first published in November 2024 following an interview with photojournalist Gary He.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kenya plans to borrow 125 billion shillings ($969 million) in short-term syndicated loans this year to fund ongoing road construction, with plans to refinance the debt later through longer-term bonds backed by a 25 shillings-per-litre fuel levy. Kenya plans to borrow 125 billion shillings ($969 million) in short-term syndicated loans this year to fund ongoing road construction, with plans to refinance the debt later through longer-term bonds backed by a 25 shillings-per-litre fuel levy. This move will bring the total funds raised by securitising future fuel levy flows to 300 billion shillings, according to Bloomberg. Last year, Kenya raised 175 billion shillings in syndicated loans, which were used primarily to settle outstanding payments to road contractors. “These funds will be used to support ongoing works given that we have already settled pending bills and told contractors to restart works,” Agumbi said in an interview. The loans will be evenly split between local currency and dollars. Facing limited fiscal space after anti-government protests in June 2024, the government under President William Ruto has increasingly turned to alternative financing, including privatisation and securitisation of the fuel levy, to fund infrastructure. By law, Kenya can only securitise half of the 25 shillings-per-litre gasoline and diesel tax.
