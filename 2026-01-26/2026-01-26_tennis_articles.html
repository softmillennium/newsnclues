                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coco Gauff was just 17 when she advanced to her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. She lost that 2021 Roland Garros match to Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets. "Plenty of people make the quarterfinals in their career and didn't win," Gauff told reporters at Melbourne Park on Sunday. But after Monday's WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz action, we're down (under) to a truly elite eight. This is her first major quarterfinal, but she's not approaching this one with the wide-eyed wonder of the American teenager that came before her. "I don't really feel like there is a lot of house money or [an] underdog mentality that I'm feeling," she said coolly. "Because I don't feel like I have been playing anything outside of my comfort zone or outside of my normal level. "I have come from two other tournaments where I was playing every day and winning a lot of matches. So this week, and the level that I'm showing right now, doesn't really feel much different than that." As we enter quarterfinal play, the top five seeds are all still in contention in Melbourne, including four Americans and a two-time champion. We take a closer look at these sterling matchups, with thoughts from writers Greg Garber and Brad Kallet. What's at stake: Sabalenka -- who has played three tiebreaks in her past four sets -- is trying to get to her fourth consecutive final in Melbourne. Jovic has won more matches this year (11) than any woman. Both players are making Martina Hingis kinds of history: Sabalenka has reached eight consecutive major quarterfinals on hard courts, the first player to do that since Hingis made 13 straight between 1996-2002. She's been terrific, but I can't see her beating Sabalenka in this spot. Kallet's take: It's incredible that Jovic is the last teenager standing, considering how well Mirra Andreeva and Victoria Mboko have been playing. The 18-year-old American has looked phenomenal all week, picking up a signature win over Jasmine Paolini, but she's yet to face a player with the power and pace of Sabalenka. 1 has been challenged in some sets of late, but she's yet to drop one all week. In fact, she hasn't dropped a set all season. What's at stake: It's another generational collision with nearly a decade between these two. At 21, Gauff is playing in her third straight quarterfinal at the Australian Open, the youngest to pull that off since Maria Sharapova from 2005-08. Svitolina, 31, is in her 14th Grand Slam quarterfinal but has progressed to the semifinals only three times. Garber's take: Gauff suffered some lapses in her past two matches, going the distance with Hailey Baptiste and Karolina Muchova. Nevertheless, I see Gauff digging in and winning this one. A post shared by TNT Sports (@tntsports) Kallet's take: Yep, Gauff has had a tricky last couple matches, and it's a great sign that she's held her nerve (and her serve) to return to the quarters yet again. But Svitolina has quietly had a brilliant start to the season, winning the title in Auckland -- and beating Jovic in the process -- before winning all eight of her sets in Melbourne. The 6-2, 6-4 win over Andreeva, who had been red hot, was a statement. I'm picking the veteran to take this one in a tight three-setter. What's at stake: Pegula is into her fourth Australian Open quarterfinal after dethroning her best pal, Madison Keys, in the fourth round. She hasn't been to this stage in Melbourne since 2023, and another win will net her best result ever at the Slam. Anisimova is seeking her third straight major final. Garber's take: At the age of 31 (she turns 32 next month), Pegula continues to produce some of her best tennis. She looked rock solid in her 6-3, 6-4 win over Keys. That said, I like the way Anisimova is tracking, building on last year's breakthrough success. Kallet's take: You're right, Greg -- Pegula looked great against Keys, and hasn't really been challenged all tournament. What's at stake: Swiatek is seeking her second straight (and third overall) semifinal in Melbourne, in her somewhat quiet quest for the career Grand Slam. Rybakina, who hasn't dropped a set through four matches in Melbourne, is back in the quarterfinals for the first time since making the final here back in 2023. Garber's take: There have been a couple of bobbles for Swiatek along the way -- a tough opening tiebreak against qualifier Yuan Yue and a 6-1 dropped set to Anna Kalinskaya. The 6-5 head-to-head doesn't reveal much, but … Rybakina won their last meeting, at the WTA Finals in Riyadh. Kallet's take: That WTA Finals match you're referencing, Greg, was quite memorable for how quickly it turned. Swiatek won the first set fairly handily, and then Rybakina came right back to win 12 of the next 13 games. Prior to that match, Swiatek had beaten the former Wimbledon champ four straight times in 2025. This feels like a pick'em between two veterans and champions, but I'm going with Swiatek to narrowly escape in three.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When his incredibly successful collaboration with Carlos Alcaraz came to an end this past December, Juan Carlos Ferrero's inbox was surely flooded with interest in his services.Over their seven-plus years together, Ferrero was the guiding voice that helped Alcaraz reach the top of the ATP rankings and win a pair of titles each at Wimbledon, Roland Garros and the US Open among numerous successes. 1 revealed Sunday that he's trading in racquets for clubs, joining Angel Ayora's team.“We'll be working together on the mental side of performance and professional development,” Ferrero wrote on his social media.“We've already started, highly motivated and looking forward to continuing this journey.”The 45-year-old will still be involved with the training center that bears his name in Villena. The Ferrero Tennis Academy, founded in 1990 by Antonio Martínez Cascales and later rebranded to honor the future Roland Garros champion he would coach, also features the "Rural Ferrero Hotel" and several padel courts among its facilities. “We'll be working together on the mental side of performance and professional development,” Ferrero wrote on his social media.“We've already started, highly motivated and looking forward to continuing this journey.”The 45-year-old will still be involved with the training center that bears his name in Villena.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ben Shelton showcased the growing versatility of his game on Monday at the Australian Open, where he rallied past Casper Ruud to book a return to the quarter-finals in Melbourne. The 23-year-old American combined resilient defence with bursts of explosive aggression to seal a gripping 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 victory after two hours, 36 minutes inside Rod Laver Arena. It marks Shelton's third quarter-final appearance in just four trips to Melbourne Park, where he advanced to a meeting with two-time defending champion Jannik Sinner. “For me, the atmosphere is everything,” said Shelton. Down here in Australia, there's no shortage… From my first experience, I fell in love with this tournament. It's one of my favourites marked down on the calendar every year.” 👏@BenShelton takes out Ruud to advance into a 5th career Grand Slam quarter-final 💪#AO26 pic.twitter.com/Qp1kC6H4y3 Once in front, the eighth seed raised his level, striking a series of eye-catching winners and finishing points at the net with authority. Shelton won 97 per cent (29/30) of net points during the clash, according to Infosys Stats, and dropped just three points on serve in the fourth set as he closed out the match in commanding fashion. “It's what you look forward to most in this sport,” Shelton said of his upcoming clash with Sinner, who leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 8-1, including victory in their semi-final meeting in Melbourne last year. I wanted to give myself another shot, improve on some things I didn't do as well last year and leave it all out on the court.” Ruud, who reached the fourth round at the Australian Open for the first time since 2021, will now head home to Norway, where he and his wife Maria are expecting a daughter.

Jessica Pegula brought Madison Keys' title defense to a close Monday at the Australian Open, earning a 6-3, 6-4 win that sets up another all-American Top 10 meeting on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz against Amanda Anisimova in the quarterfinals. Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play Keys, who won her first Grand Slam singles title in Melbourne last year, brought a 10-match winning streak into the contest after three victories this year, while Pegula entered the match 3-0 in Round of 16 appearances at the tournament. 6 seed advanced, improving to 8-2 in Grand Slam fourth-round matches. 9 seed's primary weapons, returning more than 70% of her opponent's serves and committing just 13 unforced errors against 14 winners. Keys finished with 28 unforced errors, as Pegula surged to a 6-3, 4-1 lead she never relinquished. "I've been playing really well, seeing the ball really well, hitting the ball really well this whole tournament, and I wanted to stay true to that and lean on a couple of things that I felt like she would do," Pegula said afterwards in her on-court interview. "I felt like I came out doing it pretty well and got a couple of quick points for her early on. That run will be tested again in the quarterfinals, where Pegula faces No. She defeated China's Wang Xinyu 7-6(4), 6-4 later Monday to reach the last eight, advancing to the quarterfinals or better at all four Grand Slams in her career. 13 seed Linda Noskova, but was unable to add a third seeded win against Anisimova. Anisimova was broken only once in the 1-hour, 42-minute victory, coming in her opening service game of the second set after she had converted her fourth break point of the match. She broke again to move ahead 2-1 and was never threatened again, dropping just two points across her final four service games. "I think the fact that I've been in the Round of 16 three time, and making that step further is pretty special," Anisimova said. "And yeah, I love playing in Australia.

Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a bit different when there is no sun, even if it's quite warm outside still.“But yeah, it's also different opponent. Everything is different in every day. So, I felt quite good out there physically. 2 seed captured his day off for his official YouTube channel, taking fans through a day at the practice courts followed by an evening out to dinner in anticipation of his evening match on MCA.

I felt like the third set was a bit different because it also got a bit later. But this I feel like it's in every court. Of course, it might feel a bit faster because the court itself is a bit smaller than Rod Laver. I feel like it also depends how much space you have around to move. But I didn't feel so much difference, to be honest.”Playing Darderi for the first time in an official match, he struck a clean 46 winners to just 16 unforced errors and broke serve four times while saving all six break points against his own serve over three sets. Though Darderi made a strong push in the third set, Sinner ultimately proved too strong. “But all things considered, it's more or less the same.

Though Darderi made a strong push in the third set, Sinner ultimately proved too strong. “Of course, we try to prepare the match in one way,” Sinner said. “Things got very different from the third set on, for example. I couldn't return as much as in the first couple of sets.“Yeah, I mean, of course you try to understand where he is going to play. Of course, there is a certain percentage. In the same time, if I would lose the first couple of sets, I also would change like he did today. It gets a bit more unpredictable.”Sinner will next face the winner of the final fourth-round match between No. “Yeah, I mean, of course you try to understand where he is going to play.

It had nothing to do with my political views or anything like that.”Anisimova was one of several American players asked about U.S. politics and current events in the first week of the tournament; her response drew numerous comments on social media that attempted to infer her political leanings.“The fact that people assume they know my stance on certain important topics is just wrong, and it's not factual,” she somewhat obliquely clarified.Ansimova later posted and deleted a tweet in response to a circulating video, which attempted to equate an innocuous on-court moment with Novak Djokovic's near-miss of a ball kid during his third-round match against Botic van de Zandschulp Anisimova was one of several American players asked about U.S. politics and current events in the first week of the tournament; her response drew numerous comments on social media that attempted to infer her political leanings.“The fact that people assume they know my stance on certain important topics is just wrong, and it's not factual,” she somewhat obliquely clarified.Ansimova later posted and deleted a tweet in response to a circulating video, which attempted to equate an innocuous on-court moment with Novak Djokovic's near-miss of a ball kid during his third-round match against Botic van de Zandschulp “The fact that people assume they know my stance on certain important topics is just wrong, and it's not factual,” she somewhat obliquely clarified.Ansimova later posted and deleted a tweet in response to a circulating video, which attempted to equate an innocuous on-court moment with Novak Djokovic's near-miss of a ball kid during his third-round match against Botic van de Zandschulp Ansimova later posted and deleted a tweet in response to a circulating video, which attempted to equate an innocuous on-court moment with Novak Djokovic's near-miss of a ball kid during his third-round match against Botic van de Zandschulp “I didn't even hit the ballkid,” confirmed Anisimova, who would have been defaulted from the tournament if she had. “You couldn't even see it in the clip.“People are always saying something. Yeah, people just love talking about stuff that's not even about the tennis.”On the court, Anisimova has left little to question when it comes to her form, which she has impressively carried over from a breakthrough 2025 season. Her win over Wang guaranteed at least one American woman will reach the semifinals by drawing No. 6 seed Jessica Pegula.“We've always had some great matches,” Anisimova said of Pegula, who leads their tour-level head-to-head 3-0.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MELBOURNE, Australia—We knew what was on the line for Madison Keys coming into her Australian Open fourth round with Jessica Pegula—a slice of cheddar apple pie—but Pegula waited for her on-court interview to reveal what had been in store for her had she lost to her good friend on Monday.“I was going to have to wear a Travis Kelce Kansas City Chiefs jersey,” Pegula told CoCo Vandeweghe after a 6-3, 6-4 win over the defending champion. “I was going to have to wear a Travis Kelce Kansas City Chiefs jersey,” Pegula told CoCo Vandeweghe after a 6-3, 6-4 win over the defending champion. “Yeah that was bad,” Pegula told me when I asked about the bet in her post-match press conference. '“I saw Iva Jovic in the locker room before I went on, and she was, like, ‘If you lose, that's way worse wearing the Chiefs jersey.' I'm, like, ‘Yeah, all she has to do is eat a piece of pie. Yeah, I think that was really some extra motivation, because that would have been a tough moment for me.”The final details of the bet are yet to be hashed out, but Pegula believes Keys will take her sweet-savory lumps courtesy of Brady in Orlando. “I saw Iva Jovic in the locker room before I went on, and she was, like, ‘If you lose, that's way worse wearing the Chiefs jersey.'

We got off to a bad start because I randomly said it in a recording, and everyone freaked out, because someone pulled up a picture, and if you Google it, it looks really bad. They also Googled it, looked like it was a Kraft single piece of cheese.“I was, ‘Okay, no, get like a good cheese.' Don't put a Kraft, the plastic thing and just put it on there and, like, that sounds really bad. It's not as bad as everyone thinks.”Pegula knows good tennis in addition to good cheese in Melbourne, breezing into the last eight with the loss of just 17 games. A disappointed but philosophical Keys gave Pegula her props after the match.

Pegula knows good tennis in addition to good cheese in Melbourne, breezing into the last eight with the loss of just 17 games. A disappointed but philosophical Keys gave Pegula her props after the match. “Jess does a really good job at taking time away,” said Keys, who felt Pegula was “dictating play” on Rod Laver Arena. “She redirects incredibly well, so it's kind of a catch-22 sometimes with her, because it's almost like the more pace you give her, the quicker the ball is coming back at you.“I think another thing that I don't think she always gets as much credit for is she hits a lot of very deep balls, so you can't really do a whole lot with them, or if you do, you kind of have to take a little bit more of a risk just because she does a really good job of kind of pushing people off of the baseline as she's slowly taking her baseline…So, I think that's always been, I think, in my opinion, her superpower.”Where Pegula's consistency has regularly taken her to this stage at a major tournament since 2021, it's only recently the No. 6 seed has begun to more regularly factor beyond the quarterfinals—a narrative Pegula sees as more media-driven than anything else.“I mean, the fact that I'm putting myself in that many positions I feel like is a feat in itself. “I think another thing that I don't think she always gets as much credit for is she hits a lot of very deep balls, so you can't really do a whole lot with them, or if you do, you kind of have to take a little bit more of a risk just because she does a really good job of kind of pushing people off of the baseline as she's slowly taking her baseline…So, I think that's always been, I think, in my opinion, her superpower.”Where Pegula's consistency has regularly taken her to this stage at a major tournament since 2021, it's only recently the No. 6 seed has begun to more regularly factor beyond the quarterfinals—a narrative Pegula sees as more media-driven than anything else.“I mean, the fact that I'm putting myself in that many positions I feel like is a feat in itself.

Looking to make her first major semifinal outside of Flushing Meadows, she will face fellow American Amanda Anisimova, guaranteeing at least one U.S. woman into the final four.“I think that's great for American tennis,” said Pegula.“Yeah, it's been pretty crazy how well the women have been doing and how many top-ranked girls there are. I'm just happy to be a part of that conversation.”Although for Pegula, any conversation that isn't about Kansas City is probably a great one. “I think that's great for American tennis,” said Pegula.“Yeah, it's been pretty crazy how well the women have been doing and how many top-ranked girls there are.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lorenzo Musetti downed fellow Top 10 star Taylor Fritz on Monday at the Australian Open, where the Italian is into his fourth major quarter-final and first in Melbourne. Combining elite court coverage with his blistering shotmaking, Musetti scored a 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 victory inside Rod Laver Arena to seal a set of quarter-final appearances at the four Slams. “I think today [my serve] was really working well,” said Musetti, who struck 13 aces and won 84 per cent of his first-serve points. “When I finished last season pretty late, the goals were to start well this year, because I'd never surpassed the first week here. The fifth seed has earned a clash against record 10-time champion Novak Djokovic, who reached the last eight after Czech Jakub Mensik withdrew due to an abdominal muscle injury. Djokovic leads Musetti 9-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, and will enter Wednesday's meeting on a six-match winning streak against the Italian. Two days removed from playing a four-hour, 27-minute five-set battle against Tomas Machac, Musetti showed no obvious signs of fatigue under the afternoon sun. Musetti opened his shoulders and dictated play from the baseline, crushing 33 winners and using his heavy top-spin forehand to draw errors from Fritz. The American struggled early to land his usually reliable serve, finishing the first set with a 42 per cent first-serve percentage, according to Infosys Stats. Sporting k-tape on both his left and right oblique areas, Fritz called for the physio at 3-2 in the second set. Musetti, a two-time tour-level titlist, broke Fritz to love at 5-5 later that set, allowing him to serve for a two-sets-to-love advantage. Musetti again broke Fritz in the opening game of the third set and rarely looked back, clinching victory after two hours and three minutes. “My coach always keeps telling me to be a little more aggressive and try to go for it, take the lead of the rally. Musetti is competing at a career-high No. 5 in the PIF ATP Rankings this fortnight. Last year, he posted a career-best 45 tour-level match wins and competed at the year-end Nitto ATP Finals for the first time.

Musetti, a two-time tour-level titlist, broke Fritz to love at 5-5 later that set, allowing him to serve for a two-sets-to-love advantage. Musetti again broke Fritz in the opening game of the third set and rarely looked back, clinching victory after two hours and three minutes. Musetti kept his cool when serving for the match, landing three deft drop shots en route to holding to love. “I definitely improved my serve a lot and especially trying to be more aggressive with the forehand and trying to use my variation to lead the game,” Musetti said when asked about adjustments he's made to improve on hard courts. “My coach always keeps telling me to be a little more aggressive and try to go for it, take the lead of the rally. Musetti is competing at a career-high No. Last year, he posted a career-best 45 tour-level match wins and competed at the year-end Nitto ATP Finals for the first time. The Italian's victory marked his first hard-court win against Fritz. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

"I think that I was open to trying new things, open to trying to implement some of the things that we have been working on, and that's not always the easiest thing to do, especially here, just coming back and having that extra layer of pressure.

While her barnstorming run to the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup was one of the more memorable tournament runs in recent memory—she won five of her seven matches in three sets, saved match points against Iga Swiatek in the semifinals, and denied Aryna Sabalenka a three-peat in the final— Keys added that her best tennis may still be in front of her, even as her 31st birthday approaches next month. "So I feel like there are some things that I'm still picking up easily and just kind of being open to switching, and then there are some things that have just taken a little bit more time to try to fully figure out.
