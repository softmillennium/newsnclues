                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Launched last year and backed by Mark Cuban and other investors, Skylight's mobile app is built on the AT Protocol, the technology that also powers the decentralized X rival, Bluesky, which now has north of 42 million users. Skylight, co-founded by CEO Tori White and CTO Reed Harmeyer, offers a built-in video editor, user profiles, support for likes, commenting, and sharing, and the ability for community curators to create custom feeds for others to follow. It can also stream videos from Bluesky because of its AT Protocol integration. This surge was likely triggered by concerns over TikTok's change in ownership and its unfortunately timed technical glitches. TikTok's Chinese parent ByteDance will now own less than 20% of the new entity. The deal was a result of increased tensions between the U.S. and China, which led to concerns that TikTok could be a threat to national security, both by collecting data on U.S. citizens and through algorithmic influence. Now, however, some of TikTok's users are more worried about the new American investors and their allegiance to Trump. Those concerns grew to a head when TikTok pushed out an updated privacy policy, which includes permission to track users' GPS coordinates, among other things. So far this January, the app has seen around 95,000 monthly active users. While Skylight has made notable gains, it's still overshadowed by TikTok and its 200 million monthly active U.S. users. Still, Skylight's founders believe their approach provides an opening for growth. That's why we built Skylight Social on open standards.

Both systems of app integrations are built on the Model Context Protocol, an open standard introduced by Anthropic in 2024. MCP launched support for apps in November, drawing on work from both companies. The new apps will be particularly powerful when integrated with Claude Cowork, an all-purpose agent tool launched by Anthropic last week. Combined with the new apps feature, Cowork could be granted access to cloud files or ongoing work projects. For example, Cowork could update a marketing graphic in Figma or use new data from the company's Box instance. Apps are not available in Cowork at launch, but Anthropic said the integration would be “coming soon.” “Be cautious about granting access to sensitive information like financial documents, credentials, or personal records,” the company recommends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This isn't just another Intel chip launch. For years, most updates to Intel's laptop chips have been nothing more than modest performance increases over the previous year. It's a chip design announced almost five years ago as part of the company's ambitious rescue plan to get back on track. Having tested it myself, I'm left extremely impressed. I'm not sure if the Series 3 will redeem Intel's recent foibles, but these chips certainly feel like a big win for a company that really needs one. Namely, battery life and efficiency equivalent to its predecessor (Lunar Lake) with improved performance. The chip was tested in a 16-inch Lenovo IdeaPad reference unit. Interestingly, this is actually two fewer performance cores than the Core Ultra 9 285H, though it gets confusing as to which chip from the Intel Core Ultra Series 2 this chip is the successor to. Here's a sampling of the scores it posted in my testing. Coming back with a chip that outperforms Apple's latest M5 by this much is no easy feat, but Intel pulled it off. But Intel still can't compete on single-core performance against Apple, and that's where the improvement is the most modest. Apple's M5 Pro and M5 Max are just around the corner, too. I'd also love to test the Core Ultra X7358H against upcoming processors in next-gen laptops like the Snapdragon X2 Elite Enhanced, but I don't have them on hand yet for comparisons. Intel claimed that Panther Lake graphics were 77 percent faster than in the previous-gen Lunar Lake laptops, and while I didn't quite see that much of a jump, it's hard to get a direct apples-to-apples comparison with laptops. Either way, as you can see above, Intel has pulled off a huge move forward in integrated graphics. Big numbers are what you want in benchmarks, yes, but as always, how that translates into an actual product you buy is what matters. There are two useful applications for putting stronger graphics in an otherwise basic, thin-and-light laptop. First, it speeds up all types of tasks, whether that's video editing or local artificial intelligence inferencing, without having to deal with a thicker, more expensive device. That's falling behind the Qualcomm Snapdragon X2's 80 TOPS—then again, the NPU hasn't proven itself to be all that exciting just yet in average laptop use. Non-gaming Windows laptops with discrete GPUs still aren't as common as they should be, get poor battery life, and often cost too much. That has left a space for the MacBook Pro to dominate without any real competition. While it still depends largely on laptop manufacturers, they at least now have access to chips that can handle the performance and efficiency. Gaming is the most obvious advantage of improved graphics. The laptop I tested isn't a conventional “gaming” laptop, and yet, the power of that B390 makes gaming not only possible, but actually enjoyable. The device I tested bears a lot of resemblance to the IdeaPad Pro 5i, a 16-inch laptop that had an RTX 4050 when it launched in 2024. The Core Ultra X9 388H really has room to breathe in the newer reference version I tested; its gaming performance is really impressive. Cyberpunk 2077 can hit a comfortable 55 frames per second (fps) at native medium graphics settings—and that's without any upscaling and frame generation. When you do need higher frame rates than what this system can natively produce, such as in Marvel Rivals, Intel has XeSS upscaling, frame generation, and a low-latency mode. The Lenovo machine only got around 36 fps natively at medium graphics settings in that title, but after I turned on the XeSS 2.0 Quality setting, that jumped up to 54 fps without much of a downgrade in image quality. Here's the thing: This is a fairly large laptop. It is already the size of a machine that could squeeze in a discrete graphics card, and as powerful as the Core Ultra X9 388H is, it's still a solid 25 percent behind even an older graphics card like the Nvidia RTX 4050, as well as Apple's M4 Pro. I love the idea of not needing a dedicated gaming device to play games, and this device sells that idea best over the Lenovo reference design. But as gaming laptops get trimmer and MacBooks push forward into gaming, Intel's success here feels like less of a revelation than I thought it would. Presumably, we'll get thinner laptops that can make use of this chip, but we'll have to see how the performance shapes up. As of now, the main benefit you're getting here isn't performance, it's battery life. Laptops with discrete graphics generally get poorer battery life, while this larger Lenovo machine got well over 20 hours of local video playback. For the first time, it finally feels like Apple has a competitor within striking distance of its MacBook Pro—at least when it comes to not having to always make a trade between performance and battery life. The facility isn't just another chip plant. It was hailed as an attempt to bring back advanced chip manufacturing to the states, largely funded by the CHIPS Act. And don't forget an $8.9 billion investment in Intel from the US government, which gained a 10 percent equity stake in the company. Intel 18A is also a return to form in that the previous-gen Core Ultra Series 2 was partially manufactured by TSMC. This was a big deal at the time—an admission of just how far behind Intel had fallen versus the competition, especially in battery life. While it allowed those chips to be more competitive with Apple and Qualcomm in terms of efficiency and battery life, it was a bitter pill to swallow, no doubt. The Core Ultra Series 3 reverses that water-treading trend for Intel, positioning itself well against the likes of Qualcomm and Apple. What happens in the long run is harder to say. But I do know this: Panther Lake is Intel's biggest success in years and should restore some confidence in its future.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sustainability: News about the rapidly growing climate tech sector and other areas of innovation to protect our planet. In perhaps a matter of weeks, Bill Gates-backed TerraPower expects to receive federal permits to begin building the nuclear components of its first-of-a-kind, next-generation power plant in Wyoming. After being largely mothballed for decades, America's nuclear sector has kicked into hyper speed as tech giants scramble to power data centers nationwide and energy demands are spiking for commercial, residential and industrial uses. TerraPower, which launched 20 years ago, aims to be the first in the U.S. to deliver on a new model of smaller, less expensive nuclear reactors that can be produced in three years from fabricated components — instead of the past approach of constructing giant, one-off structures that take a decade to erect. The Bellevue, Wash.-based company has announced a string of new partnerships supporting its operations: “We plan to build hundreds of Natrium reactors,” Levesque told GeekWire. Earlier this summer, X-energy and Amazon shared updates on a planned facility in Eastern Washington. While TerraPower's leadership is bullish on its prospects, there are plenty of hurdles ahead. They include limited supplies of reactor fuel, ongoing concerns about nuclear reactor safety, and construction cost challenges as designs evolve and a supply chain takes shape. Finding fuel sources: Russia was the world's only commercial producer of HALEU (high-assay, low-enriched uranium fuel, pronounced hay-lou), but that source was cut off after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the U.S. has restarted and been ramping up its domestic fuel production. At a recent public hearing in Olympia, Wash., regarding the potential for new nuclear facilities in the state, multiple participants cited worries about nuclear safety and environmental contamination. Cost concerns: Research from Boston University analyzed nuclear plant construction costs going back decades, finding they were on average double the expected price tag, running nearly $2 billion over. Levesque acknowledged the poor record, but said that as TerraPower goes into production mode, lessons learned from the demonstration project and each additional reactor will be incorporated to cut costs. He pointed to the SpaceX aerospace company as a model for that iterative approach. The Wyoming plant was estimated in 2021 to cost about $4 billion; no updated figures have been provided. “Almost any governor in the country now wants a nuclear plant,” Levesque said. And while these renewable power sources are increasingly being paired with energy storage solutions such as giant batteries, nuclear is attractive for its 24/7 production capabilities. Levesque said the company is being cautious in signing future deals, recognizing that it will be mid-2030s until it can hit its initial target of producing six reactors a year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“For months now, Trump has sent federal agents to our cities to criminalize us, our neighbors, friends, colleagues, and family members,” reads the open letter from IceOut.Tech. “From Minneapolis to Los Angeles to Chicago, we've seen armed and masked thugs bring reckless violence, kidnapping, terror and cruelty with no end in sight.” Minneapolis has become the focal point of a large-scale federal immigration operation, employing tactics so intense that many have characterized it as a military occupation. The operation has been marked by confrontations between federal agents and community members protesting the raids, with law enforcement indiscriminately deploying crowd control tactics, including pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets, and sound cannons. The campaign among tech workers began after ICE agents shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis three weeks ago, and it grew over the weekend after Border Patrol agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse at the Minneapolis VA hospital. A number of tech leaders have already spoken out against federal actions in Minneapolis. OpenAI's head of global business, James Dyett, criticized the industry's silence, posting on X that “there is far more outrage from tech leaders over a wealth tax than masked ICE agents terrorizing communities.” Signal President Meredith Whittaker bemoaned that masked agents are “executing people in the streets and powerful leaders are openly lying to cover for them. None have spoken out publicly about the ramping up of ICE raids. In keeping with his anti-immigration views, Elon Musk has actively supported ICE operations, calling protestors “pure evil.” The letter also calls on tech CEOs to cancel all company contracts with ICE — potentially an expensive demand, as several tech firms currently hold contracts with ICE. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Oracle also provide cloud infrastructure to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, as well as IT services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft on Monday announced Maia 200, the second generation of its custom AI chip, claiming it's the most powerful first-party silicon from any major cloud provider. The company says Maia 200 delivers three times the performance of Amazon's latest Trainium chip on certain benchmarks, and exceeds Google's most recent tensor processing unit (TPU) on others. The chip is already running workloads at Microsoft's data center near Des Moines, Iowa. It's part of the larger trend among cloud giants to build their own custom silicon for AI rather than rely solely on Nvidia. Google has been refining its TPUs for nearly a decade, and Amazon's Trainium line is now in its third generation, with a fourth already announced. Despite entering the race late, Microsoft makes the case that its tight integration between chips, AI models, and applications like Copilot gives it an edge. The company says Maia 200 offers 30% better performance-per-dollar than its current hardware. All three companies are betting that custom chips tuned for their own workloads will be cheaper than buying solely from Nvidia. The company announced a software development kit that will let AI startups and researchers optimize their models for Maia 200. Developers and academics can sign up for an early preview starting today. University of Washington scientists and students are using AI to create real medicines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The demonstration, Cohen wrote, would showcase “exciting new AI tools available to DOT rule writers to help us do our job better and faster.” Discussion of the plan continued among agency leadership last week, according to meeting notes reviewed by ProPublica. Zerzan appeared interested mainly in the quantity of regulations that AI could produce, not their quality. “We don't need the perfect rule on XYZ. We don't even need a very good rule on XYZ,” he said, according to the meeting notes. The agency's rules touch virtually every facet of transportation safety, including regulations that keep airplanes in the sky, prevent gas pipelines from exploding and stop freight trains carrying toxic chemicals from skidding off the rails. Why, some staffers wondered, would the federal government outsource the writing of such critical standards to a nascent technology notorious for making mistakes? Writing and revising complex federal regulations can take months, sometimes years. But, with DOT's version of Google Gemini, employees could generate a proposed rule in a matter of minutes or even seconds, two DOT staffers who attended the December demonstration remembered the presenter saying. In any case, most of what goes into the preambles of DOT regulatory documents is just “word salad,” one staffer recalled the presenter saying. The goal is to dramatically compress the timeline in which transportation regulations are produced, such that they could go from idea to complete draft ready for review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in just 30 days, he said. That should be possible, he said, because “it shouldn't take you more than 20 minutes to get a draft rule out of Gemini.” This administration is not the first to use AI; federal agencies have been gradually stitching the technology into their work for years, including to translate documents, analyze data and categorize public comments, among other uses. Trump released multiple executive orders in support of AI last year. In April, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought circulated a memo calling for the acceleration of its use by the federal government. Three months later, the administration released an “AI Action Plan” that contained a similar directive. The department has used AI to draft a still-unpublished Federal Aviation Administration rule, according to a DOT staffer briefed on the matter. Skeptics say that so-called large language models such as Gemini and ChatGPT shouldn't be trusted with the complicated and consequential responsibilities of governance, given that those models are prone to error and incapable of human reasoning. Such optimism was on display in a windowless conference room in Northern Virginia earlier this month, where federal technology officials, convened at an AI summit, discussed adopting an “AI culture” in government and “upskilling” the federal workforce to use the technology. Those federal representatives included Justin Ubert, division chief for cybersecurity and operations at DOT's Federal Transit Administration, who spoke on a panel about the Transportation Department's plans for “fast adoption” of artificial intelligence. Many people see humans as a “choke point” that slows down AI, he noted. But eventually, Ubert predicted, humans will fall back into merely an oversight role, monitoring “AI-to-AI interactions.” Ubert declined to speak to ProPublica on the record. A similarly sanguine attitude about the potential of AI permeated the presentation at DOT in December, which was attended by more than 100 DOT employees, including division heads, high-ranking attorneys and civil servants from rulemaking offices. The presenter expressed little concern that the regulatory documents produced by AI could contain so-called hallucinations — erroneous text that is frequently generated by large language models such as Gemini — according to three people present. “It seemed like his vision of the future of rulemaking at DOT is that our jobs would be to proofread this machine product,” one employee said. A spokesperson for the DOT did not respond to a request for comment; Cohen and Zerzan also did not respond to messages seeking comment. The December presentation left some DOT staffers deeply skeptical. Rulemaking is intricate work, they said, requiring expertise in the subject at hand as well as in existing statutes, regulations and case law. But all that seemed to go ignored by the presenter, attendees said. “It seems wildly irresponsible,” said one, who, like the others, requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Noting the life-or-death stakes of transportation safety regulations, Horton said the agency's leaders “want to go fast and break things, but going fast and breaking things means people are going to get hurt.” If agency rule writers use the technology as a sort of research assistant with plenty of supervision and transparency, it could be useful and save time. But if they cede too much responsibility to AI, that could lead to deficiencies in critical regulations and run afoul of a requirement that federal rules be built on reasoned decision-making. “Just because these tools can produce a lot of words doesn't mean that those words add up to a high-quality government decision,” said Bridget Dooling, a professor at Ohio State University who studies administrative law. But I think it should be done with a lot of skepticism.” DOT has had a net loss of nearly 4,000 of its 57,000 employees since Trump returned to the White House, including more than 100 attorneys, federal data shows. In July, The Washington Post reported on a leaked DOGE presentation that called for using AI to eliminate half of all federal regulations, and to do so in part by having AI draft regulatory documents. DOGE's AI program “automatically drafts all submission documents for attorneys to edit.” DOGE and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. The White House did not answer a question about whether the administration is planning to use AI in rulemaking at other agencies as well. Four top technology officials in the administration said they were not aware of any such plan. Trump's attacks on bedrock environmental and climate laws are inherently fragile—and could reflect the president's preference for political dominance over lasting change. Employees reported major job cuts this week, just months after the video hosting site was bought by Bending Spoons. Eightfold, an AI company that makes human resources software, is being sued over one of its hiring tools. The iPhone maker might be preparing to battle OpenAI's own family of AI gadgets. Razer doesn't know exactly what it's creating, but it still wants you to put money down on its desktop AI gadget.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We also followed Dunk's increasingly desperate quest to find someone, anyone, to vouch for him—hoping the legacy of his master, Ser Arlan of Pennytree, would be enough to get him into the tourney at Ashford Meadow. This week, in an episode entitled “Hard Salt Beef,” well… Dunk has to level up. Your eyeballs won't soon forget the sight of Ser Arlan of Pennytree emerging from a shack (where he's clearly just had a tryst) and taking a relaxing whizz—stark naked, his dangling manhood on display. Last week's projectile poop has nothing on this explicit visual. Does anything in Game of Thrones-adjacent history? Ser Manfred Dondarrion blew him off last week, but some knight or lord must remember Ser Arlan… right? He always knew what was expected of him.” It's a glowing reminiscence that isn't entirely supported by a flashback montage, which shows Ser Arlan was frequently very drunk and fond of singing at the top of his lungs in that state. But Dunk is genuinely earnest, and when we pull away from his memories, we see the young hedge knight is making the rounds… in vain. None of the men—House Florent, House Hayford, House Tyrell—gathered at Ashford have any recollection of his late master. We realize that Egg has been taking in the many rejections and feels sorry that Dunk is being humiliated over and over. He doesn't understand why Dunk puts up with it. “Why do you treat these royal lapdogs like they're your betters?” he asks. He's still got hope that someone will remember Ser Arlan. But his quest is interrupted when trumpets sound and a group of riders, dressed in black and holding banners festooned with that familiar three-headed dragon, gallop into Ashford. We get a close-up of Egg looking concerned. Distracted, Dunk agrees and sets off after the new arrivals. Aerion immediately mistakes the hovering Dunk for a stable boy. He's intending to continue his hunt for a sponsor but overhears Baelor (polite, diplomatic), Maekar (rude and blustery), and Lord Ashford (obsequious) discussing the unpleasant fact that two of Maekar's sons, Daeron and Aegon, have gone missing while making their way to the tourney. The even-tempered Baelor is certain they'll turn up. Maekar, talking about Daeron, who was supposed to enter the lists, mutters, “I do not need to be reminded of my son's failings. He's as kind as Dunk is awkward (even as Maekar snorts at the hedge knight's fumblings) and suggests to the Ashford steward—the phlegmy guy we met last week; he's in charge of running the tourney—that Dunk should be allowed to enter. Dunk puts his foot in his mouth a few times during this chat, but Baelor lets it slide. He'll need to change up Ser Arlan's shield and make it his own. The pretty narrator from last week, now even taller on stilts, performs as Dunk looks at her through goo-goo eyes. After the show, Dunk and Egg (Egg is also delighted by the puppet show, for more childlike reasons) approach. After she mentions she helps create the puppets, Dunk asks her if he can hire her to paint a new design on his shield. His shaky confidence runs out when he realizes he hasn't actually thought about the design, but Egg steps in to help shape the idea: an elm tree with a shooting star above. Dunk introduces himself as “Ser Duncan the Tall,” and she reveals her name is Tanselle, adding, “The boys used to call me Tanselle Too-Tall.” Dunk, of course, turns this into a clumsy compliment. Moments later, he asks his tiny wingman, “Was that ill-handled?” His mortification is eased when Ser Lyonel—the good-time guy we met last week, who took quite the shine to Dunk—appears and drafts the pair into a rowdy, spontaneous game of tug-of-war. After, Dunk wanders the makeshift village until he finds an armorer, who says he can outfit him for 800 stags. But he can't fight without armor. The man—Steely Pate is his name—gives off very gruff vibes, but he's not without reason. He agrees to let Dunk trade in some old armor (Ser Arlan's, no doubt) and to lower the price a little. He also accepts Dunk's two stags (that's all he has) as a deposit, but the generosity ends there. We see Dunk reluctantly selling one of his beloved horses to make up the rest. “Is there any measure of a fool I fail to meet?” he murmurs sadly. In a somber mood, he tells Egg that maybe if he becomes a champion at Ashford, some great house will want to take him into its service. Egg doesn't think much of that plan, but the moment is interrupted when the horn blows: time to watch some opening-night jousting! What looks to be a Tully of Riverrun sets the tone by biting the head off a fish and yelling “For the new gods… and old!” to thunderous approval; his opponent is “Prince Valaar, Baelor's son. Second in line to the throne,” Egg explains. Dunk hoists Egg onto his shoulders so he can see above the masses. The action is boisterous, electric, and… terrifying, at least to Dunk. Egg is hooting like he's at a pro wrestling match. But Dunk's face as he watches riders get struck down and horses collapse betrays his realization that this is what he himself will be doing once he's called into the ring. He flashes back to burying Ser Arlan, and it's a sobering moment. Ser Arlan “was a hard man to know,” Dunk admits. He lived nigh on 60 years and never was a champion. There's still hope for this young hedge knight. But he kept me like we were. He raised me to be an honorable man, and all these noble lords can't even remember his name. “On the morrow, we will show them what his hand has wrought.” Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Neurophos, an AI chip started based in Austin, Texas and backed by Bill Gates' Gates Frontier Fund, says that it has developed an optical processing unit (OPU) that the company claims is ten times more powerful than Nvidia's latest Vera Rubin NVL72 AI supercomputer in FP4 / INT4 compute workloads, while still consuming a similar amount of power. “On chip, there is a single photonic sensor that is 1,000 by 1,000 in size,” Neurophos CEO Patrick Bowen told the publication. This is about 15 times larger than the usual 256 x 256 matrix used in most AI GPUs. Despite that, the company was able to make its optical transistor around 10,000 times smaller than what's currently available. “You just can't fit enough of them on a chip in order to get a compute density that remotely competes with digital CMOS today.” More importantly, Bowen says that it built its optical transistors using current semiconductor fabrication technologies, so it could potentially tap fabs like Intel or TSMC to mass produce them. It also needs to address challenges, like the need for massive amounts of vector processing units and static memory (SRAM). Photonics is a new frontier that many companies are paying attention to. Nvidia already uses Spectrum-X Ethernet photonics switch systems in its Rubin platform, while AMD is set to develop a $280 million hub, specifically geared toward researching silicon photonics. Either way, it appears that this latest development is just a new wrinkle on the photonics frontier, and we should expect many more developments to come as the technology matures.

The latest entry in AMD's Ryzen 9000 lineup, the 9850X3D, is set to launch in just a few days worldwide, but it seems like China will be getting a little special treatment when it does. The set is likely aimed at offering customers a convenient all-in-one solution. Hardware bundles are commonplace at many retailers, especially Micro Center, which once handed out free 32 GB DDR5 kits with the purchase of a Ryzen 7000 CPU. Anyhow, these bundles usually focus on CPU, RAM, and motherboard combos instead of throwing in a cooler. That's not the case here, as you can see AMD, Cooler Master, and V-Color's logo on the box, signaling this is an official collab, at least in China. It was unveiled at Cooler Master's latest press event in the region. The RAM is a 32 GB kit of V-Color's Manta XFinity RGB DDR5-6000 that's retailing for ~$500 right now. We've since reviewed the 64 GB 6400 MT/s kit favorably just a few days ago. Lastly, the Ryzen 7 9850X3D CPU itself has an MSRP of $500, which totals out this package to $1,080 individually, but we don't know the actual bundle's cost. A couple of days ago, AMD said the 9850X3D doesn't require high-speed DDR5. So, there's at least some sort of silver lining with this new processor launch.

It may be a grim time for building a new PC due to the ever-growing expense of RAM kits, SSDs, and graphics cards, but that makes it super important to look after what you've already got and keep your PC maintained and in tip-top condition. Apart from the normal tasks of cleaning out your case's dust filters, don't forget to replace the aging thermal paste on your CPU or GPU if everything starts to run a little hotter. Checking the Amazon price checker CamelCamelCamel, we can see that this new $5.99 price point is an all-time low for this product. Arctic's MX-6 thermal paste is a very popular choice for enthusiasts looking to add a premium cooling solution to their very important CPUs and GPUs. A lot of coolers come with a default paste already applied, but this isn't always the best option, and temperatures of CPU operations can be improved with more heat-conductive thermal paste options. Keep your CPU running at peak performance with an application of Arctic's MX-6 thermal paste between your CPU and chosen cooling option. There is a new Arctic MX-7 thermal paste available, and it boasts better performance, but it's also a fair bit more expensive than this deal. Also, this particular product is available directly from Arctic via Amazon, and not a third-party reseller, so you avoid possible forgeries. We haven't reviewed Arctic's MX-6 thermal paste, but we have tested the previous MX-4 and MX-5 products, and they both appeared high up in the benchmarking charts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With just a couple of clicks, it offers you the ability to convert a single photo into an eight-second explicit videoclip, inserting women into realistic-looking graphic sexual situations. “Transform any photo into a nude version with our advanced AI technology,” text on the website says. The website, which WIRED is not naming to limit further exposure, includes warnings saying people should only upload photos they have consent to transform with AI. It's unclear if there are any checks to enforce this. Grok, the chatbot created by Elon Musk's companies, has been used to created thousands of nonconsensual “undressing” or “nudify” bikini images—further industrializing and normalizing the process of digital sexual harassment. For years, a deepfake ecosystem, comprising dozens of websites, bots, and apps, has been growing, making it easier than ever before to automate image-based sexual abuse, including the creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). “It's a societal scourge, and it's one of the worst, darkest parts of this AI revolution and synthetic media revolution that we're seeing,” he says. Over the past year, WIRED has tracked how multiple explicit deepfake services have introduced new functionality and rapidly expanded to offer harmful video creation. Image-to-video models typically now only need one photo to generate a short clip. For instance, in June last year, one deepfake service promoted a “sex-mode,” advertising it alongside the message: “Try different clothes, your favorite poses, age, and other settings.” Another posted that “more styles” of images and videos would be coming soon and users could “create exactly what you envision with your own descriptions” using custom prompts to AI systems. It's the different sexual positions,” says independent analyst Santiago Lakatos, who along with media outlet Indicator has researched how “nudify” services often use big technology company infrastructure and likely made big money in the process. “There's versions where you can make someone [appear] pregnant,” Lakatos says. A WIRED review found more than 1.4 million accounts were signed up to 39 deepfake creation bots and channels on Telegram. “Nonconsensual pornography—including deepfakes and the tools used to create them—is strictly prohibited under Telegram's terms of service,” a Telegram spokesperson says, adding that it removes content when it is detected and has removed 44 million pieces of content that violated its policies last year. Lakatos says, in recent years, multiple larger “deepfake” websites have solidified their market position and now offer APIs to other people creating nonconsensual image and video generators, allowing more services to mushroom up. “They're consolidating by buying up other different websites or nudify apps. They're adding features that allow them to become infrastructure providers.” So-called sexual deepfakes first emerged toward the end of 2017 and, at the time, required a user to have technical knowledge to create sexual imagery or videos. However, sexual deepfakes have continuously created widespread harm to women and girls. “This ecosystem is built on the back of open-source models,” says Stephen Casper, a researcher working on AI safeguards and governance at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has documented the rise in deepfake video abuse and its role in nonconsensual intimate imagery generation. But they have also been used by men to harass colleagues and friends, and by boys in schools to create nonconsensual intimate imagery of their classmates. “We as a society globally do not take violence against women seriously, no matter what form it comes in.” “There's a range of these different behaviors where some [perpetrators] are more opportunistic and do not see the harm that they're creating, and it is based on how an AI tool is also presented,” Farvid says, adding some AI companion services can target people with gendered services. One Australian study, led by the researcher Asher Flynn, interviewed 25 creators and victims of deepfake abuse. Unlike the widespread public sharing that happened with nonconsensual sexual images created using Grok on X, explicit deepfakes were more likely to be shared with victims or their friends and family privately, the study found. These included sextortion, causing harm to others, getting reinforcement or bonding from their peers, and curiosity about the tools and what they could do with them. Multiple experts WIRED spoke to said many of the communities developing deepfake tools have a “cavalier” or casual attitude to the harms they cause. “There's this tendency of a certain banality of the use of this tool to create NCII or even to have access to NCII that are concerning,” says Bruna Martins dos Santos, a policy and advocacy manager at Witness, a human rights group. For some abusers creating deepfakes, the technology is about power and control. “You just want to see what's possible,” one abuser told Flynn and fellow researchers involved in the study.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But later, they sat back as council members discussed a proposed tech factory. A similar contrast is repeating in communities across the US. Data centers are meeting unprecedented public resistance, with environmental costs a leading concern. Factories tend to create more jobs and drain fewer natural resources than data centers do, so with the exception of a few controversial chipmaking fabs in several states, they have been sailing through local hearings to get permits and tax breaks. “At some point, people are going to figure out what the critical factory is that can bring all the data centers to their knees, and they will go after that,” says Andy Tsay, a Santa Clara University professor who studies global trade and reshoring. Though targeting the supply chain could be a new way to slow data center construction, Griffin says organizers are spread too thin to take on more. Her focus at last month's council meeting was on opposing a proposal for a second data center in Taylor, following one being built near her home that she's suing to stop. That evening, Griffin and her fellow activists knew the council also would be considering a proposed factory for Taiwanese manufacturer Compal. Griffin's case shows what communities protesting data centers are up against if they consider also challenging manufacturing projects: opacity, public perception, and the prospect of additional legal battles. Council members asked a couple of basic questions about the jobs and competing cities before unanimously approving nearly $4.4 million in tax breaks for the project. “Another home run,” mayor Dwayne Ariola said of the project. Griffin, a retired teacher and learning center director who grew up in Taylor, says she and fellow residents deserved more transparency at the meeting about Compal's work with data centers. “I'm just trying to stop data centers from coming into city limits. If we stop the ones trying to get the jobs in, then people will turn against us and say we're trying to stop jobs.” ​Masheika Allgood, founder of AllAI Consulting, which has been advising community groups that are against data centers, notes that another challenge is that the data center industry is well funded to lobby politicians and run public relations campaigns to combat opponents. Factory developers are likely in a similar position, and critics don't have the resources to fight on multiple fronts. New or expanded factories have been pitched as necessary to keep up with growing demand and alleviate the impacts of tariffs on imports to the US. It's sensible that servers factories would want to set up near their customers, and, in the US, Texas is second only to Virginia in terms of data centers. Cities find having both data centers and factories valuable because they balance each other out in some ways. Data centers don't create many jobs, but they generate ample property tax revenue. Factories increase employment but also the demand on public services such as roads, schools, and benefit programs, adding more costs. “Both types of projects can be very beneficial to our community as we seek to attract more good-paying jobs close to home for our residents and … reduce our reliance on residential property taxes,” says Jerrod Kingery, a spokesperson for Taylor. Last month, Georgetown's city council unanimously approved about $1.8 million each in public support for Compal and another Taiwanese manufacturer, Pegatron, to move into town. Compal plans to service servers at a nearly 213,000 square foot space. Pegatron expects to create about 100 jobs at a 169,000 square foot factory, its first in the US. Similar to the Compal factory in Taylor, there's little public-facing information about what, specifically, Pegatron will produce. Industry insiders speculated to Taiwan's United Daily News that the factory will mainly produce servers. In an unsigned email, Pegatron declined to comment on specific plans but said its project has “proceeded as planned.” No members of the public spoke up about either project in Georgetown during last month's council meeting . Earlier, when the city posted on Facebook to celebrate Pegatron's plans, a few commenters raised questions about how local water, electricity, and traffic could be affected, with some conflating the factory with a data center. But after the city posted a clarification saying that “facilities like these use minimal water” and “pay for their own electricity,” only a few more comments trickled in. Cameron Goodman, director of economic development for Georgetown, says the city has been deliberate about locating factories “in locations with appropriate roadways, water, wastewater, and electrical infrastructure” and recruiting companies that “are well suited” for those spaces. Fabs where computer chips are produced do use large amounts of water, and activists have protested plans for new fabs in Arizona, Indiana, and New York. But concerted opposition to other links in the data center supply chain, such as factories in Texas, California, and Colorado that make electrical equipment, has been limited. Cities welcoming those suppliers could face economic challenges if the massive buildup in AI data centers is symptomatic of a bubble that will soon pop, as some skeptics believe, and demand for servers and other parts slows. Or if data center opponents such as Griffin start to have widespread success, that could also undermine the need for more production. But the immediate prospect of more jobs and economic growth has put longer-term concerns far in the distance, and manufacturing for data centers continues to accelerate.</p>

It got acquired by a mental guy who was screaming about government propaganda and censorship (while doing Nazi salutes). Do you really think that if there was any government mandate to do anything like what the Russians are doing, he wouldn't have exposed it as "SEE, I TOLD YOU BIG GUBIMNT BAD!!" It's interesting you focus on "the west" when we have solid proof about e.g. Russian interference in many an election and protest via social media. From paid propagandist (e.g. Tim Pool) to the Internet Research Agency. The only factual information we have about anything remotely similar from "the west" was that research about Facebook activity in the Central African Republic being roughly 40/40/20 split between Russians, French, and actual locals. And even that isn't comparable because the French online campaign was mostly combatting Russian disinformation propaganda, not trying to bring about a coup or stoking tensions to get to a civil war.> Showing the result of the western sponsored genocide in GazaThe genocide in Gaza is not "sponsored" by the "west". Well, Hamas was for decades sponsored by entire West via UNRWA while their "from the river to the sea" slogan is as clearly expressed intent to commit genocide as one can wish for.

Many independent news, VPN services, and foreign websites (e.g., Chess.com) are also inaccessible Many independent news, VPN services, and foreign websites (e.g., Chess.com) are also inaccessible If we consider russia bad for doing those blocks above, then we should consider EU being bad when they do it for us.

I can't do anything about iran, i don't live there, neither does anyone else commenting here it seems... but many of us do live in EU, and are bothered by EU doing the same thing as iran, even if it's on a smaller scale (for now). You can't support censorship at home and then act outraged when someone else just implements more of it... even though some do, as long as the censored things are the things they personally don't like.To be fair, i'm more worried about UK, since it's a "test ground" to see how things work before the bad thing are implemented elsewhere, but either way, in my small country we have a saying, that "people should first sweep infront of their own doorways", and yeah, EU and our censorship is my doorway in this case.TLDR: if we're bothered by internet censorship, we should first stop at 'at home'.

You also don't live in the United States, or in Israel or Palestine but folks tend to forget that it seems.But you can do something anyway which is to be aware of the atrocities committed by Iran's regime, make sure your government is aware of your opinion, you can protest outside the Iranian embassy in your country, help Iranian dissidents, help Iranians find sneaky ways to get internet access, &c.I'm not expecting anyone to do those things but I find this “I don't live there” argument continue to creep up whenever it comes to Iran but it never enters conversation when it comes to specific other countries.> TLDR: if we're bothered by internet censorship, we should first stop at 'at home'.Sure but you don't have to focus on one issue at a time.

On the other hand, there are many people from EU here who need to hear it, that EU is doing the same as iran... censoring websites and more (IDs, chat control,...). Yes, maybe not at the same level, less sites are censored here, but censorship is still censorship, and the trend is going towards more control and more censorship.United states, israel (and palestine), etc. Are we bothered by what israel is doing in palestine? US is doing that to us (EU) with tarrifs every two weeks, but we didn't really properly respond, even under the threat of an invasion on greenland.Yes, restricted internet in iran is bad, but we can't stop it. Sadly, changing back EU rules is similarly hard to do, which again, is something that should be fixed, by us, at home. Are we bothered by what israel is doing in palestine?

Lets make this clear: "Spain" is not blocking, some ISP companies which have many users ask the judge for permission to block IP ranges because they are streaming football matches. As they have millions of users, the block feels huge, but it is not issued by the government.I am not a customer of those ISP, so my internet isn't disrupted at all during football matches. Some services, like annas-archive and torrent sites, are intermittently blocked, but you can easily avoid the blocks just by switching DNS server to 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8.

In "normal" filtering situations, we can connect to most VPNs and do our stuff. The internet speed is also now at crawling speed so you really can't upload download anything.Also, in each blackout, people find ways to work around the censorship. We have almost ran out of ways to prevent the censorship now. Also, in each blackout, people find ways to work around the censorship. We have almost ran out of ways to prevent the censorship now. All other platforms (instant messengers, social media, news) are massively unpopular for being horrid to use at best, and government spyware at worst.To slow down the immediate damage the government has rolled back a few of the recent restrictions, hence why I can access HN. Among Google and a handful of other basic websites. Where almost all but a few big important services are blocked completely. This would have the bonus effect of making circumvention using VPNs and other methods even more difficult than it already is. Among Google and a handful of other basic websites.

Can anyone recommend a good book, video course or other material to learn more about these topics? The way that I see it, its not just a technical problem anymore. As an anecdotal data point, the network was quite tightly controlled / monitored around 2023 in Iran and nothing worked reliably. This was an unacceptably high collateral damage for the censors (? Vless and Trojan were the same at that time and didn't work or were blocked very quickly, but they started working ~reliably again until very recently. Be warned, the conclusion is:> We enumerate the requirements that a censorship-resistant system must satisfy to successfully mimic another protocol and conclude that “unobservability by imitation” is a fundamentally flawed approach. > We enumerate the requirements that a censorship-resistant system must satisfy to successfully mimic another protocol and conclude that “unobservability by imitation” is a fundamentally flawed approach. Plus, the elites economic prosperity is also linked to their not being protests and for the toppling of govt to not occur and they might be willing to offset some losses to keep the average population in checkWhich sucks for the average iranian but we saw how their protests were cracked down with 20-30 THOUSAND people killed and Iran hiding bodies etc.I have heard that all shops are either shut down or running at the most minimum capacity. Economic prosperity just isn't a question now in Iran.

Invading Iran would be difficult, but totally destroying IRGC and military (as long as they side with the former) wouldn't be that hard. Dropping communications equipment and weapons to Iranian opposition groups wouldn't be hard either. Now, if you're doing something unrelated that the administration doesn't like, you can expect VPN use to be included in the long list of charges. But polices in developed areas usually treat them like antragsdelikte(no trial without a complaint). i remeber when we start working on golang dev, and because its under google domain so many sub sites is blocked including golang ones, its very time consuming for chinese devs to develop golang projects, you have to figure out the VPN/goproxy... stuff.. This can be overriden to use "Starlink positioning" where the terminal ignores GPS signals and dtermines its position based on Starlink satellite signals. I think this is what is used in Ukraine where GPS is mostly jammed/spoofed to hell even far from the front.The GPS positioning is the default as it is likely more user friendly/has quicker lock in normal circumstances.Another venue of attack could be the Starlink WiFi AP included in the terminals- you could track that down.So in general:* switch the terminal to Starlink positioning* disable the Starkink terminal WiFi AP and conect by ethernet or connect an AP via ethernet with a new SSID and different MAC addressAnd it should be good to go.

While that gives some ideas of how widespread the jamming is, it won't give accurate information about the range (air traffic avoids areas with jamming) of the interference or any information from places where there is no commercial air traffic (war zones, etc). Much higher orbits for gnss satellites, much lower signal intensity.Also, starlink uses phased arrays with beamforming, effectively creating an electronically steerable directional antenna. It is harder to jam two directional antennas talking to each other, as your jammers are on the sides, where the lobes of the antenna radiation pattern are smaller.Still, we're talking about signals coming from space, so maybe it is just enough to sprinkle more jammers in an urban setting..

Still, we're talking about signals coming from space, so maybe it is just enough to sprinkle more jammers in an urban setting.. The components needed to build jammers and EW systems have been heavily commodified for a decade now (hell, your phone's power brick, car, and TV all have dual use components for these kinds of applications), and most regional powers have been working on compound semiconductors and offensive electronic warfare for almost a generation now. Iran was reported to have mobile units with a fairly short range that constantly roamed around, only hitting 2 of the 3 bands (Ku/Ka). They're also reported to have received mobile Russian military units capable of jamming all 3 (X/Ku/Ka) over a much wider area. (I'm not actually clear the extent to which X band is associated with either Starlink or Starshield. Starshield also reportedly operates to at least some extent in parts of the S band.

So the technology clearly exists but it doesn't seem to be something you can trivially throw together in your basement. They have limited service because they can't afford anything better, and the USA prevents installing additional undersea cables, but only a small number of sites are blocked by Cuba itself, such as a few Spanish language news sites run by Cuban-Americans.Many more sites are unavailable in Cuba because their USA owners refuse access to Cuba, but that's not Cuba's fault.

After many years of heavy censorship on 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, there are a lot of accounts on Chinese BBS who say all the footage "AI generated". Firstly the protesters will be able to communicate in private.And secondly, Iranians will continue to be reminded of the freedoms most other Muslims enjoy: As in free speech and free trade.One of the reasons the Berlin wall fell was that East Europeans saw on TV that how prosperous Western Europe became.

One of the reasons the Berlin wall fell was that East Europeans saw on TV that how prosperous Western Europe became. In fact, the official policy is that if you don't like it here, then you are are supposed to move out. As this plan failed economically, a side effect was that it only became common knowledge across society how big the gap in quality of life really was.The idea that free internet access will magically change the situation for Iranians on it's own is naive. At the same time, I can see Apple caving to Iran governement - or China's - and restrict this feature to countries where it is legal. And it has nothing to do with your political views. Everyone will feel the squeeze and nobody is gonna be dismissive about it. It's a desperate attempt, that really shows how cornered the administration is.Any power that fears information, has to have a highly fine grained, high level control of information to maintain power.

Right now the internet access is widening and some areas are already back to normal internet — but it hasn't been stable over the past week. Seems they had the good luck with that one. Let me remind you that many civilians died, including two children. Don't take my word for it:The following quote can be attributed to Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa Director at Human Rights Watch:    “Customary international humanitarian law prohibits the use of booby traps – objects that civilians are likely to be attracted to or are associated with normal civilian daily use – precisely to avoid putting civilians at grave risk and produce the devastating scenes that continue to unfold across Lebanon today. The use of an explosive device whose exact location could not be reliably known would be unlawfully indiscriminate, using a means of attack that could not be directed at a specific military target and as a result would strike military targets and civilians without distinction. A prompt and impartial investigation into the attacks should be urgently conducted.” The following quote can be attributed to Lama Fakih, Middle East and North Africa Director at Human Rights Watch:    “Customary international humanitarian law prohibits the use of booby traps – objects that civilians are likely to be attracted to or are associated with normal civilian daily use – precisely to avoid putting civilians at grave risk and produce the devastating scenes that continue to unfold across Lebanon today.

You could try to bifurcate into allied and non allied, but even that would be flawed, especially in countries like the USA where it becomes a first amendment right to try to ban such connectivity. Their elites will find workarounds and they'll leave the internet completely blocked apart from that. Even with ublock Origin, these corporations will build a profile on me. Not so in Iran, where people can live without the watchful eye of Google looking at everything they do. Over 12.000 people have been killed in the protests with some reports going up to 30.000 since then and here you are happy about the fact that Google cannot profile them anymore. Protesters are beeing shot on-masse in the streets and families from outside the country have no ideas if their brothers and sisters are even still alive. While you're at it, you can try explaining Ukranians why it's fine that Russia is invading them because America is bad. Because I guess you're not interested in my own personal experience of witnessing said people get killed either. But you seem to have a loose definition of "unconfirmed" [1] so I won't dwell on that.

Given the direct comparison and language of the parent comment, it's hard for me not to see an implied agenda here: Iran's regime is bad, they're islamists, just like Hamas, therefore Israel should be excused for having turned Gaza into a parking lot, or something along these lines. Our commitment to human rights should be strong enough to reject this sort of thinking and condemn every single one of these civilian deaths. "local cop shoots innocent 80-year-old woman carrying groceries" is a story for a day at best, then the cop gets punished and we move on.Gaza is the same.

This goes both ways and applies to all conflicts, but somehow we always cherry-pick the source that is not aligned with western interests as the "untrustworthy". The ICJ seems more interested in truth and you may criticize how that went for them, or are they anti western in your book?

UAE directly finances the sanguinary RSF in Sudan and CTS in Yemen, Saudi Arabia/Qatar has financed institutions behind the expansion of the Muslim Brotherhood/Salafism in the worlld and Turkey has a shaky economy with a large underbelly as well as engaging in their own brand of imperialism abroad. The rhetoric that Sweden, Germany, UK and France are Muslim countries is exclusivley used by very far-right standing people to fearmonger and hate against immigrants. What would it even mean for these countries to be Muslim? You still hear the bells of Christian churches everywhere. It's one thing to accuse someone of not replying to the "strongest plausible interpretation of what someone says", and another thing to accuse someone of "hate", which is a very serious accusation that requires proof beyond a shadow of a doubt, especially in the EU where strong anti libel laws apply.</p>

The point i was responding to was whether such protests [for Iranians] are pointless, and i asserted there can certainly be a point to them.Different people care about different things. I doubt the "tax dollar" explanation for Gaza protests because they seem just as popular in countries that dont provide aid to Israel, and people seemed to care a lot more about Gaza than say Iraq, despite much much more tax dollars going there and much more people dead. Or more specificly such sanctions have complex impacts and it can be unclear what the overall net result is, especially over the long run.Sanctions against Iran of course do not solely have to do with the human rights situation and are also being applied for various geopolitical reasons.> I'd say it's also tricky in such situations to protest and not have your protest co-opted to justify aggression.

What makes intra-state politics more acceptable to use violence? I don't know that anyone thinks a state's violence against its citizens is less immoral. It's more that countries are more hesitant to get militarily involved in the domestic affairs of another country because it would mean essentially declaring war against that state. But in a conflict between states, an outsider can more easily support one side militarily without declaring war against the other side. Luckily we have largely moved past that view.I think as a purely practical matter, moral outrage is shaped by who controls the information space. If you are a country being invaded, you probably have an organized, well funded communication department to tell your side.

Quite a lot of detail in the nyt article https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/25/world/middleeast/iran-how... "Iranian security forces deployed unknown chemical substances amid deadly crackdowns on protestors in several cities earlier this month, eyewitnesses told Iran International, causing severe breathing problems and burning pain.They described symptoms that they said went beyond those caused by conventional tear gas, including severe breathing difficulties, sudden weakness and loss of movement......According to the accounts, in some cases gunfire began at the same time, or immediately after, protesters lost the ability to walk or run and fell to the ground.Several witnesses said that moments of immobilization became points at which shooting intensified, particularly when protesters collapsed in alleys or while trying to flee.Reports came from multiple cities, including Tehran, Isfahan and Sabzevar.

Or does that logic only apply to US-based developments? However, it also says:> "Please don't complain that a submission is inappropriate. If a story is spam or off-topic, flag it." > "Please don't complain that a submission is inappropriate. If a story is spam or off-topic, flag it." IE as the right is becoming more anti-Israel, you find a lot more pro Islamic Republic stuff there these days. I don't follow the left as closely these days, but imagine there are a myriad of opinions on the matter. I used to read the English version of Russia today, and it was almost comical to seem them oscillate articles that fit the "Based Mother Russia of Traditional Values" trope, then right next to it nostalgic Tankie stuff or the anti "Western Imperialist" think pieces. It's like they didn't even know who their useful idiots were anymore. Machiavelli in Discourses on Livy says you are inviting an overthrow of your government by doing this.The mercenaries can flip sides if the opposite faction pays them and offers them better terms... or maybe the mercs just flip.Hard to say how true this is. I hate how irrational our species is and how unempathetic we are to situations not immediately in front of us.And Trump should not have promised assistance. How many more people are dead because they were encouraged by said promise? Some of these deaths can surely be attributed to him.

Unless you show them a video of protestors being massacred in Iran, or take them to a factory farm, they don't care. Why?Suffering is roughly sortable and it is certainly within the power of most people to drive down the greatest sources of suffering, and pressure their government to do so when it is not directly within their power.But people are irrational.

The irony is that now those who are still alive in Iran might remember this and update their notion of US trustworthiness accordingly. They're not going to be outraged over the people they support killing protestors who want to topple the thing they support.Also, just to be fair, there's also some right-wing obvious Russian agents weirdly not condemning the Islamic Republic... What's vile is not being opposed to the murder of 36000 people. If Palestine had full US backing they would push Israelis in to the ocean and claiming otherwise is dishonest. UAE is the largest backer of Palestine, they have no qualms backing genocide in Sudan. The notion of some well-defined "people" is a fiction that ruling powers use to keep humanity's innate tribalistic tendencies pointed outward at their adversaries.The truth is that the powers-that-be consider themselves to be above "the people", and will dispose of you as soon as you become inconvenient. Alex Pretti.It's not just that they were killed but so much of the country including, most relevantly, the administration, believe they should have been killed.It's not hard to other any set of people.

Usually mercenaries mean people doing it for money not ideology who get paid significantly more than your average soldier. There's maybe some disquiet in realizing that they're not someone you can side with, too.And for sure some of the outlets followed by the protesters have ties to Iran, sadly. Their aims may align with the protestors temporarily but I think a permanently fractured, Syria type situation is much more palatable to them than a rapid transition to a more democratic system that leaves the country intact. There is no guarantee a post-islamic Iran would step into line, and it would remain a regional power that would be much harder to justify continued sanctions against.A part of me suspects the incredibly conspicuous endorsement of the protestors by the US/Israel regime is an attempt to discredit them. A clean change of government with domestic US pressure to lift sanctions would be their nightmare scenario.

Note, I'm not saying that they have been confirmed, but I do not think that you have given sufficient cause for rejecting them out of hand. This is the organisation most commonly cited in news reports, they estimate ~5200 protestors confirmed killed (+ a few hundred more for security personnel killed)They are a group of anti-regime Iranian dissidents based in the US. I don't know why they would seek to provide a deliberately low estimate. They are a group of anti-regime Iranian dissidents based in the US.
