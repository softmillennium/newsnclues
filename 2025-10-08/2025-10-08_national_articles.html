                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Arizona's Democratic senators got into a hallway confrontation with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday as the government shutdown's eighth day dragged on. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego centered on the speaker's decision not to swear in Democrats' newest congresswoman-elect until they break the Senate logjam and reopen the government. Full of traded insults and forceful cross talk, the six-minute exchange underscored just how far apart the two parties remain on how to approach reopening the federal government as each side digs in. The speaker exchanged handshakes with the pair as he approached to push back on their claims. “Your excuse just keeps on moving,” said Gallego, as the Democrats pointed to Johnson's swearing-in of Florida GOP Reps. Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine during a pro forma session – when the House wasn't formally in session – earlier this year. Ms. Grijalva, Rep.-elect Grijalva has not yet had a scheduled date because she was elected after the House was out of session. Johnson, who said he was happy Grijalva was elected, denied that it had anything to do with a vote on the Epstein files and remarked the House didn't need to vote on releasing more of them because the House Oversight Committee is already conducting a bipartisan investigation. They're doing it with subpoena power, and you don't need an act of Congress for that to happen because they're already on it,” Johnson said. The exchange grew more heated as the lawmakers cut each other off, raising their voices to speak over each other. “Stop covering up for pedophiles,” Gallego charged. “That is ridiculous,” Johnson immediately shot back, arguing separately that “it has nothing to do with Epstein.” GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York walked up to the group near the exchange's end, jumping in to defend Johnson. You're absolutely absurd,” he told Kelly and Gallego. Kelly repeatedly pushed Johnson to bring the House back into session so that lawmakers could have a serious discussion about how to fund the government and address expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies – a key demand for Democrats. He said his Republican colleagues in the Senate were telling him that they didn't want to negotiate without House Republicans also weighing in. “If you bring them back, we will have a discussion. Johnson was adamant that the House had done its job, a line he has repeated countless times since government funding lapsed on October 1, and said there wouldn't be a discussion on the Obamacare subsidies until Democrats provided the needed votes in the Senate to pass the Republican House-passed short-term funding bill and reopen the government. White House draws out mass federal firings timeline as GOP grows squeamish in funding fight In an apparent attempt to make it personal for the speaker, Kelly argued health care premiums could skyrocket in Johnson's own Louisiana district. “I imagine yours are going to hurt even worse than ours with these premium increases. We have to fix this,” Kelly said. But Johnson held firm that he would not have that policy conversation until the government shutdown ended. Multiple times, the Democrats gestured to the empty House floor and accused Johnson of giving his lawmakers an extended summer vacation as the two sides continued to talk over each other. Lawler held up a copy of a House bill that he said would extend the ACA subsidies for one year. “We actually have put forth legislation to do it. These gentlemen had a publicity stunt here. You see the issue, they need to go vote to reopen the government, plain and simple. The House has done its work,” he told reporters.</p>

New York salon owner Ashley DiMatteo and hairstylist Briana Delvecchio discuss why losing weight, especially with GLP-1s, often leads to temporary hair loss. But for a very small number of people, that innocuous posture can set off a cascade of vascular injury known as beauty parlor stroke syndrome (BPSS). The term was popularized in 1993, when New York neurologist Michael Weintraub described five case reports of patients who developed symptoms following salon shampoo treatments. A recent review published this year in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine identified 54 documented cases of BPSS over nearly five decades, drawn from 22 studies. Leaning back into a salon sink can strain the neck's arteries in rare cases, according to a 2025 review in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine. Most affected patients (roughly 80%) were women, with ages ranging from teenagers to seniors. A 2018 review in Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine stated that BPSS occurs when the neck is held in an extreme backward or twisted position during a wash or treatment, stretching or compressing the vertebral arteries that run along the spine to the brain. In rare instances, that posture can cause a tear in the artery wall, called a dissection, which may then form a clot and block blood flow to the brain. Most beauty parlor experiences are entirely safe, but simple ergonomic tweaks can make them even safer. The same review describes how even minor structural issues, such as bone spurs (osteophytes) in the cervical vertebrae, can worsen compression and increase risk. In effect, a casual tilt of the head can briefly limit blood supply to key parts of the brain stem and cerebellum. Symptoms typically appear during or within several days of a triggering posture, according to the American Journal of Emergency Medicine review. Common warning signs include dizziness, vertigo, neck pain or visual disturbances. More serious cases may lead to weakness, numbness or speech difficulties. Supporting the neck with towels or cushions during shampooing can minimize the risk of artery compression, experts say. Diagnosis usually involves MRI or CT angiography to confirm arterial dissection. As with other stroke types, doctors often treat patients using antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs, though some require vascular stenting or surgery, experts say. Health researchers writing for the American Council on Science and Health in New York City emphasize that BPSS is highly uncommon and largely known from isolated case reports rather than population data. Experts also recommend that clients speak up immediately if they feel neck strain or dizziness. Khloe Quill is a lifestyle production assistant with Fox News Digital.

An Indiana man accused of stabbing a 69-year-old at a gas station has ignited outrage after records revealed a staggering criminal history – nearly 100 prior arrests – with little to show in the way of punishment. Courtney Boose, 41, was arrested after the alleged gas-station stabbing, according to the Lawrence Police Department and Fox 59, which reported that Boose has been arrested 99 times over the years on charges ranging from theft and trespassing to battery. Despite that record, court documents reviewed by Fox News Digital show he's never served a day in state prison. Boose's long paper trail through Marion County courts paints a picture of a man repeatedly cycling through the system. Even when convicted, Boose typically received short county-jail terms or time served. One 2019 case included a battery resulting in bodily injury charge, which was later dismissed in a plea deal, and a conviction for misdemeanor theft that earned Boose just two months behind bars. In 2020 and again in 2022, he pleaded guilty to felony trespass and was sentenced to county jail time already served, court records show. The Indianapolis skyline is photographed at night. Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) President Rick Snyder blasted the situation as proof that repeat offenders are "being turned back onto the streets faster than officers can arrest them." "This is exactly what we've been warning about," Snyder said on "The Hammer and Nigel Show" on 91.3FM WIBC. You've got someone arrested 99 times, accused now of stabbing an elderly man, and he's never seen prison… Prosecutors recently downgraded Boose's latest charge from attempted murder to aggravated battery, a level three felony, reducing potential prison exposure from up to 40 years to a maximum of 16. He is being held at the Marion County Jail on a $50,000 bond. Fox News Digital has reached out to Marion County for comment. "What's the number of times where somebody in a black robe says, 'You know what, I don't think this guy is getting it'?" This undated photo provided by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) shows Troy McAlister, a parolee who was allegedly intoxicated when he ran a red light in a stolen car, killing two pedestrians. Critics argue Boose's record highlights problematic "catch-and-release" justice, where habitual offenders face little deterrent. In deep-blue San Francisco, residents protested Troy McAlister's bid to swap prison time for a drug rehabilitation program just years after he allegedly plowed down two pedestrians. "91 felonies, 2 deaths, No more chances," signs read outside San Francisco's Hall of Justice. "Judge Begert chooses politics over public safety. The case of McAlister, 50, has long been a lightning rod of restorative justice reform, forcing elected officials to confront whether policies meant to show compassion to offenders put the public at risk. McAlister was on parole on Dec. 31, 2020, when he allegedly drove a stolen car while intoxicated, ran a red light, and killed Hanako Abe, 27, and Elizabeth Platt, 60. "Troy McAlister has been charged with 91 felonies over the course of his multi-decades career here in San Francisco, and we don't think that someone should be given infinite chances to ultimately correct course," Scotty Jacobs, director of Blueprint for a Better San Francisco, told KTVU-TV.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025, at the Federal Reserve Board Building in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Most members of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate setting committee supported further reductions to its key interest rate this year, according to minutes from last month's meeting released Wednesday. A majority of Fed officials felt that the risk unemployment would rise had worsened since their previous meeting in July, while the risk of rising inflation “had either diminished or not increased,” the minutes said. Rate cuts by the Fed can gradually lower borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans, and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring. Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut: Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Donald Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead. But the minutes noted that “a few” policymakers said they could have supported keeping rates unchanged, or said that “there was merit” in such a step. It's not incredibly obvious what to do.” Miran said in remarks Tuesday that he thinks inflation will steadily decline back toward the Fed's 2% target, despite Trump's tariffs, and as a result he doesn't think the Fed's rate needs to be nearly as high as it is. Rental costs are steadily declining and will bring down inflation, he said, while tariff revenue will reduce the government's budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, which gives the Fed more room to cut. Yet many other Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that “inflation is too high” and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening. And Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press that he supported a cautious approach toward more cuts, and wanted to see evidence that inflation would cool further. “I am a little uneasy with front loading rate cuts, presuming that those upticks in inflation will just go away,” he said. The minutes provide insight into how the Fed's policymakers were thinking last month about inflation, interest rates, and hiring.</p>

Sen Tim Kaine, D-Va., tells reporters he stands behind Jay Jones amid violent text messages unearthed last week. FIRST ON FOX: The largest individual donor to Jay Jones' flailing attorney general campaign in Virginia is a billionaire heiress who has backed a variety of left-wing candidates and causes along with a recent massive donation backing socialist NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani. Elizabeth "Liz" Simons, the daughter of the late billionaire hedge fund manager James "Jim" Simons, donated a total of $750,000 to Jones' campaign over the past few months in four separate payments, campaign finance records show. The elder Simons founded the successful hedge fund Renaissance Technologies and built up a personal fortune worth $31.4 billion over the course of his lifetime while donating billions of that money to charity. The donations from his daughter are likely to face increased scrutiny after Jones was the subject of a National Review report on Friday that exposed text messages he sent fantasizing about shooting a Republican colleague, former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert, in the head and suggesting his wife should have to watch his young "fascist" children die. The texts compared Gilbert to mass murderers Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, adding that if he was given two bullets, he would use both against the GOP lawmaker to shoot him in the head. The report has prompted Republicans in Virginia and across the country to call for Jones to drop out of the race, but as of Wednesday afternoon, he is still in the race as Democrats who endorsed him rally around his candidacy. Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, who condemned the texts, said he is "still a supporter" of his campaign. Fox News Digital reported on Tuesday that Mark Warner, the other Democratic senator in Virginia, also criticized Jones' "appalling" texts and said his behavior was "inconsistent with the person I've known," but stopped short of calling for him to drop out of the race. A text message from Jay Jones to Del. FEC records reviewed by Fox News Digital show that she has given millions of dollars to the Senate Majority PAC, which has close ties to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the House Majority PAC, a fundraising operation aligned with House Democratic leadership. She also gave over $800,000 to a PAC that supported Kamala Harris' failed presidential campaign. Virginia attorney general candidate Jerrauld "Jay" Jones speaks at an event in Norfolk, Virginia, on on June 17, 2025. Simons, who joined her husband in forming the Heising-Simons Foundation in 2007 to bankroll left-wing environmentalist, education, and social policy causes, has recently made donations to Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff's campaign, over $100,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and over $40,000 to the Democratic National Committee. Her family foundation is also a member of at least two gun control advocacy organizations, including Fund for a Safer Future and Hope and Heal Fund, which are both controlled by the New Venture Fund, according to the Capital Research Center's InfluenceWatch. Fox News Digital reached out to Simons for comment, but did not receive a response by press time. Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Hakeem Jeffries slammed President Trump's behavior as "unhinged" and "unreasonable" amid the ongoing government shutdown, when pressed on the president's meme video depicting the House Minority leader in a sombrero. A moderate House Democrat is splitting from his party leader on a compromise to extend enhanced ObamaCare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this year. Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., is among the House Democrats backing a bipartisan bill aimed at extending those tax credits for one year. But House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called a one-year extension a "laughable proposition" in comments to reporters on Tuesday. Suozzi, who also backs a permanent extension, said both sides need to begin negotiating at some point, even without a perfect solution. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Oct. 3, 2025. "A one-year extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits is not acceptable. It's a nonstarter," Jeffries said, referring to ObamaCare. "What world are these MAGA extremists living in right now to think that Democrats are going to go along with a one-year extension from a group of people, meaning the Republicans, who just permanently extended massive tax breaks for their billionaire donors?" But it's not just Republicans pushing that bill — the legislation has 11 total Democrat co-sponsors out of 25 total supporters. "This bill isn't perfect — I'd prefer a permanent extension, and I'd gladly settle for a multi-year one — but right now, our priority must be stopping the massive health insurance premium hikes set to hit mailboxes in less than a month," Suozzi said. Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., speaks during a campaign canvass kick-off event on Feb. 11, 2024, in Plainview New York. "Our bipartisan bill would extend the credits by one year. Our coalition already includes 12 House Republicans — an essential bloc of support for passing a bill in the GOP-controlled House. "As we negotiate, I see two sides who genuinely want to get to ‘yes,' which gives me hope that we can avert price spikes and coverage losses in January. Golden was the lone House Democrat to vote for the GOP-led bill to avert a government shutdown last month. The bill, called a continuing resolution (CR), would keep federal funding levels roughly flat through Nov. 21, while including added spending for national officials' security amid the heightened political threat environment. Senate Majority Leader John Thune talks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House on Sept. 29, 2025, in Washington, as House Speaker Mike Johnson listens. But Democrats, furious at being sidelined in federal funding talks, have largely said they'll reject any deal that does not include an extension of the expiring ObamaCare subsidies. Suozzi and several other Democrats supporting the one-year extension are also co-sponsors on legislation that would permanently extend the enhanced ObamaCare subsidies. The office of Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., pointed out to Fox News Digital that he was also a co-sponsor of that bill but refused to comment on the one-year bill or Jeffries' dismissal of it. But that bill is likely a nonstarter for GOP leaders in Congress, who say that some reform is needed to the system if those healthcare credits are to be extended. Fox News Digital reached out to the remaining eight co-sponsors of the one-year extension bill but did not receive a response to Jeffries' comments by press time.

JB Pritzker accused President Donald Trump of being a "man who's suffering dementia" in their escalating feud over National Guard deployment in his state — despite the Democrat once backing former President Joe Biden's mental fitness. Texas National Guard troops arrived in Illinois on Tuesday to protect federal personnel and property amid anti-immigration protests, the Pentagon confirmed. A Pentagon official said 200 guardsmen were mobilized for an initial 60-day period. "This is a man who's suffering dementia," Pritzker said Tuesday about Trump, according to The Chicago Tribune. "This is a man who has something stuck in his head. He can't get it out of his head. He doesn't know anything that's up to date. It's just something in the recesses of his brain that is effectuating to have him call out these cities." JB Pritzker said President Donald Trump has dementia despite previously rejecting challenges of former President Joe Biden's mental fitness. The sharp criticism comes after Pritzker defended Biden following the release of a report from Special Counsel Robert Hur in February 2024 that described the former president as a "sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory." "I smell a rat," Pritzker was quoted as telling reporters the day after Hur's report was made public. Pritzker further defended Biden's fitness to serve. "The man knows more than most of us have forgotten. He knows so much more because he's been in government for a number of years and has served in important positions." Biden later dropped his re-election bid in July after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Biden's own party quietly ceded to concerns over his fitness, mental competency and overall strength as a candidate as fallout from the debate overtook conversation on the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill. Military personnel in uniform, with the Texas National Guard patch on, are seen at the U.S. Army Reserve Center on Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025, in Elwood, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. At a time Pritzker was being floated as potentially joining the Democratic ticket and was holding speaking engagements in battleground states, the Illinois governor released a statement on Biden's decision to withdraw from the race. "President Joe Biden has dedicated his life in service to this nation, and its citizens are all the better for it. His is a storied political career culminating in one of the most accomplished and effective presidencies of our lifetime," Pritzker said at the time. He also attacked Trump, adding, "We must not ignore the threat posed by Donald Trump's potential return to the White House," according to WMAQ-TV. Trump went on to win the November election. An X account affiliated with the Trump White House on Tuesday called Pritzker "one SICK scumbag," sharing a clip of his recent interview with WGN. "What I know is, in the early days of Nazi regime, they started slowly but surely taking away people's rights. And what we are seeing now is the very same thing. Where the President of the United States is sending military or troops dressed as military — ICE and CBP — in camouflage, with automatic weapons, into our major cities? Smoke is seen rising as federal law enforcement pushes back anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protesters outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, on Sept. 26, 2025. The White House Rapid Response team said Pritzker "calls President Trump a Nazi — fomenting more deranged violence from his Radical Left lunatic supporters." Trump on Wednesday said on Truth Social that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson should be jailed for not defending ICE agents. The White House provided Fox News Digital with a statement elaborating on the president's post, noting that 30 people were shot, five of whom died, in Chicago last week alone, yet "these Trump-Deranged buffoons would rather allow the violence to continue and attack the President for wanting to help make their city safe again." The White House did not immediately address Pritzker's specific "dementia" comment about Trump. Fox News Digital also reached out to Pritzker's office for comment but did not immediately hear back.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Katie Porter became a national figure among Democrats for her sharp questioning of Trump administration figures, often holding a whiteboard, in House Oversight Committee hearings. Porter, now running for governor of California, is drawing blowback after threatening to walk out of an interview with CBS News Sacramento. A portion of the interview was posted online and widely shared, even as Porter's campaign noted she ultimately spoke to the reporter for another 20 minutes. “What do you say to the 40% of California voters who you'll need in order to win, who voted for Trump?” reporter Julie Watts begins in the clip. (President Donald Trump won 38% of the vote in California last year.) “How would I need them in order to win?” Porter shot back, emphasizing her focus on the state's Democratic voter base. CA gubernatorial candidate interview goes viral when she threatens to walk out Porter then cut in, “OK, so, I don't want to keep doing this. “I want to have a pleasant, positive conversation, in which you ask me about every issue on this list. Gavin Newsom, a contest former Vice President Kamala Harris considered but ultimately decided not to join. Porter is a former congresswoman who ran unsuccessfully for US Senate in 2024. She is a former law professor and protege of Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Former Biden administration Health and Human Services Director Xavier Becerra, one of Porter's top rivals in the gubernatorial race, responded to clips of the interview picked up by social media, writing, “I'm not interested in excluding any vote. And former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa also weighed in, writing that “We need a leader who will solve hard problems and answer simple questions.” Liberal commentator Mehdi Hasan on X called it a “car crash interview,” while Republican strategist Matt Whitlock wrote, “This Katie Porter crashout is INCREDIBLE.” No Republican has won it at the presidential level since Ronald Reagan in 1988, and in the 2024 campaign, Kamala Harris won her home state by more than 30 points. However, California's distinct “top two” primary system – in which the first and second place candidates in a primary advance to the general election, regardless of party – means that two Democrats could face off on the final ballot, incentivizing appeals to independents and Republicans. Porter, Becerra and Villaraigosa rank as the most prominent declared Democratic candidates, but US Sen. Alex Padilla and billionaire businessman Rick Caruso loom as potential entrants. Conservative commentator and strategist Steve Hilton, meanwhile, leads among GOP candidates, drawing a meaningful share of the vote in public polls.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But he returned to the rationale that first led him to side with the GOP, warning that a shutdown ceded too much authority to President Donald Trump as he threatens mass layoffs and the cancellation of projects in blue states. White House budget director Russ Vought fanned those concerns on Tuesday with a draft memo that argued furloughed workers were not entitled to back pay. “The power that the president and OMB and Vought and Miller are exercising under the shutdown is a real threat to our country,” King told reporters ahead of the vote, referring to White House policy adviser Stephen Miller. “I would very much like to get this ACA thing resolved. “I think the Republicans should step up and help us do that. But in the end, we got to get this shutdown over with because I think the worst is yet to come.” Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and John Fetterman (D-PA) joining King, but fell short of the 60 needed to overcome the filibuster. A Democrat-led funding proposal that extends the Obamacare subsidies and rolls back Medicaid changes in Trump's tax law also failed in a separate vote held minutes earlier. Republicans hoped the repeated votes would exert pressure on retiring or centrist members seen as willing to break with Democratic leadership, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has managed to keep his caucus largely in lockstep. Democrats are asking for a permanent extension of the subsidies but have so far been unable to get a GOP commitment that they will be extended at all. Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), an adviser to Senate GOP leadership, met with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday night to discuss the shutdown, telling reporters the talks are a “directive” from the president. “Our position as Republicans hasn't changed of a clean CR, it's what happens next,” Mullin said. “It would be a lot easier to resolve the situation if Russ Vought would stop talking,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) said Tuesday after the budget office floated draft guidance to bar furloughed employees from back pay.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch live outside a court in Alexandria, Virginia, as former FBI Director James Comey makes his first court appearance in a Justice Department criminal case accusing him of lying to Congress five years ago. Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty Wednesday in a criminal case that has thrown a spotlight on the Justice Department's efforts to target adversaries of President Donald Trump. Comey entered a not guilty plea through his lawyer at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, to allegations that he lied to Congress five years ago, kick-starting a process of legal wrangling in which defense lawyers will almost certainly move to get the indictment dismissed before trial, possibly by arguing the case amounts to a selective or vindictive prosecution. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego gathered reporters in front of the speaker's office Wednesday afternoon to call on Johnson to swear in an Arizona congresswoman-elect who won a special election two weeks ago. After quickly shaking their hands, Johnson said he would swear in Adelita Grijalva after the government shutdown: “We need the lights turned back on, so we encourage both of you to go open the government.” “Get your people in and stop covering up for the pedophiles,” Gallego snapped at Johnson. Top union leaders representing federal employees, along with allied labor groups, on Wednesday pressured both parties to reach a solution to end the shutdown. “No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,” said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees. Union leaders criticized both parties in Congress but also targeted Trump, accusing him of using federal workers as “political pawns” after warnings Tuesday that back pay is not guaranteed. “He intends to either violate the law, or degrade, frighten, antagonize hardworking federal employees whose only crime is caring and wanting to work for the American people,” said Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees. Trump arrived in office in January 2017 as Comey, appointed to the FBI director job by President Barack Obama, was overseeing an investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. The dynamic was fraught from the start, with Comey briefing Trump weeks before he took office on the existence of uncorroborated and sexually salacious gossip in a dossier of opposition research compiled by a former British spy. In their first several private interactions, Comey would later reveal, Trump asked his FBI director to pledge his loyalty to him and to drop an FBI investigation into his administration's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Comey said Trump also asked him to announce that Trump himself wasn't under investigation as part of the broader inquiry into Russian election interference, something Comey didn't do. Comey was abruptly fired in May 2017 with Trump later saying he was thinking about “this Russia thing” when he decided to terminate him. The ACLU of Illinois and other Chicago immigration advocates sued DHS and ICE in March, alleging the January arrests of 26 people in the Midwest violated a 2022 consent decree that bans ICE from arresting people without warrants or probable cause. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered ICE to start making monthly disclosures of how many warrantless arrests agents make each month. House Speaker Mike Johnson is rejecting calls from some lawmakers for Congress to hold a stand-alone vote on paying military service members, who will potentially miss a paycheck next week if the shutdown isn't resolved soon. Johnson said the House already had that vote as part of a stop-gap spending bill that would have funded the federal government through Nov. 21. “Every Republican and at least one Democrat had the common sense to say ‘of course we want the government to stay in operation, of course we want to pay our troops and our air traffic controllers and our border patrol agents, TSA and everybody else,'” Johnson said. It does us no good to be here dithering on show votes.” House Speaker Mike Johnson's comments during a news conference at the Capitol on Wednesday follow the Trump administration's warning of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown, potentially reversing what has been long-standing policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees. Comey entered the not guilty plea through his lawyer at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, to allegations that he lied to Congress five years ago, kick-starting a process of legal wrangling in which defense lawyers will almost certainly move to get the indictment dismissed before trial, possibly by arguing the case amounts to a selective or vindictive prosecution. Comey is expected to plead not guilty during his appearance at federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Wednesday. Comey's legal team includes Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. attorney in Chicago. Trump has said he plans to designate antifa, an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups, as a “major terrorist organization” but it's not clear how that would work against the decentralized movement. The president said in a Wednesday morning social media post that Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritkzer, both Democrats, “should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!.” It wasn't immediately clear what Trump was specifically objecting to with his post, but it was the latest example of his brazen calls for his opponents to be prosecuted or locked up, a break from longtime norms as the Justice Department traditionally sought to maintain its independence. Authorities said a woman was shot over the weekend in Chicago when Border Patrol vehicles were boxed in and struck by other vehicles. Comey family arrives at Virginia courthouse for Former FBI Director's first court appearance They include his daughter Maurene, who was fired by the Justice Department earlier this year from her position as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, as well as Troy Edwards Jr., a son-in-law of Comey's who minutes after Comey was indicted resigned his job as a prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia — the same office that filed the charges. Tours at the Capitol have come to a standstill. President Trump is threatening to mass fire federal workers and refuse back pay for the rest. As the government shutdown enters a second week, there's no discernible endgame in sight. The Republicans who have majority control in Congress believe they have the upper hand politically, as they fend off Democratic demands to quickly fund health insurance subsidies as part of any plan to end the shutdown. Behind the scenes, though, signs of discomfort are apparent. A loosely formed collection of senators, Republicans and Democrats, have bantered about options for addressing the health insurance problem. Military personnel in uniform, with the Texas National Guard patch on, are seen at the U.S. Army Reserve Center, Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025, in Elwood, Ill., a suburb of Chicago.

A partisan battle is playing out in a Washington courtroom that could decide the fate of President Trump's federal law enforcement intervention in the nation's capital. Dozens of states have taken sides in a lawsuit challenging the open-ended National Guard deployment in Washington, with their support falling along party lines. On Wednesday, he finds himself at the center of a political storm: presiding over the Justice Department's prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey. Confirmed to the bench by President Joe Biden in 2021, Nachmanoff was randomly assigned to the case after a Virginia grand jury indicted Comey last month on charges including obstruction of a congressional proceeding. Despite the political noise, lawyers who know Nachmanoff say he is unlikely to be swayed. President Trump publicly implored Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey and other perceived adversaries. Halligan rushed to file charges before a legal deadline lapsed despite warnings from other lawyers in the office that the evidence was insufficient for an indictment. The two-count indictment alleges Comey made a false statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 30, 2020, by denying he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source to the news media and that he obstructed a congressional proceeding.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is barreling forward with his administration's heavy-handed efforts across the United States, in rather ominous and drastic ways. In recent days alone, his administration has tried to skirt a Trump-nominated judge's ruling against his use of the National Guard in Portland, Oregon. He's pressed forward with a Guard deployment to Chicago that the mayor and Illinois's governor have rejected – and even said Wednesday that the mayor and governor should be “in jail.” And he's now floating invoking the Insurrection Act, which hasn't been used in decades and would give him more freedom in deploying the military domestically. But in this moment, it's also worth emphasizing: He's charging forward despite public opinion, too. While many wagered at the start that Americans really just wanted to stomp out crime and didn't care about the details, the public has  actually taken a pretty dim view of Trump's gambit. And if anything, their skepticism appears to be growing. A few polls of late drive that home. The first thing to note is that Americans seem to oppose Trump's use of the Guard by sightly widening margins. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed they disapproved of Trump's use of the Guard and federal law enforcement to reduce crime, 55%-42%. And NPR-Ipsos polling in recent weeks showed fewer than 4 in 10 Americans supported Trump's decisions to deploy the Guard to Washington, DC, and Memphis, Tennessee. These numbers are significant because early polling suggested Americans were more evenly split on Trump's initial deployment of the military to Los Angeles over the summer. Those early polls also suggested Americans were broadly open to the concept of using the Guard to help police combat crime, at least as long as local officials didn't object. (An August AP-NORC poll showed Americans said 55%-37% that it was acceptable for the military and National Guard to support local police.) But the new data suggest Americans are now broadly opposed to using the Guard at all, irrespective of local input. A new Reuters-Ipsos poll released Wednesday showed Trump's approval rating on crime going from 43% last month to 41% now. A Washington Post-Ipsos poll conducted in mid-September showed Americans disapproved of him on crime 54%-44%. A New York Times-Siena College poll showed a more even split, but with some warning signs: Independents disapproved 51%-42%, and even 15% of Trump voters didn't like his handling of crime. That's actually something that Americans seem concerned about, even at this early juncture and even as they've been quite worried about crime. It surveyed  whether Americans were more worried about whether crime would “spiral out of control in big cities” if the Guard weren't deployed, or whether they were more concerned about Trump using the Guard to “intimidate his political opponents.” That latter option might seem rather conspiratorial to Trump supporters. But Americans chose it by a significant margin, 51%-42%. In fact, they said 58%-25% that a president should only deploy it to deal with “external threats.” Trump, by contrast, is very much seeking to use it against supposed internal threats – what he labels the “enemy from within.” “No different than a foreign enemy,” he said at one point. And Trump has solid support in his base, which is usually what he cares about most. But as he pushes toward the scenario that some of his most prominent top military leaders once feared – the militarization of the homeland – it's worth emphasizing that he's apparently doing these drastic things against Americans' will.</p>

Terrill) Osaka University professor Dr. Shimon Sakaguchi, right, receives flowers at a news conference in Suita, near Osaka, western Japan, Monday, Oct. 6, 2025, after he won the Nobel Prize in medicine. BERLIN (AP) — For some Nobel Prize winners this year, the news came with a knock at the door before dawn. One of the medicine prize winners, meanwhile, was on vacation in Yellowstone National Park without cellular service. It would be hours before he found out. The Nobel Prizes are considered among the world's most prestigious honors for achievements in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, economics and peace. Potential winners plan tentative news conferences or, in the western U.S., wait up all night for the news. While some prizes might feature household names — such as 2009 peace prize winner then-U.S. President Barack Obama or 2016 literature laureate and singer-songwriter Bob Dylan — the natural science categories typically go to people whose names the general public doesn't know, for decades-old research. Two winners in Japan, seven hours ahead of Stockholm, were awake and working when the call came from a Swedish number. Here's how some of this year's winners found out: When Associated Press photographer Lindsey Wasson knocked on the door of Mary E. Brunkow's Seattle home around 4 a.m. local time Monday, it was the scientist's dog who woke up first. Zelda's barking roused Brunkow's husband, Ross Colquhoun. Wasson's photographs captured Colquhoun waking up Brunkow and telling her the life-changing news: She was among three winners sharing the 2025 medicine prize. “Don't be ridiculous,” she told her husband. The trio had, in research dating back two decades, uncovered a key pathway the body uses to keep the immune system in check, called peripheral immune tolerance. Experts called the findings critical to understanding autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The following day, AP photographers Mark J. Terrill and Damian Dovarganes headed to Santa Barbara, California, to find physicist John Martinis before the sun rose. His wife, Jean, answered the door and told them to come back later: Martinis needed to sleep. “At some point we just decided, that's nuts. She finally woke her husband up just before 6 a.m. local time (1300 GMT), telling him only that the AP wanted an interview. “I kind of knew that the Nobel Prize announcements was this week, so I kind of put two and two together,” Martinis said later. So I was kind of in shock.” Martinis will get that trip to Sweden. Everyone but Fred Ramsdell seemed to know he had just won the Nobel Prize in medicine. Ramsdell was away on a backpacking trip Monday, driving through Yellowstone National Park with his wife and two dogs, Larkin and Megan. As they drove through a small town hours later, his wife started screaming as notifications flooded her phone. She told him he'd just won the Nobel Prize in medicine alongside Brunkow and Shimon Sakaguchi. “I said, ‘No, I didn't,'” Ramsdell told the AP in an interview the following day from his car. I have 200 text messages that say you won the Nobel Prize. He didn't speak with the Nobel committee to get their congratulations until midnight. But he has no plans to change his phone habits, which he says are important for work-life balance. When his phone rang Wednesday, chemistry winner Susumu Kitagawa was skeptical. He said he answered “rather bluntly, thinking it must be yet one of those telemarketing calls I'm getting a lot recently.” Will that winner pick up the phone?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 29-year-old Florida man is under arrest on suspicion of arson in connection with the Palisades Fire, which burned thousands of homes and killed 12 people when it tore through the Los Angeles area in January. Florida resident Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, is facing a federal charge of destruction of property by means of fire, according to Bill Essayli, the acting US attorney for Southern California. Rinderknecht allegedly generated an image on ChatGPT “depicting a burning city,” according to Essayli. “The investigation into the Palisades Fire of January 2025 was lengthy, complex and, as I mentioned, extremely thorough,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said at a news conference on Wednesday. Six days earlier, there had been another fire in the same vicinity, according to satellite images and dispatch recordings analyzed by CNN. That fire had been reported contained within hours by local firefighters after growing to about eight acres, according to alerts from the LA fire department, which noted a team would work to ensure no flare-ups occurred. The suspect is expected in federal court for a first appearance Wednesday afternoon, Essayli said. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined the fire “was ignited with an open flame,” Essayli said. Rinderknecht lived in the Palisades and was familiar with the neighborhood, which was full of dense vegetation, officials said. “Part of the lengthy time that it took to go over the thousands of acres that were burned is we literally had agents with our partners on their hands and knees crawling through fire debris,” said ATF Special Agent in Charge Kenny Cooper. Bill Weir investigates Pacific Palisades home that survived fires California Attorney General Rob Bonta told CNN earlier this year there were “some indications that arson is a possibility that we have to be open to.” LA County response to deadly fires slowed by lack of resources, outdated alert process, report says The deadly inferno in Los Angeles is the third-most destructive wildfire in Southern California history, destroying thousands of homes and businesses and burning more than 23,000 acres. “While we cannot undo the damage and destruction that was done, we hope his arrest and the charges against him bring some measure of justice to the victims of this horrific tragedy,” Essayli said in a social media post. This is a developing story and will be updated.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nine months after a raging inferno decimated the Los Angeles area, claiming the lives of a dozen people and burning down thousands of homes and businesses, officials have arrested a suspect in Florida on suspicion of arson. The suspect also allegedly prompted ChatGPT to generate a “dystopian painting showing in part a burning forest and a crowd fleeing from it,” in the months before the fire started, according to Bill Essayli, the acting US attorney for Southern California. The suspect, who worked as an Uber driver and lived in the Pacific Palisades at the time, is under arrest on suspicion of arson in connection with the Palisades Fire and is expected to make his first appearance in federal court in Orlando on Wednesday. CNN has contacted Rinderknecht's attorney for comment but did not immediately hear back. The iconic Pacific Coast Highway along Malibu looked like a war zone,” Essayli said. The homes and businesses cannot be rebuilt. This arrest, we hope, will provide a measure of justice to all those who were impacted.” Suspect charged in connection with deadly Palisades Fire The suspect was working as an Uber driver and dropped off a passenger on New Year's Eve before walking up a nearby trail where he took some iPhone videos of the view and listened to the rap song, before allegedly starting a fire 12 minutes into the new year, officials said. The blaze the suspect allegedly started was called the Lachman Fire, and it grew to eight acres before firefighters were able to knock it down, according to alerts from the Los Angeles Fire Department, which noted a team would work to ensure no flare-ups occurred. LAFD had suppressed the Lachman Fire on January 1, the complaint says, but it “continued to smolder and burn underground” unnoticed. “The investigation into the Palisades Fire of January 2025 was lengthy, complex and, as I mentioned, extremely thorough,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said at a news conference on Wednesday. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined the fire “was ignited with an open flame,” Essayli said. “Part of the lengthy time that it took to go over the thousands of acres that were burned is we literally had agents with our partners on their hands and knees crawling through fire debris,” said ATF Special Agent in Charge Kenny Cooper. This arrest is a critical step toward ensuring accountability, justice, and healing for our city,” Interim LAFD Chief Ronnie Villanueva said in a statement following the announcement of Rinderknecht's arrest. California Attorney General Rob Bonta told CNN earlier this year there were “some indications that arson is a possibility that we have to be open to.” LA County response to deadly fires slowed by lack of resources, outdated alert process, report says The deadly inferno in Los Angeles is the third-most destructive wildfire in Southern California history, destroying thousands of homes and businesses and burning more than 23,000 acres. “Our heroic firefighters fought the blaze valiantly with no rest,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement. “Each day that families are displaced is a day too long and as we are working tirelessly to bring Angelenos home, we are also working towards closure and towards justice – and today is a step forward in that process.” “While we cannot undo the damage and destruction that was done, we hope his arrest and the charges against him bring some measure of justice to the victims of this horrific tragedy,” Essayli said in a social media post.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Virginia Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is directing her attention to federal worker back pay in an apparent attempt to pull focus away from Jay Jones's violent text messages. Winsome Earle-Sears‘s campaign blasts the Democratic ticket on Jones's violent rhetoric. Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have called on Democrats to force their candidate for attorney general, Jones, to drop out of the election after text messages surfaced in which he said state House Speaker Todd Gilbert should get “two bullets to the head.” He has not dropped out, and Democrats have been mum about holding him accountable for his violent rhetoric, frustrating conservatives further. Spanberger has condemned Jones's violent rhetoric, but she didn't ask him to leave the race. “My opponent, Winsome Earle-Sears, has backed President Trump's job-killing and price-hiking agenda at every turn.” Earle-Sears has joined national GOP leaders in blaming the government shutdown on congressional Democrats, releasing a video advertisement on her social media pages in late September. She said, “Abigail Spanberger is right there with them,” in a post on X. Meanwhile, Earle-Sears's campaign hasn't taken its foot off the gas on slamming Jones's violent texts. Her campaign released a new ad titled “Two Bullets” that says plainly, “Jay Jones says he wants to put two bullets in a political opponent.” Earle-Sears has been consistently polling behind Spanberger by double digits, leading some Republicans to withhold endorsements or donations. Trump hasn't given her a full-fledged endorsement, and some of Gov. Glenn Youngkin's (R-VA) biggest donors haven't donated similarly to Earle-Sears. Earle-Sears and Spanberger are set to face off in their first debate on Thursday at Norfolk State University. Spanberger did not respond to the Washington Examiner's requests for comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Katie Hobbs launched her reelection bid Wednesday, outlining a practical rather than confrontational approach to campaigning in a swing state where the politics are delicate and she will need Republican support. Katie Hobbs speaks during an interview with The Associated Press, Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025, in Phoenix. Katie Hobbs speaks during an interview with The Associated Press, Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025, in Phoenix. Katie Hobbs speaks during an interview with The Associated Press, Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025, in Phoenix. Katie Hobbs launched her reelection bid Wednesday, outlining a practical rather than confrontational approach to campaigning in a swing state where the politics are delicate and she will need Republican support. Nationally, Democrats are looking to bounce back from sweeping losses in the 2024 election. She'll need that, particularly in a swing state that endorsed President Donald Trump in 2024 but chose Joe Biden four years earlier. “I think winning this race in Arizona is going to send a strong message of we know how to win in tough states like Arizona. It's about delivering on the issues that matter,” Hobbs said, pointing to issues including affordable housing and border security. As the likely Democratic nominee, Hobbs will face developer Karrin Taylor Robson, U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs or U.S. Rep. David Schweikert in the November 2026 general election. Taylor Robson and Biggs are both endorsed by Trump. Hobbs rose to prominence nationally amid Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Hobbs ran a cautious campaign in 2022, keeping largely to scripted and choreographed public appearances. She declined to debate her Republican opponent, Kari Lake, a Trump loyalist who also falsely claimed the 2020 election was rigged. Hobbs won by less than a percentage point. Hobbs acknowledged the 2026 race will be tough and said she's not taking any vote for granted. She criticized Taylor Robson, Biggs and Schweikert for supporting Trump's budget bill that she said raises the federal deficit, slashes meals for kids and jeopardizes health care. “The impacts of this partisan Washington budget are going to be really painful for Arizonans, having to make really tough choices when I've consistently tried to put families first. And it's going to be really challenging with these cuts.” It drew praise from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Hobbs pointed to it as an example of how she's worked with the Trump administration on border security. She had called out Biden, saying his administration didn't do enough. Hobbs stood firm in her conviction that deporting people shouldn't be done indiscriminately and rebuked Trump's widespread immigration crackdowns. “I would continue to advocate for the president to keep his promise and go after the people that are making us unsafe,” she said. This past legislative session, she vetoed a GOP-favored bill that sought to require local and state officials to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. She has drawn criticism from members of her own party, who pushed her to reduce spending for border support. Since she's been in office, Hobbs has remained strategically critical of her Republican foes in the state Legislature. She said she shares the frustrations of Arizonans who want accountability within the program and more guardrails. This past session, Hobbs' office chose to negotiate on just a handful of issues, including water policy, funding for some of Arizona's most vulnerable residents and renovations to a stadium used by the Arizona Diamondbacks. Not all of that legislation made it over the finish line. “I think that my record on delivering on the issues that Arizonans care about, whether it's securing the border, securing our water future, lowering costs, investing in education, creating good paying jobs is what is going to make that four more years possible,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Crow Creek Tribal School system is marked by a sign in Stephan, S.D., Feb. 7, 2025. (AP) — When Rob Coverdale started his job in 2023 as superintendent of the K-12 Crow Creek Tribal School in South Dakota, there were 15 unfilled teaching positions. Within nine months, he had filled those vacancies with Filipino teachers, the majority of whom arrived on the H-1B, a visa for skilled workers in specialty occupations. “So they're certainly not taking jobs from Americans. They're filling jobs that otherwise just simply we would not get filled.” Now a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications spells trouble for those like Coverdale in rural parts of the country who rely on immigrants to fill vacancies in skilled professions like education and health care. The Trump administration announced the fee on Sept. 19, arguing that employers were replacing American workers with cheaper talent from overseas. H-1Bs are primarily associated with tech workers from India. Big tech companies are the biggest user of the visa, and nearly three-quarters of those approved are from India. But there are critical workers, like teachers and doctors, who fall outside that category. One in eight public school positions are vacant or filled by uncertified teachers, and the American Medical Association projects a shortage of 87,000 physicians in the next decade. The shortages are often worse in small, rural communities that struggle to fill jobs due to lower wages and often lack basic necessities like shopping and home rental options. While large companies may be able to absorb the new fee, that's not an option for most rural communities, said Melissa Sadorf, executive director of the National Rural Education Association. “Attaching that price tag to a single hire, it just simply puts that position out of reach for rural budgets.” A coalition of health care providers, religious groups and educators filed a lawsuit on Friday to stop the H-1B fee, saying it would harm hospitals, churches, schools and industries that rely on the visa. Coverdale said spots like Stephan, where Crow Creek is based, struggle to attract workers in part because of their isolation. Stephan is nearly an hour's drive from the nearest Walmart or any place that sells clothes, he said. Among Coverdale's hires is Mary Joy Ponce-Torres, who had 24 years of teaching experience in the Philippines and now teaches history at Crow Creek. “I came from a private school,” she said. Many immigrants like Ponce-Torres leave their family behind to pursue the experience and higher wages that a U.S. job can provide. Sean Rickert, superintendent of the Pima Unified School District in Pima, Arizona, said he would stop seeking H-1B teachers if the new fee is imposed. “I just plain don't have the money,” he said. “It's so important that we find permanent people, people who can buy homes, who can become part of our community,” said George Shipley, superintendent at Bison Schools in the town of Bison, South Dakota. Without enough staff, schools may hire uncertified teachers, combine classes, increase caseloads for special education managers or drop some course offerings. Shipley said any future shortage of teachers in Bison would force some classes to move online. The fee could be a “huge problem” for health care, said Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association and a doctor in Flint, Michigan. Without enough doctors, patients will have to drive farther and wait longer for care. “It's just going to be terrible for the physician shortage, particularly in rural areas,” said Mukkamala, whose parents came to the U.S. as international medical graduates. “The people that do graduate from here, who want to practice medicine, obviously have a choice and they're going to pick Detroit, they're going to pick Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco. Leading medical societies have called on the Trump administration and lawmakers to grant exemptions from the fee to immigrant health care workers. “Given the staffing and financial challenges our hospitals are already facing, the increased petition fees outlined in the September 19 Proclamation would likely prevent many of them from continuing to recruit essential health care staff and could force a reduction in the services they are able to provide,” the American Hospital Association said in a statement. Allison Roberts, vice president of human resources at Prairie Lakes Healthcare System in Watertown, South Dakota, said the change could be dire for health care in rural America. “If we end up not being exempt, the variation between what it is now and that $100,000 fee is going to really take your smaller, rural health care institutions out of the picture,” she said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty Wednesday morning to charges of making false statements and obstructing a 2020 congressional proceeding, as prosecutors signaled the case would introduce classified information in the discovery phase of legal proceedings. The prosecution, led by U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, argued this was a complicated case and pushed for more time before bringing it to trial. U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, raised skepticism about how complicated the two-charge indictment is, but he eventually agreed that a preliminary date for when the trial could begin is Jan. 5. Nachmanoff also told the prosecution team that the case would move forward, “or we will go through the fastest CIPA process you have ever seen in your lives,” referring to the Classified Information Procedures Act process that typically involves lawyers presenting materials to defendants in private settings away from public view. Halligan, a former real estate lawyer and personal attorney to President Donald Trump, was only recently appointed to her position after Trump fired her predecessor, Erik Siebert, after sources revealed to multiple outlets that he was pushing back against charging New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud violations. Comey arrived early at his seat inside the courtroom on the sixth floor of the courthouse and was supported by members of his family, including his daughter, Maurene Comey, who was fired from her post as a top prosecutor in the Southern District of New York earlier this year. Comey welcomed a trial in his statement following the Sept. 25 indictment, though his attorney Fitzgerald signaled they may attempt to avoid one altogether. He was released on his own recognizance and departed the federal courthouse through a secured exit, while his family exited through the main courthouse entrance. The grand jury issued charges against Comey last month relating to alleged false statements and obstruction that occurred five years ago on Sept. 30, 2020, when the former director allegedly deceived the Senate Judiciary Committee about whether he authorized another person “to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation” into former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The indictment does not name the individual whom prosecutors say Comey authorized to leak information, nor does it specify which articles were involved. However, a 2018 report by the Justice Department's inspector general found that then–FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had approved sharing details of the Clinton investigation with a Wall Street Journal reporter and later showed a “lack of candor” when Comey and other officials questioned him about the leak. In a CNN interview last month, McCabe said he found it “unbelievable” that federal investigators had not contacted him regarding Comey's testimony. During the 2017 congressional hearing, Comey admitted he had asked a Columbia Law School friend to relay information to a New York Times reporter about his conversations with then-President Trump early in his tenure. That friend — a former special government employee, professor, and advice liaison to Comey, Daniel Richman — later confirmed he was the intermediary but said the material he conveyed at Comey's request was not classified. Nachmanoff, 57, oversaw the previous cases of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, and released them on $1 million bonds in 2019. In a more recent case, he declined to block the CIA from firing Terry Adirim, a Pentagon physician who was scrutinized by Trump allies over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Rep. Katie Porter bit back at a reporter's question about whether she would need President Donald Trump's voters to win the California governor's race. A reporter from CBS Los Angeles asked Porter, as she had asked several other gubernatorial candidates, “What do you say to the 40% of CA voters who you'll need in order to win, who voted for Trump?” Porter called the line of questioning “unnecessarily argumentative.” I'm happy to answer the question as you have it written,” Porter said. “Every other candidate has answered our follow-ups,” the journalist said. I don't care … if every question you're gonna make up a follow-up question, then we're never gonna get there,” Porter said, trying to leave. “I don't want to have an unhappy experience with you,” she added, “and I don't want this all on camera.” Former California State Controller Betty T. Yee criticized Porter most directly. “After watching the interview, it's clear—Katie Porter doesn't have the temperament to be Governor,” she said in a post on X. “As a candidate, I welcome the hard questions—the next governor must be accessible and transparent. No place for dodging the public's right to know.” Other candidates include former Los Angeles Mayor Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa and Republican Steve Hilton. Porter has been out of politics since leaving her office representing California's 47th district in the House earlier this year. She entered the California gubernatorial race in March, aiming to succeed term-limited Gov.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Police arrested a New Jersey man in Washington, D.C., on Sunday who was accused of stashing over 200 “fully functional” grenades in his tent. Louis Geri, who appeared to be homeless, was apprehended outside St. Matthew's Cathedral in Northwest Washington hours before an annual Red Mass ceremony marking the start of the Supreme Court's fall term, according to authorities. Geri was also found with documents showing animosity toward Jews, Catholics, Supreme Court members, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to records. “Do you want me to throw one out? I have a hundred plus of them,” the suspect said. “If you just step back, I'll throw one in the street, no one will get hurt, there will be a hole in the street. … If you just step back, I'll take out that tree. “Several of your people are going to die from one of these,” Geri told police as they warned him he would be removed. He is being held in jail without bond. The incident is the latest of targeted threats against religious institutions, including shootings at a Catholic church in Minneapolis and a Mormon church in Michigan. Three were killed at Minnesota's Annunciation Church in August.</p>
