Live Updates


            • US special envoy Steve Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Israel's chief negotiator Ron Dermer are taking part in an “expanded meeting” in Egypt today to end the war in Gaza, according to Egyptian state-affiliated TV.
    


            • The negotiations are taking place to finalize a deal based on Trump's Gaza ceasefire proposal. Hamas and Israel have already exchanged a list of hostages and prisoners to be released as part of a deal, according to a Hamas official.
    


            • Meanwhile, Israel has intercepted another fleet of Gaza-bound aid ships carrying journalists, activists and medical professionals according to organizers.
    


            There are positive signals coming out of the ongoing Gaza ceasefire talks in Egypt which US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner are taking part in, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
    


            The indirect talks between Hamas and Israel have not yet secured an agreement but the sentiment from those involved is that one could be reached this week, the sources said. They are specifically working toward an agreement to release the hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, which they hope would happen soon after a deal is struck, one of the sources said.
    


            The White House did not immediately respond when asked to provide a status update on the talks.
    


            The brother of the Irish author Naoise Dolan, a participant aboard the Thousand Madleens flotilla that was intercepted on Wednesday morning, has called for government officials to ensure her safe return.
    


            “Thousand Madleens is a humanitarian mission whose sole aim is to bring critical support to the citizens of Gaza who have been suffering for years under a dehumanising blockade; their abduction by Israel is entirely unwarranted, inhumane, and in clear breach of international law,” Mike Dolan told CNN.
    


            Naoise Dolan was travelling on a vessel named Milad, after the daughter of Walid Daqqa, who was one of the longest-serving Palestinian prisoners in Israel until his death last year.
    


            The treatment of the activists detained by Israel will “pale in comparison to that which the people of Palestine have been subjected to, both before and during the most recent escalation,” Mike Dolan told CNN.
    


            “I would urge governments and public representatives to take decisive action to ensure the safe return of my sister and her fellow volunteers, and to end the brutal occupation of Palestine,” he said.
    


            Negotiations between Israel and Hamas in the Egyptian city of Sharm El-Sheikh are focused on where Israeli forces will withdraw to in Gaza, the timeline for the release of the hostages and the list of Palestinian prisoners set for release, an Israeli source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            “The fact that senior officials from all the countries are there is encouraging,” the source said.
    


            Officials from the United States, Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, Israel and Hamas are in the Red Sea city negotiating the implementation of a plan presented by the Trump administration to end the war.
    


            These are some of the latest pictures into us from Gaza today, showing life on the ground while ceasefire negotiations take place in Egypt aimed at finalizing a deal that will end fighting in the enclave.
    


            Eight Palestinians have been killed and another 61 people have been injured in Gaza in the past 24 hours, according to the health ministry there, as we reported earlier.
    


            Arab nations have condemned far-right Israeli minister Itamar Ben Gvir after he prayed at Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site today, despite a decades-old agreement that bars non-Muslims from worshipping there.
    


            Ben Gvir, who drew condemnation for a similar move in August, visited the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, known to Jews as Temple Mount, alongside a number of Jewish men and boys.
    


            In a video recorded at the site, Ben Gvir said that two years after Hamas' October 7 attacks on Israel and the subsequent war in Gaza that followed, “we are the owners of the Temple Mount.”
    


            “Here on the Temple Mount, there is victory; in every house in Gaza there is a picture of the Temple Mount, and today, two years on, we are victorious on the Temple Mount,” he said.
    


Reaction: The Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry called Ben Gvir's actions an attempt to “inflame the region” and to “sabotage” the ceasefire plan proposed by US President Donald Trump, which negotiators are currently discussing in Egypt.
    


            Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry also condemned Ben Gvir, writing on social media that it “renews its strongest denunciation of the continued assaults on the sanctity of the al-Aqsa Mosque.”
    


            The Jordanian foreign ministry lambasted what it called Ben Gvir's “raid,” writing that it was a “blatant breach of international law and international humanitarian law, a condemned escalation and an unacceptable provocation.”
    


More context: The complex in occupied East Jerusalem is the holiest site in Judaism, where Jews face in prayer. It is also the third holiest site in Islam.



Anyone can visit the site, but only Muslims are allowed to pray there, according to an understanding known as the ‘status quo agreement,' which has existed since Israel captured the Old City of Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of a future independent state.



            We reported earlier that an “expanded meeting” to end the war was due to get under way in Egypt this afternoon.
    


            US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner have been participating in these “expanded” ceasefire talks in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egyptian media has said, with Israel's minister of strategic affairs and chief negotiator Ron Dermer in attendance.
    


            Indirect talks between Hamas and Israel are ongoing in the city, with officials from the US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkey mediating, Egyptian state-affiliated Al-Qahera News said.
    


            Bilateral talks are also being held between Egyptian, Qatari mediators, and Hamas, Al-Qahera news said.
    


            Eight Palestinians have been killed and another 61 people injured in Gaza over the last 24 hours, according to the health ministry there, as Israeli, Hamas and US delegations are in Egypt for indirect ceasefire talks.
    


            Gaza residents CNN spoke to this morning described hearing attacks in Gaza City and along the coast over the last 24 hours. It comes days after US President Donald Trump called for Israel to “immediately” stop its bombardment.
    


            Mohammad al-Jarou, who lives in Gaza City's al-Rimal neighborhood, said that he saw warplanes flying at low altitudes Wednesday, with airstrikes and explosions occurring throughout Tuesday into the night.
    


            “Most of these airstrikes and explosions were in the same areas where the army advanced,” he said.
    


            Ismail Zaydeh, who has been displaced to Gaza's coast, said that he could also hear the sounds of munitions from where he is sheltering in northern Gaza's Al-Shati Camp.
    


For context: More than 67,000 people – most of them women and children - have been killed since the war began, according to the latest health ministry figures, with an additional 169,841 people injured.



The true death toll is believed to be much higher, with many thousands believed to still be trapped under the rubble, according to the ministry, the United Nations and multiple humanitarian organizations.



            More than 60 percent of all buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed in the last two years of war in the enclave, according to an analysis of satellite data.
    


            The image below shows the impact the conflict has had on Gaza's buildings and human settlements.
    


            Israeli Minister of Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer is likely to join the ceasefire talks in Sharm el-Sheikh today, according to a senior Israeli official. Dermer is considered the closest confidant of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
    


            He is the head of the Israeli negotiation team, but wasn't part of the Israel-Hamas indirect negotiations on Monday or Tuesday, which were handled by a lower-level delegation. An Israeli source told CNN he will be joining talks when US envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff arrive in Sharm el-Sheikh today.
    


            “When Kushner and Witkoff will be there – Dermer will be there as well,” the source said.
    


Some background: Dermer is Netanyahu's key point man to both the Trump administration and Arab states in the region. He was appointed to lead the negotiation team in February 2025, after Netanyahu dismissed the heads of Mossad and Shin Bet, who had overseen the previous hostage deals in November 2023 and January 2025.
    


            Since his appointment, however, no new hostage deal with Hamas has been reached, and only one hostage has been freed in a separate US-Hamas arrangement.
    


            An “expanded meeting” to end the war will soon get under way in the Egyptian city of Sharm El- Sheikh, with US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner and Israel's chief negotiator Ron Dermer attending, the Egyptian state-affiliated al-Qahera News said.
    


            Top officials from Egypt, Qatar and Turkey are in the Red Sea city for indirect ceasefire negotiations between Hamas and Israel.
    


            Bilateral meetings with mediators were held ahead of the expanded meeting, according to the Egyptian outlet.
    


            The family of Bipin Joshi, one of the hostages still held in Gaza, said a previously unseen video showing him alive in captivity gives them new hope.
    


            The video, recovered by Israeli military in Gaza, is believed to have been filmed in November 2023, just weeks after Joshi's kidnapping, according to a Wednesday statement from the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.
    


            The Nepali student was kidnapped by Hamas during the October 7, 2023 terror attack. He was working at a farm in kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel. He was 22 at the time.
    


            In the statement released by the forum, the family said the video gave them “unwavering faith that (Bipin Joshi) is alive.”
    


            Joshi is one of five foreign nationals who are still held in Gaza, alongside three people from Thailand and one from Tanzania.
    


            Sonthaya Oakkharasri and Sudthisak Rinthalak, from Thailand, and Joshua Mollel, from Tanzania, have been declared dead by the Israeli government.
    


            Israeli officials have previously said there were “grave concerns” for Joshi.
    


            We've just heard from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who said he is inviting US President Donald Trump to attend the signing ceremony in Egypt if a ceasefire agreement over Gaza is reached.
    


                    “It would be wonderful, if an agreement is reached, that your excellency attends. I am inviting President Trump in the case, God willing, if an agreement is reached, that he attends the signing in Egypt,” al-Sisi said at a graduating ceremony for police students in Cairo.
                





            Al-Sisi said “prominent” US envoys were dispatched to Sharm El Sheikh on Tuesday, referring to special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, “with a strong mandate from President Trump to end the war during the current round of negotiations.”
    


            “My message to President Trump…continue your support and your will to end this war.”
    


            Delegations from Israel and Hamas have been holding indirect negotiations over the past three days in Egypt, based on US President Donald Trump's proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza.
    


            Trump's plan demands Hamas release all hostages while Israel releases Palestinian prisoners, withdraws its forces within Gaza to agreed-upon lines following a timeline. Both Israel and Hamas have signaled willingness to work toward a deal.
    


Key issues are now being discussed between both parties. These include:



Hostage releases



            Hamas has accepted one of the most important demands of the Trump plan: the release of all of the hostages at the start of the ceasefire. Hamas agreed to the “exchange formula” laid out in the plan: all 48 remaining hostages for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 Palestinians from Gaza detained after October 7.
    


            The militant group has demanded the release of Marwan Barghouti - a prominent figure in the Palestinian national movement who is facing multiple life sentences in Israel - as part of a deal, a Hamas official told CNN today.
    


Hamas disarmament



            Hamas' response fails to address the issue of disarmament or the decommissioning of weaponry: a key condition of the Trump proposal and a demand of the international community. Hamas has repeatedly refused to disarm.
    


“Board of Peace”



            Missing from Hamas' latest response is any mention of the international oversight committee led by Trump, a “Board of Peace” that's supposed to supervise the local Palestinian governance.
    


Gaza governance



            Hamas also said it was willing to hand over power in Gaza to independent Palestinian technocrats, closely mirroring the language in the US plan.
    


Israeli guarantees



            Hamas is demanding guarantees that Israel will stick to the deal, and guarantees of safe passage for senior figures leaving the territory. The latter is especially sensitive, after Israel launched a series of strikes targeting Hamas' leadership in the Qatari capital of Doha.
    


            US President Donald Trump's decision to send Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to join the Gaza ceasefire talks in Sharm el-Sheikh inevitably prompts suggestions that an agreement might be coming soon.
    


            Trump's big hitters would not be going if the two sides were failing even to make progress on technical issues, such as the timing of Palestinian prisoner releases, the logic runs.
    


            Deploying the White House team cranks up the pressure on the parties in the Egyptian resort city.
    


            But it also sets a new timer: How long can the Americans remain at the talks without themselves starting to suffer reputational damage? (The same considerations are true, of course, for the other third parties joining the fray on Wednesday: Qatar's Prime Minister and Turkey's Intelligence Chief.)
    


            Trump sees himself as the ultimate deal maker, but regardless of his inflated claims to have solved seven wars in a little over seven months, his foreign policy record is somewhat patchy.
    


            In his quest to land the Nobel Peace Prize, along with his notoriously short attention span, it's possible he could have sent in his key envoys too soon.
    


            Once they are on the ground, the Americans could, of course, threaten to leave again, which would presumably serve to further increase the pressure on Israel and Hamas to get a deal over the line.
    


            But a departure is something they could only really do once, and it would surely signal the end of this round of diplomacy.
    


            At the same time, the two Americans cannot stay forever.
    


            As we've been reporting, US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner are expected to land in Egypt to join negotiations aimed at finalizing a Gaza ceasefire agreement.
    


            Kushner worked as Trump's adviser in his first term, and after leaving the White House in 2021, launched a private equity firm, Affinity Partners, which received $2 billion from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund. The UAE and Qatar have also invested large amounts into his firm.
    


            These deals came shortly after Kushner helped lead Middle East policy during the first Trump administration, including the Abraham Accords, which normalized ties between Israel and several Arab states. Kushner has denied these investments are a conflict of interest.
    


            Critics from across party lines and human rights organizations argue that Kushner continues to profit from relationships he built while in public office, renewing questions about whether his financial ties with Riyadh and other Gulf players could influence US policy under his father-in-law.
    


            His firm invests heavily in Israeli companies, and Kushner praised the “very valuable” potential of Gaza's “waterfront property” last year, suggesting that Israel should move Palestinians “out and then clean it up” — raising further questions about his impartiality in acting as a mediator as he re-enters diplomatic circles.
    


            While Kushner has quietly advised administration officials on Middle East issues since Trump's return to office, he doesn't hold an official role inside the White House.
    


            In August, he met with Witkoff and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to discuss ideas for a post-war Gaza plan. 



            Hamas has demanded the release of Marwan Barghouti – a prominent figure in the Palestinian national movement who is facing multiple life sentences in Israel – as part of a Gaza ceasefire deal, a Hamas official told CNN.
    


            Negotiations between Israel and Hamas are underway in the Egyptian city of Sharm El Sheikh focused on a potential release of hostages held in Gaza and Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Hamas said it has submitted a list of prisoners it seeks to have released.
    


            Hamas and Israel have already exchanged a list of hostages and prisoners to be released as part of a deal , another Hamas official, Taher Al Nunu said, adding that a “spirit of optimism prevails among everyone” involved in the talks.
    


More about Barghouti: The 66-year-old is serving five life sentences after being convicted in 2002 for his role in planning attacks that killed five civilians during the Second Palestinian Intifada. He denied the charges at the time.
    


            He is widely seen as a popular and unifying figure among Palestinians and a potential successor to the increasingly unpopular and ageing Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
    


            On multiple occasions, Palestinian factions have tried to secure his release, including reportedly in ceasefire negotiations during the current war. But Israel has refused to consider releasing Barghouti, who is not a member of Hamas.
    


            He has been held in solitary confinement since the start of the Gaza war, according to his family and the Palestinian Prisoners' Society. In August, a video surfaced showing Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir taunting Barghouti while visiting him in jail – an encounter that has prompted outrage from supporters.
    


            At the time he appeared gaunt and frail, with his arms held together in front as he nods slightly.
    


            Palestinian health care workers are exhausted and desperate for the war to end, a Nicaraguan-American pediatric critical care doctor volunteering in Gaza told CNN.
    


            “It's been two years of just nonstop war and violence,”  Dr. Michael Lintner Rivera told CNN's Rosemary Church. “They're just wanting peace.”
    


            Health care workers are having to contend with limited supplies and a high number of severely wounded patients, many of them children, Lintner Rivera said.
    


            “We're seeing mass casualties come in still. They're coming in with blast injuries, shrapnel injuries. There's also just very, very limited resources right now,” he said, adding that patients are dying from treatable infections like sepsis as a result.
    


                    “Al-Aqsa hospital was designed for 200 patients,” he said. “There are well over 700 patients right now in the hospital.”
                





            The humanitarian situation in Gaza is only becoming “more and more catastrophic” as Israel's war stretches into its third year, the emergency coordinator for Doctors Without Borders (MSF) in the enclave told CNN's Lynda Kinkade.
    


            Following the Israeli military's attacks on Gaza City, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee south, where they lack shelter, clean water and food, said Aitor Zabalgogeazkoa, who spoke to CNN from Khan Younis.
    


                    “It's impossible to try to describe the amplitude and the magnitude of the impact that (the war) is going to have on the people in the next months and years to come,” Zabalgogeazkoa said.
                





            Medical facilities in Gaza are overcrowded, with shortages of everything from fuel to medicine, he said.
    


            Nasser Hospital, which has been struck repeatedly by Israel, is often treating more than 1,000 patients in a facility with just 390 beds, Zabalgogeazkoa said.
    


            MSF workers in Gaza are “struggling on a daily basis,” he said, noting that two of his colleagues were recently killed in an air strike while waiting for the bus to go to work.
    


            The third day of talks to bring an end to the war in Gaza will start at 11 a.m. local time (4 a.m. ET), Egypt's state-affiliated Al Qahera news said.
    


            Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, Egypt's intelligence chief Hassan Rashad and his Turkish counterpart, Ibrahim Kalin, will be mediating the talks.
    


            US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner are also expected in Egypt for the talks.
    


            Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani will head to Sharm el-Sheikh for peace talks today, according to the Qatari foreign ministry's spokesperson.
    


                    Spokesperson Majed al-Ansari wrote on X that Al-Thani's participation “comes at a critical stage of the talks, reaffirming the determination of the mediators to reach an agreement that would bring an end to the catastrophic war in the Gaza Strip.”
                





            Al-Thani's trip also comes a few days after a direct apology from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the Qatari leader during a meeting with US President Donald Trump to apologize for an unprecedented September strike targeting Hamas' negotiating team in Doha.
    


            At the time, Al-Thani was pessimistic about the chances for peace, declaring in an interview with CNN that Netanyahu had “killed any hope” for bringing Israeli hostages out of Gaza.

            A bear rampaged through the sushi section of a supermarket in central Japan Tuesday, the latest in a series of attacks that have pushed this year's death toll to a record high.
    


            Two customers, ages 69 and 76, were injured when the bear, standing at 1.4 meters, crossed a parking lot before entering a supermarket in Numata City, about 80 miles north of Tokyo, according to local police. One was injured in the parking lot, the other inside the store.
    


            Though this encounter wasn't fatal, two bear attacks earlier this month took the death toll to 7 people so far this year, according to official data and local news reports – the highest annual toll since records began in 2006.
    


            On Tuesday, around 40 people were doing their shopping at about 7:30 p.m. local time when the bear entered the premises and pounced on a shopper, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported. Two customers suffered minor injuries, police said.
    


Experts say bears are increasingly venturing out of their traditional habitats and into urban areas in search of food because climate change is interfering with the flowering and pollination of some of the animals' traditional sources of food.
    


            However, the supermarket store manager told NHK the bear didn't seem interested in food.
    


            “It seemed like it had entered the store, wanted to leave but couldn't, and then became agitated,” he said.
    


            As the manager tried to evacuate customers from the store, the bear ran out.
    


            “I often heard news reports about bears entering stores, but I never imagined one would actually come to ours,” the manager told NHK.
    


            Earlier this month, two deaths were attributed to bear attacks, taking the annual toll to 7. Then a body with scratch marks that appeared to be from a bear was discovered Wednesday morning in the northern Iwate prefecture, NHK reported, possibly pushing the death toll higher.
    


            Tuesday's attack was among a series of reported encounters between bears and humans across the country this week.
    


            Also on Tuesday, a farmer in his 20s was attacked by a bear in the northern prefecture of Akita, days after a Spanish tourist was wounded by another animal while walking near a shuttle bus top at the Shirakawa Village, a popular destination in central Japan.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","US govt shutdown triggers air traffic chaos","https://www.rt.com/news/626073-us-flights-delay-shutdown/","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 09:41:00 GMT","



Over 9,000 flights were delayed or canceled across the US on Monday and Tuesday, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) data. The disruptions were triggered by a staffing shortage of air traffic controllers caused by the ongoing partial government shutdown.  

The shutdown began on October 1 after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on a spending bill. While most federal workers are furloughed, air traffic controllers are deemed essential and must work without pay during the shutdown, although back pay is guaranteed.   

However, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed a higher rate of controllers calling in sick since the shutdown began.   

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) union, which represents 20,000 air traffic controllers, said it is working with the FAA to mitigate disruptions in the National Airspace System.   

“It is normal for a few air traffic controllers to call in sick on any given day, and this is the latest example of how fragile our aviation system is in the midst of a national shortage of these critical safety professionals,” NATCA said in statement on Monday.  

“NATCA has consistently warned that the controller staffing shortage leaves the system vulnerable, and today's events underscore the urgent need to accelerate training and hiring,” it added. 

The statement warned that a government shutdown places an unnecessary strain on an already overstretched workforce. It recalled that during the 2019 shutdown, many controllers were forced to take second jobs to pay their bills, leading to significant stress and fatigue.  

The shutdown also impacts the Essential Air Service, a program that funds flights to smaller airport, he said, warning that its funding could run out.  

During a 35-day government shutdown in 2019 under President Donald Trump's first term, a spike in absences among controllers and TSA officers led to extended checkpoint waits and forced authorities to slow air traffic, particularly in New York, increasing pressure on lawmakers to end the standoff.

Airports in Denver, Newark, and Burbank were among those most affected by the disruptions early this week.

Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has alleged that she and other detainees from the Gaza flotilla were subjected to harsh treatment by the Israeli authorities.

The Global Sumud Flotilla set sail in late September to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza and protest Israel's naval blockade. Organized by pro-Palestinian groups, it carried food and medical supplies.

Israeli forces intercepted it on October 3, detaining hundreds of activists, including Thunberg. Israel called the move a legal security action.

Speaking at a press conference in Stockholm on Tuesday following her deportation, Thunberg claimed that she and other activists were “kidnapped and tortured.” She declined to elaborate, only saying that detainees were denied clean water and critical medication.

”Personally, I don't want to share what I was subjected to … because that's not the story here,” she said, adding that the treatment they endured was minor compared with what people in Gaza face daily.

Turkish journalist and flotilla participant Ersin Celik earlier claimed that he witnessed Israeli forces “torture Greta Thunberg,” and that she was “dragged on the ground” and “forced to kiss the Israeli flag.” Thunberg made no mention of the allegations at the press conference.

The Israeli government has denied the allegations of torture, claiming that the detainees were treated in accordance with legal standards and provided with food, water, restrooms, access to medical assistance, and legal counsel.

In earlier remarks, the Israeli Foreign Ministry called the flotilla a “selfie yacht of celebrities,” saying it was aimed more at generating publicity than delivering aid.

Following the detention, Thunberg and 170 other activists were deported to Greece and Slovakia. Several participants have since alleged that they were beaten, deprived of sleep, and denied medical care during their time in Israeli custody.

Ukraine could use US Tomahawk missiles to launch increasingly escalatory strikes on targets inside Russia in order to “pressure” Moscow to agree to a peace deal, an official in Kiev has claimed to The Telegraph.

Washington first signaled last month that it was considering supplying Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine. The weapons, which cost about $1.3 million each and have a range of 2,500km (1,550 miles), could reach targets deep inside Russia, including Moscow. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he had “sort of made a decision” on the matter, but added that “I'm not looking to see escalation.”

Egor Cherniev, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliament's national security, defense, and intelligence committee, suggested that the missiles could be deployed in phases, with one scenario being that they would not be fired at all, or only used against a narrow range of targets.

“First they will give us rockets, but a few pieces, or a couple of dozen, but they will not allow us to shoot them at once and we will see the Kremlin's reaction,” he said, as quoted by The Telegraph.

If Russia does not respond, he added, “the envelope increases, allowing strikes on the Russian border.” Eventually, he suggested, in order to push Moscow towards talks, all restrictions might be lifted “except perhaps strikes on the Kremlin and directly on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.”

“This whole epic could take at least a few months. But it's already real pressure,” Cherniev argued.

Putin warned last week that sending Tomahawks to Ukraine would “lead to the destruction of [Russia-US] relations, or at least the positive tendencies that have appeared in these relations.”

The Russian leader has also pointed out that Ukrainian forces would be unable to operate the system without “direct participation of American military personnel,” adding that the deliveries would not alter “the balance of power on the battlefield.”

Putin recalled previous shipments of long-range ATACMS missiles to Ukraine, which he said at first “caused some damage, but in the end, Russia's air defense systems adapted.”

MOSCOW, October 8. /TASS/. Russia, under the current circumstances, considers it inappropriate to maintain its obligations under the plutonium management and disposition agreement with the US, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told the State Duma.

""In this situation, the process of terminating cooperation with the Americans under the agreement, even from a formal standpoint, simply naturally offers itself. Maintaining any further obligations regarding plutonium, which is the subject of this agreement, is unacceptable and inadvisable from any point of view,"" he explained.

At Wednesday's plenary session the State Duma considered a bill ""On the denunciation by the Russian Federation of the agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the United States on the disposal of plutonium, declared to be no longer necessary for defense purposes, its handling, and cooperation in this area, and the protocols to this agreement.""

Ryabkov clarified that ""the necessary conclusions and approvals have been received, and if the federal law is adopted, no additional federal budget expenditures will be required for its implementation.""

He recalled that this agreement was suspended by a presidential decree on October 31, 2016, and a federal law on this matter was adopted at the same time.

""The reasons were: a fundamental change in circumstances, the imposition of sanctions against Russia by the United States, the adoption of a law on support for Ukraine that allows interference in our country's internal affairs, NATO's eastward expansion, and the buildup of the US military presence in East European countries,"" Ryabkov stated.

He emphasized the fact that there was also ""an intention by the United States to change the plutonium disposal procedure, as outlined in the agreement itself, without obtaining consent from Russia.""

""The agreement assumed that Russia would process excess plutonium into so-called mixed uranium-plutonium fuel, or MOX fuel, for nuclear power plants. The Americans intended to bury it, but the proposed disposal methodology raised questions about the possible recovery of this material after disposal,"" Ryabkov explained.

""Therefore, the situation required action on our part. Certain conditions for the agreement's resumption were formulated, which, of course, the Americans failed to fulfill,"" Ryabkov stated. ""At present none of these conditions can be met, given that the situation has radically changed,"" leading to the termination of cooperation in this area. The agreement with the United States was reached in 2000 and ratified in 2011. It provided for the disposal by each side of 34 tons of weapons-grade plutonium, declared redundant for military programs.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

CHISINAU, October 8. /TASS/. Brussels is preparing Moldova for war, regarding it not as a future EU member state but as frontline territory, Igor Dodon, former president and the leader of the Patriotic Electoral Bloc, said.

""The current EU authorities are preparing Moldova for war and regard our country not as a future EU member state, but as a frontline territory that they could potentially use against their geopolitical opponents. That is why they need their puppet regime here, represented by Maia Sandu and her Party of Action and Solidarity. They are pumping Moldova with military equipment so that, in case of necessity, they can ignite another hotspot on the map,"" Dodon wrote on his Telegram channel.

Earlier, the Moldovan parliament approved a national security strategy proposed by Sandu that names Russia as the biggest threat. Despite Moldova's enshrined constitutional neutrality, the strategy states that Chisinau will strengthen its cooperation with NATO and EU countries in this area and increase its arms spending. Meanwhile, all opposition parties are criticizing the multimillion-dollar defense spending during an economic crisis.

This has raised concerns in the Gagauz autonomy and the unrecognized Transnistria, who are worried about the increased frequency of NATO drills near the security zone guarded by Russian peacekeepers. Moldovan civil society is also concerned about the increasing presence of foreign servicemen on the streets of the country's towns.

The Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) press bureau did not rule out the deployment of armed forces from EU countries or NATO in Moldova to keep the country aligned with anti-Russian sentiment. The bureau emphasized that provocations against Transnistria or Russian peacekeepers could be used as a pretext for deploying troops.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

President accused Brandon Johnson and JB Pritzker of failing to protect Ice officers as troops deploy to Chicago

Donald Trump on Wednesday called for the imprisonment of Brandon Johnson, Chicago's mayor, and JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor, accusing them of failing to protect US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers.

“Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!” Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday morning. “Governor Pritzker also!”

Both Johnson and Pritzker are Democrats.

Trump's remarks come as national guard troops have begun arriving in the Chicago area at the order of the Trump administration, despite objections from Illinois officials, including Pritzker and Johnson.

“This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested” Johnson said on Wednesday in response to Trump's remarks. “I'm not going anywhere.”

Pritzker also responded on social media, saying: “I will not back down. Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?”

As of Wednesday morning, national guard troops from Texas had arrived at Elwood army reserve center, an army training center about 50 miles outside Chicago, as the Trump administration pushes ahead with an aggressive policy toward big-city crime and its mass deportation efforts..

The president has called Chicago a “hellhole” of crime, although police statistics show significant drops in most crimes, including homicides.

On Wednesday, 200 national guard troops from Texas are expected to deploy to the Chicago area, with another 300 Illinois national guard troops preparing to deploy, according to the New York Times, citing a US military official. The official reportedly said the troops were not going to assume law enforcement duties but would protect federal immigration agents and facilities.

Military personnel in uniforms with the Texas national guard patch were reported by the Associated Press at the USarmy reserve center in Elwood. Trucks marked “Emergency Disaster Services” dropped off portable toilets and other supplies. Trailers were set up in rows. Extra fencing was spread across the perimeter.

The Federal Aviation Administration ordered flight restrictions over the army reserve center for security reasons until 6 December.

The Trump administration has ramped up immigration enforcement operations in Chicago in recent weeks, prompting protests, especially outside an immigration center in Broadview, a Chicago suburb..

On Monday, Illinois and Chicago sued the Trump administration, seeking to block the deployment of the national guard to the city, urging a federal judge to stop what they describe as “Trump's long-declared ‘War'” on Chicago and Illinois, calling it “unlawful and dangerous”.

A court hearing on their lawsuit is scheduled for Thursday.

Mayor Johnson also signed an executive order on Monday barring federal immigration agents and others from using city-owned property as staging areas for enforcement operations.

Pritzker  has accused Trump of using troops as “political props” and “pawns”.

At a news conference on Tuesday, Pritzker said that Trump was attempting to “justify and normalize the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command”.

The nearly 150-year-old Posse Comitatus Act limits the military's role in enforcing domestic laws. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active-duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law.

Since starting his second term, Trump has sent or talked about sending troops to at least 10 cities, including Baltimore; Washington DC; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles, arguing that the military presence is needed to combat crime and protect Ice officers.

Data shows that most violent crime around the US has declined in recent years. In Chicago, for example, police data shows that homicides were down 31% to 278 from the start of 2025 to the end of August compared with the same time period last year.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found that most Americans oppose the deployment of troops without an external threat.

 This article was amended on 8 October 2025. An earlier version said that in Chicago homicides were down 31% to 278 through August. In fact, the figures were for 2025 from January to the end of August, compared with the same time period in 2024.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Government department taunts chart-topping artist who sang of scared children and Ice raids on unreleased new song

Zach Bryan, one of the biggest stars in US country music, has been criticised by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over a new song in which he sings about immigration raids by Ice.

The DHS's assistant secretary of public affairs, Tricia McLaughlin, told Bryan to “stick to Pink Skies, dude,” referring to one of his previous hits, in comments reported by the Independent. The DHS also made a provocative post on X, laying another Bryan song, Revival, over footage of Ice officers arresting migrants, with the caption “we're having an All Night Revival”.

Using rhetoric that is characteristic of its public messaging during Donald Trump's second term in office, the department is responding to a snippet of unreleased new song Bryan posted on social media earlier this week, featuring the lyrics: “I heard the cops came, cocky motherfuckers ain't they? / And Ice is gonna come bust down your door / Try to build a house no one builds no more / Well I got a telephone / Kids are all scared and all alone”.

Bryan has elaborated on the song, presumably titled The Fading of the Red White and Blue after he used those words as a caption alongside the song snippet.

“This song is about how much I love this country and everyone in it more than anything,” he wrote on Instagram. “When you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle. Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back … Left wing or right wing we're all one bird and American. To be clear I'm on neither of these radical sides.”

The song also more generally laments discord in American society, as Bryan sings: “The middle fingers rising and it won't stop showing / Got some bad news / The fading of the red white and blue.”

Bryan, 29, was born to parents in the US Navy, and himself served in the Navy for eight years as a younger man, writing and uploading his earliest songs while enlisted. “I am so proud to have served in a country where we can all speak freely and converse amongst each other without getting doxed or accosted on the internet or worse; the violence and heartbreak we've faced in the last few months!” he wrote in another message this week.

Bryan self-released his debut album DeAnn in 2019, and broke through with American Heartbreak in 2022 which reached the US top five. His self-titled follow up reached No 1 in 2023, and his latest album The Great American Bar Scene reached No 2 and is certified platinum. He also topped the US singles chart in 2023 with his Kacey Musgraves duet I Remember Everything.

Earlier this month he broke the record for the highest attendance at a ticketed concert in US history, with 112,408 concertgoers, beating another country star, George Strait, who who drew 110,905 to a 2024 concert. Bryan's huge gig also broke the record for merchandise sales, shifting $5m worth of goods.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP) remains disconnected from the Ukrainian electricity grid and without external power for two weeks, creating an increasingly ""risky"" situation,  experts told the Kyiv Independent.

Russian President Vladimir Putin referenced the crisis at the ZNPP, which is under Russian control, in his Oct. 2 remarks at the Valdai International Discussion Club,  again blaming Ukraine for the outage, despite evidence to the contrary, and threatening retaliatory strikes on Ukrainian nuclear power plants. 

Beyond the escalating rhetoric, experts indicate that the danger at the plant, the largest nuclear power station in Europe, is real. 

Ukraine on Oct. 6 condemned recent attacks near the ZNPP, blaming them on Russia. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said its team heard ""several rounds of incoming and outgoing shelling from near the site.""

Ukraine's state nuclear operator Energoatom warned that the diesel generators powering the plant are designed only for short-term emergency use and are not meant to sustain the plant's operational needs for an extended period. A shutdown of these generators could result in a loss of control over the facility's nuclear safety systems. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky described the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant as ""critical"" on Sept. 30. Diesel generators are now supplying power to the plant, but one has already failed, he said.

Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of civil/environmental engineering, industrial and systems engineering and international relations at the University of Southern California, also confirmed that diesel generators ""are not designed to be run in such a sustained period of time.""


""No nuclear power plant in the world has ever been in the same situation as the ZNPP, and it is impossible to predict anything.""
    

""It's a risky situation because emergency generators are big machines, and they could easily break down. They are reliable, but at the same time, (require) a high-maintenance type of machinery due to their wear and tear,"" Meshkati said.

""I would not be surprised if some of them break down after this length of period of being in operation,"" he added.

Ukraine's Energy Ministry told the Kyiv Independent that the situation is further complicated by Russia's failure to carry out scheduled repairs and maintenance, which increases the risk of diesel generator failure and threatens a shutdown of the nuclear fuel cooling system and failure of critical safety systems. This could lead to a nuclear or radiation accident.

""The potential consequences of the failure of safety systems at the ZNPP will be transboundary and pose a danger not only to Ukraine but also to many European countries,"" a spokesperson said.

""No nuclear power plant in the world has ever been in the same situation as the ZNPP, and it is impossible to predict anything,"" the spokesperson added.

The ZNPP has been under Russian occupation since March 2022. The six reactors were shut down a month after Moscow's occupation, but the facility still requires electricity to maintain cooling and prevent a nuclear incident.

Russian troops reportedly struck a power line on Sept. 23, severing the plant's connection to Ukraine's electrical grid. This marks the 10th and longest blackout at the plant since Russia's full-scale invasion began in 2022.

While Russian state media blame Ukraine for the strike, Greenpeace Ukraine published an investigation on Oct. 1, saying that there is no evidence of any military strikes around the pylons and power line network at the ZNPP. Greenpeace nuclear expert Jan Vande Putte told the Kyiv Independent that Russia can repair the line ""in a matter of hours.""

""But they don't do that. They created the crisis, and they want to manage it as a political strategy. It's a very precise sabotage,"" Vande Putte said.

President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed a similar sentiment, writing in an Oct. 1 social post that ""Russia is deliberately creating the threat of radiation incidents, taking advantage, unfortunately, of the weak position of the IAEA and its director, Rafael Grossi, as well as the distraction of global attention.""

Zelensky's statements came after a Russian attack on an energy facility in the town of Slavutych in Kyiv Oblast, which caused a several-hour blackout at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant on Oct. 1.

While ZNPP ""is not going to blow up tomorrow,"" the situation is serious in a long-term perspective, Vande Putte said.  

""They (Russians) can let the crisis get worse. (...) They can move closer and closer to that point over the coming week, and to have that kind of nuclear blackmail. That's their strategy,"" he added.

Dmytro Orlov, Energodar mayor, who lives in Ukraine-controlled territory, told the Kyiv Independent that at the start of the Russian occupation, the power plant remained fully operational. 

""But they pressured the staff to the point that there was almost no one left to work there,"" he said. ""All the equipment was shut down, is not being repaired, and is deteriorating. And the station has been turned into a military base.""

""The nuclear power plant is no longer used as an energy facility, but is used exclusively for military purposes, and the goal is clear — international pressure. The occupiers are doing this (provocations) to use nuclear blackmail against the whole world,"" Orlov added.

An investigation by the Truth Hounds and Greenpeace Ukraine published on Sept. 24 detailed Rosatom's role in pressuring plant staff,  including torture, ""including beatings, electrocution, sexual violence, mock executions, and threats to family members of detainees."" Rosatom, the Russian nuclear giant, became ZNPP's operator after the occupation.

The report indicated that 78 staff members were unlawfully detained, while six were ""tortured to death.""

Meshkati suggests that Russia's actions at the power plant could be a negotiating tactic.

""Nuclear plants are too important to be used as a bargaining chip or for political horse-trading or power plays. They are really too dangerous. If something goes wrong, everybody, the friend and foe, will be hurt equally,"" Meshkati said.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Oct. 2 that Russia deliberately cut power to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant as it's preparing to reconnect the facility to its own energy system.

Greenpeace Ukraine published a report on Sept. 27 that used satellite imagery and Rosatom's reports indicating  that Russia wants to restart one of the reactors, and reconnect the grid to the occupied territories and eventually to the Kremlin.

Vande Putte also suggests that Russia's motivation is based ""not so much for electricity reasons, but for military and political reasons.""

It's the way for them to say clearly ""this is Russian territory, it's our nuclear power plant,"" Vande Putte said.

In a statement issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), chief Rafael Grossi said that the U.N. agency is ""in constant contact with the two sides with the aim to enable the plant's swift re-connection to the electricity grid.""

The EU has called on Russia to ""immediately cease all military operations around the nuclear plant"" and enable the repairs. In a Sept. 30 statement, the bloc's diplomatic service denounced Russian occupation of the plant as illegal and urged Moscow to withdraw its forces.

The Zaporizhzhia plant has faced repeated safety concerns since Russia's invasion, including power outages, nearby shelling and staffing shortages. A monitoring mission from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been stationed at the ZNPP since September 2022, but Russian authorities have frequently restricted its access.

Traders are asking Indian state refiners to pay for Russian oil with Chinese yuan amid warming ties between New Delhi and Beijing, Reuters reported on Oct. 8, citing undisclosed trade sources.

Indian Oil Corp, the country's leading state-owned refiner, has recently purchased two to three cargoes of Russian oil using Chinese yuan, sources told Reuters.

Russia has been increasingly turning to the yuan for international trade in the wake of Western sanctions imposed over the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Yuan has also been on the rise in oil trade settlements as an alternative to the petrodollar.

Since the outbreak of the all-out war, India has become one of Russia's leading buyers of crude, along with China.

Energy exports account for roughly one-third of Russia's federal revenue and play a crucial role in sustaining the country's wartime economy.

Indian buyers made payments for Russian oil with the Chinese currency in 2023, but ceased due to heightened tensions between India and China at the time.

Recent months have seen a thaw between the two Asian powers, as U.S. President Donald Trump's steep tariffs on India — imposed over Indian purchases of Russian oil — prompted New Delhi to seek alternative economic partnerships.

European arms company Thales has raised concerns over the number of unidentified drones spotted recently over its Belgian facility producing 70 mm rockets, Politico reported on Oct. 8.

The news comes as suspicious drone activity has caused alarm across Europe, with some cases having been linked to Russia.

Alain Quevrin, country director for Thales Belgium, told Politico that the company is ""seeing more drones than what was the case a few months ago"" and highlighted sightings at the Evegnee Fort site in the eastern part of the country.

The company's Belgium-based facilities have been ramping up the production of 70 mm rockets that can be used against drones, supplying both European countries and Ukraine.

Thales facilities could use its jamming equipment to bring down the drones, but the Belgian government must first set the legal procedures for such cases, Quevrin said.

Arms demand is growing in the European market amid Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and fears of a potential clash between NATO and Moscow, exacerbated by recent drone incursions.

In recent weeks, unidentified drones have disrupted airport operations in Germany, Denmark, and Norway.

Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that entered their airspace during an attack on Ukraine in September. Days later, a Russian drone breached Romanian territory, though Bucharest chose not to engage it.

Estonia also reported that three Russian MiG-31 briefly violated its airspace on Sept. 19.

The incidents prompted calls for a more forceful response to such incursions, including downing Russian aircraft and drones if necessary.

According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russian forces launched 183 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight. 

The Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova parliamentary leader, Vlad Batrincea, claimed the elections were marred by ""violations and the use of administrative resources,"" which, he said, ""called into question the fairness of the vote.""

Indian Oil Corp, the country's leading state-owned refiner, has recently purchased two to three cargoes of Russian oil using Chinese yuan, sources told Reuters.

The Bavarian cabinet approved the law, which grants local police the authority to destroy drones if deemed necessary to ensure public safety. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Three scientists who learned how to create materials with microscopic cavities that are ideal for trapping other substances have been awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry. 

On Wednesday, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced that Susumu Kitagawa, 74, of Kyoto University in Japan; Richard Robson, 88, of the University of Melbourne in Australia; and Omar Yaghi, 60, at the University of California, Berkeley in the United States will jointly share the chemistry prize.

They have been recognized for the development of “metal-organic frameworks,” or MOFs, a class of porous solids made of metal ions joined by carbon-based connectors that can act as tiny cages for different species of molecules, such as various gasses.

MOFs are the subject of active investigations for a range of possible uses including hydrogen storage for fuel and absorption and removal of toxic substances from the environment. In the future, they may be harnessed for carbon capture at power plants and other industrial sites.

While describing the science of MOFs during Wednesday's announcement, Olof Ramström, a chemist and member of the committee that awarded this year's prize, compared their storage capacity to Hermione Granger's magical handbag from the Harry Potter series.

“They are small on the outside but very large on the inside,” he said.

He added that only a few grams worth of one version of the material, known as MOF-5 – roughly the size of a sugar cube by volume – has the equivalent surface area of a soccer field.

Another key feature of the materials is their versatility. When they are made, their structures can be precisely tuned to exhibit affinities for different molecules. This has led some researchers to explore the prospect of using MOFs as drug delivery devices that can hold on to medications until they arrive at the correct place in the body so they can be released for optimal effect.

In Australia, Dr. Robson first began working on the materials in 1989 starting with copper ions arranged in diamond-like patterns. The work showed promise but the materials could not be made stable. This was only achieved in the 1990s through the work of Dr. Kitagawa in Japan, and then Dr. Yaghi, who was born in Jordan to a Palestinian refugee family and then moved to the United States to pursue his education.

Speaking with reporters by telephone after the announcement, Dr. Kitagawa said that he was hopeful that the materials he and his co-winners have developed will provide transformational benefits for society. Noting that they have many surprising properties, he added, “this is my fun – to discover new properties” of MOFs.

In 1901, Dutch scientist Jacobus H. van ‘t Hoff became the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, in part for determining how to calculate osmotic pressure in dilute solutions.

In the 124 years since, a total of five researchers who were born or based in Canada have taken home the prize, including Gerhard Herzberg (1971), Henry Taube (1983), John Polanyi (1986), Sidney Altman (1989) and Michael Smith (1993).

Wednesday's announcement marks the third in a series of Nobel prize reveals.

On Monday, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to a trio of researchers in the U.S. and Japan for discoveries related to the human immune system. On Tuesday, three U.S-based scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for discoveries that helped set the stage for the development of quantum computers.

The spotlight now turns to this year's Nobel Prize in Literature and the Nobel Peace Prize, scheduled to be announced on Thursday and Friday respectively. Recipients of this year's economics prize, set to be revealed next Monday, will round out the cohort of 2025 Nobel laureates.

A large-scale rescue operation for hundreds of trapped climbers near Mount Everest has been successfully executed, according to Chinese media. Almost 1,000 hikers and their guides have been rescued.

All of the climbers stranded on Mount Everest due to intense snowstorms this week have been successfully evacuated, according to local media reports.

""580 hikers and over 300 personnel, including local guides and yak herders, have arrived safely in a nearby town,"" reported the Chinese state news agency Xinhua on Tuesday evening.

A further dozen people were reported to have been brought to a secure meeting point on the Tibetan Plateau on the east side of the world's highest mountain, where they have access to supplies.

""Local staff are organizing their return journeys in an orderly manner,"" reported Xinhua.

Heavy snowfall over the weekend caught hundreds of hikers off guard across the Himalayan region, with tents crushed by snow and trails rendered impassable.

Groups of climbers and hikers, including both paying tourists and their local guides, found themselves trapped at altitudes of around 4,900 meters (about 16,075 feet) – over halfway up the world's highest peak, which rises to a total of 8,849 meters.

On Monday, emergency services told Chinese state broadcaster CCTV that one person had died from hypothermia and altitude sickness in the neighboring Chinese province of Qinghai.

The snowstorms struck during China's ""Golden Week,"" a period of eight national holidays in which many people, both locals and tourists, travel to the mountains.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Olympic champion Caster Semenya: 'It's never the end'","https://www.dw.com/en/olympic-champion-caster-semenya-its-never-the-end/a-74263101","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 04:45:03 GMT","

Speaking to DW, the South African runner vows to continue her fight against sex eligibility rules and calls out 'weak leadership' from World Athletics.

Two-time Olympic champion Caster Semenya has played down reports that she is ending her legal challenge against sex eligibility rules in athletics. ""We are forever fighting,"" the South African told DW.

In July, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) handed Semenya a partial victory in her yearslong legal battle, ruling that a Swiss appeals court hadn't examined her case rigorously enough. That ruling leaves open the possibility of further legal action against World Athletics, the sport's global governing body.

Last week, The Associated Press quoted one of Semenya's lawyers, Patrick Bracher, as saying her challenge would ""not be taken further in the circumstances.""

However, in an interview with DW at the Play the Game sports conference in Tampere, Finland, Semenya suggested Bracher had been misquoted.

""It's not about stopping, it's never the end,"" Semenya said. ""They didn't understand what my legal team was saying. It's not the end, it's just the beginning of making sure that we fight the right cause. World Athletics is constantly changing its policies. With the new policies, we are forever fighting. We want to make sure that athletes are protected.""

""[The courts are] not necessarily over,"" Semenya added. ""I'm still yet to decide if we still go on with the courts. I'm still waiting for my legal team to finalize everything.""

Semenya was a gold medalist over 800 meters at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics. She was also born with a difference of sexual development (DSD), a genetic condition that — in her case — means she has XY (male) chromosomes and produces higher levels of the hormone testosterone than most women.

When she was still competing, World Athletics, then known as the IAAF, introduced rules requiring DSD athletes to reduce their testosterone levels, arguing that their condition gave them an unfair advantage in the female category. But Semenya refused to take drugs to suppress her testosterone.

The ECHR's verdict was the latest in a legal battle that has been running since 2018, when Semenya took her case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), claiming the governing body's policy discriminated against her and violated her human rights.

Both CAS and the Swiss appeals court, the Swiss Federal Tribunal, ruled in favor of World Athletics.

""When you're born with your differences, those are your differences and they don't make you a great athlete,"" said Semenya, who is now 34. ""You are a great athlete through training, hard work, showing up every day, dedication. Not because of your given body.""

World Athletics has since modified its DSD regulations, and now requires all female competitors to undergo sex testing, with the organization's president, Sebastian Coe, stating in July: ""We are saying, at elite level, for you to compete in the female category, you have to be biologically female.""

If an athlete is found to have the SRY gene, which is found on the Y chromosome and triggers the development of male characteristics, they will be barred from competing in the female category.

However, sex testing for non-medical reasons is not permitted in some countries, such as France and Norway, which has caused problems with the implementation of the policy.

""Regulations like this are not safe for the sport,"" Semenya said. ""It questions the quality of the leaders that we have now. That's weak leadership because you can't impose rules that you know are not in favor of some of the nationalities, where in their countries, those are illegal.

""If you're going to regulate, you have to regulate fairly for everyone. That's what we need to promote, rather than promoting mediocre. It's got nothing to do with regulation, it's about people imposing power over other people.""

The new World Athletics policy mirrors that of World Boxing, which has also introduced mandatory sex testing for its competitions. That followed a controversy at last year's Paris Olympics, when two female boxers, Imane Khelif of Algeria and Taiwan's Lin Yu-ting, were accused of failing unspecified gender tests in 2022 and 2023.

Khelif is contesting the World Boxing regulations at CAS and Semenya revealed that she had been in contact with the Algerian Olympian.

""We had a conversation, I said to her: 'Look, you have to understand in this world, when something is special, when something is beautiful, people will always criticize,'"" Semenya said. ""As women who have faced a similar situation, you have to be brave, fight for justice and make sure that you just love yourself for who you are.""

Semenya says she urges any athlete to ""fight"" if it benefits them, but is under no illusion about the toll her legal battle has had on her.

""It takes the person out of you, it takes vulnerability out of you,"" Semenya said. ""People will always have an opinion of you. You have to mute your real feelings. You can't show weakness. It costs you the person that you are.""

The newly elected mayor of the western German town of Herdecke was found with multiple stab wounds at her home. Police now say they see no sign of a political motive and presume a family connection in the crime. 

Iris Stalzer, the recently elected mayor of Herdecke in the western German state of  North Rhine-Westphalia, was discovered critically injured in her apartment, authorities said on Tuesday.

The center-left Social Democrat politician had suffered several stab wounds.

""According to the current state of investigations there are no indications of a politically motivated crime,"" police wrote in an update later on Tuesday.

""A family connection is suspected. The crime scene is located inside the house of the politician. Numerous pieces of evidence [showing this] have been secured.""

Police said that Stalzer was found at her own home with life-threatening injuries at 12:40 p.m. local time (1040 GMT/UTC). She was flown to the hospital in a rescue helicopter.

Investigators had secured evidence at the scene while Stalzer received intensive medical treatment. Police had already highlighted a possible family angle.

""A homicide commission has been set up by Hagen Police,"" police said in an earlier statement, referring to a nearby and much larger city. ""Investigations are pursuing every avenue; at this stage, a family connection cannot be ruled out either."" 

A 57-year-old adoptive mother of a son and daughter, aged 15 and 17 respectively, Stalzer is a labor lawyer who has worked for many years in the local politics of the town of some 23,000.

Police said on Tuesday evening that the teens, both minors in the German legal system, remained with investigators. 

According to the Bild newspaper, Stalzer was found seriously injured in her apartment by her son.

The boy, 15, is said to have told the police that his mother had been attacked by several men on the street.

A WDR journalist had reported from the scene that a male teenager was led out of the house in handcuffs by the police and taken away.

The motive for the attack remains unknown. However, according to the news magazine Der Spiegel, there was a case of domestic violence in the Stalzer household earlier this year. 

Stalzer had only recently been elected mayor. In the runoff election on September 28, she won with 52.2% of the vote against center-right Christian Democrat (CDU) candidate Fabian Conrad Haas. The CDU had previously held the mayoral office in Herdecke for a long time. 



Federal Chancellor Friedrich Merz (CDU) has expressed deep shock over the knife attack on Stalzer.

""We have received news of a heinous act from Herdecke. It must now be quickly clarified. We fear for the life of the designated mayor, Iris Stalzer, and hope for her full recovery,"" Merz wrote on the platform X. ""My thoughts are with her family and loved ones.""

SPD parliamentary group leader in Berlin, Matthias Miersch, said he hoped the Social Democrat would ""survive the terrible act."" He could not comment on the background, saying the SPD was deeply concerned.

A vibrant, grassroots, bottom-up movement was behind the victory, offering a template that other states can follow.

Americans are used to struggling for basic necessities while their tax dollars fund wars and prop up big businesses. So when they are offered something as fundamental as child care at no additional cost, the response is often: “What's the catch?” That's how some residents of New Mexico are responding to a first-of-its-kind program in the United States where, starting on November 1, 2025, parents, regardless of their income, will be able to avail themselves of government-funded child care.

While mainstream media outlets are crediting New Mexico's Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham with ushering in universal child care, it's crucial to recognize that a vibrant, grassroots, bottom-up movement began laying the ground work years earlier. Andrea Serrano is a lifelong New Mexican and executive director of OLÉ, which stands for “Organizers in the Land of Enchantment.” She pointed out that “for years New Mexico teetered between 48th, 49th and 50th in the ‘States for child wellbeing.'”

To address such dire circumstances, social justice organizations (including OLÉ) in 2010 first introduced the idea of government-funded child care for all residents. “There is no reason why families should be having to choose between paying the rent or paying their mortgage and paying for child care,” said Serrano.

With the understanding that opposition to such a program would likely be based on its cost, organizers named a clearly identifiable funding source: royalties that oil and gas companies pay to New Mexico for leasing lands.

Instead of casting it as a new program, organizers presented as the extension of an existing program by adopting the term “early childhood education” to describe child care. Voters are used to the idea of publicly funded K-12 school and therefore, extending government funding of pre-K education and care was not much of a stretch. 

“The idea,” according to Serrano, “was to increase the [royalties] payout for education … so that it can cover early childhood education.” The increase is small — only 1.25 percent.

But, guaranteeing child care to all residents required voters to approve the matter as a constitutional amendment. And in order for that to happen, the state legislature first needed to pass a resolution approving such an amendment. “For 10 years, the legislature blocked the constitutional amendment from going before voters,” said Serrano.

That's a decade of people being unable to afford child care for their children, being forced into poverty, or even making the choice to not have children because of the high cost.

So, groups like OLÉ played the long game. They organized to unseat the handful of New Mexico's lawmakers blocking the constitutional amendment for child care funding, and replaced them with people Serrano called “values-aligned” legislators. In other words, they engaged the nuts and bolts of local democracy to achieve their goal.

“In a state like New Mexico that has a mix of ideologies … to get 70 percent of the vote was huge.”

Such an approach was politically savvy. In 2021, New Mexico's legislature finally passed a resolution to put the question of universal child care funding on the ballot and in late 2022, voters were allowed to decide on the matter directly. They voted overwhelmingly to approve it.

“In a state like New Mexico that has a mix of ideologies … to get 70 percent of the vote was huge,” said Serrano.

New Mexico already had a state-level agency to tackle child care, called the Early Childhood Education and Care Department, which covered child care costs for families with incomes up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. In September 2025, Governor Grisham announced this coverage would be expanded to cover all families regardless of their income, fulfilling voters' wishes.

At a time when wealth continues to be redistributed to the top echelons of society, government-funded child care can have a serious impact on families' bottom lines. “We're going to see families saving, on average, about $12,000 a year” in New Mexico, said Serrano. “That is huge.”

Like elder care, child care suffers from multiple intersecting problems of rising costs, constant demand, labor shortages, and low wages. By virtue of being a basic necessity that requires an enormous amount of human labor, child care is often financially unsustainable in a society with stagnant wages and high inflation — unless government steps in to subsidize it.

New Mexico's universal child care program will guarantee higher wages for child care workers to the tune of $18 and $21 an hour.

Further, child care workers are disproportionately women of color and immigrant women, who make poverty-level wages caring for people's children. The average child care worker makes just over $12 an hour. To address this issue, New Mexico's universal child care program will guarantee higher wages for child care workers to the tune of $18 and $21 an hour.

The U.S. birthrate fell to an all-time low this year, and that's not merely because people are uninterested in procreating — which is a valid position. It's also because it is too expensive to have children. New Mexico may offer hope for those who want kids but can't afford to have them.

A Model in the Face of Federal Inaction

An early version of President Joe Biden's signature Build Back Better legislation included $400 billion in national funding for child care and pre-K education, which could have heavily subsidized child care costs for parents across the nation. But thanks to conservative Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia, that provision was stripped out before it went to a vote.

Now, under current President Donald Trump, even long-standing government-funded programs such as Medicaid are under attack, with no chance of public funding for new programs such as early education and universal child care.

In the absence of federal action, left-leaning candidates such as New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani are running for office on platforms of delivering universal child care.

While most municipalities don't have access to a special fossil-fuel-funded pot of money as New Mexico does — nor would it be prudent to rely for the long term on a product that jeopardizes children's future — there are plenty of other ways to fund universal child care. “There's always money to be found when there's the will to do it,” said Serrano. Mamdani's campaign, for example, seeks to increase taxes on corporations and his city's wealthiest residents to pay for child care.

“There's always money to be found when there's the will to do it.”

Like New Mexico's efforts, the battle for universal child care in New York City began at the grassroots. “There are so many New Yorkers, especially those in my generation now, who are looking to start families here, raise their children here and want to be able to afford to do so,” said Jagpreet Singh, political director for DRUM Beats, an offshoot of the South Asian community organization Desis Rising Up and Moving (DRUM). Singh's group endorsed Mamdani for mayor early on, and rallied support among South Asian residents of New York City — a group that has traditionally had low voter turnout.

“By the time the Cuomos and Adamses came to them, it was already too late,” said Singh. “We had already built up the name of Zohran, talked a lot about the policies like the rent freeze campaign or universal child care, which really bolstered the working-class community to support him and locked down the support within our community.”

Mamdani handily beat former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary in June. Singh is not worried that the November election, which will see a rematch between the two candidates, will turn out any differently. “[Mamdani] doesn't have to change his tune” on the issue of universal child care even when facing the general electorate, he said.

Serrano feels strongly that the long and hard work of mobilizing voters around such popular issues bears fruit. “It might sound to some people that it isn't possible,” she said. “And it is, it absolutely is. It takes years and there's a tenacity that has to come with it as well. But it also is about: How are you creating the issue environment and how are you electing the folks who are going to make it happen?”

Publicly funded government programs for basic necessities are popular — and it's no wonder. Taxpayers pool their money to pay for the common good. And what could fit such a definition better than the care of our children?

Conversion therapy is a discredited anti-LBGTQ practice that many health experts say is akin to torture.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on Tuesday in a case that aims to undo several states' bans on “conversion therapy” for youth, a dangerous pseudoscientific practice that purports to “convert” gay people to heterosexuality or make transgender people become cisgender. 

The case, Chiles v. Salazar, centers upon Kaley Chiles, a licensed counselor in Colorado who sometimes incorporates her Christian beliefs in her methods. She is represented by lawyers from Alliance Defending Freedom, a far right organization that frequently targets its legal efforts against LGBTQ people and that has been recognized by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) as a hate group.

Chiles's primary ADF lawyer, James Campbell, argued to the court that Colorado's ban on conversion therapy places an unlawful restriction on her ability to discuss methods her clients may want to pursue with regard to their identities, adding that her speech rights shouldn't be restricted “where there is debated science.” Although there are a plethora of studies showcasing how conversion therapy harms LGBTQ people, particularly those under the age of 18, Chiles claims her version of the practice, which she calls “talk therapy,” is different, and therefore should be permissible. 

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

Colorado Solicitor General Shannon Stevenson disagreed, noting that there have been zero studies suggesting Chiles's methods would fare any better.

“People have been trying to do conversion therapy for a hundred years with no record of success,” Stevenson said in oral arguments. “There is no study, despite the fact that people tried to advance this practice, that has ever shown that it has any chance of being efficacious.”

Still, the court's conservative majority appeared willing to accept Chiles's arguments, indicating that, at the end of this term, the justices may rule that bans on conversion therapy, which have been enacted in a total of 23 states, are unconstitutional. 

Chief Justice John Roberts suggested he felt that therapists shouldn't be restricted from talking about conversion therapy. “Just because they are engaged in conduct doesn't mean their words aren't protected,” he said at one point.

Justice Samuel Alito described conversion therapy bans as “blatant viewpoint discrimination” because such bans limit speech from therapists questioning the gender identity or sexuality of minors.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, however, one of the court's three liberal justices, was skeptical of the idea that limiting therapy options was a violation of Chiles's First Amendment rights.

“I understand if Ms. Chiles here were writing an article about conversion therapy or writing or giving a speech about it” that such restrictions may be improper, Jackson said. “I'm just trying to understand how the First Amendment protects that doctor from providing therapy that is outside the standard of care.”

Jackson also pointed out the court's hypocrisy, noting that conservatives of the court who are open to overturning bans on conversion therapy voted to uphold bans on gender-affirming care in other states earlier this year.

“I'm wondering why this regulation at issue here isn't really just the functional equivalent of Skrmetti,” Jackson said, referring to that previous case. “It just seems odd to me that we might have a different result here.”

With liberals in the minority — and Justice Elena Kagan appearing to show some sympathies toward Chiles's and the ADF's arguments — it is likely that the Supreme Court will overturn Colorado's conversion therapy ban, and potentially overturn similar bans in 22 other states. 

Conversion therapy has been widely discredited by scientific studies and is viewed by many health professionals as being tantamount to torture. One such study from 2020 found that LGBTQ people exposed to conversion therapy were twice as likely to have future episodes of suicide ideation than were those who had never experienced it. The United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has also denounced the practice, calling for it to be banned on a global scale. 

Several observers have called for Supreme Court justices to ignore discredited arguments in defense of conversion therapy and to uphold Colorado's statewide ban.

“Conversion ‘therapy' is a discredited and deceptive practice that hurts patients and families,” Rep. Mark Takano (D-California), chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus, said in a statement just before the court's Tuesday hearing convened. “Almost half of states have taken steps to protect young LGBTQI+ people from these cruel practices, which I hope the Supreme Court will rightly recognize as a just and constitutional use of their powers.”

“So-called ‘conversion therapy' is not therapy. It's a discredited pseudoscience rooted in shame, rejection and fear…The Supreme Court must uphold the constitutionality of these legal restrictions,” said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson. 

Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, also urged the Court to uphold the ban, stating:

It is unimaginable to see fringe practices that have been debunked, discredited, and known to cause harm for decades now being debated before our country's highest court. While many people believe these practices are a relic of the past, they are sadly still harming young Americans in communities all across the U.S. today. I strongly urge the justices to uphold Colorado's law, which was based on decades of evidence and medical consensus, and continue to allow more than 20 states across the country to protect children from these dangerous practices.

Conversion therapy “is a sick form of abuse that has harmed LGBTQ+ Americans for decades,” Tyler Hack, executive director of The Christopher Street Project, said in a press release. “Colorado and the 20+ states that have banned conversion therapy are following recommendations from experts and scientists.”

Hack also denounced the ADF for its inclusion in the case, noting that it has been designated a hate group by the SPLC.

“ADF and MAGA are one in the same — they are attempting to legislate trans and queer people out of existence, and now they are using Trump's SCOTUS to peddle an agenda rooted in pseudoscience, extremism, and hate,” Hack added.

 What the Kremlin Is Learning From the War in Ukraine

 Dara Massicot



The story of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been one of upset expectations and wild swings in performance. At the start of the war, most of NATO saw Russia as an unstoppable behemoth, poised to quickly defeat Ukraine. Instead, Russia's forces were halted in their tracks and pushed back. Then, outside observers decided the Russian military was rotten, perhaps one counterattack away from collapse. That also proved incorrect—Ukrainian offensives failed, and Moscow resumed its slow advance. Now, plenty of people look beyond Russia to understand the state of the battlefield, blaming Kyiv's troubles on insufficient external backing instead.

What many policymakers and strategists have missed is the extent to which Moscow has learned from its failures and adapted its strategy and approach to war, in Ukraine and beyond. Beginning in 2022, Russia launched a systematic effort to examine its combat experience, draw lessons from it, and share those lessons across its armed forces. By early 2023, Moscow had quietly constructed a complex ecosystem of learning that includes the defense manufacturing base, universities, and soldiers up and down the chain of command. Today, the military is institutionalizing its knowledge, realigning its defense manufacturers and research organizations to support wartime needs, and pairing tech startups with state resources.

The result has been new tactics on the battlefield—codified in training programs and combat manuals—and better weapons. Moscow has developed fresh ways of using drones to find and kill Ukrainian soldiers and to destroy Ukrainian assets, turning what was once an area of weakness into an area of strength. It has built better missiles and created more rugged and capable armored systems. It is giving junior commanders more freedom to plan. It has become a military that is capable of both evolving during this war and readying itself for future, high-tech conflicts.

Because of these changes, Ukraine is likely to face even greater destruction in the months ahead. It will have to contend with faster and more numerous Russian drone attacks, resulting in more harm to cities, civilians, and critical infrastructure. Larger numbers of missiles will get through Ukraine's defenses. The ten miles leading up to the frontlines, already very hazardous, will become even more dangerous and difficult to cross. These changes may not produce any dramatic breakthroughs for Russia, thanks to Ukraine's defenses and extensive drone and artillery attacks. But they do mean Moscow can keep trading its soldiers' lives for slow gains in the Donbas while hoping that NATO tires of the conflict.

Some American and European officials are, indeed, losing interest in Ukraine. But the same Russian adaptations that threaten Ukraine should be of concern to policymakers elsewhere. The Russian military will emerge from its invasion with extensive experience and a distinct vision of the future of combat, and it is sharing its experience with China, Iran, and North Korea. It has laid the groundwork for a more intense period of learning and reconstitution after the war ends. Russia will remain constrained by bad discipline and will struggle to produce the most sophisticated equipment. But it will be as ready for the new way of war as any other state, constraints on its resources notwithstanding. If they do not want to fall behind, Washington and European capitals must therefore start learning from the war in Ukraine, not turning away. Rather than dismiss it, they need to study Russia's studying—and then start making their own changes.

The Russian military has been forced to adapt to its circumstances since the early days of its invasion. To survive fierce Ukrainian counterattacks, Russian units grafted protective armor onto vehicles, learned new styles of camouflage, and adopted small-unit assault tactics, among many other adaptations. Russian soldiers also shared advice informally through social networks, closed social media channels, and self-published advice manuals. This type of informal, person-to-person or unit-to-unit learning is an important first stage of wartime adaptation. But unless the larger military organization captures these lessons, they are often lost over time, not passed to those who need them, and not spread across the force.

The second stage of learning includes institutionalizing those changes, such as by revising training programs, procurement plans, and operational concepts. After that, militaries must engage in predictive learning about the future of warfare and recognize the need for reforms or transformational change. The militaries that learn best follow five steps: acquire combat experience, analyze it, propose recommendations, disseminate the recommendations and lessons throughout the force, and, finally, implement them.

As it became clear that the war would drag on, Russia started fulfilling most of these criteria. What began as ad hoc battlefield adaptation evolved into a systematic effort to take its battlefield experience, study it, and share it across the military to improve performance. In 2022, for example, the military ordered dedicated staff officers and researchers to frontline military command posts so they could observe the war as closely as possible and seek to understand troop performance. The researchers then reviewed the results of battles, combed through commander logs, and interviewed personnel to generate analytic reports. After additional evaluation, these “lessons learned” reports (as military experts call them) were shared with the wartime headquarters in Rostov, the general staff in Moscow, service branch headquarters, military academies, defense firms, and the military research community.



The armed forces then adjusted in accordance. Aided by Moscow's September 2022 mobilization order and a surging defense budget, the Russian military reorganized its command structure and modified its tactics and force posture in Ukraine. Moscow changed its logistics system to make it more survivable. It introduced new technologies or new ways of using old technology to improve both its precision targeting and its electronic warfare capabilities. These interim adaptations helped Russia stabilize its frontlines and withstand Ukraine's 2023 counteroffensive. 

Since then, Russia's learning ecosystem has become even more extensive. In Moscow, the Russian military has over 20 commissions devoted to implementing recommendations based on information it receives from the frontlines and from Russian researchers. The military has been busy disseminating lessons learned to the force by summarizing them in bulletins, holding themed workshops, and hosting conferences to troubleshoot problems and share knowledge. Russia's Southern Military District repeatedly gathers soldiers and commanders from the air force, ground forces, electronic warfare forces, and the defense industry to teach them how to better detect, suppress, and destroy the enemy's uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which were essential to Ukraine's early military success. At a 2023 conference hosted by Russia's artillery academy, soldiers and experts came together to revise artillery tactics and integrate drones into artillery strikes. In just three years, Russia has made over 450 interim modifications to combat manuals. Military leaders emphasize that these handbooks are likely to be completely overhauled after the war ends.

During the invasion's first year, Ukraine received some help from an unexpected source: Russia's own military equipment. For seemingly months on end, Russia's gear repeatedly malfunctioned because of sloppy maintenance, manufacturing defects, and design flaws. Consider Moscow's electronic warfare equipment: a snap inspection of hundreds of Russian electronic warfare systems found defects in 30 percent of them. The most common flaw was the poor quality of electronic subcomponents, specifically circuits. According to the Russian military's flagship publication, Military Thought, a whopping 60 to 70 percent of Russia's electronic warfare failures from 2022 to 2024 were caused by equipment malfunctions of various types. Only 30 to 40 percent of failures were caused by Ukrainian military fire.

At times, Russia has struggled to fix its equipment problems. During the first year of the war, the defense industry's slow responsiveness, disconnection from soldiers, and outdated regulations impeded innovation efforts. But eventually, the country's defense manufacturers were instructed to improve production, increase the repair rate, and generally speed innovation. And thanks to government support, they did. The Ministry of Defense relaxed regulations to shorten research and development timelines. It held meetings with the defense manufacturing base to ensure it received and digested feedback from frontline units and made changes. Defense companies, meanwhile, sent industry specialists into occupied Ukraine to fix equipment, study its performance, and report back, just as they did in Syria when Russia was defending Bashar al-Assad's regime. And starting in early 2023, the Kremlin created programs to integrate civilian universities and research centers into national defense efforts. It improved military and civilian engineer collaboration at test sites and training ranges to test prototypes before sending them into combat.

The Russian government also launched initiatives to help the country's defense startups in the hope of promoting innovation. Russian Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, for instance, worked to connect startups with the state-owned companies that dominate the sector and are resistant to newcomers. It worked: now, startups have taken their place alongside Russia's largest defense contractors in arms shows and sell their products to the military. These changes have allowed Russia to start closing the technological edge that Kyiv enjoyed in the war's early years. Russian manufacturers are producing new and modified systems better suited for conditions in Ukraine. The Russian military, in turn, has learned how to use them. Perhaps most famously, the Ministry of Defense set up Rubikon, the country's elite drone research and operations unit, which experiments with different types of tactics that now inform how other UAV units are instructed.

Moscow has made less flashy but equally essential improvements, as well. Defense companies have upgraded armor and other defenses on many classes of vehicles and equipped others with stronger engines, better vision scopes, and improved jamming systems. The country has increased the lethality of its glide bombs and increased production of modified Shahed drones and a variety of other types of UAVs. And the defense sector is addressing manufacturing defects and improving maintenance protocols for Russian electronic warfare systems.

These upgrades help explain why Ukrainians have encountered more trouble in the last year and a half. In 2022 and 2023, Kyiv could target Russian command centers, stockpiles, and supply lines with relative ease; today, Russia's electronic countermeasures and adjusted missile defenses make such attacks more difficult. Russian drone and missile strikes are also becoming larger and more complex. At a minimum, this means Ukraine's partners will need to supply it with more air defenses and invest more in the country's electronic warfare systems. Ukraine is also developing a long-range missile, as it looks to destroy Russian weapons at their source.

Russian learning extends to another important domain: training. The country's military instructors are thoroughly reviewing combat experiences and integrating the lessons they learned into training programs. To make sure these programs are both relevant and realistic, Russia rotates troops between the battlefield and training ranges, much as it has sent defense manufacturers to the front. When in-person visits are not possible, the military sets up secure videoconferences between frontline units, academies, and training centers. Some disabled veterans have become full-time instructors.

Russia has made several teaching changes as a result of its combat experience in Ukraine. It has made its simulators more realistic and has modified its instruction of tactical first aid. It has started teaching troops how to drive military vehicles through a complicated drone battlefield, as well as how to carry out a small assault within a larger drone and armored assault—both critical tasks in a war where the frontlines are under constant surveillance by Kyiv. (Given that Ukraine can see most of what Russia is doing on the battlefield, small, discrete assault teams are needed to overwhelm Kyiv's defensive positions.) For the first time, Russian instructors are using drones to monitor soldiers' training so they can better evaluate and discuss the units' successes and failures afterward.

Russia has also made several changes to its training course for junior officers to better prepare them for operational tasks. These changes do not constitute a total overhaul; Moscow's main wartime adjustment is adding a two-month supplemental training session to help lieutenants improve their skills in marksmanship and artillery, reconnaissance, topography, navigation, drone use, and tactical medicine. Instructors are also focusing on teaching junior officers how to command small units, given the importance of small infantry assaults on the battlefield. Some junior officers are even being taught what NATO states call mission planning, in which they are given an objective that they and their staffs must figure out how to achieve on their own rather than following centralized commands. This is a major shift for the traditionally top-down Russian military, one inspired by the successes some Russian units have scored against Kyiv.

Yet despite the attention senior leaders have given to fixing them, Russia's training programs remain uneven. Instruction for Ukrainian-bound volunteers is now rightfully focused on teaching soldiers to fight in small assault teams on drone-saturated battlefields. But the training remains too short, so troops are still arriving ill-suited for their combat tasks. Although the instructional program for fresh conscripts has also been modified since 2022 to reflect combat experience, it has yet to be fully overhauled. Some district training centers are still teaching outdated information or otherwise not keeping pace with rapid battlefield adaptation, Russian officials report. The military has resorted to snap inspections to ensure that new training directives are being adopted.

Russian training may remain a work in progress, and fierce Ukrainian resistance continues to prevent the Kremlin from achieving its main objectives. Yet Moscow's changes are undoubtedly disheartening for Ukrainians. Since the war began, Kyiv has held its own against Moscow in large part because of its innovation advantage, which is now eroding. The Ukrainians have long acknowledged they cannot defeat the Russian military on numbers alone.

But fortunately for Kyiv, Russia can do only so much to match Ukraine's qualitative edge. For starters, the Russian military's learning process has a critical flaw—one that explains the divide between the vibrant learning underway among the headquarters staff, researchers, and some defense firms back home and the bleak experience of frontline soldiers. Although the Russian military shows strength in acquiring, analyzing, and disseminating combat experience, it has struggled to implement its recommendations—and, relatedly, to ensure that its guidance is being followed. Officials have recommended, for example, that the country's quality control system be overhauled in response to the many breakdowns and errors, but the country has yet to do so. Similarly, the study of combat medicine and combat traumatology in Russia has advanced considerably since 2022. Yet the number of frontline soldiers contracting HIV infections is surging, at least in part because field hospitals reuse syringes and have poor sanitation practices during mass casualty events.

Then there are the areas in which Moscow is still struggling to learn at all—such as discipline and professionalism, long-neglected areas of combat power. As a result, the quality of Russia's frontline personnel is still wildly variable. Some units have competent commanders, but others have leaders who are abusive or absent. Neighboring units fail to coordinate, which results in excess casualties during rotations or maneuvers. Units struggle to cohere when they are regenerated (as they often are; Russia's military continues to suffer enormous losses). Some personnel experience violence and neglect in their own units. Others may receive draconian punishments for infractions, such as being tied to trees or left in open-air pits.



Although they have not prevented combat forces from conducting most of their assigned tasks, these problems are certainly part of the reason Russia continues to underperform relative to its material and manpower advantages. Russian military psychologists have sounded the alarm, arguing that their country's current efforts to assess soldiers' psychological states and identify triggers of so-called deviant behavior (desertion, surrender, violence, or loss of combat effectiveness) are outdated. But the military apparatus itself has not internalized this message, choosing instead to focus on endurance and the execution of orders by any means necessary.

At least for now, challenges related to the nature of the war itself are also exceedingly difficult to resolve, even after they have been identified. The Russian command, for instance, is well aware that the Ukrainian battlefield is extensively monitored by drones and that it is thus nearly impossible to mass large numbers of forces for an armored assault without coming under attack. In military journals, strategists bluntly admit that Russia's traditional formations have ceased “to serve as the main condition for achieving success.” The military has adapted by moving away from using large armored formations, increasingly embracing the small assault teams that are now central to military training. Russian officials have also added new drone units, assault detachments, and reconnaissance detachments to help overcome prepared Ukrainian defenses. Although these changes complicate Ukrainian countermeasures and occasionally lead to tactical Russian breakthroughs, they come with extremely high casualties, and these small units and detachments cannot seize and hold territory in the way that a large, massed force can. Nonetheless, the Kremlin demands that the war grind on in this manner.

Finally, Moscow's track record on postwar learning is not particularly inspiring. After the Soviet war in Afghanistan and the Russian war to help the Assad regime, the country's military failed to learn or forgot its combat experience because acquired knowledge was not disseminated beyond the small groups that fought. The Russian armed forces also failed to implement critical lessons in the 1990s and early 2000s, when financial and leadership support for postwar reforms collapsed.



Yet none of these factors are present in the Russia of today. In fact, many of the learning processes now underway resemble those Moscow underwent after World War II. Given its current architecture, finances, and leadership, the Russian military appears poised for a comprehensive and intense learning period after the war in Ukraine ends. Officials are already discussing an extensive review of Russian operational concepts, military theory and strategy, combat regulations, and long-term procurement choices from now until the mid-2030s. Russian officials have stated that overcoming threats to large-scale armored assaults is a top research priority and that they are planning to alter the military's force design and operational concepts to account for this challenge. From now on, the Russian military will likely create more UAVs and other uncrewed systems, which will supplement Moscow's military power relative to NATO.

Russian leaders will further integrate UAVs, robots, and other autonomous systems across the force. In the military's view, these technologies are the future of combat: Russian military experts have written that uncrewed systems will become the most important weapons of the twenty-first century. The world they envision will soon have swarms of autonomous drones that can overwhelm adversaries' defenses, microdrones that are difficult to identify or stop, and drones that mimic birds, bugs, or other wildlife. The Russian military has been observing the Ukrainian military's use of combat robots and is preparing to invest more in this area to help with tasks such as sentry duty, logistics, mining and demining, and undersea surveillance.

Russian military theorists and leaders also see artificial intelligence as essential to modern combat. The speed at which the technology can process growing amounts of digital information will allow commanders to make faster decisions. Moscow's strategists fear that if Russian commanders do not have top-notch AI tools, they will be overwhelmed by adversaries that possess them. As a result, Russian experts are considering how to field AI decision-making systems and AI-enabled weapons by the early 2030s. The military is exploring how to use artificial intelligence in hypersonic missiles, air defense systems, and drones to improve performance. It is also thinking through how AI could speed the execution of analytic tasks and automate commands. Although this area is a national priority, investment in AI remains relatively modest, limiting Russia's capabilities in the near term.

At the start of the invasion in 2022, the Russian military misjudged Ukraine's capabilities and will to fight. Moscow's equipment was not always up to the task, and some systems failed outright. Its soldiers were not trained for their assigned missions (or even told that they would be going to war, for that matter). Its command chain struggled to function.

But observers of the Russian military can no longer anchor its views to that period. In the years since, it has become a learning organization, and ongoing adaptations on the frontlines are only a piece of its educational activity. Moscow is acquiring and analyzing combat experience and disseminating the lessons it has learned throughout its force and defense ecosystem. It is systemically trying to capture and institutionalize its wartime experience and prepare for a postwar reform period. It realizes that the future character of warfare is changing, so the military must change, as well.

Russian leaders will face obstacles to their ambitions even after this conflict ends. International sanctions, for instance, will be a major impediment to their progress (provided those sanctions last). The Russian military's ability to improve, after all, will depend on sustained financing, access to critical minerals, and the ability to produce top-of-the-line equipment—all things that sanctions make difficult. The Russian military will also require leadership support and the input of enough experienced veterans for planned reforms to take effect. And no matter what happens, Russia will be constrained by its traditional personnel weaknesses—poor discipline, for example—and an expensive procurement program that will sap its resources.

Moscow also worries that the United States and Europe will study its war and develop countermeasures to Russia's newest capabilities and tactics. NATO must prove these fears to be justified. To match Russian capabilities and catch up in key areas like drone warfare, the United States and Europe must accelerate their analysis of the invasion of Ukraine and then adapt, including through the procurement of more UAVs and by adopting other innovations. Although several organizations in NATO countries are devoted to gathering lessons from the war, progress is uneven and siloed. These bodies' efforts have not yet comprehensively altered their countries' procurement plans, training regimens, or operational concepts.

To avoid falling behind, the United States and Europe need to start paying better attention—especially since Moscow is passing its knowledge along to its autocratic partners. But that means they must see the Russian military for what it is: flawed, but resilient in its own way. Its structural problems are very real and would be particularly acute in the event of a conflict with NATO. Yet its learning process is relentless. The Russian armed forces will further modify tactics, introduce new weapons, and expand as they begin a decadelong reconstitution effort. Experts are fond of saying that armies shape war. But war shapes armies, as well.

Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts.

James Curran is Professor of Modern History at Sydney University. From 2023 to 2025, he was International Editor of the Australian Financial Review, where he remains a columnist. He was previously an Intelligence Analyst at Australia's Office of National Assessments (now the Office of National Intelligence).

 Unmet Expectations Could Fracture the U.S.-Australian Alliance

 James Curran

Australia, like many U.S. allies, is struggling to deal with President Donald Trump. At issue is the country's national security. Although China is by far Australia's most important trade partner, it is also the country that Australia's national security establishment perceives as its greatest threat. Australia's fear of China is more than a century old and runs deep through every defense strategy that Australia has developed since the signing of the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS) in 1951 and the resolution of its postwar relationship with Japan later that decade. The same fear drives Australia to keep the United States close today, even as tensions rise over the Trump administration's economic and defense policies.

The glue now holding Australia and the United States together is AUKUS, a security arrangement that also includes the United Kingdom, formed in 2021. Parts of the agreement—including cooperation in quantum computing; artificial intelligence; cyber-, hypersonic, and undersea technology; and more—are moving ahead more or less as planned. But a key component of AUKUS could be in serious trouble. Australia is supposed to begin receiving a small fleet of nuclear-powered submarines from the United States in 2032, and then the three countries are supposed to jointly design and produce a new class of submarine. Practical and strategic concerns, however, have put the submarine purchase and the design project in jeopardy; in June, the Pentagon commissioned a review to determine whether the entire AUKUS arrangement is in line with Trump's “America first” agenda. Its findings are expected later this October, coinciding with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to Washington for his first substantive meeting with Trump.

At stake is more than the fate of a handful of submarines. AUKUS has become emblematic of the U.S.-Australian alliance as a whole, and it is now at risk of being weighed down by unfulfilled expectations on both sides. Whereas Australia wants constant reassurance from the U.S. administration that the agreement is moving ahead as planned, the United States wants firm pledges that any submarines it transfers to Australia will participate in a potential conflict with China. Neither country may be able to offer the other the confidence it seeks. Even if they choose to honor their original agreement, the uncertainty about the future of AUKUS has revealed a larger discrepancy between U.S. and Australian security strategies that the two allies will have to contend with in the years ahead.

At its core, the AUKUS agreement is about nuclear-powered submarines. Although successive Australian governments have been reluctant to spell out publicly the strategic rationale for their acquisition, it is undoubtedly to enable Australia to assist the United States in any military contingency involving China in the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait. Australia's current fleet of six diesel-powered submarines is aging and needs to be replaced soon; nuclear-powered submarines are faster and can conduct operations of longer duration. As part of the AUKUS deal, the United States committed to transfer three to five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia by 2032, as long as Washington determines that their sale does not degrade U.S. undersea capabilities and that it remains in the American national interest. Australia has already contributed close to $2 billion to the U.S. submarine industrial production line to help speed construction. In addition, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States agreed to jointly design a new class of submarine, the SSN-AUKUS. For reasons never adequately explained, this vessel will be more than 25 percent larger in size than the Virginia-class submarine and will require more crew. The first is to be built in the United Kingdom, with subsequent production moving to Australia.

Since its announcement in September 2021, AUKUS has taken on a larger meaning than a mere submarine deal. It has become the prism through which Australians think and talk about the relationship with the United States. As Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said in late 2023, when the U.S. Congress authorized key provisions of the agreement, AUKUS “will transform our ability to effectively deter, innovate, and operate together.” The agreement was a public relations coup when it was first signed, showcasing strong American support at a time of deep tension between Australia and China. In 2020, Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government had openly challenged Beijing's “wolf warrior” diplomacy and called for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19. In response, China slapped sweeping trade restrictions on Australia. Unbowed, Australia styled itself as the “tip of the spear” as it condemned China's assertive behavior in Asia and pushed back against Beijing's economic coercion.

After coming into office in May 2022, Albanese dramatically improved Australia's relations with China, abandoning his predecessor's megaphone diplomacy and emphasizing stability and, more recently, “constructive engagement” with Beijing. Yet he has still plowed ahead with AUKUS, worried that any sign of slipping support for the deal will be interpreted by political opponents as weakness on national security and a sign that his Labor Party cannot manage the U.S. alliance. His government's endorsement can often seem tepid, however. Albanese himself tends to talk more about the local employment opportunities of AUKUS than about the strategic benefits, and Foreign Minister Penny Wong barely mentions the deal in public and is known to oppose it in private.

Washington, meanwhile, typically sees Australia's close economic relations with China as reason to doubt its commitment to the alliance with the United States. This is particularly the case under Labor governments, as the party has a long history of opposing U.S. security policies, from the installation of American intelligence facilities in Australia in the early 1960s to the invasion of Iraq in 2003. In June 2022, a few months into its term, the Albanese government sought to assuage Washington's concern by secretly dispatching a special envoy to the White House to reassure the Biden administration of Australia's steadfastness. It worked. President Joe Biden's Asia policy chief, Kurt Campbell, told European officials privately in late 2022 that AUKUS had been about “getting Australia off the fence.” With the deal signed, he said, “we have them locked in now for the next 40 years.” But officials in the Trump administration are not so convinced, interpreting Albanese's attempts to patch up relations with China as disregard for the security challenges that Beijing poses.

Consistent with its approach to other allies in Asia and Europe, the Trump administration is now pushing Australia, in public and in private, to do more. U.S. officials want Canberra to increase its defense spending—speaking in Singapore earlier this year, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called for Australia to raise spending from around 2.0 percent to 3.5 percent of GDP—and to openly commit its forces to help defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.

At the same time that Washington increases its demands from Canberra, Australian officials have been informed that the United States may ultimately renege on the promises it made to its ally in the AUKUS deal. The sticking point is whether the U.S. industrial base can produce nuclear-powered submarines quickly enough to transfer some to Australia. Currently, the United States produces a new submarine every ten months; it needs to produce one every five to six months to keep its own fleet intact while also selling vessels to Australia. U.S. law does not require the president to approve the transfer of Virginia-class submarines to Canberra until the end of 2031, well after the end of Trump's term. But Washington may act much sooner. Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby, who is leading the Pentagon's AUKUS review, has been openly skeptical of the agreement because of the critical role that submarines play in the United States' own military plans in Asia. Speaking at the British think tank Policy Exchange last year, he asked, “Why are we giving away this crown jewel asset when we most need it?”

Concerns are also mounting in Australia. Canberra worries about the United States' reliability as a security partner, fearing that Australia may be left with no submarine capability at all if AUKUS fails. Prominent critics of the agreement, including former Prime Ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Turnbull, along with various former submarine commanders and experts, have also raised practical concerns, including questions about Australian industry's capacity to assume responsibility for building a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines by the early 2040s and, in the meantime, about whether a naval port under construction in Western Australia will be ready to host British and American nuclear-powered submarines when they are due to arrive on a military rotation in 2027. And according to recent opinion polling, public approval for AUKUS is wobbly: a Lowy Institute survey this year found that only around half of Australians think the deal will make Australia safer, and a Guardian Essential poll revealed that 60 percent of Australians think it unlikely that United States will ever deliver Virginia-class submarines.

Australia is increasingly uneasy about the cost of the deal, too, which is expected to be around $240 billion (and probably more) over the life of the agreement, through the late 2040s. Already, AUKUS is cannibalizing the budgets of Australia's conventional forces as the government prioritizes funding for submarine production in the United States and the United Kingdom. So far, Albanese has been adamant that his government will raise Australian defense spending only to roughly 2.3 percent of GDP by 2032, an increase of less than half a percentage point, which will not be nearly enough to cover the additional expense of AUKUS. For at least the next several years, therefore, the Australian military could be unprepared to respond to any potential conflict. Indeed, it could do little more than what is has traditionally done: send a small deployment to operate alongside U.S. forces.

The Trump administration could well choose to keep AUKUS intact for now, leaving the decision about selling the Virginia-class submarines to the next president. It could determine that Australia has paid into the U.S. industrial base sufficiently and that the benefits of access to joint intelligence and military facilities across Australia are valuable enough to allow the deal to proceed. Washington could conceivably prefer to lose a few submarines—sending them to Australia rather than reserving them for American use in a fight with China over Taiwan, for instance—rather than upset Canberra, which the United States needs on board if it is to use Australia as a base for U.S. force projection in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea.

Preserving the terms of AUKUS, however, would not resolve Australia's problems. The submarines may not arrive by 2032, a failure that would cast an ominous cloud over U.S.-Australian relations, feeding doubts about whether the Trump administration and its successors remain committed to keeping a firm military footprint in Asia. And even a prompt delivery of the vessels in the early 2030s would likely come with conditions that some of the submarines remain under U.S. command, since the United States will want to be able to use those vessels in the event of a conflict over Taiwan. Canberra would, in effect, be paying an eye-watering cost to provide auxiliary forces for the U.S. Navy, not gaining sovereign defense capabilities that it can command as it wishes. Such an outcome would make AUKUS seem like an immense strategic blunder: Australia would have spent years backing (and funding) the United States without receiving what it expected from the deal.

If Washington instead concludes that the enormous challenges it faces in expanding its own submarine fleet prevent it from honoring the promised transfer to Australia, the consequences could be just as dire. Australia's faith in the United States' reliability as an ally, already rocked by Trump, would be shaken even more, and the tremors would be felt in Manila, Seoul, Taipei, and Tokyo, too. Other forms of military cooperation with the United States may continue, including rotations of U.S. and British submarines at the base in Western Australia (assuming it is completed more or less on schedule), but the dark shadow cast over the relationship may lead to resentment toward the growing U.S. military presence in the country, which includes the stationing of B-52 bombers in northern Australia. And after wasting billions of dollars, Canberra could end up with shattered hopes of a defense industrial boom from production of a new class of submarines and no domestic submarine capability at all. Australia's existing fleet of submarines is aging and requires costly, time-consuming refits to extend its service; only one of six vessels is currently operational. Replacing them will be no easier. Submarine suppliers are few, and Canberra has already burned its bridges with one of them—the French firm that Australia publicly dumped before AUKUS was announced. The possibility of Australia's invasion by a hostile power remains remote, of course. But with no genuine submarine capability, long-standing national anxieties about the country's geopolitical vulnerability—paranoia about China in particular—will likely intensify.

Whether AUKUS succeeds or not, the debate about its future has revealed a fundamental disconnect between Australia and the United States. Washington has long assumed, but left unsaid, that Australia would join the United States in a potential war with China over Taiwan by providing bases for intelligence gathering and by conducting other military activities. That assumption has become explicit: last year, the Republican chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, Michael McCaul, referred to Australia as “the central base of the Indo-Pacific to counter the China threat.” Yet even as AUKUS deepens Australia's defense integration with the United States, neither major political party in Australia nor the country's broader foreign policy community has confirmed in such stark terms that the alliance with Washington requires a firm commitment to participate directly in a war with China.

Australian officials do have an interest in Taiwan's future, to be sure. Beyond concern about Taiwan itself, Australia does not want China further emboldened to assert itself all over East Asia and Southeast Asia. Yet Australia has a strong interest in avoiding war, too, given that any conflict could entail severe economic disruption because of the country's dependence on the China market.

What Australian security elites want is the old American ally, the one to which they so often appealed as the guarantor of the rules-based order. And they want, more than anything else, ironclad guarantees that the transfer of the Virginia-class submarines will take place and that the United States will not retreat from Asia. They worry, however, that Australia's much-prized access in Washington is slipping as Trump prioritizes great-power politics. For now, Australia is experiencing this loss as a trauma. The only way forward may be to accept that the United States today is simply not the ally Canberra is used to.

            A 29-year-old Florida man is under arrest on suspicion of arson in connection with the Palisades Fire, which burned thousands of homes and killed 12 people when it tore through the Los Angeles area in January.
    


            Florida resident Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, is facing a federal charge of destruction of property by means of fire, according to Bill Essayli, the acting US attorney for Southern California.
    


            The suspect, who lived in the Palisades neighborhood at the time, was working as an Uber driver and dropped off a passenger on New Year's Eve before walking up a nearby trail and starting the fire, officials said.
    


            Rinderknecht allegedly generated an image on ChatGPT “depicting a burning city,” according to Essayli.
    


            “The investigation into the Palisades Fire of January 2025 was lengthy, complex and, as I mentioned, extremely thorough,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said at a news conference on Wednesday.
    


            The Palisades Fire, which began the morning of January 7, has been determined to be a “holdover” fire, according to the criminal complaint, meaning it started from the remnants of an earlier blaze.
    


            Six days earlier, there had been another fire in the same vicinity, according to satellite images and dispatch recordings analyzed by CNN. That fire had been reported contained within hours by local firefighters after growing to about eight acres, according to alerts from the LA fire department, which noted a team would work to ensure no flare-ups occurred.
    


            The Los Angeles City Fire Department had suppressed the Lachman Fire on January 1, the complaint says, but “unbeknownst to anyone the fire continued to smolder and burn underground, within the root structure of dense vegetation.”
    


            The suspect is expected in federal court for a first appearance Wednesday afternoon, Essayli said.
    


            The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined the fire “was ignited with an open flame,” Essayli said.
    


            Rinderknecht lived in the Palisades and was familiar with the neighborhood, which was full of dense vegetation, officials said.
    


            “It took the defendant several tries to contact 911 to report the fire,” Essayli said. “He fled the scene in his car, but turned around after passing fire engines driving in the opposite direction to fight the fire.”
    


            Essayli declined to speak to Rinderknecht's motive.
    


            “Part of the lengthy time that it took to go over the thousands of acres that were burned is we literally had agents with our partners on their hands and knees crawling through fire debris,” said ATF Special Agent in Charge Kenny Cooper.
    


Bill Weir investigates Pacific Palisades home that survived fires



            California Attorney General Rob Bonta told CNN earlier this year there were “some indications that arson is a possibility that we have to be open to.”
    


            Fifteen members of the ATF's National Response Team headed up the investigation into the fire's “cause and origins,” ATF deputy assistant director Tim Jones previously told CNN.
    


            The proximity of the two fires had prompted questions as to whether winds could have rekindled smoldering debris left from New Year's Eve fireworks to trigger the Palisades Fire, as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and the Washington Post.
    


LA County response to deadly fires slowed by lack of resources, outdated alert process, report says



            The Palisades wildfire is the ninth deadliest wildfire in state history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
    


            The deadly inferno in Los Angeles is the third-most destructive wildfire in Southern California history, destroying thousands of homes and businesses and burning more than 23,000 acres.
    


            The fire was anticipated to be among the costliest wildfires in the history of the United States, a climate expert predicted.
    


            “While we cannot undo the damage and destruction that was done, we hope his arrest and the charges against him bring some measure of justice to the victims of this horrific tragedy,” Essayli said in a social media post.

Speaking at the “Day of Unreasonable Conversation” summit, an invitation-only event for writers in Los Angeles, former vice president Kamala Harris had some harsh words on the current political moment.

Speaking at the “Day of Unreasonable Conversation” summit, an invitation-only event for writers in Los Angeles, former vice president Kamala Harris had some harsh words on the current political moment.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem met with Portland Mayor Keith Wilson during her Tuesday trip to Oregon's biggest city. Noem said she threatened the mayor during the meeting to send “four times the amount of federal officers” to Portland if he doesn't follow through on security measures for government officers.

The government shutdown is having major impacts on air traffic control capabilities at some of the nation's busiest airports. CNN's Pete Muntean has the latest.

President Donald Trump told reporters he could potentially invoke the Insurrection Act, a law that allows the deployment of troops in the US in certain limited situations, as civilians continue to protest against immigration raids in cities such as Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles.

Video shared with CNN shows a crowd of people in Chicago help stop two masked US Border Patrol agents from detaining an unidentified man. The video of the confrontation lasted more than four minutes before agents released the man, got in their car, and drove away. 

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Attorney General Pam Bondi clashed over the Trump administration sending National Guard troops into Illinois. Bondi refused to answer Durbin's questions about the legal rationale.

CNN's Kaitlan Collins speaks with Bill Nye, ""The Science Guy,"" about the potential impact of proposed massive cuts to NASA's budget.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized the blocking of the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon, calling the ruling “untethered in reality and in the law.”

CNN's Kaitlan Collins asks President Trump about his call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu over the weekend.

Gov. JB Pritzker (D) of Illinois and Attorney General Kwame Raoul (D) have announced they are suing President Donald Trump for deploying the National Guard to Chicago.

House Speaker Mike Johnson made clear that he's counting on Senate Democrats to cave and back Republicans' House-passed bill to reopen the government, as the shutdown drags into a second week and the House remains out of session for the third week in a row. CNN's Arlette Saenz reports.

For a second time, a Trump-appointed judge has blocked President Trump from sending troops into Portland. CNN's Alayna Treene reports.

Police are investigating a house fire at a South Carolina district judge's home. Three people were hospitalized, but the cause of the fire is currently unknown.

In a video filmed on Sunday evening, protesters can be seen clashing with federal agents outside Portland's ICE detention facility. This comes as a federal judge blocked President Trump from sending the National Guard to Oregon.

A local artist in India portrayed President Donald Trump as the ""demon"" for the recent Durga Puja Festival. The organizers told CNN News 18, that the decision was not random and it was a response to Trump's 50 percent tariff on Indian goods.

A judge granted a temporary restraining order Saturday blocking Trump from sending the Oregon National Guard to the state's largest city. The Trump administration said it would appeal the ruling.

In an exclusive text interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, President Donald Trump provided new insight into the ongoing ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas nearly two years after the October 7th attack.

In an interview with Jake Tapper, Gov. JB Pritzker (D) responds to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem who claimed Chicago residents are applauding the work of federal law enforcement conducting immigration operations in Illinois. 

Chicago Alderperson Jessie Fuentes claims she was handcuffed by two Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents while attempting to visit a man detained by ICE at a hospital emergency room.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on ""The Benny Show"" she requested the Department of War be deployed to Chicago. Her comments come as DHS released a stylized video of an ICE raid in Chicago and during her visit to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois.

            The running battle between President Donald Trump and Democratic-led cities is nearing a new inflection point, as National Guard troops gather near Chicago while lawyers prepare for critical court hearings 2,000 miles away from each other.
    


            The Trump administration is tying planned deployments in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, to increasingly tense protests outside Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, as well as citing the shooting at an ICE facility in Dallas. Two ICE detainees were killed there. Trump has called it an attack on law enforcement.
    


            The president ramped up his criticism Wednesday of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker, who called the Guard call-up “Trump's invasion” over the weekend.
    


            “Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers! Governor Pritzker also!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


What is the Insurrection Act?



            Both officials responded to Trump's criticism on X Wednesday morning, with the mayor saying, “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested. I'm not going anywhere.”
    


            Meanwhile, Pritzker wrote he doesn't plan on backing down, saying, “Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?”
    


            “Masked agents already are grabbing people off the street,” the governor said, “Separating children from their parents. Creating fear.”
    


            Trump's commitment to the military option has been shown not only in courts, but in the frequent air travel by members of his administration. FBI Director Kash Patel and Assistant Attorney General Todd Blanche paid a brief visit to Chicago on Tuesday, at the same time Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem flew to the Portland ICE office.
    


            Noem visited the Chicago ICE facility last week, just after multiple Cabinet officials held a news conference in Memphis, Tennessee, touting the coming Guard deployment there.
    


Why Trump's troop deployments to US cities are such a big deal



            If the pending court cases challenging the deployments don't go Trump's way, the president has said he may effectively overrule them by invoking the Insurrection Act, which allows the deployment of troops in the US in certain limited situations – it's the largest statutory exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits the use of the military inside the US for domestic law enforcement purposes.
    


            “If I had to enact it, I'd do that,” Trump said Monday. “If people were being killed, and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure I do that.”
    


            Here is where the National Guard deployments stand now:
    


            It's said that nature abhors a vacuum, and the vacuum produced by a federal judge's decision to avoid an immediate ruling on whether to block the president's deployments in Chicago is quickly being filled by hundreds of Guard troops pouring into local training facilities there.
    


            President Trump authorized 300 Illinois National Guard troops for active duty in Chicago, and the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, volunteered another 400 of his state's guardsmen. Members of the Texas National Guard were seen at a suburban training center Tuesday.
    


Why Trump's troop deployments to US cities are such a big deal



            District Court Judge April Perry – nominated to the bench last year by President Biden – told both sides earlier this week she needed more time to digest the complicated legal issues surrounding the troop deployments.
    


            Both sides have until the end of the day Wednesday to submit their written arguments to Perry, with a hearing scheduled for Thursday morning.
    


            The mayor of Chicago said Wednesday that local police trying to maintain order are being put in a difficult position.
    


            “The president of the United States of America is literally pitting law enforcement against law enforcement,” said Johnson.
    


            “That's not the way it's supposed to be.”
    


            The deliberative steps of the Illinois judge contrast with the fast movement on the similar case in Portland.
    


            Judge Karin Immergut – a Trump appointee who once served on the Starr investigation into President Bill Clinton – almost immediately blocked Trump's call-up of the Oregon National Guard on Saturday.
    


            When the White House responded by deploying federalized California National Guard troops to Portland on Sunday, Immergut responded by expanding her ruling to stop all National Guard deployments in Oregon.
    


            The case is now moving to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is being asked by the White House to suspend Immergut's order and allow Guardsmen to be deployed.
    


             A Thursday hearing is scheduled in front of three-judge panel – two Trump appointees and a Clinton appointee who was once a justice on the Oregon Supreme Court.
    


            While the rollout of the military in Portland has been blocked by a judge, the planned rollout in Memphis is being slowed by more practical concerns.
    


            “The Tennessee National Guard should be coming in the next few days or in the next week or so,” Democratic Mayor Paul Young told CNN affiliate WATN on Tuesday.
    


Feds rack up arrests in Memphis as part of Trump admin's latest crime crackdown operation



            The exact role that the Tennessee National Guard, which is being deployed to Memphis by Republican Gov. Bill Lee, will play in the city has not been revealed.
    


            A large group of federal law enforcement agents is already in the city as part of the Memphis Safe Task Force. The group made 386 arrests in just over a week, according to Justice Department figures released Wednesday, with more than 200 being classified as either “warrant pickups” or “administrative.” Two arrests were made in homicide cases.
    


            The mayor's Democratic political leadership has been at odds with the Trump administration and Republican state leaders over the need for federal involvement, but Young said they are cooperating.
    


            “It was something that the governor and the president decided, and as mayor of the city, it's my job to make sure it's coordinated well within our community,” he told WATN.
    


Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the type of federal troops training for deployment near Chicago. They are National Guard troops.

            Fifty years ago this month, President Gerald Ford told New York City the federal government would not save it from financial collapse. The New York Daily News summed up Ford's speech in an infamous front-page headline: “Ford to City: Drop Dead.”
    


            Today, President Donald Trump is punishing American cities in ways that make Ford's refusal to bail out New York look amicable by comparison. (Ford later approved federal loans to the city with strict conditions attached.)
    


            But cities lack the power or resources to fight back.
    


            They can't stop Trump's funding cuts, remove federal troops stationed on their streets or reverse damaging policies beyond legal challenges — despite being the economic engines of the United States. Last year, metropolitan areas accounted for 90.8% of the country's economic output, employed 88.2% of Americans and housed 86.4% of the population. The income cities generate also supports rural areas and small towns.
    


            There's a long history of hostility toward cities in the United States, but “right now we're at an apex of virulent anti-urbanism,” said Richard Schragger, a law professor at the University of Virginia who specializes in local government and urban policy. “What Trump is doing is affirmatively attacking and occupying American cities. That's a much more hostile attitude” than Ford.
    


            Trump is going after cities every way he can. He suggested using “some of these dangerous cities as training grounds” for US troops. He authorized the National Guard to Los Angeles; Washington, DC; Memphis; Portland; and Chicago, and threatened the same for New Orleans and New York City. The White House also recently canceled or delayed funding for critical infrastructure, transit and clean energy projects in Democratic-run cities during the federal government shutdown. That's on top of the cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other federal programs that will blow a hole in local budgets.
    


            Cities are nearly powerless to stop Trump because they are considered  “creatures of the state” in American law. They can't raise taxes or borrow money without approval from states, and states often create policies that impose burdens on cities.
    


            So if Republican Gov. Bill Lee of Tennessee, for example, encourages Trump to send federal troops to Memphis over the objections of the city's Democratic mayor, Paul Young, Memphis is powerless to stop it.
    


            “It's three tiers — federal, state, local — and we're in the lowest tier,” said Brett Smiley, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, who is also on the US Conference of Mayors' advisory board. “Each step you take down that rung limits your options and your authority.”
    


            “We will never be able to backfill the scale of cuts, depending on what happens at the federal level,” Smiley added. “We also don't have all of the legal tools necessary to resist some of these federal actions.”
    


            The White House did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
    


            Cities are never mentioned in the Constitution and have no official place in the US system of government. Over time, this has left their role open to interpretation.
    


            “We don't have a clear, rationally planned system of designating what powers cities do and don't have,” said Clarissa Hayward, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis who studies democratic theory and urban politics. “It's a system that evolved over time in circumstances that have nothing to do with the challenges cities are facing in 2025.”
    


            Cities are still constrained by a legal doctrine from the 1870s known as Dillon's Rule, named for a judge in Iowa, that said states control cities. Most states adopted Dillion's Rule in the nineteenth century, although a few like California, Oregon, and New York empower cities to set their own laws and manage local affairs, a principle known as home rule.
    


            Many states exert tight influence over cities, however, even passing legislation in recent years that preempt cities from adopting their own policies on issues like immigration, gay rights and the environment. For example, Texas passed a law in 2023 that prevented progressive cities from enacting legislation that didn't align with the conservative state legislature, dubbed the “Death Star” law by opponents.
    


            Eighteen of the 20 largest US cities have Democratic mayors, and Trump has “figured out how to exploit this bizarre legal morass that we have,” Hayward said. “One of these things that can be exploited is blue cities in red states.”
    


            Cities are often blamed for national problems like homelessness and crime. But they don't control federal funding for housing assistance or set national gun laws.
    


            Cities also have limited ability to solve these problems since they don't have direct control over the resources needed to tackle them. Roughly one-third of cities' revenue comes from federal grants to states that are then doled out to cities.
    


            “The problem is that cities have responsibilities but not power,” said Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia University who studies state and local government. “Cities have to absorb the costs of poverty. If a lot of people can't pay their rent or access health care, the consequences will show up at the local doorstep.”
    


            Providence Mayor Smiley said the Trump administration's policies on trade, immigration and energy are already hurting his city. Tariffs on lumber have increased construction costs, and immigration raids have hurt local businesses and caused children to stay home from school.
    


            “Everything that happens at the federal level eventually trickles down to the street level,” Smiley said.
    


            Although Smiley is a Democrat in a blue city, he said wants to collaborate with the Trump administration to build more housing, improve public safety and other bipartisan issues.
    


            But the administration's approach is making a strong partnership difficult, he said.
    


            “The thing that has been challenging at this time with the administration is the unpredictability,” he said. “Things are being done to cities, not in partnership, but rather to us against our wishes.”

BOSTON (AP) — Joan B. Kennedy, the former wife of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy who endured a troubled marriage marked by family tragedies, her husband's infidelities and her own decades-long struggles with alcoholism and mental health, died on Wednesday. She was 89.

The former Joan Bennett, one of the last remaining members of a family generation that included President John F. Kennedy, was a model and classically-trained pianist when she married Ted Kennedy in 1958. 

Their lives would change unimaginably over the next decade and a half. Brother-in-law John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960 and assassinated three years later. Brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy served as attorney general under JFK, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1964 and assassinated while seeking the presidency.

Her husband was elected to the U.S. Senate and became among the country's most respected legislators despite initial misgivings that he was capitalizing on his family connections. But Ted Kennedy also lived through scandals of his own making. In 1969, the car he was driving plunged off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island, killing his young female passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne.

Kennedy, who swam to safety and waited hours before alerting police, later pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. Chappaquiddick shadowed him for the rest of his life, weighing against his own chances for the presidency.

Joan Kennedy had three children with her husband, but also had miscarriages, including one shortly after the Chappaquiddick accident. She stood by her husband through the scandal, but their estrangement was nearly impossible to hide by the time of his unsuccessful effort to defeat President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 Democratic primaries. They had been separated by then, and would later divorce. One bumper sticker from the campaign read “Vote for Jimmy Carter, Free Joan Kennedy.”

Virginia Joan Bennett was born into a prominent Bronxville, N.Y., family and as a teen she worked as a model in TV ads. She was a classmate of Jean Kennedy, the future senator's sister, at Manhattanville College, where her exceptional beauty caught Ted Kennedy's eye when he visited the campus for a building dedication in 1957.




They married a year later, but Joan Kennedy struggled from the start to fit in to the high-powered family.

“Joan was shy and a really reserved person, and the Kennedys aren't,” Adam Clymer, author of “Edward M. Kennedy: A Biography” said in an 2005 interview with the AP.

Her love of piano would be a trademark for much of her life. She was known for opening her husband's campaign rallies with a piano serenade and, after they divorced, touring with orchestras around the world. Her family said she would combine her masterful playing with a message about the transformational potential of the arts and the need for equitable arts education.

In a 1992 Associated Press interview, she recalled playing piano for brother-in-law Bobby when he ran for president in 1968. “He took me with him and encouraged me,” she said. “He had a theme, ‘This Land Is Your Land,' the Woody Guthrie song. I'd play that on the piano and everybody would come in, feeling really great about everything.”

“It seems like a long time ago, but it's part of my memories,” she said softly.

In a statement, former Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island praised his mother for her courage and talent.

“Besides being a loving mother, talented musician, and instrumental partner to my father as he launched his successful political career, Mom was a power of example to millions of people with mental health conditions,” his statement said. “She will be missed not just by the entire Kennedy Family, but by the arts community in the City of Boston and the many people whose lives that she touched.” 

She also became one of the first women to publicly acknowledge her struggles with alcoholism and depression. 

“I will always admire my mother for the way that she faced up to her challenges with grace, courage, humility, and honesty,” Ted Kennedy Jr. said in a statement. “She taught me how to be more truthful with myself and how careful listening is a more powerful communication skill than public speaking.”

After Chappaquiddick, her drinking worsened. A series of drunken driving arrests led to stays in alcohol treatment programs. Then in 2005, a passerby found her passed out on a Boston sidewalk in the rain, and she was hospitalized with a concussion and broken shoulder. Her children intervened, with Ted Jr. obtaining a court-ordered guardianship for his mother's care.

Kennedy is survived by her two sons, nine grandchildren and other 30 nieces. Her daughter, Kara, died in 2011.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The global economy is holding up better than expected despite major shocks such as President Donald Trump's tariffs, but the head of the International Monetary Fund says that resilience may not last.

“Buckle up,” Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said in a speech at a think tank Wednesday. “Uncertainty is the new normal and it is here to stay.”

Her comments at the Milken Institute come on a day when gold prices hit $4,000 an ounce for the first time as investors seek safe haven from a weaker dollar and geopolitical uncertainty and before the IMF and World Bank hold their annual meetings next week in Washington. Trump's trade penalties are expected to be in sharp focus when global finance leaders and central bankers gather.

The worldwide economy is forecast to grow by 3% this year, and Georgieva is citing a number of factors for why it may not slip below that: Countries have put in place decisive economic policies, the private sector has adapted and the tariffs have proved less severe than originally feared.

“But before anyone heaves a big sigh of relief, please hear this: Global resilience has not yet been fully tested. And there are worrying signs the test may come. Just look at the surging global demand for gold,” she said.

On Trump's tariffs, she says “the full effect is still to unfold. In the U.S., margin compression could give way to more price pass-through, raising inflation with implications for monetary policy and growth.”




The Republican administration imposed import taxes on nearly all U.S. trading partners in April, including Canada, Mexico, Brazil, China and even the tiny African nation of Lesotho. “We're the king of being screwed by tariffs,” Trump said Tuesday in the Oval Office during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. 

While the U.S. has announced some trade frameworks with nations such as the United Kingdom and Vietnam, the tariffs have created uncertainty worldwide. 

“Elsewhere, a flood of goods previously destined for the U.S. market could trigger a second round of tariff hikes,” Georgieva said.

The Supreme Court next month will hear arguments about whether Trump has the authority to impose some of his tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

In her wide-ranging remarks, Georgieva pointed to youth discontent around the world as many young people foresee a future where they earn less than their parents. 

“The young are taking their disappointment to the streets from Lima to Rabat, from Paris to Nairobi, from Kathmandu to Jakarta, all are demanding better opportunities,” she said. “And here in the U.S., the chances of growing up to earn more than your parents keeps falling and here too, discontent has been evident — and it has helped precipitate the policy revolution that is now unfolding, reshaping trade, immigration and many international frameworks.”

She also called for greater internal trade in Asia, more business friendly changes in Africa and more competitiveness in Europe. 

For the United States, Georgieva urged the government to address the federal debt and to encourage household saving. 

The national debt is the total amount of money that the federal government owes to its creditors. The federal debt has increased from $380 billion in 1925 to $37.64 trillion in 2025, according to Treasury Department data.

The Congressional Budget Office reported in July that Trump's new tax and spending law will add $3.4 trillion to that total through 2034. 

The IMF is a 191-country lending organization that seeks to promote global growth and financial stability and to reduce poverty.

SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — When Rob Coverdale started his job in 2023 as superintendent of the K-12 Crow Creek Tribal School in South Dakota, there were 15 unfilled teaching positions.

Within nine months, he had filled those vacancies with Filipino teachers, the majority of whom arrived on the H-1B, a visa for skilled workers in specialty occupations.

“We've hired the H-1B teachers because we quite simply didn't have other applicants for those positions,” Coverdale said. “So they're certainly not taking jobs from Americans. They're filling jobs that otherwise just simply we would not get filled.” 

Now a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications spells trouble for those like Coverdale in rural parts of the country who rely on immigrants to fill vacancies in skilled professions like education and health care. 

The Trump administration announced the fee on Sept. 19, arguing that employers were replacing American workers with cheaper talent from overseas. Since then, the White House has said the fee won't apply to existing visa holders and offered a form to request exemptions from the charge.

H-1Bs are primarily associated with tech workers from India. Big tech companies are the biggest user of the visa, and nearly three-quarters of those approved are from India. But there are critical workers, like teachers and doctors, who fall outside that category. 

Over the last decade, the U.S. has faced a shortage in those and other sectors. One in eight public school positions are vacant or filled by uncertified teachers, and the American Medical Association projects a shortage of 87,000 physicians in the next decade. The shortages are often worse in small, rural communities that struggle to fill jobs due to lower wages and often lack basic necessities like shopping and home rental options. 

▶ Stay up to date with the latest U.S. news by signing up to our WhatsApp channel.

H-1B and J-1 visas provide communities an option to hire immigrants with advanced training and certification. The J-1s are short-term visas for cultural exchange programs that aren't subject to the new fee but, unlike the H-1B, don't offer a pathway to permanent residency.




While large companies may be able to absorb the new fee, that's not an option for most rural communities, said Melissa Sadorf, executive director of the National Rural Education Association.

“It really is potentially the cost of the salary and benefits of one teacher, maybe even two, depending on the state,” she said. “Attaching that price tag to a single hire, it just simply puts that position out of reach for rural budgets.”

A coalition of health care providers, religious groups and educators filed a lawsuit on Friday to stop the H-1B fee, saying it would harm hospitals, churches, schools and industries that rely on the visa. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment and referred a query to its website.

Coverdale said spots like Stephan, where Crow Creek is based, struggle to attract workers in part because of their isolation. Stephan is nearly an hour's drive from the nearest Walmart or any place that sells clothes, he said.

“The more remote you are, the more challenging it is for your staff members to get to your school and serve your kids,” he said.

Among Coverdale's hires is Mary Joy Ponce-Torres, who had 24 years of teaching experience in the Philippines and now teaches history at Crow Creek. It was a cultural adjustment, but Ponce-Torres said she's made friends and Stephan is now a second home.

“I came from a private school,” she said. “When I came here, I saw it was more like a rural area ... but maybe I was also looking for the same vibe, the same atmosphere where I can just take my time, take things in a much slower pace.”

Many immigrants like Ponce-Torres leave their family behind to pursue the experience and higher wages that a U.S. job can provide.

Sean Rickert, superintendent of the Pima Unified School District in Pima, Arizona, said he would stop seeking H-1B teachers if the new fee is imposed. “I just plain don't have the money,” he said.

Though schools can also use J-1 visas to bring in immigrant teachers, it increases turnover because it is shorter term.

“It's so important that we find permanent people, people who can buy homes, who can become part of our community,” said George Shipley, superintendent at Bison Schools in the town of Bison, South Dakota. “So the H-1B opens that possibility. It is super important, in my opinion, to actually transition from the J-1 visas to the H-1B.” 

Without enough staff, schools may hire uncertified teachers, combine classes, increase caseloads for special education managers or drop some course offerings. Shipley said any future shortage of teachers in Bison would force some classes to move online.

The rural reliance on immigrant teachers is concentrated on harder-to-fill specialties, Sadorf said.

“It's a lot more difficult to find a high school advanced math teacher that's qualified than it is to fill a second or third grade elementary class position,” she said.

The fee could be a “huge problem” for health care, said Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association and a doctor in Flint, Michigan. Without enough doctors, patients will have to drive farther and wait longer for care.

One-quarter of the nation's physicians are international medical graduates, according to the AMA.

“It's just going to be terrible for the physician shortage, particularly in rural areas,” said Mukkamala, whose parents came to the U.S. as international medical graduates. “The people that do graduate from here, who want to practice medicine, obviously have a choice and they're going to pick Detroit, they're going to pick Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco. ... This is kind of where everybody goes.”

Leading medical societies have called on the Trump administration and lawmakers to grant exemptions from the fee to immigrant health care workers.

“Given the staffing and financial challenges our hospitals are already facing, the increased petition fees outlined in the September 19 Proclamation would likely prevent many of them from continuing to recruit essential health care staff and could force a reduction in the services they are able to provide,” the American Hospital Association said in a statement.

Allison Roberts, vice president of human resources at Prairie Lakes Healthcare System in Watertown, South Dakota, said the change could be dire for health care in rural America.

“If we end up not being exempt, the variation between what it is now and that $100,000 fee is going to really take your smaller, rural health care institutions out of the picture,” she said.

Watch live outside a court in Alexandria, Virginia, as former FBI Director James Comey makes his first court appearance in a Justice Department criminal case accusing him of lying to Congress five years ago.

Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty Wednesday in a criminal case that has thrown a spotlight on the Justice Department's efforts to target adversaries of President Donald Trump.

Comey entered a not guilty plea through his lawyer at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, to allegations that he lied to Congress five years ago, kick-starting a process of legal wrangling in which defense lawyers will almost certainly move to get the indictment dismissed before trial, possibly by arguing the case amounts to a selective or vindictive prosecution.

Frustration is running high in the Capitol, spilling over in a hallway debate between House Speaker Mike Johnson and two Democratic senators.



Arizona Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego gathered reporters in front of the speaker's office Wednesday afternoon to call on Johnson to swear in an Arizona congresswoman-elect who won a special election two weeks ago.

But Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was not about to let them stand outside his office without a challenge.



After quickly shaking their hands, Johnson said he would swear in Adelita Grijalva after the government shutdown: “We need the lights turned back on, so we encourage both of you to go open the government.”



Gallego argued that Johnson was trying to keep Grijalva from providing crucial support to force a vote on a bill to release the Epstein files.

“Get your people in and stop covering up for the pedophiles,” Gallego snapped at Johnson.

Top union leaders representing federal employees, along with allied labor groups, on Wednesday pressured both parties to reach a solution to end the shutdown.

“No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,” said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

Union leaders criticized both parties in Congress but also targeted Trump, accusing him of using federal workers as “political pawns” after warnings Tuesday that back pay is not guaranteed.

“He intends to either violate the law, or degrade, frighten, antagonize hardworking federal employees whose only crime is caring and wanting to work for the American people,” said Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees.

“Congress, do your damn job,” added Erwin. “And president, you better start obeying the Constitution.”

Trump arrived in office in January 2017 as Comey, appointed to the FBI director job by President Barack Obama, was overseeing an investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.

The dynamic was fraught from the start, with Comey briefing Trump weeks before he took office on the existence of uncorroborated and sexually salacious gossip in a dossier of opposition research compiled by a former British spy.

In their first several private interactions, Comey would later reveal, Trump asked his FBI director to pledge his loyalty to him and to drop an FBI investigation into his administration's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Comey said Trump also asked him to announce that Trump himself wasn't under investigation as part of the broader inquiry into Russian election interference, something Comey didn't do.

Comey was abruptly fired in May 2017 with Trump later saying he was thinking about “this Russia thing” when he decided to terminate him. The firing was investigated by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller as an act of potential obstruction of justice.

Comey in 2018 published a memoir, “A Higher Loyalty,” that painted Trump in deeply unflattering ways.

The federal judge ruled Tuesday on the arrests that happened during the early days of President Trump's second term.

The ACLU of Illinois and other Chicago immigration advocates sued DHS and ICE in March, alleging the January arrests of 26 people in the Midwest violated a 2022 consent decree that bans ICE from arresting people without warrants or probable cause.

U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered ICE to start making monthly disclosures of how many warrantless arrests agents make each month.

“Today's decision makes clear that DHS and ICE — like everyone else — must follow the Constitution and the law,” Michelle García, deputy legal director at the ACLU of Illinois and co-counsel in the case, said in a statement. “The federal government's reckless practice of stopping, harassing and detaining people — and then finding a justification for the action must end.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson is rejecting calls from some lawmakers for Congress to hold a stand-alone vote on paying military service members, who will potentially miss a paycheck next week if the shutdown isn't resolved soon.

Johnson said the House already had that vote as part of a stop-gap spending bill that would have funded the federal government through Nov. 21.

“Every Republican and at least one Democrat had the common sense to say ‘of course we want the government to stay in operation, of course we want to pay our troops and our air traffic controllers and our border patrol agents, TSA and everybody else,'” Johnson said. “We did have that vote.”

“The House is done,” he added. “The ball is now in the Senate's court. It does us no good to be here dithering on show votes.”

House Speaker Mike Johnson's comments during a news conference at the Capitol on Wednesday follow the Trump administration's warning of no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown, potentially reversing what has been long-standing policy for some 750,000 furloughed employees.

Johnson said he had yet to dig into legal analysis that is the basis for the administration's warning.

But he said it is tradition “and I think it is statutory law that federal workers be paid.”

“And I think they should be,” Johnson said.

The criminal case has thrown a spotlight on the Justice Department's efforts to target adversaries of President Trump.

Comey pleaded not guilty through his lawyer to allegations that he lied to Congress five years go.

Comey entered the not guilty plea through his lawyer at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, to allegations that he lied to Congress five years ago, kick-starting a process of legal wrangling in which defense lawyers will almost certainly move to get the indictment dismissed before trial, possibly by arguing the case amounts to a selective or vindictive prosecution.

Comey is expected to plead not guilty during his appearance at federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Wednesday.

Comey's arraignment is expected to be brief. But the moment is nonetheless loaded with historical significance given that the case has amplified concerns that the Justice Department is being weaponized in pursuit of President Trump's political enemies and is operating at the behest of a White House determined to seek retribution.

Comey's legal team includes Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. attorney in Chicago.

The White House hasn't released details about the meeting scheduled for Wednesday afternoon.

Trump has said he plans to designate antifa, an umbrella term for far-left-leaning militant groups, as a “major terrorist organization” but it's not clear how that would work against the decentralized movement.

The president said in a Wednesday morning social media post that Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritkzer, both Democrats, “should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers!.”

It wasn't immediately clear what Trump was specifically objecting to with his post, but it was the latest example of his brazen calls for his opponents to be prosecuted or locked up, a break from longtime norms as the Justice Department traditionally sought to maintain its independence.

Authorities said a woman was shot over the weekend in Chicago when Border Patrol vehicles were boxed in and struck by other vehicles.

Outside Chicago, in the village of Broadview, there have been skirmishes between protesters and agents outside a detention center.

They include his daughter Maurene, who was fired by the Justice Department earlier this year from her position as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, as well as Troy Edwards Jr., a son-in-law of Comey's who minutes after Comey was indicted resigned his job as a prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia — the same office that filed the charges.

Tours at the Capitol have come to a standstill. The House is keeping its doors closed, while the Senate is stuck in a loop of failed votes on a rejected plan to reopen the government. President Trump is threatening to mass fire federal workers and refuse back pay for the rest.

As the government shutdown enters a second week, there's no discernible endgame in sight.

The Republicans who have majority control in Congress believe they have the upper hand politically, as they fend off Democratic demands to quickly fund health insurance subsidies as part of any plan to end the shutdown. But so have Democrats dug in, convinced Americans are on their side in the fight to prevent the looming health care price spikes and blaming Trump for the shutdown.

Behind the scenes, though, signs of discomfort are apparent.

A loosely formed collection of senators, Republicans and Democrats, have bantered about options for addressing the health insurance problem.

And Trump himself signaled he was open to negotiating with Democrats over their demands to save health care subsidies.

A partisan battle is playing out in a Washington courtroom that could decide the fate of President Trump's federal law enforcement intervention in the nation's capital.

Dozens of states have taken sides in a lawsuit challenging the open-ended National Guard deployment in Washington, with their support falling along party lines. It shows how the law enforcement operation in the nation's capital remains a flashpoint in the Republican president's broadening campaign to send the military to cities across the country and underscores the deepening divisions over the move.

The lawsuit, filed Sept. 4 by Washington Attorney General Brian Schwalb, challenges the Trump administration's use of the National Guard in the heavily Democratic city as part of an emergency order issued by Trump to stem what the president called “out of control” crime. Although the order has lapsed, hundreds of troops are still in the city, which is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the deployment.

Michael Nachmanoff has built a quiet reputation in the federal courthouse in northern Virginia — a onetime public defender turned judge known for methodical preparation and a cool temperament. On Wednesday, he finds himself at the center of a political storm: presiding over the Justice Department's prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey.

Confirmed to the bench by President Joe Biden in 2021, Nachmanoff was randomly assigned to the case after a Virginia grand jury indicted Comey last month on charges including obstruction of a congressional proceeding. The assignment instantly drew President Trump's attention. Trump, long fixated on Comey, blasted him as a “Dirty Cop” and derided Nachmanoff as a “Crooked Joe Biden appointed Judge” while celebrating the charges as “JUSTICE FOR AMERICA!”

Despite the political noise, lawyers who know Nachmanoff say he is unlikely to be swayed.

President Trump publicly implored Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against Comey and other perceived adversaries.

The Republican president also replaced the veteran attorney who'd been overseeing the investigation with Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who had never previously served as a federal prosecutor. Halligan rushed to file charges before a legal deadline lapsed despite warnings from other lawyers in the office that the evidence was insufficient for an indictment.

The two-count indictment alleges Comey made a false statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 30, 2020, by denying he had authorized an associate to serve as an anonymous source to the news media and that he obstructed a congressional proceeding. Comey has denied any wrongdoing and has said he was looking forward to a trial.

Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs launched her reelection bid Wednesday, outlining a practical rather than confrontational approach to campaigning in a swing state where the politics are delicate and she will need Republican support.

PHOENIX (AP) — Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs launched her reelection bid Wednesday, outlining a practical rather than confrontational approach to campaigning in a swing state where the politics are delicate and she will need Republican support. 

Nationally, Democrats are looking to bounce back from sweeping losses in the 2024 election. In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of the launch, Hobbs shrugged off pessimism in the Democratic ranks and among voters. She said she's focused on putting Arizonans first and politics aside, a message she hopes will resonate with voters across the political spectrum. 

She'll need that, particularly in a swing state that endorsed President Donald Trump in 2024 but chose Joe Biden four years earlier.

“I think winning this race in Arizona is going to send a strong message of we know how to win in tough states like Arizona. And it's not about politics. It's about delivering on the issues that matter,” Hobbs said, pointing to issues including affordable housing and border security.

As the likely Democratic nominee, Hobbs will face developer Karrin Taylor Robson, U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs or U.S. Rep. David Schweikert in the November 2026 general election. Taylor Robson and Biggs are both endorsed by Trump. 

Hobbs rose to prominence nationally amid Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. The former Arizona secretary of state was ushered into the governor's office in 2023 as Democrats made gains in the state's top offices, becoming the first Democrat elected as governor since Janet Napolitano won a second term in 2006. 

Hobbs ran a cautious campaign in 2022, keeping largely to scripted and choreographed public appearances. She declined to debate her Republican opponent, Kari Lake, a Trump loyalist who also falsely claimed the 2020 election was rigged. Hobbs won by less than a percentage point.

Hobbs acknowledged the 2026 race will be tough and said she's not taking any vote for granted.

She criticized Taylor Robson, Biggs and Schweikert for supporting Trump's budget bill that she said raises the federal deficit, slashes meals for kids and jeopardizes health care.

“It's not pretty,” she said. “The impacts of this partisan Washington budget are going to be really painful for Arizonans, having to make really tough choices when I've consistently tried to put families first. And it's going to be really challenging with these cuts.”

Earlier this year, Hobbs launched a law enforcement task force to combat the flow of illegal drugs, including fentanyl, into the U.S. through the state's border with Mexico. It drew praise from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Hobbs pointed to it as an example of how she's worked with the Trump administration on border security. She had called out Biden, saying his administration didn't do enough. 

Hobbs stood firm in her conviction that deporting people shouldn't be done indiscriminately and rebuked Trump's widespread immigration crackdowns.

“I would continue to advocate for the president to keep his promise and go after the people that are making us unsafe,” she said.

This past legislative session, she vetoed a GOP-favored bill that sought to require local and state officials to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. She has drawn criticism from members of her own party, who pushed her to reduce spending for border support. 

Since she's been in office, Hobbs has remained strategically critical of her Republican foes in the state Legislature. The GOP expanded its majorities in both chambers in last year's election, raising the hurdle for the governor in getting any of her priorities through.

She's consistently called for reining in the state's school voucher program — a nonstarter for legislative Republicans. She said she shares the frustrations of Arizonans who want accountability within the program and more guardrails. 

“Arizonans should be frustrated. I am frustrated. I'm going to continue to propose reforms, and I'm going to continue to fight for those reforms,” she said. 

This past session, Hobbs' office chose to negotiate on just a handful of issues, including water policy, funding for some of Arizona's most vulnerable residents and renovations to a stadium used by the Arizona Diamondbacks. Not all of that legislation made it over the finish line.

“I think that my record on delivering on the issues that Arizonans care about, whether it's securing the border, securing our water future, lowering costs, investing in education, creating good paying jobs is what is going to make that four more years possible,” she said.

Ilay David joins ‘Fox & Friends' to call for the release of his brother, Evyatar David, who has been held and starved by Hamas in Gaza since the October 7th terror attacks on Israel.

Swedish activist Greta Thunberg is facing backlash after using an image of an emaciated Israeli hostage in an Instagram post allegedly showing Palestinians suffering.

The post read, ""The suffering of Palestinian prisoners is not a matter of opinion — it is a fact of systemic cruelty and dehumanization. Humanity cannot be selective. Justice cannot have borders."" It also included three images, including one of hostage Evyatar David, who was taken from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7, 2023. 

The image of David was a still frame from a Hamas propaganda video. In the video, David appears extremely frail as he describes the conditions in captivity and says he hasn't eaten for days. The part of the video that shocked many was when David's captors forced him to dig his own grave.

Yeela David, Evyatar's sister, commented on the post saying Thunberg needed to do research before posting ""things you don't understand."" She then added that, ""every minute you are not deleting the post, you are becoming a bigger joke. Embarrassing.""

The post, which contained multiple images, appears to have since been edited and the slide with David's image is no longer visible. The comment section, however, is full of reminders that his image was there with users decrying the ""lies"" showcased in the post.

The slides were part of a collaboration post with Thunberg, Yasmin Acar, a member of the steering committee of the Freedom Flotilla Coalition; the Gaza Sumud Flotilla and two other accounts.

ISRAEL CLAIMS GRETA THUNBERG'S FLOTILLA SEEKING TO BREAK GAZA BLOCKADE HAS HAMAS TIES, CITES DOCUMENTS

The first slide of the post read, ""The world is rightly horrified by what the Sumud Flotilla hostages are enduring,"" referring to detainees arrested when Israel intercepted their fleet last week. ""Their suffering is real and no human being should ever be subjected to such pain, fear or humiliation."" The post then goes on to compare this to the plight of Palestinians in Israeli prisons, with the activists asserting that over 11,000 Palestinian ""hostages and prisoners"" were held in unhygienic and inhumane conditions. 

The group also included a video from 2015 in their post showing Ahmad Manasra, who was 13 at the time. Manasra was arrested in 2015 in connection with a Jerusalem stabbing attack during what is often called the ""Knife Intifada,"" according to The Jerusalem Post.

The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs posted a screenshot of the deleted slide next to a zoomed-in version of the still image of David, declaring, ""Ignorance blinded by hate is trending.""

""Greta Thunberg posted about ‘Palestinian prisoners' using the image of Israeli hostage Evyatar David - starved, abused, and forced by Palestinian Hamas to dig his own grave,"" the ministry wrote on X.

Fox News' Martha MacCallum joined America's Newsroom to share her reaction to California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter's CBS interview, which she abruptly ended after a heated back-and-forth.

Conservatives on social media blasted California Democrat Katie Porter, who is considered by many Democrats to be a frontrunner in the state's gubernatorial race, after she attempted to end a contentious interview due to the follow-up questions asked by a reporter.

The viral moment happened in a clip posted Tuesday night where Porter took issue with the line of questioning from CBS investigative journalist Julie Watts, who was pushing Porter on whether she can and needs to appeal to the millions of Trump voters in the state to become the next governor.

""I feel like this is unnecessarily argumentative,"" Porter said, adding, ""I don't want to keep doing this, I'm going to call it.""The exchange quickly went viral on social media, with conservatives hammering Porter for becoming frustrated over simple follow-up questions that Watts argued were asked of the other candidates in the race as well.

""California Democratic consultants have been telling me for years that Katie Porter is the most unpleasant and unprofessional candidate they've ever encountered and well…I think they might have been on to something,"" political consultant Liz Mair posted on X. 

""Katie Porter just had a meltdown when asked what she'd say to GOP voters,"" GOP California Congressman Ken Calvert posted on X. 

""Her tirade is a window into the mentality of radical CA Democrat politicians. They can't stand those who disagree with them,"" he continued. ""They're trying to silence their opponents with Prop 50. They even condone violent rhetoric targeting Republicans. We have to speak up. We have to vote NO on Prop 50. We have to take our state back from these extremists.""

""Katie Porter is the epitome of a Karen,"" Republican digital operative Alec Sears posted on X. ""When I picture a Karen in my mind it's just Katie Porter. Just pure, unearned ego and a vile attitude.""

""Follow-up questions are a fact of life,"" political commentator Michelle Tafoya posted on X.  ""A good reporter listens to your answer and follows up for clarification. @katieporteroc has no business leading a state.  Any state.""

""This is simply not how to run for office or how to deal with the media,"" Democratic consultant Lis Smith posted on X. ""And if this how someone acts on camera, imagine how they act off camera.""

Porter, 51, served three terms in Congress – winning her Orange County seat by upsetting GOP Rep. Mimi Walters in 2018. She ran unsuccessfully for the Senate seat now held by Sen. Adam Schiff, D–Calif., and her district is now represented by Dave Min, a Democrat. 

The Los Angeles Times describes Porter as a prolific fundraiser, while the former lawmaker's gregarious nature was projected at the time of her jumping into the race to make inroads among Californians upset at President Donald Trump's election.

In her announcement, Porter referenced Trump and alleged he would seek to enrich himself and his circle while in the White House.

Porter is running for governor in a crowded field of Democrats and Republicans competing in the state's ""jungle primary"" system, where the two candidates who receive the most votes in the primary, regardless of party, will advance to the general election. 

Several of Porter's opponents reacted to the viral clip on social media. 

""We need a leader who will solve hard problems and answer simple questions,"" former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat, posted on X. 

""I'm not interested in excluding any vote,"" former HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, posted on X. ""Every Californian deserves affordable health care, safe streets, a roof over their head and a living wage.""

Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reports from Tel Aviv two years after Hamas' Oct. 7 terror attack as President Trump pushes for a Gaza peace deal. Former National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien weighs in.

New satellite images reveal the extent of the destruction in the Gaza Strip after enduring more than two years of Israeli strikes during the war with Hamas.

Planet Labs PBC released the images on Tuesday, showing the Palestinian enclave before the Israel-Hamas war broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, and after the war began.

An estimated 192,812 – about 78% – of all structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, according to a United Nations Satellite Center report from July.

Where homes, buildings and fields once stood in the southern city of Rafah, there were now craters and barren wastelands.

Israel's retaliatory offensive has displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of some 2 million, often multiple times, and restrictions on humanitarian aid have contributed to a severe hunger crisis, with experts saying Gaza City is experiencing famine.

The war has already killed over 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, which does not say how many were civilians or combatants. It says women and children make up around half the dead.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: ISRAELI HOSTAGE FAMILIES PLEAD, PEACE FALTERS, AND WAR GRINDS ON IN GAZA

The Israel-Hamas war began after Hamas terrorists launched a surprise attack on southern Israel, storming army bases, farming communities and an outdoor music festival, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, including women, children and older adults.

Hamas abducted 251 others, most of whom have since been released in ceasefires or other deals. Forty-eight hostages remain inside Gaza, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive. 

Hamas has said it will release them only in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until all the captives are returned and Hamas has been removed.

Fox News senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot reports on the latest developments in the Israel-Hamas war on ‘Special Report.'

A crew member has died from injuries sustained during a Houthi attack on a Dutch cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden, as the Iran-backed rebels escalate their campaign against international targets and detain United Nations workers in Yemen.

The Philippines' Department of Migrant Workers confirmed that the victim was a Filipino national aboard the Minervagracht, a vessel operated by Amsterdam-based Spliethoff. The ship was struck by an explosive device while sailing in international waters, igniting a fire that forced the evacuation of 19 crew members of Russian, Ukrainian, Filipino and Sri Lankan nationalities. They were rescued by helicopter and transported to safety, the company said.

Iran-backed Houthis claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging the vessel had ""violated the entry ban to the ports of occupied Palestine."" The group has repeatedly targeted commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, claiming its attacks are acts of solidarity with Palestinians amid Israel's war in Gaza.

But the strike on the Minervagracht was the first major assault in the Gulf of Aden, which links the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, since July 2024.

And the strike on the Minervagracht marked the Houthis' first assault on a commercial ship since the Sept. 1 attack on the Israeli-owned tanker Scarlet Ray near the Saudi port city of Yanbu.

Meanwhile, the United Nations said that 10 of its staff members — all Yemeni nationals — were detained this week in areas controlled by the Houthis. They were working to deliver humanitarian aid in one of the world's poorest and most war-torn countries.

According to the U.N., a total of 54 staff members have been detained by the Houthis since 2021 as the rebels intensify their crackdown on international aid organizations. The Houthis have previously accused detained aid workers of being part of a ""spy network,"" a claim the U.N. and human rights groups have strongly denied.

ISRAEL CONFIRMS STRIKE ON HOUTHIS IN YEMEN, MARKS SECOND TIME THIS WEEK

The detentions come as Yemen's civil war, now in its 10th year, continues to fragment the country and complicate aid delivery, with more than two-thirds of the population reliant on humanitarian assistance.

The attacks come after Washington agreed to a ceasefire with the Houthis in May — raising questions about whether it will hold.

The Houthis ""say they will not be blowing up ships anymore,"" President Donald Trump said on May 6 when he announced the ceasefire.

In July, the Houthis attacked Greek-owned commercial vessel Magic Seas and the Liberia-flagged bulk carrier Eternity C.

Between December 2023 and February 2024, Houthi attacks caused a 90% drop in global container shipping through the Red Sea, according to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.

The Houthis have not violated the ceasefire provision banning attacks on U.S. ships but have breached the agreement's clause requiring ""the smooth flow of international commercial shipping.""

Republican Matt Van Epps is one step closer to the halls of Congress after winning the GOP nomination to replace former Tennessee GOP Rep. Mark Green in the House on Tuesday.

The Associated Press called the race for Van Epps at 8:40 p.m., 40 minutes after polls closed. Van Epps defeated nine other candidates in the primary with 42.3%. His closest competitor was state Rep. Jody Barrett, who received 26.3%.

Van Epps will advance to the general election on Dec. 2, where he is all but assured to win thanks to the 7th Congressional District's safe Republican leaning.

The Army veteran and former commissioner of Tennessee's Department of General Services's victory was a testament to the strength of President Donald Trump's endorsement, which pushed two of Van Epps's original 11 competitors to withdraw and throw their support behind him. 

Barrett had the backing of House Freedom Fund, which has endorsed and supported many conservative House Freedom Caucus members in Washington. But Barrett had drawn ire from school choice groups after he voted against Gov. Bill Lee's (R-TN) school voucher expansion.

Trump had joined a tele-rally on Monday night with Club For Growth PAC supporters and made a final endorsement push on Truth Social on Tuesday morning.

TENNESSEE GOP PRIMARY TO REPLACE MARK GREEN TESTS STRENGTH OF TRUMP ENDORSEMENT

If Van Epps wins the general election, his victory will bolster the House GOP's majority. Currently, Speaker Mike Johnson's (R-LA) majority sits at two seats. With a Nov. 4 special election in Texas likely to yield a Democrat victor, the majority is expected to narrow to just one seat. 

Van Epps's victory in December will push the majority back to two seats, giving Johnson slight breathing room heading into the 2026 midterm cycle. With contentious legislation, every vote counts, and Johnson's speakership has been plagued by revolt from fiscal hawks and other conservatives on his right flank.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty Wednesday morning to charges of making false statements and obstructing a 2020 congressional proceeding, as prosecutors signaled the case would introduce classified information in the discovery phase of legal proceedings.

The prosecution, led by U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, argued this was a complicated case and pushed for more time before bringing it to trial. U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, raised skepticism about how complicated the two-charge indictment is, but he eventually agreed that a preliminary date for when the trial could begin is Jan. 5.

The government requested that a trial take place outside the “speedy trial window” in part because there is a large amount of discovery in the case, including “a lot” of classified materials, which were not previously discussed before the arraignment.

Comey's attorneys, former Illinois prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald and national security attorney Jessica Carmichael, informed the court that they do not have security clearances to view any classified materials, prompting the judge to tell the prosecution that they would either need to obtain clearances or that the government would need to consider declassifying the records.

Nachmanoff also told the prosecution team that the case would move forward, “or we will go through the fastest CIPA process you have ever seen in your lives,” referring to the Classified Information Procedures Act process that typically involves lawyers presenting materials to defendants in private settings away from public view.

Halligan, a former real estate lawyer and personal attorney to President Donald Trump, was only recently appointed to her position after Trump fired her predecessor, Erik Siebert, after sources revealed to multiple outlets that he was pushing back against charging New York Attorney General Letitia James for alleged mortgage fraud violations. Comey's counsels are expected to challenge the legality of Halligan's appointment to her position.

The newly appointed U.S. attorney did not speak during the nearly one-hour arraignment hearing, instead delegating the process to two prosecutors, Nathaniel Lemons and Gabriel J. Diaz, who were pulled from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina to assist in the case.

Comey arrived early at his seat inside the courtroom on the sixth floor of the courthouse and was supported by members of his family, including his daughter, Maurene Comey, who was fired from her post as a top prosecutor in the Southern District of New York earlier this year. 

When asked by the judge if the former director understood the charges against him, he responded, “I do, your honor. Thank you very much.”

Comey welcomed a trial in his statement following the Sept. 25 indictment, though his attorney Fitzgerald signaled they may attempt to avoid one altogether. He was released on his own recognizance and departed the federal courthouse through a secured exit, while his family exited through the main courthouse entrance.

The grand jury issued charges against Comey last month relating to alleged false statements and obstruction that occurred five years ago on Sept. 30, 2020, when the former director allegedly deceived the Senate Judiciary Committee about whether he authorized another person “to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation” into former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) questioned Comey on whether he had ever authorized someone within the FBI to be an anonymous source to the media about the Trump-Russia investigation or the investigation into Clinton. Comey said he stood by his previous testimony from 2017 that he did not authorize a leak.

The indictment does not name the individual whom prosecutors say Comey authorized to leak information, nor does it specify which articles were involved. However, a 2018 report by the Justice Department's inspector general found that then–FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe had approved sharing details of the Clinton investigation with a Wall Street Journal reporter and later showed a “lack of candor” when Comey and other officials questioned him about the leak.

In a CNN interview last month, McCabe said he found it “unbelievable” that federal investigators had not contacted him regarding Comey's testimony. “All I can say is what I personally observed — I never saw Jim Comey authorize anyone to leak information,” he said.

During the 2017 congressional hearing, Comey admitted he had asked a Columbia Law School friend to relay information to a New York Times reporter about his conversations with then-President Trump early in his tenure. That friend — a former special government employee, professor, and advice liaison to Comey, Daniel Richman — later confirmed he was the intermediary but said the material he conveyed at Comey's request was not classified.

The introduction of classified documents to the narrow indictment will likely function to bolster the prosecution's belief that Comey's testimony to the Judiciary Committee was not forthright. But the judge warned that the introduction of these records should not allow the case to go “off track.”

COMEY MAKES HISTORY AS FIRST FORMER FBI DIRECTOR TO FACE ARRAIGNMENT

Nachmanoff, 57, oversaw the previous cases of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, associates of Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, and released them on $1 million bonds in 2019. In a more recent case, he declined to block the CIA from firing Terry Adirim, a Pentagon physician who was scrutinized by Trump allies over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate.

Both defense attorneys and prosecutors agreed that the eventual trial, set for the start of the new year, would only last approximately two days.

Former Rep. Katie Porter bit back at a reporter's question about whether she would need President Donald Trump's voters to win the California governor's race.

Porter is one of the top Democrats running in the race, and has been seen as the front-runner ever since former Vice President Kamala Harris decided she would not run.

A reporter from CBS Los Angeles asked Porter, as she had asked several other gubernatorial candidates, “What do you say to the 40% of CA voters who you'll need in order to win, who voted for Trump?”

She responded in a hushed tone, “How would I need them in order to win, ma'am?”

After the reporter asked her if she would win the 60% of people who did not vote for Trump, Porter said she believes she'll win those people. She also said she doesn't “intend” to run against another Democrat, which would further split the anti-Trump vote.

She then went into a back-and-forth with the reporter after touting her experience as a purple-district representative. Porter called the line of questioning “unnecessarily argumentative.”

The former California representative argued over the semantics of needing the Trump voters “to win” against what she would say to those voters.

“I'm happy to say that, it's the ‘do you need them to win' part I don't understand. I'm happy to answer the question as you have it written,” Porter said.

She then tried to walk out of the interview, claiming the reporter was asking too many follow-up questions. “Every other candidate has answered our follow-ups,” the journalist said.

“I don't care. I don't care … if every question you're gonna make up a follow-up question, then we're never gonna get there,” Porter said, trying to leave. “I don't want to have an unhappy experience with you,” she added, “and I don't want this all on camera.”

Porter's opponents pounced on her viral interview. Former California State Controller Betty T. Yee criticized Porter most directly.

“After watching the interview, it's clear—Katie Porter doesn't have the temperament to be Governor,” she said in a post on X. “As a candidate, I welcome the hard questions—the next governor must be accessible and transparent. No place for temper tantrums. No place for dodging the public's right to know.”

Other candidates include former Los Angeles Mayor Democrat Antonio Villaraigosa and Republican Steve Hilton.

Porter has been out of politics since leaving her office representing California's 47th district in the House earlier this year. She entered the California gubernatorial race in March, aiming to succeed term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA).

The former Orange County representative has been accused of being abrasive in the past. Politico reported in 2023 that Porter staffers called her “rage-prone,” “racist,” and had “a tendency to disparage staffers.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem warned she would send “four times” the number of federal officers to Portland, Oregon, if they don't receive more security assistance.

Noem made the comments in an interview on Fox News on Tuesday night.

“What I told him is that if he did not follow through on some of these security measures for our officers, we were going to cover him up with more federal resources and that we were going to send four times the amount of federal officers here so that the people of Portland could have some safety, they could have some security,” she said, referencing her meeting with Portland Mayor Keith Wilson.

He's going to have blood on his hands because he sat around and thought too long, because he's too scared of the political ramifications of making a big decision to keep his city safe."" @Sec_Noem… pic.twitter.com/OobidQC8ku

She said her meeting with Wilson went poorly, and he did not commit to providing any of her security demands. According to Noem, Wilson said he would get back to her on Wednesday.

Noem said she requested more security at Portland's ICE facility, a larger buffer zone between officers and protesters, and for them to open up the streets so the “anarchists” don't “run this city anymore.”

Noem visited a Portland ICE facility on Tuesday, watching protesters shout to her from below. The facility has seen law enforcement deploy tear gas and smoke to disperse large crowds of protesters.

The Trump administration has sought a crackdown on Portland crime, ordering the National Guard to be deployed to the city. For now, a court has blocked the deployment twice, and it is currently in legal limbo.

Trump said on Sunday that Portland is “burning down to the ground.”

Oregon has resisted the administration's demands for the National Guard. Gov. Tina Kotek (D-OR) said there is no insurrection in the state.

“I requested that Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents obey Oregon laws when they engage in federal operations,” the governor added. “I reiterated that I continue to be focused on doing whatever I can to protect Oregonians from military intervention or harmful federal law enforcement tactics. Oregon is united against military policing in our communities.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Democrats' blue-state failures are becoming a political problem","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/3821729/democrats-blue-state-failures-political-problem/","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Republicans have Democrats nationwide on the ropes over local governing failures on issues such as crime, a vulnerability that could cost them at the ballot box if left unaddressed.

President Donald Trump has spent the past several months pushing the issue of state and local crime to the foreground of U.S. politics by either sending or threatening to send federalized troops to Democrat-led cities such as Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Memphis, Oakland, and Washington, D.C. His administration has highlighted failures by state leaders and painted their handling of public safety as abysmal.

Trump has called Baltimore a “hellhole” and Los Angeles a lawless “trash heap,” and he posted a parody image from Apocalypse Now featuring a ball of flames as helicopters zoom over Chicago, the nation's third-largest city. 

For 2028 presidential hopefuls, such as Govs. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), JB Pritzker (D-IL), and Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), how they handle characterizations of cities in their states carries outsize weight. Scrutiny over what are typically seen as state issues could not only tank their political aspirations but also hurt other Democrats. 

“Republicans are already laying out their playbook for 2026 and 2028: Turn every Democratic misstep into a national talking point,” Tom Letizia, a crisis manager and political consultant, told the Washington Examiner. “They'll point to crime in big cities, homelessness, high taxes, and everyday cost-of-living struggles as the ‘Democratic blueprint.' Then they'll hang those failures around the necks of governors like Newsom, Pritzker, and Whitmer before those candidates even get to define themselves.”

Letizia, who has managed and won every Las Vegas mayoral race for the past 25 years, called it “discipline strategy.” 

“Frame the midterms and the 2028 presidential race not as a choice of vision but as a referendum on Democratic governance,” he said. “And if Democrats don't answer with results and a sharper message, Republicans will succeed in defining the narrative long before voters go to the polls.”

Last year, Trump made inroads in blue states like California, New York, and New Jersey by calling out crime. This stunned the Democratic Party because it struck a nerve with blue-state voters. Since then, Trump has made splashy speeches and taunted Newsom and Pritzker over crime in their states, forcing them to walk a fine line between pushing back and acknowledging constituents' concerns about public safety. 

“Donald Trump is driving an anti-crime agenda that has a clear narrative and purpose, which means it's far easier to communicate success and redirect failure,” Dustin Siggins, founder at Proven Media Solutions, told the Washington Examiner. “This stands in stark contrast to Democrats, who don't have clear policy prescriptions or voices representing those prescriptions. These realities will negatively impact Democrats until they have a unified message that can proactively drive successful outcomes, because running solely on an ‘anti-Trump' platform won't win voters' trust.”

Republicans have been perfecting the strategy of turning local governing failures into national ones that Democrats have to defend. Every time a state-level Democratic misstep happens, it is turned into a national crisis and multiplied by Republican coordination, said strategist Steve Morris, founder and CEO of NEWMEDIA.COM. 

“The thing about this coordinated state-level game that Republicans are playing is that it sweeps Democratic opposition along with it,” Morris told the Washington Examiner. “It's not just a bad week for any particular governor. It's a bad week for all Democrats because it happened under Democratic governance.”

Like Morris, Letizia predicted the GOP would continue to hammer Democrats by nationalizing local missteps, pushing cultural wedge issues, and viewing the economy through the lens of grocery bills, housing costs, and gas prices. 

“They'll brand Democrats as incompetent and out of touch while casting themselves as the party of basic competence and accountability,” he said.

Jeff Le, managing principal at 100 Mile Strategies, cautioned that Trump's strategy on crime is not without risk. He told the Washington Examiner that Democratic governors with reported presidential aspirations could “seize on the perceived overreach while also sweeping away persistent failings in reducing homelessness and combating high costs of living.” 

Newsom, whose national profile has risen significantly since Trump took office, has used his social media reach to push back on the president's claims that blue states are dangerous. He has accused Trump of exaggerating statistics and manipulating the situation to stoke fear for political gain. 

Newsom amplified his complaints on X and drew a comparison between California's homicide rate and that of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. All those states have Republican governors and homicide rates much higher than California's. 

NEWSOM COMPARES CALIFORNIA'S HOMICIDE RATE TO RED STATES: DOES HE HAVE A POINT?

“If the president is sincere about the issue of crime and violence, there's no question in my mind that he'll likely be sending the troops into Louisiana and Mississippi,” Newsom said. 

Pritzker has also been trying to change the narrative on crime. The Democratic billionaire accused Trump of deploying National Guard troops to cities to scare voters and ensure Republicans walk away with wins in next year's elections. Pritzker condemned a plan to send the National Guard to Chicago as “unprecedented, unwarranted, illegal, unconstitutional, and un-American.” 

Republicans have also taken Democrats to task over balancing the budget, arguing if they can't make it work in their home states, they shouldn't be allowed to level up. 

When Newsom released his revised budget proposal in May, it came with a new $12 billion shortfall. He was heavily criticized for his handling of the state's finances and faulted for spending policies and “fiscal mismanagement.” Newsom blamed the shortfall on Trump's tariffs and suggested California, the world's fourth-largest economy, had suffered unjustly. 

“We don't live in Plato's Republic,” Newsom said. “California is under assault. The United States of America, in many respects, is under assault because we have a president that's been reckless in terms of assaulting those growth engines. Best to call this a Trump Slump.”

Can more Democrats fight back and blunt Republican efforts to portray them as too incompetent to lead the nation? Political strategist Kaivan Shroff thinks more Democrats should follow Newsom and Pritkzer and fight back. He added that while Republicans have “mastered the art of honing in on one small example and making it a national referendum,” opportunities still exist for Democrats to turn the tables.  

“The truth is, voters don't just punish failure — they reward solutions,” he told the Washington Examiner. “So, just as there is the risk of a negative example, there is opportunity in the positive one. Democrats who show up locally with real fixes on crime, housing, and budgets can turn GOP attack ads into proof of Democratic leadership.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

NOEM: ‘I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH … A BUNCH OF PANSIES': The dueling realities of the Trump administration and state and local officials about crime in blue states were on vivid display Tuesday, as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited “war-ravaged” Portland, while Attorney General Pam Bondi rebuked Democratic senators in congressional testimony over the murder rate in Chicago.

Noem arrived in Portland to oversee illegal immigration enforcement operations and was seen in social media posts peering down from the rooftop of an ICE facility at a small group of protesters, including a man in a chicken suit. “Our goal is that people would peacefully protest, but that we would still be able to enforce the law.”

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek (D) said she only learned of Noem's visit through “unofficial channels” and reached out to request a meeting with her. “We talked about safety. We talked about safely allowing folks to peacefully protest. No one in Oregon is interested in seeing military policing on our streets when people are protesting peacefully,” Kotek said on CNN. “I also brought up the issue of the use of tear gas. We have some very strict laws in Oregon about how we interact with protesters and people who are lawfully demonstrating.”

“So, it was a straightforward conversation,” Kotek said. “I'm glad she is here on the ground to assess the situation, because she needs to see what the reality is here.”

Later, Noem went on Fox to rail against Portland's leadership, including the city's mayor, Keith Wilson. “What I told him is that if he did not follow through on some of these security measures for our officers, we were going to cover him up with more federal resources and that we were going to send four times the amount of federal officers here so that the people of Portland could have some safety,” Noem told Fox News host Jesse Watters. 

“What is shocking to me about these leftist politicians is just how they ignore the people who elected them, jeopardize their safety, and continue to disrespect our law enforcement officers,” she said. “So one of the things I've been dealing with all day here in Portland is a bunch of pansies that are elected into political office who won't make a decision to keep their citizens safe.”

NOEM WARNS PORTLAND MAYOR SHE'LL FLOOD CITY WITH FEDS IF SECURITY DEMANDS GO UNMET

CHICAGO DUE IN COURT: Following this weekend's temporary restraining order from a federal judge blocking troops from being sent to Portland, Oregon, the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois have a court date tomorrow in Chicago. U.S. District Judge April Perry will hear arguments in a lawsuit aimed at halting the dispatch of Texas National Guard troops to Chicago against the wishes of state and local officials.

The vanguard of the Texas troops have already arrived, and pictures posted on social media showed the troops mustering outside the city, including a photo of some well-fed soldiers dubbed by a social media wag “Meal Team 6.”

In her combative appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday, Attorney General Pam Bondi refused to answer questions about the justification for sending hundreds of troops to Illinois and Oregon. “Why do you want to keep this secret? So the American people don't know of the rationale behind the deployment of National Guard troops in my state,” asked Sen. Richard Durbin (D-IL), the committee's ranking member.

“I wish you loved Chicago as much as you hate President Trump. And currently, the National Guard is on the way to Chicago. If you're not going to protect your citizens, President Trump will,” Bondi said, prompting Durbin to complain that Bondi was refusing to answer “a legitimate question.”

“That's the kind of testimony you expect from this administration,” Durbin said. “A simple question, as to whether or not they had a legal rationale for deploying National Guard troops, becomes grounds for personal attack.”

TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD STAGE OUTSIDE CHICAGO AS PART OF TRUMP DEPLOYMENT

TRUMP: ‘IF THE GOVERNOR CAN'T DO THE JOB, WE'LL DO THE JOB': President Donald Trump continues to make no-so-veiled threats to invoke the Insurrection Act, which would allow the use of active-duty military in a law enforcement role, if courts rule against his mobilization of National Guard troops.

“It's been invoked before, as you know,” Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. “If you look at Chicago, Chicago's a great city where there's a lot of crime, and if the governor can't do the job, we'll do the job.”

“We have cities where there's tremendous crime, and Chicago's one of them. And if the governor can't straighten it out, we'll straighten it out,” Trump said. Later, Trump added that “Democrats are like insurrectionists, OK? They're so bad for our country.”

On his Truth Social account, Trump posted, without comment, a photo of a 1963 memo from then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy justifying federalizing 17,000 troops from the Alabama National Guard to allow black students to attend nine previously all-white schools in Birmingham, Alabama. Kennedy cited “unlawful obstructions of the authority of the United States” as the basis for “calling into federal service the militia of any state,” which includes placing National Guard troops on active duty service.

That is precisely the legal argument the Trump administration is making in court, and will likely use in an appeal to the Supreme Court, if necessary.

HAPPENING TODAY: SHUTDOWN DAY 8: The shutdown of the federal government over demands by Democrats for preservation of healthcare subsidies for millions of Americans is in its second week, with no end in sight.

There are some nascent behind-the-scenes discussions of some kind of compromise on healthcare premiums, which are expected to double for many people who buy their coverage on the Obamacare exchanges, with a handful of Republicans suggesting that something should be done.

But publicly, Republicans and President Trump are hanging tough, with Trump renewing his threat to permanently eliminate federal jobs, and suggesting furloughed workers may not get back pay. 

“You know Russell Vought. He's a serious person, very serious person. He's sitting there and he's getting ready to cut things,” Trump said. “We have a lot of things that we're going to eliminate and permanently eliminate.”

“I'll be able to tell you that in four or five days if this keeps going on. If this keeps going on, it'll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back,” he said. “We'll be announcing it pretty soon.”

NO BACK PAY? Despite a law that Trump signed during his first term that guarantees federal workers will get full back pay after a government shutdown ends, Trump's Office of Management and Budget circulated a draft memo this week suggesting that such payments would not be automatic for workers who stayed home because they were deemed nonessential.

Asked about it yesterday, Trump at first indicated that it was, in fact, under consideration. “I would say it depends on who we're talking about,” he said. “I can tell you this, the Democrats have put a lot of people in great risk and jeopardy, but it really depends on who you're talking about. But for the most part, we're going to take care of our people. There are some people that really don't deserve to be taken care of, and we'll take care of them in a different way.”

But later in the Oval Office session, he seemed to backtrack when reminded of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act. “I follow the law and what the law says is correct, and I follow the law.”

“Muhammad ‘Abd-al-Wahhab al-Ahmad was a member of Ansar al-Islam, an Al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist group,” CENTCOM said in a news release. No other details were released about the strike, which was carried out on Oct. 2.

“U.S. forces in the Middle East remain postured to disrupt and defeat efforts by terrorists to plan, organize, and conduct attacks,” said Adm. Brad Cooper, CENTCOM commander. “We will continue to defend our homeland, warfighters, allies, and partners throughout the region and beyond.”

A BINDER FULL OF BARBS: Attorney General Pam Bondi's appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday was one for the books. Bondi's strategy became clear from her opening comments: admit nothing, deflect criticism, and counterattack. Despite the constitutional duty of the committee to exercise oversight over the Justice Department, Bondi clearly felt no obligation to answer even the simplest questions posed by the Democrats.

In front of her was a binder with folders, including barbed retorts, akin to mean tweets, she could give to individual senators instead of actually responding to their questions.

“And I'm not going to be lectured to you about integrity by someone who lied about being in the military just to be elected as senator,” Bondi said to Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).

“​​If you worked for me, you would have been fired  because you were censured by Congress for lying,” she said to Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA).

“Senator, I don't think a lot of people like that you were out protesting with Antifa,” she said to Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI).

The frustration of the Democrats was palpable. “I think it's valuable that the American people get a sense of what you refuse to answer today,” said Schiff at the end of his attempt to cross-examine Bond.

“You were asked, whether you consulted with career ethics lawyers, as you promised you would do during your nomination hearing, when you approved the President receiving a $400 million gift from the Qataris, you refused to answer that question.”

“You were asked, who or what role you may have played or who played the role in asking that Trump's name be flagged in any of the Epstein documents gathered by the FBI. You refused to answer that question.” 

“You were asked, whether Homan kept the $50,000 bribe money. You refused to answer that question.”

“You were asked, did career prosecutors find insufficient evidence to charge James Comey? You refused to answer that question.”

“You were asked, how were military strikes on these boats in the Caribbean legal? And you refuse to even answer that question.”

“You were asked by my California colleague whether you believe government officials, like immigration officials, have to abide by court orders. You wouldn't even answer that question.”

Bondi's response: “What about the fires in California, do you care about that, Sen. Schiff? Leadership. Are the riots in L.A. serious? I think you owe the President an apology for your entire career, frankly. Clearly, you're a failed lawyer because you don't understand when someone can and cannot answer a question.”

The self-help mantra that's helping young people navigate their economic anxiety.

TikTokers love a challenge, especially if it involves some sort of self-imposed hibernation period that will transform their lives and pay off in physical or financial success.

Currently, my feed is full of young people participating in “The Great Lock-In,” a three-month challenge that began in September and lasts through the end of the year. The goal is that participants enter January having already completed a set of goals and established certain habits, a jumpstart on “New Year, New Me.”

“Locking in” has become its own aesthetic. Videos under the #thegreatlockin and #lockingin hashtags feature Zoomers in sterile apartments wearing neutral workout clothes. They're usually fixing healthy meals, walking on treadmills, and making lists in journals, complete with timestamps for each activity. There are inspirational slideshows set to rap songs. Others feature soundbites from iconic NBA players, like Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan.

“It's all about programming your mind to go hard for a sprint of time,” says influencer Tatiana Forbes in a TikTok video. “It's meant to be this time where you put forth immense effort in some area of your life.”

It's curious that locking in is a formal challenge. With origins in football and video-game culture, the term itself describes a period of hyperfocus in order to get stuff done. Online, locking in has become the ultimate Gen Z mantra. People post about locking in at the gym, locking in at work, locking in to finish books, locking in to stay hydrated, and locking in to simply get through the day.

Of course, this collective desire for productivity and personal growth isn't a new phenomenon. If Gen Z seems obsessed with assigning themselves a list of goals every few months, it's probably because they witnessed or at least felt the residual effects of millennial hustle culture. Whereas millennials were reacting to their own generation's misfortune — namely, the Great Recession — Zoomers are trying to shake off the brain rot of digital living in the pandemic and navigate the economic uncertainty brought on by artificial intelligence and the second Trump administration.

So what exactly is Gen Z locking in for, and how does the mantra manifest in their lives beyond TikTok? Is locking in an act of resistance, a coping mechanism, or just a performance? The answer is a bit of everything.

There are some obvious reasons why young people are craving focus. As much as locking in is about completing tasks, for some, it also means eliminating distractions. Tips for locking in on social media consistently include limiting screen time before bed. Some guidance is more extreme, encouraging users to “lock in and disappear” from social media with the expectation that they'll eventually return as their improved self.

Even if the time away from their phones is temporary, many young people are aspiring to digital minimalism, a term popularized by Georgetown University professor and author Cal Newport. There's now a popular subreddit devoted to promoting digital minimalism as a lifestyle, a way to recharge and live more intentionally.

Locking in isn't that different from another concept coined by Newport: deep work. And it's seemingly just the Gen Z version of a millennial-era idea. This, according to Newport, refers to “the act of focusing without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.” Newport says that, according to young people he's talked to, locking in is “specifically a reaction to smartphones” and feeling like they're “under the spell of digital attention purveyors.”

“It would be impossible for them to avoid noticing the degree to which these devices are taking them away from essentially every meaningful activity and manipulating their psychology,” Newport told me.

Recent studies reveal as much. Some 83 percent of Gen Z respondents said they have an unhealthy relationship with their phone, compared to 74 percent for other generations, according to the 2024 BePresent Digital Wellness Report. Similarly, 72 percent of Gen Z members surveyed in a 2025 study by Harmony Healthcare IT said that their mental health would improve if apps were “less addictive.” This year's Pinterest Summer Trend Report found that the searches on the platform for “digital detox vision board” were trending up by 273 percent.

Still, the act of being active, for many, necessitates posting on TikTok or Instagram, which you might say is antithetical to the whole distraction-free concept of locking in. The locked-in lifestyle falls into a broader category of popular aspirational content online that, following the Covid-19 pandemic, revolves mainly around wellness and fitness. There's social-media capital in looking like someone who is locked in.

So what is locking in actually inspiring young people to do with their lives? You'd think the point of getting off your phone would be to engage in human connection. But Gen Z has built a reputation for being the loneliest generation, with higher isolation rates than millennials and Gen X-ers, due in part to pandemic lockdowns and heavier reliance on social media. An uncertain economy is also keeping Gen Z stuck in a permanent cocoon.

Locking in defies previous stereotypes we've held about Gen Z and its relationship to work. Gen Z is far from lazy — rather, studies have found that Gen Z has a different perspective on their professional lives than what grind culture taught millennials. Zoomers are more focused on creating work–life balance than climbing the corporate ladder, with only 6 percent saying that attaining a leadership position is a primary career goal, according to a 2025 Deloitte survey. A LinkedIn study also found that Gen Z was the most likely generation to reject jobs that don't offer flexible work policies. But just because Gen Z isn't as eager to devote themselves to a company doesn't mean they aren't busy.

“Gen Z isn't more obsessed with productivity, but rather, obsessed with productivity in a different context,” says Kate Lindsay, co-founder of the newsletter Embedded and co-host of the podcast ICYMI. “Anecdotally, millennials enjoy being productive in relation to their career, whereas Gen Z is more focused on productivity as self-improvement — ‘locking in,' ‘glowing up,' etc.”

Lindsay sees locking in as a response to our resting state becoming “very passive.” “We're scrolling, we're binging, we're bed-rotting,” she said. “Locking in is a way of kick-starting ourselves out of that and into a state that's more active.”

This focus on self-improvement can be explained by a labor market that has become highly competitive for young people following the Covid-19 pandemic, including a declining number of entry-level jobs due to AI. A Bank of America Institute report found that over 13 percent of unemployed Americans this past July were “new entrants” or those without prior work experience, a group that “skews toward Gen Z.”

While “locking in” can appear like a shallow venture to some, it allows people to “feel in control of their lives in an economy that seemingly offers little security,” according to freelance writer and editor Chiara Wilkinson, who covered “The Great Lock In” in British Vogue.

“Many of the promises we were sold in the traditional narrative of growing up now seem out of reach for the vast majority of the population,” Wilkinson told me. “Factors like crippling student debt, rising house prices, inflation, and bleak graduate prospects — especially as AI threatens entry-level jobs — have left many Gen Z-ers unsatisfied with the current state of play.”

In its most radical interpretation, locking in seems like a way to fight back against tech companies that have shortened our attention spans and degraded our social lives. However, in its most common use, the locking-in trend shows Gen Z pursuing an endless cycle of self-improvement that doesn't offer a fix to any of their generation's problems.

You have to wonder: With all these rule-based attempts to improve their lives, is Gen Z factoring in fun?

“So much of Gen Z's worldview is shaped by economic anxiety, and many can feel uneasy when they're not being productive,” Wilkinson says. “The current economic structures might make ‘having fun' difficult. Even ‘free' fun, like going for a walk, or hanging at a mate's house, comes with a degree of trade-off.”

For now, it seems like “locking in” is simply a way to get by, not necessarily a way to get better. We'll know that life for Gen Z has finally improved when they don't have to try as hard.

Reckoning with Jane Austen and empire on her 250th anniversary.

There's a bizarrely opaque, oddly modern question hovering over the legacy of Jane Austen. And despite centuries of debate, scholars still haven't been able to figure out how to answer it.

Jane Austen lived under the rule of a slave-trading empire. What did she think about that? And if we could figure out what someone so smart and morally conscious thought about life in a colonizing power, what would that tell us about how ordinary people make their peace with living with an atrocity?

One scene in particular is key to this debate. It comes in Austen's third published novel, 1814's Mansfield Park. Today, Mansfield Park is one of Austen's least-loved books. Nonetheless, it is her only book to feature characters discussing slavery without using it as a metaphor for something else — and, upon a close reading, the whole book is riddled with references to the slave trade and the slave economy.

The scene in question features the novel's heroine, poor and downtrodden Fanny Price, talking with her cousin and love interest Edmund Bertram about his father, stern Sir Thomas Bertram.

Culture reflects society. Get our best explainers on everything from money to entertainment to what everyone is talking about online.

Fanny is a little afraid of Sir Thomas, who took her into his lavish country home when she was 10 years old as an act of charity. Fanny is now in her late teens, and both Sir Thomas and Edmund know her to be the most upright and moral member of their household — but Sir Thomas is so forbidding, and Fanny so convinced of her social inferiority to her wealthy relations, that she rarely speaks to him of her own volition.

The scene begins with Edmund telling Fanny she should talk to Sir Thomas more. Then Fanny, out of apparently nowhere, starts talking about slavery: “[...]Did not you hear me ask him about the slave-trade last night?”

“I did — and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others. It would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther.”

“And I longed to do it — but there was such a dead silence! And while my cousins were sitting by without speaking a word, or seeming at all interested in the subject, I did not like — I thought it would appear as if I wanted to set myself off at their expense, by shewing a curiosity and pleasure in his information which he must wish his own daughters to feel.”

What, literary critics have demanded, is that scene doing in Mansfield Park? Does it have anything to do with why Mansfield Park is such a strange, sad, moralizing novel? What do we make of that “dead silence” that answered Fanny's question? Is this how normal people talked about slavery at the time? Is it how Austen talked about slavery? What did she think of it? What did other people think of it? Most urgently of all: What horrible things are we treating as polite dinner table conversation without realizing it?

I've been thinking a lot about Jane Austen and Mansfield Park over the last few weeks, as President Donald Trump announced his intention to excise from the Smithsonian museums all references to slavery that he finds objectionable, and as conservatives promote educational materials that minimize the effects of slavery on America's history.

Some scholars argue that Mansfield Park is Austen's apologia for slavery. The first time I came across that reading, in college, I was depressed by it, in the same way that I was depressed when I learned about the Founding Fathers being slave owners.

Austen has such a clear, precise moral vision: You can hear it ticking through her fiction like clockwork. How awful, I thought, if someone who thought so carefully about what was ethical and what was pleasurable was able to talk herself into internalizing the logic of empire to the point that it warped the very machinery of her novels. What a disappointment. I had the instinct to try to forget Mansfield Park even existed, to bury it away, like the Trump administration demanding the Smithsonian stop talking about slavery so much. It had never been my favorite of Austen's books, anyway.

But literary scholars aren't looking for references to slavery in Mansfield Park to try to prove that it is a sinful book that must be forgotten. They are looking for those references to try to figure out how the citizens of the British Empire thought about the terrible acts that were committed in their name, the acts that brought them so much wealth and power. Looking at those thought processes with clear eyes helps us understand how the human mind is capable of deceiving itself — and what we might be deceiving ourselves about too, here at the other end of history.

To modern readers, Mansfield Park is a strange book in Austen's beloved oeuvre. Among its more fashionable sisters — sparkling Pride and Prejudice, melancholy Persuasion, clever Emma, bitchy Northanger Abbey, and sweet Sense and Sensibility — Mansfield Park is the Mary Bennet of the crowd. It reads as lugubrious, scolding, and far too moralistic to be any fun.

While Mansfield Park has gone through periods of approbation — the Austen scholar Devoney Looser notes that by the 1830s, male readers were particularly fond of it — it seems to have puzzled its first audience, too. The rest of Austen's six novels were all covered by contemporary literary periodicals as soon as they were published, but Mansfield Park went six years without a single review. Austen's records showed she asked her family what they thought of it, and her mother said that Fanny was “insipid.”

In 1954, the literary critic Lionel Trilling spoke for many when he described Mansfield Park as the only novel of Austen's “in which the characteristic irony” could not be found. “Perhaps no other work of genius has ever spoken, or seemed to speak, so insistently for cautiousness and constraint, even for dullness,” he went on, adding, “Nobody, I believe, has ever found it possible to like the heroine of Mansfield Park.”

Fanny Price is indeed a tough pill to swallow. While Austen's other heroes are spirited, funny, and attractively willing to break with convention when it suits them, Cinderella-like Fanny Price is anxious, solemn, and aligns herself with conventional morality. Her moral goodness is, indeed, her only real strength. Physically she is so frail that she is overcome by gathering a basketful of roses, and emotionally she is so unwilling to stand up for herself that she spends her rare free time in a room kept frigidly cold, because she cannot bear to ask for a fire to be lit for her.

But Fanny, alone of all her wise and wealthy relations, is able to hold onto her moral courage even when it is inconvenient and unpleasant to do so. Her cousins are all seduced by the rich and charismatic Henry Crawford. So is the reader, who can recognize a bad boy ready to be redeemed by the love of a good woman as soon as he strides onto the page, quoting Shakespeare and talking about how he thinks he might be ready to give up his wickedness. Only Fanny looks at Henry, so anguished and so witty, and sees a cad.

In the end, Fanny is proven right to refuse Henry. He runs away with her married cousin, Maria. Fanny, in turn, marries the upright Edmund, the only Bertram who was ever kind to her, and ultimately inherits Mansfield Park and becomes its mistress. We may find it hard to love Fanny, but Austen directs us to notice that she is, in the end, correct, and rewarded for her correctness, too. Even if Edmund is much less charming and way more priggish than Henry.

Throughout the novel, the wealth of Mansfield Park stands as the redemptive factor that will save Fanny Price: luxurious, beautiful wealth, which takes her out of the wretched squalor of her parents' house and into the withholding ease of the estate. And where does this wealth come from? It comes from Sir Thomas Bertram's holdings in Antigua — which is to say, it comes from a sugar plantation worked by enslaved people.

The first critic to truly grapple with the problem of Sir Thomas's slave holdings was the great postcolonialist critic Edward Said, in his classic 1994 essay “Jane Austen and Empire.” Said argued that because Austen lived in a slave-holding colonizing state, the ideology of empire inflected her worldview and fiction in ways that felt so natural as to slide under not only her notice but the notice of her readers.

In Mansfield Park, the Bertrams bring their niece Fanny to live with them partially out of a genuine desire to help the impoverished relative, and partially out of convenience. A girl like Fanny, they feel, could be a help around the house. In 1994, Said argued that the worldview that would import a poor relation into a person's country estate is the same worldview that could lead a nation to export their agricultural work to a colony worked by enslaved people.

“I think Austen sees what Fanny does as a domestic or small-scale movement in space that corresponds to the larger, more openly colonial movements of Sir Thomas, her mentor, the man whose estate she inherits,” Said wrote. “The two movements depend on each other.”

This was one of the essays in which Said essentially invented postcolonialist literary criticism, or the idea of reading literature with a focus on the effects of colonialism. It was hugely influential and is still taught in colleges. A central part of his argument was that slavery formed a sort of lacuna in Austen's tale, a pointedly ignored hole that spoke to a shameful guilt.

“All the evidence says that even the most routine aspects of holding slaves on a West Indian sugar plantation were cruel stuff. And everything we know about Austen and her values is at odds with the cruelty of slavery,” Said wrote. He thought the key to understanding how Austen made her peace with the contradiction lay in that famous scene where Fanny asks about the slave trade, and is met with “such a dead silence” — as though, Said wrote, “one world could not be connected with the other since there simply is no common language for both.”

For Said, reading Mansfield Park while paying special attention to the source of Sir Thomas's wealth was a radical attack of redirecting one's attention, of refusing to cover up an inconvenient truth, just as Fanny does when she refuses Henry Crawford.

In the time since Said's essay, however, scholars have begun to make the case that Austen wasn't being quite so silent on the problem of slavery as she appears to contemporary readers.

When Austen published Mansfield Park in 1814, slavery was central to the British economy. It was a politically charged topic, and the newly enshrined aristocrat who owes their fortune to the slave trade was a known type. As ever is the case with new money, established gentry tended to sneer at them as coarse, unrefined, and — in this case, truthfully — inextricably intertwined with a moral atrocity.

Some scholars read the Bertram family as Austen parodying this prominent new type. Lady Bertram's indolent carelessness, the relaxed morals of her daughters, their casual dependence on the imported labor of their ill-treated cousin: All this is a send-up of the slave-owning aristocratic class. Toward the end of the book, we even learn that the adulterous Maria Bertram has taken over a house previously owned by the Lascelleses, a prominent family of slave plantation owners of the same type Austen may have been parodying with the Bertrams.

The reference becomes more pointed with the repeated invocation of names associated with the slave trade and with abolition. Mansfield Park itself shares a name with William Murray, first earl of Mansfield, an aristocratic judge with a mixed-race adopted daughter. Lord Mansfield famously ruled in 1772 that it was illegal to transport a slave out of England and Wales against his or her will, a landmark decision that paved the way for the abolition of the slave trade.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Norris, Fanny's most miserly and wicked aunt, shares a name with the infamous slave trader Robert Norris, a man whose venal sadism made him the villain in a book of history Austen said in her letters she read and admired.

Throughout the novel, Sir Thomas journeys back and forth between Mansfield Park and his holdings in Antigua, where he must set right some never-specified trouble that apparently involves his slaves.

In her recent book Wild for Austen, Looser sums up the debate: “To some readers, the fact that Sir Thomas isn't explicitly damned for that quest, by any character or the narrator, suggests Austen must be pro-slavery. Others conclude the opposite: that the sordid, selfish doings of powerful white people at Mansfield Park…are meant to make readers connect these characters' deep flaws to their ill-begotten colonial wealth. As is characteristic of her fiction, Austen raises these difficult moral and political questions, then doesn't tell her readers what to do or think. It's bewildering by design.”

Austen left behind no clear account of her feelings about slavery in her surviving papers. But Austen was a very moral writer, and even Said thought that it was unlikely that she was in favor of slavery.

In Wild for Austen, Looser provides a fair amount of historical context that suggests Austen was probably in favor of abolition of the slave trade. Austen wrote in a letter that she had just finished a book by an abolitionist historian and found herself “in love” with the author. Three of her brothers were active abolitionist activists after her death, implying the Austens had a family history of anti-slavery thought. Further, as Fuller points out, women of Austen's education and social class at the time were overwhelmingly likely to be abolitionists, in the same way that highly educated young women today are overwhelmingly likely to be liberal.

But if Austen was against slavery, why is it so hard to tell that from Mansfield Park?

One prominent theory, recently espoused by the author Lauren Groff in the New York Times, is that Austen wrote Mansfield Park with encoded anti-slavery messages, the better to foil censorious readers. Groff quotes the literary critic Helena Kelly, author of the 2017 book Jane Austen the Secret Radical, who argues that in the early 19th century, Austen was writing under what we should understand today as a totalitarian state.

To that end, Kelly approaches Austen's novels with the spirit of an amateur detective with a decoder ring. She makes much of the appearance of an apricot tree of the Moor Park variety (“Is it just coincidence that it's the same word Shakespeare uses to describe the ethnicity of black Africans and that ‘Moor Park' echoes ‘Mansfield Park'?”), and she argues that when Fanny Price hangs a cross pendant on a gold chain gifted to her by the clergyman Edmund, Austen has provided us with a symbol that is “clear as daylight.” The chain, Kelly writes, represents slavery. The cross represents the Church of England.

“It's the Church of England that is tainted; the Church that taints,” she writes. The Church of England, like other wealthy institutions of the day, was heavily invested in slave plantations. As such, Kelly theorizes that Austen wrote Mansfield Park with the aim of castigating the Church for its hypocrisy.

Other scholars, meanwhile, note that Austen's contemporary peers wrote plenty of non-coded books that deal explicitly with slavery, and they don't appear to have been arrested or tortured by the government for their daring.

“Discussion of the West Indies and slavery was a cornerstone of even educational fiction in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century,” the scholar George E. Boulukos wrote in 2006. “Far from avoiding these issues so prominent in political and journalistic discourse, fiction considered them educational, topical, and even fashionable subjects.”

Another theory — and I must confess I find this one most convincing — is that Austen wrote from a perspective in favor of abolishing the slave trade, but for keeping slavery itself. This position was a surprisingly ubiquitous “moderate” stance in her era, a kind of attempt at finding reasonable common ground.

The idea was that while it was surely immoral to kidnap free-born people away from their homes and treat them as chattel, slavery itself was too entrenched in Britain's economy to be reasonably outlawed. In that case, as long as a slave owner was merciful and humane to the enslaved people he owned, and he wasn't enslaving anyone who wasn't born into the system, then he was fulfilling his moral duty.

This theory helps make sense of why, in that dinner scene, Fanny and Edmund both think the slave-owning Sir Thomas was happy to hear Fanny ask questions about the slave trade: They could probably all agree that the trade of free-born people was wrong. “We are left with the sense that Fanny sees Sir Thomas's trip to Antigua as fulfilling his moral obligation to ensure the humane treatment of his slaves,” Boulukos wrote.

In this reading, Austen is neither a shamefully repressed apolitical slave apologist, as Said argued, nor a secret abolitionist radical, as Kelly suggested. Instead, she's a hypocritical centrist of a type who was all too common in her moment.

Ultimately, though, all this is theorizing. We don't really know either way. We probably never will.

It really is so tempting to simply reject Mansfield Park. I never particularly liked the novel, and I never liked prim, preaching Fanny Price either. If I could simply discard her as a symbol of empire, and Mansfield Park as a novel irrevocably damaged by its moment, I could have the rest of Austen and her undeniable genius to myself.

Annoyingly, that's the very trap that Mansfield Park warns us clearly against, in a way you don't need a PhD in 19th-century abolitionist discourse to parse.

Every single character in that book except for Fanny is willing to embrace charming Henry Crawford and his sister, witty Mary, despite all the red flags suggesting that they aren't overly bothered about other people's pain. It's almost as impossible to read Mansfield Park and not like the Crawfords, all their faults be damned, as Lionel Trilling said it was to read Mansfield Park and like dour, insipid Fanny.

Yet the second Fanny turns down Henry Crawford, the energy around her in the text seems to crackle. For the first time, there is something compelling about her, something that draws us in. When she tells Sir Thomas, through tears, that she would not be refusing Henry “if it were possible for me to do otherwise…but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make him happy, and that I should be miserable myself,” there seems to be an electric strength of character about her that no one else in this novel has, not even the Crawfords.

Part of the project of postcolonial literary criticism is to use old literature to understand how people who lived within morally depraved institutions thought about those institutions for themselves. Whatever Mansfield Park has to say about slavery, it answers that question very clearly. The awful message of Mansfield Park is that we mistake charm and intelligence for true moral fiber at our peril, and that people who are good when it is convenient for them to be so may not continue to do what is right when it interferes with their pleasure.

Supporting something awful when it is fully integrated into the economic and political system in which you live is very convenient. Choosing to work against it requires real strength of character. Plenty of charming, likable people throughout history have done that math and come out on the side of keeping dead silent about an atrocity.

So we don't know for sure, in the end, what Jane Austen really thought about slavery and empire. She chose her words too carefully for us to be able to tell. What we can see very clearly, nonetheless, is what she thought about doing something that you know to be wrong, because it's too difficult or inconvenient to do otherwise.

How Trump and his Supreme Court made a big problem even worse.

If someone illegally double parks in a one-way street and a cop walks by, the expectation is that they'd get fined. Similarly, you'd think that if a company that uses animals is caught mistreating them, they too would face some sort of legal repercussion. But for many businesses in the US, that's not what's happening.

This summer, an inspector with the US Department of Agriculture visited a dog breeder in Ohio where they found one of his dogs — a 4 1/2-year-old female Maltipoo — to be in bad shape. Several of her teeth were missing, she had gum recession, and when the inspector lightly pressed on some of the teeth she still did have, they moved. The breeder was issued a warning, which has no real consequences.

That was also the case when, three years prior, a USDA inspector who visited Alpha Genesis — a company that breeds and experiments on primates — learned that two of the company's animals died after some of their digits (fingers and toes) became entrapped in a structure inside their cage. Another primate died after being placed in the wrong cage and attacked by another animal.

These incidents represent severe animal neglect and mismanagement — and alleged violations of the Animal Welfare Act. According to a new, exclusive analysis by the nonprofit Animal Welfare Institute (AWI), they're part of a larger trend over the last five years of the USDA increasingly issuing warnings over actual enforcement actions, like fines.

“USDA is continuously looking for opportunities to improve regulatory compliance and believes that regulatory correspondence, such as an Official Warning, can be a useful tool to encourage compliance and deter future noncompliance,” a USDA spokesperson wrote in an email to Vox.

Passed in 1966, the Animal Welfare Act sets minimum standards, such as food, water, housing, and veterinary care for over a million animals used by around 17,500 businesses, which are subject to annual USDA inspections to ensure compliance with the law.

The problem is that the act is rife with loopholes. It excludes the animals abused in the greatest numbers: those farmed for meat, milk, and eggs, who now number over 10 billion each year. The legislation does cover animals used in laboratory experiments, but excludes mice, rats, fish, and birds — the species who make up the vast majority of animals used in research.

Sign up here to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

In other words, the bill covers less than 0.01 percent of animals exploited by US businesses.

The animals who are covered can be, and often are, still treated terribly, like in puppy mills, where dogs are treated more like breeding machines than man's best friend; in zoos, where the mental well-being of many wild animals is severely damaged by captivity; and in research laboratories, where animals are subjected to painful experiments.

It stands to reason that if a business is found in violation — especially repeatedly — it would receive a hefty fine or worse, like a license suspension, animal confiscation, or criminal charge. But as AWI's new analysis has revealed, the USDA's enforcement has only gotten weaker in recent years.

What gives?

Part of the problem is that the USDA is severely understaffed; over the last few years, the agency has lost one-third of its inspectors while the number of businesses it needs to inspect has doubled.

But the root of the problem is that it often lets violators off easy: The department has long been criticized by both animal advocates and the US Office of Inspector General (OIG) — a government oversight agency — for terribly weak enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act.

Stretching back to the early 1990s, the OIG has documented the USDA consistently failing to hold repeat violators accountable, along with significantly reducing fines (in the early 2000s, fines were reduced by an average of 86 percent). The resultant fines are so small — thousands of dollars instead of tens of thousands; or tens of thousands of dollars instead of hundreds of thousands — that many violators see them “as a normal cost of business, rather than a deterrent for violating the law,” according to an OIG report.

But according to AWI's analysis, the Supreme Court and the Trump administration bear some of the blame for enforcement getting worse in recent years.

In June 2024, the Supreme Court ruled in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy that the SEC violated the Seventh Amendment — the right to a jury trial — when an SEC judge fined a hedge fund manager for allegedly defrauding investors. The decision essentially stripped the agency of its power to impose certain fines.

It also seems to have had a chilling effect on other agencies, including the USDA.

In the 14 months after the Jarkesy decision, the USDA issued just five fines compared to 63 fines in the 14 months before it. And of these five, only one was issued during President Donald Trump's second term, suggesting the new administration is going easier on businesses that allegedly violate the Animal Welfare Act, a problem also observed in Trump's first term.

“Jarkesy has hamstrung us the most,” an anonymous USDA manager told Science magazine in August. “We have an inability to do anything, even when we see bad stuff.”

“The decision in Jarkesy v. SEC impacts all agencies that seek civil penalties before administrative law judges (ALJs),” a USDA spokesperson wrote. “USDA continues to assess its authorities in light of the decision.”

Mary Hollingsworth, director of Harvard Law School's Animal Law and Policy Clinic and a former Justice Department trial attorney, told me what's most needed to deter violations is stronger fines. For that to happen, the Animal Welfare Act needs to be amended to allow the Justice Department to take violators to federal court, where judges are “much more likely to impose a reasonable fine” than USDA judges, Hollingsworth said.

In the last Congress, a bill to do just that — among other Animal Welfare Act reforms — garnered 220 cosponsors, but didn't get put up for a vote. The current Congress is weighing a reintroduced version of the bill. Stronger fines are especially critical for holding research facilities accountable, since it's generally the only enforcement action the USDA can bring against them.

On the bright side, however, the Trump administration is at least — even if for the wrong reasons — trying to hack away at the core issue: reducing the number of animals used in experiments and moving toward non-animal methods.

AI-generated video slop is filling feeds. It's time to learn how we can tell if something is real.﻿

If your feed isn't already filled with AI-generated video slop, it's only a matter of time.

Meta and OpenAI will make sure of it. Meta recently announced its endless slop-feed Vibes, made up entirely of AI-generated content: cats, dogs, and blobs. And that's just in Mark Zuckerberg's initial video post about it.

OpenAI's new Sora app offers a different flavor of slop. Like TikTok, Sora has a For You page for vertically scrolling through content. But the scariest part of Sora is how real it looks. One feature, called Cameo, lets users make videos of themselves, their friends, and any public-facing profile that grants access. This means videos of Sam Altman hanging out with Charizard or grilling up Pikachu are making the rounds on social media. And, of course, Jake Paul videos are also starting to circulate.

It's just the beginning, and the technology is only getting better. To help navigate it, we spoke with Hayden Field, senior AI reporter at The Verge. Field and Today, Explained co-host Sean Rameswaram discuss why these tech giants are doubling down on AI video, what to do with it, and we even get fooled by one.

Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What is Mark Zuckerberg trying to do with Vibes?

That is the million-dollar question. These companies, especially Meta right now, really want to keep us consuming AI-generated content and they really want to keep us on the platform.

I think it's really just about Zuckerberg trying to make AI a bigger piece of the everyday person's life and routine, getting people more used to it and also putting a signpost in the ground saying, “Hey, look, this is where the technology is at right now. It's a lot better than it was when we saw Will Smith eating spaghetti.”

How did it get so much better so fast? Because yes, this is not Will Smith eating spaghetti. 

AI now trains itself a lot of the time. It can get better and train itself at getting better. One of the big things standing in their way is really just compute. And all these companies are building data centers, making new deals every day. They're really working on getting more compute, so that they can push the tech even more.

Let's talk about what OpenAI is doing. They just released something called Sora 2. What is Sora?

Sora is their new app and it's basically an endless scroll AI-generated video social media app. So you can think of it as an AI-generated TikTok in a way. But the craziest part, honestly, is that you can make videos of yourself and your friends too, if they give you permission. It's called a Cameo and you record your own face moving side to side. You record your voice speaking a sequence of numbers and then the technology can parody you doing any number of things that you want.

So that's kind of why it's so different than Meta's Vibes and why it feels different when you're scrolling through it. You're seeing videos of real people and they look real. I was scrolling through and seeing Sam Altman drinking a giant juice box or any number of other things. It looks like it's really Sam Altman or it looks like it's really Jake Paul.

How does one know whether what they're seeing is real or not in this era where it's getting harder to discern?

These tips I'm about to give you aren't foolproof, but they will help a bit. If you watch something long enough, you'll probably find one of the telltale signs that something's AI-generated.

“Taylor Swift, actually — some of her promo for her new album apparently had a Ferris wheel in the background and the spokes kind of blurred as it moved.”

One of them is inconsistent lighting. It's hard sometimes for AI to get the vibes of a place right. If there's a bunch of lamps — maybe it's really dark in one corner, maybe it doesn't have the realistic quality of sunlight — that could be something you could pick up on. Another thing is unnatural facial expressions that just don't seem quite right. Maybe someone's smiling too big or they're crying with their eyes too open. Another one is airbrushed skin, skin that looks too perfect. And then finally, background details that might disappear or morph as the video goes on. This is a big one.

Taylor Swift, actually — some of her promo for her new album apparently had a Ferris wheel in the background and the spokes kind of blurred as it moved.

Anything else out there that we should be looking for?I just wish we had more rules about this stuff and how it could be disclosed. For example, OpenAI does have a safeguard: Every video that you download from Sora has a watermark or at least most videos. Some pro users can download one without a watermark.

Oh, cool, so if you pay them money, you could lose the watermark. Very nice.

But the other thing is I've seen a bunch of YouTube tutorials saying, “Here's how to remove the Sora watermark.”

Do companies like OpenAI or Meta care if we can tell if this is real or not? Or is that exactly what they want?

They say they care. So I guess that's all we can say right now. But it's hard because by the very nature of technology like this, it's going to be misused. So you just have to see if you can stem that misuse as much as possible, which is what they're trying to do. But we're going to have to wait and see how successful they are at that. And right now, if history is any guide, I'm a little concerned.

Business Insider Edition 

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has declared an “economic emergency” as the ruling African National Congress (ANC) unveiled a sweeping 10-point plan to revive the country's faltering economy, even as labour tensions at Eskom and mounting financial woes within the ANC threaten to deepen instability.


        Speaking at the launch of the initiative, Ramaphosa announced the creation of an “Economic War Room” within the Presidency. This task force will coordinate government performance and track progress on job creation, state efficiency, and industrial growth.
    


“We are treating this as an emergency because it is one. The Economic War Room will ensure that government departments are held accountable, that delivery is tracked, and that South Africans see the impact of our actions,” Ramaphosa said.
    


        The announcement comes as South Africa faces persistent unemployment, sluggish economic growth, and ongoing power challenges. 
    


        The rand traded relatively stable on Tuesday at around R17.21 to the dollar, supported by a rise in foreign reserves to $67.9 billion, up from $65.9 billion in August, slightly higher than analysts' expectations.
    


        In a parallel development, South Africa's state-owned power utility, Eskom, is bracing for heated wage negotiations. 
    


        The utility's largest union is demanding a 15% pay increase, over four times the inflation rate, following Eskom's partial stabilisation of the national grid after years of rolling blackouts.
    


        Eskom spokesperson Daphne Mokwena declined to discuss specific wage demands, saying talks had not yet formally begun. 
    


        Analysts warn that the standoff could reignite tensions in the energy sector, potentially disrupting the fragile power recovery that has brought relief to businesses and households.
    


        Adding to the country's growing list of crises, the ANC itself faces a potential insolvency battle.
    


        Reports indicate that the party's bank accounts have been attached to settle debts amounting to $4.5 million, which threatens access to over $55 million in state and private funding ahead of next year's crucial local elections.
    


        Party insiders fear the financial blow could weaken the ANC's campaign capacity and deepen internal divisions.
    


        Meanwhile, lobby group AfriForum successfully obtained a temporary court order halting Eskom's $2.8 billion settlement with the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa), calling the deal “unlawful and lacking transparency.” 



        The ruling has been hailed as a win for public accountability but may complicate Eskom's financial restructuring efforts.
    


        Separately, the Government Employees Pension Fund (GEPF) announced a temporary freeze on new “two-pot” withdrawal applications from October 7 to 21 for a system upgrade, although regular benefit payments will continue.
    


        Despite these domestic challenges, the rand's relative stability underscores investor resilience amid global volatility, a sign that, for now, markets are still giving South Africa the benefit of the doubt.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Gold's record surge past $4,000 shows stock investors may be hedging their optimism","https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/gold-record-price-today-4000-stock-market-rally-hedge-2025-10","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 04:59:00 GMT","

Gold prices smashed past $4,000 per ounce late Tuesday, hitting an all-time high that signals investors may be bracing for turbulence ahead.

Spot gold rose to $4,022.87 per ounce at 12:50 a.m. ET on Wednesday, extending a rally fueled by a potent mix of safe-haven flows, expectations of imminent Fed rate cuts, and rising geopolitical anxieties.

The surge may also reflect growing unease about the simultaneous run-up in global stock markets.

""Despite their recent resilience to macro data surprises, we think investors may be positioning themselves for a pullback,"" the World Gold Council wrote in a Tuesday report.

""This has likely helped support gold demand, as investors look to add safe-haven assets,"" the WGC added.

Equities have been on a tear this year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notching record highs, powered in part by the AI boom and expectations of easier monetary policy.

The rally has appeared unstoppable despite a wall of macroeconomic uncertainty, from President Donald Trump's new tariffs on trading partners to expectations of the Federal Reserve's rate cuts and the ongoing US government shutdown.

The foundation for this week's milestone was laid in September, when global physically backed gold ETFs recorded their largest monthly inflow, resulting in the strongest quarterly inflow on record of $26 billion. By the end of the third quarter, assets under management reached a record $472 billion — up 23% from the second quarter.

Gold rallies were typically led by Eastern buyers in China and India who hoarded the yellow metal as a store of value and for cultural reasons.

This time, the rally is driven overwhelmingly by Western investors.

North American funds accounted for $16.1 billion in inflows during the third quarter, while European funds contributed $8.2 billion. Asia, by contrast, contributed $1.7 billion.

""Flows reflected both protection and momentum as investors sought a purchasing-power hedge and leaned into the breakout,"" wrote WGC.

Trading activity exploded alongside prices.

In September, global gold trading volumes jumped 34% from August, averaging $388 billion a day — the second-strongest month of the year.

Gold's stunning 2025 rally has now sent spot prices up about 53% year-to-date, reigniting the ""fear trade"" that had cooled in previous years.

On Monday, Goldman Sachs raised its December 2026 gold forecast to $4,900 per ounce from $4,300, citing strong inflows into Western gold ETFs and central bank demand.

Some prominent investors have been sounding the same note.

Wall Street gurus, including Ray Dalio and David Einhorn, have urged investors to hold gold as a hedge against both inflation and policy volatility.

But not everyone is cheering.

On Monday, Citadel CEO Ken Griffin told Bloomberg he was uneasy about the flight to gold as a safe-haven asset because it reflects a broader derisking from the dollar, a traditional haven currency.

Meanwhile, Bank of America analysts cautioned that gold's parabolic rally could be nearing exhaustion.

Ford is the latest company to crack down on working from home — and some employees say they've been told they could be terminated if they don't comply.

In June, the Detroit automaker told employees they would be required to come into the office four days a week from September 1. Ford said the move would help boost growth as the company tries to transform itself into an affordable EV powerhouse.

Since announcing the policy, Ford has sent some employees emails telling them that they are not badging in enough and warning that they could face termination if they do not improve their attendance, three current and former Ford employees told Business Insider.

Two said they had received these emails despite complying with updated office attendance policies and having previous work-from-home arrangements signed off by their managers.

While many of Ford's Michigan-based teams have been in the office three days a week since late 2024, other divisions maintained a more flexible approach to working from home, two current and former employees said.

""We have done everything we can to make sure our employees understand the in-office policy, and we have given everyone time to adjust their schedules and work with their managers to make sure they are in compliance,"" a Ford spokesperson told Business Insider.

In an all-hands for a team within Ford's Enterprise Technology division — which oversees Ford's IT services and internal digital tools — on September 9, human resources director Homer Isaac said the emails were designed to instigate a ""change of behavior"" around remote working.

In a recording of the all-hands viewed by Business Insider, Isaac acknowledged some bumps in the warning-email system.

He said the company was aware that employees who had been ""doing the things that you were supposed to"" have been ""caught up in a lot of that noise."" He added that workers who are complying with the new four-day-a-week rules should not be concerned about losing their jobs.

""Most of the company went back to three days a week back in the fourth quarter of last year. ET [enterprise technology] had 13 days a quarter, and then progressed in August to three days a week, and now four days a week, which is the official policy in September,"" said Isaac.

""The letters up to this point, quite honestly, were based on a window where our standard wasn't the same as everybody else's standard. The communications are standard, and I will pledge to this team, we have asked for those to be changed or modified — we have failed in that,"" he said.

In the days after Ford announced the return-to-office mandate on June 25, some employees received an email saying that their badge data indicated their ""on-site presence since April 2025 has averaged less than one day a week,"" and was not in line with company expectations that hybrid workers come in three days a week.

These initial automated emails warned that not meeting these new expectations would be considered a ""policy violation,"" according to copies of the emails viewed by Business Insider.

One former Ford employee told Business Insider that despite their pre-June remote working arrangements being approved by senior management and complying with the three-day-a-week requirement, they continued to receive automated emails saying their on-site presence had not improved.

These subsequent emails warned that failure to comply with the new policy of four days a week on-site from September would result in ""discipline up to and including termination.""

""We need to work across time zones, and the new policy makes that impossible. People are working to the rule and are no longer willing to put in extra time outside normal hours. Flexibility is a two-way street,"" said the employee, who recently left the company.

Another current Ford employee told Business Insider they had also received a similar email warning that failing to comply with the new remote working rules could result in termination, despite going into the office the required number of days.

""I'm tired and exhausted. I just want to do my job and help the company, but upper management is constantly making that harder to do, and then telling me I'm the problem,"" they said.

Like many companies, Ford's return to office hasn't been entirely smooth. Employees Business Insider spoke to mentioned teething problems and overcrowding, with one calling an RTO trial run in August ""a little bit disastrous"" due to a lack of desks and parking.

The employee said the overcrowding issues have now been mostly smoothed out.

Hybrid IT employees were told to start coming into Ford's Dearborn site three days a week on August 6, according to interviews with employees and an email viewed by Business Insider.

In comments posted on an internal Ford forum on that day, employees said the site's Rotunda center had run out of parking and that police had shown up to ticket workers parked illegally. A Ford employee BI spoke to confirmed that police had attended.

Ford is set to open a 2.1 million-square-foot world headquarters in Dearborn in November. The company says it will have capacity for 4,000 employees.

Last week, frustration over Ford's return-to-office policy bubbled over in a highly public fashion.

The Detroit Free Press reported that a number of meeting room displays at the company's Dearborn site began displaying a crossed-out image of CEO Jim Farley with an explicit anti-RTO message.

The debasement trade, economic uncertainty, and geopolitical headwinds are some of the arguments for what has enhanced the appeal of gold in 2025, but whatever you want to attribute it to, one thing is certain: the price of gold is having its best run in decades.

""The rising price of gold is a direct response to the dual risks of inflation and currency devaluation in the United States and other major economies. Ever since the Great Recession, gold has been an outstanding performer because of the enormous debts incurred by governments around the world,"" Daniel Altman, economist and Founder of High Yield Economics, wrote on Tuesday.

The precious metal surged to another all-time high on Tuesday, topping $4,000 an ounce for the first time ever. And while top commentators like Ken Griffin see the rally as a sign of a more concerning trend in markets, the positive momentum doesn't appear to be waning—for now.

Bank of America recently examined gold's colossal rally, laying out the possible risks that a correction could be looming.

The first factor is its extended price run.

BofA analyst Paul Ciana noted that gold prices have been rising steadily for seven consecutive weeks, a phenomenon that has occurred 18 times since 1970. However, they see this as a potential problem, as during past rallies that went on for that long faded in the weeks after, with gold eking out more gains in the following five weeks just 28% of the time.

""Since the 1970s, many big round number areas have served as support and/or resistance levels for the gold trend at hand,"" Ciana stated. ""Since the start of 2024, gold prices have approximately doubled from +/- $2,000 to +/- $4,000.""

Second, Ciana said that gold prices may be approaching the peak of the latest rally, as the $4,000 per ounce price is 20% above the 200-day simple moving average.

During previous price rallies, gold typically reached its peak when it started trading 25% above the SMA. They said this suggests that the market may be approaching this cycle's tipping point, after which its course is likely to reverse.

He added that while the bank sees two possible scenarios where gold prices keep rising, both suggest that a material correction is likely looming.

Finally, the 14-month RSI (Relative Strength Index), which measures short-term momentum, implies that gold is highly overbought, a thesis that Adam Turnquist, Chief Technical Strategist for LPL Financial, echoed amid the latest jump to all-time highs.

""We recommend adding exposure on weakness given the degree of overbought conditions. Silver could also be another option in the space as it continues to gain relative strength over gold,"" Turnquist said.

Ciana said that in times when gold's RSI approached 80, it was nearing a peak with a correction soon to follow.

When RSI passes 70, it typically means that an asset is overbought. This data implies that gold prices have been overbought for over the last month

Eric Simons, CEO of AI startup StackBlitz, recently announced a new office lease in San Francisco. It's in Levi's Plaza, a swanky location near the water. The buildout is underway, and employees are expected to move in around January.

A few years ago, this was unheard of. Tech offices across Silicon Valley shut down as employees transitioned to remote work during the pandemic. The region's commercial real estate market plunged, and vacancies soared.

Now, though, the artificial intelligence boom is fueling a recovery. It's a strange phenomenon. Generative AI is supposed to automate many tasks, with some industry executives predicting huge job losses. However, if you examine the actions of AI companies, rather than their words, a different future begins to emerge.

The reality is that many AI companies are hiring a huge number of human employees. These are experts at putting AI to work, so they should be shedding staff, right? Instead, it's a hiring frenzy, and these growing workforces are now being housed in fancy offices across Silicon Valley and other urban, educated locations.

""AI companies are leasing because they're hiring,"" researchers at commercial real estate firm Colliers told Business Insider. ""Generative AI is reshaping the workforce, but it's also fueling new job creation that drives office demand.""

A recent report from Colliers concluded that the tech industry has become a major driver of the US office market.

In Silicon Valley, the average size of these leases has grown consistently over the past three years. So far in 2025, the office market there has reached its highest average lease size since 2020, according to Colliers data.

Since 2020, there have been 5.2 million square feet of office lease transactions by AI and AI-infrastructure companies in Silicon Valley (excluding Apple, Alphabet, or Meta). 2025 has already surpassed the full-year total for 2024 of 1.3 million square feet, according to Colliers' data.

The firm has seen significant office leasing activity in Sunnyvale, California, for pure AI companies and in Fremont, California, for AI-infrastructure companies, due to the high prevalence of advanced manufacturing in these areas. While most of the companies already have a presence in this market, many of the new firms specialize in robotics.

The takeaway from this activity: Take predictions of an AI job apocalypse with a large grain of salt. If AI companies themselves are hiring a lot of humans, then perhaps other employers will follow suit.

The $9 billion cybersecurity company Tanium is cracking down on its return-to-office policy this year in an unconventional way: It is withholding a form of compensation from those who don't comply.

As of this summer, Tanium employees who violate the RTO policy risk not getting an ""equity refresh,"" according to three people familiar with the matter. Tanium employees typically receive shares as part of their compensation package when they first join the company, and they may be eligible for an ""equity refresh"" or additional equity after a specified period of time at the company.

While Tanium CEO Dan Streetman has said at companywide meetings that going to the office was important, leadership hasn't verbally or in written communication announced to the company that RTO may be tied to equity grants, sources said.

Stock options and other forms of equity-based compensation are a crucial part of the startup ecosystem. They entice early startup employees with the promise of owning a stake in what could be the next big thing. Those shares can lead to a big payday down the line if the company goes public or gets acquired. Not receiving additional equity grants can significantly reduce a startup employee's compensation package.

Tanium did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Many companies across the US, including AT&T, Microsoft, and Amazon, have been attempting to reduce remote work. Some companies have terminated employees who don't comply with their policies. Withholding a form of compensation for those who don't return to the office is relatively rare, experts say.

""Most companies will say, 'Look, you need to come in,'"" said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford economics professor who conducts research on remote work. ""They're sanctioned, and then later they're terminated.""

Bloom said he had not heard of companies denying employees additional equity for balking at RTO mandates. He said that some law firms have cut pay for those who don't come into the office.

Tanium was founded in 2007 by father and son David and Orion Hindawi. It offers a range of cybersecurity products for securing and managing devices on an organization's network, serving customers from large businesses to government agencies. It has nearly 2,000 employees worldwide.

Tanium first announced its RTO policy in late 2023, stating that employees within a 50-mile radius of an office are required to work there on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with a third day to be determined by their team leaders. Initially, this policy was loosely enforced, said people familiar with the matter.

The company's latest policy reduced the radius to 35 miles, a current and a former employee said. To determine how often employees are going to the office, Tanium is reviewing badge scans, according to the sources.

This is not the first time Tanium has found its stock-option practices under the spotlight. In 2020, Business Insider reported that Tanium used a ""clawback clause"" to buy back employees' equity in the company, whether they wanted to sell or not. Bloomberg had also previously reported that Tanium fired employees right before their stock vested.

Prior to Tanium announcing its RTO policy, the company was known for its remote-friendly culture. In recent years, the culture has shifted to an in-office-first approach. New hires are expected to be within commuting distance of the office, three current and former employees said.

Virginia is for data centers. Big ones.

Big Tech companies filed permits for 54 new data centers in the state in the first nine months of 2025, according to a Business Insider tally.

The number represents the state's single largest spike in planned data centers in any one year, and a 16% increase from Virginia's 2024 total.

Amazon-built data centers represent the bulk of the new construction, with 28 planned facilities, according to Business Insider's count. The tech giant had 177 data centers built or in construction nationwide by the end of 2024, according to the analysis. The new planned data centers in Virginia would grow Amazon's fleet to 205, a 15% increase.

The new Virginia permits also reveal how Big Tech companies are increasingly building larger, more power-intensive data centers. Business Insider previously identified 322 ""hyperscale"" facilities built or under construction nationwide at the end of 2024 that consume an estimated 40 megawatts of electricity or more each.

The new permits push this count to 370. All but one of Amazon's new planned data centers are among the largest in Business Insider's analysis. These giant data centers can consume as much power as a small city and up to several million gallons of water a day.

An Amazon spokesperson said Business Insider's methodology for estimating electricity use is ""flawed and can lead to inaccurate conclusions."" (See more about Business Insider's methodology, and Amazon's response, here.)

This recent explosion of Virginia data center construction comes amid unprecedented nationwide investment in AI infrastructure. In June, construction spending on US data centers reached an all-time high of $40 billion, a Bank of America Institute report found. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are pouring cash into the rush to build even more. The tech giants' combined capital expenditures could reach an estimated $320 billion this year, primarily for AI infrastructure, an analysis of financial statements by Business Insider found.

Virginia is historically the epicenter of the data center construction boom in the US, with the most data centers in the country by far concentrated in Northern Virginia, known as ""Data Center Alley."" Data centers in the state have emerged as one of the largest flashpoints in a national wave of grassroots resistance from residents worried about their impact on housing, the environment, and quality of life, even as they have promised to bring new tax revenue.

Data centers in Virginia already used a quarter of the state's electricity in 2023. Business Insider estimated that if all the data centers built or in construction in the state by 2024 come online, at the low end, they would consume around the same amount of electricity as New York City used in 2024.

Overall, the 54 new planned data centers drive Business Insider's electricity estimate another 26% higher.

Collectively, Business Insider estimates that if Virginia's 383 data centers already built or in construction as of September 2025 all come online, they will use between 66.5 terawatt-hours and 106.4 terawatt-hours annually. The low end is roughly equivalent to the amount of power the entire state of Minnesota used in 2023; the high end is more power than Tennessee used that year.

To investigate data center expansion across the country, Business Insider filed requests with all 50 states and Washington, DC, for the air permits that regulate backup generators at every data center.

As of 2010, there were 311 data centers nationwide, Business Insider previously found. That number nearly quadrupled, to 1,240 data centers built or approved for construction by the end of 2024, the most comprehensive tally to date.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Nvidia shares rise after CEO Huang says AI computing demand is up 'substantially'","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/08/jensen-huang-nvidia-computing-demand.html","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 12:46:07 GMT","



In this article

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday that demand is up huge this year as artificial intelligence models develop further from answering simple questions to complex reasoning.

""This year, particularly the last six months, demand of computing has gone up substantially,"" Huang said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

The CEO of the AI chip leader was answering a question about what investors ask him most about. Nvidia shares rose about 2% on Wednesday, helping to boost the Nasdaq Composite higher.

AI reasoning models are using exponential amounts of computing power but they are also seeing exponential amounts of demand because their results are so good, Huang said.

""The AIs are smart enough that everybody wants to use it,"" the CEO said. ""We now have two exponentials happening at the same time.""

""Demand for Blackwell is really, really high,"" he said of Nvidia's most advanced graphics processing unit. ""I think we're at the beginning of a new buildout, beginning of a new industrial revolution.""  

Nvidia announced last month it will invest $100 billion in OpenAI's massive data center buildout. OpenAI is planning to build 10 gigawatts of data centers using Nvidia chips.

The scale of the AI industry's plans have raised doubts about whether the leading companies can secure the power needed to fuel their ambitions. Ten gigawatts is equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, or New York City's peak baseline summer demand in 2024.

When asked who is winning the AI race, Huang said the U.S. is ""not far ahead"" of China right now. Beijing is building out the power needed to support AI much faster than the U.S., the CEO said.

""China is way ahead on energy,"" Huang said.

The artificial intelligence industry will need to build new power generation off the electric grid in order to move quickly to meet demand and insulate consumers from rising electricity prices, he said. Data centers should be outfitted with natural gas and then potentially nuclear power at some point in the future, the CEO said.

""We should invest in just about every possible way of generating energy,"" Huang said. ""Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that,"" he said.

In this article

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday that he's surprised Advanced Micro Devices offered 10% of itself to OpenAI as part of a multibillion-dollar partnership announced earlier this week.

""It's imaginative, it's unique and surprising, considering they were so excited about their next-generation product,"" Huang said in an interview with ""CNBC's Squawk Box."" ""I'm surprised that they would give away 10% of the company before they even built it. And so anyhow, it's clever, I guess.""

OpenAI and AMD reached a deal on Monday, with OpenAI committing to purchase 6 gigawatts worth of chips over multiple years, including its forthcoming MI450 series. As part of the agreement, OpenAI will receive warrants for up to 160 million AMD shares, with vesting milestones based on deployment volume and AMD's share price.

If OpenAI exercises the full warrant, the company could acquire roughly 10% ownership in AMD.

AMD shares have soared since the announcement and were up 5% on Wednesday, rising a staggering 35% so far this week. Nvidia shares were nearly 3% higher on Wednesday following Huang's comments.

The deal challenges Nvidia's dominance in the artificial intelligence chip industry, a market where AMD has sought to catch up, alongside cloud providers which are developing their own chips.

Nvidia late last month announced it planned to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI over the next decade. OpenAI agreed to build and deploy Nvidia systems that require 10 gigawatts of power, which Huang said at the time of the announcement is equal to between 4 million and 5 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.

Huang said the investment is ""very different"" from OpenAI's deal with AMD in that it allows Nvidia to sell directly to the ChatGPT creator.

Nvidia's investment in OpenAI has underscored concerns about the ""circular nature"" of some AI infrastructure deals.

Asked how OpenAI will fund the deal with Nvidia, Huang said, ""They don't have the money yet.""

""They're going to have to raise that money through, first of all, their revenues, which is growing exponentially, equity or debt,"" Huang said. ""They gave us the opportunity to invest alongside other investors when the time comes.""

Huang added that after Nvidia previously invested in OpenAI, his ""only regret is that we didn't invest more.""

Huang also confirmed Nvidia's involvement in xAI's latest funding round, in which Elon Musk's AI startup is reportedly seeking to raise about $20 billion, according to Bloomberg. Nvidia is set to invest $2 billion, the outlet reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Huang said he's ""super excited"" about the financing opportunity, adding that he wishes he could give Musk more money.

""Almost everything that Elon is part of, you really want to be part of as well,"" Huang said.

Nvidia has also backed AI data center operator CoreWeave, which Huang said he considers one of several ""terrific investments"" made by the company recently.

""[They're] really special companies, and they're building, they're part of our ecosystem building out the AI infrastructure for the world,"" Huang said.

The Bank of England on Wednesday warned that the risk of a ""sharp market correction"" has increased, noting that valuations appear stretched, particularly for artificial intelligence-focused tech firms. 

The central bank becomes the latest in a long list of banks and investors to weigh in on whether an AI bubble is forming as markets tick into the fourth quarter. 

Heightened geopolitical tensions, fragmented trade and financial markets and pressures on sovereign debt markets play into the risk, the Bank of England said in a record of its latest meeting minutes.

""A crystallisation of such global risks could have a material impact on the UK as an open economy and global financial centre,"" it said. 

Equity market valuations stood at near all-time highs, the Bank of England said, thanks in part to strong second-quarter earnings by U.S. tech firms. 

""The market share of the top 5 members of the S&P 500, at close to 30%, was higher than at any point in the past 50 years,"" it said, noting that AI-focused tech company valuations appear particularly stretched.

""This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic,"" the meeting minutes said. With such high expectations of future earnings growth, any pullback on AI-related bets could lead to ripple effects, it added.

Investors are closely watching AI-related stocks as earning season gets underway, with some strategists confident that tech company valuations are being driven by sound fundamentals. Goldman Sachs also remained cautiously optimistic in its latest note, believing a bubble has not yet formed but heeded a warning to investors to ""diversify.""

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, however, warned of ""fairly highly valued"" assets on Tuesday, though he didn't explicitly refer to technology firms. 

The Bank of England further warned that ""downside factors included disappointing AI capability/adoption progress or increased competition, which could drive a re-evaluation of currently high expected future earnings."" 

""Material bottlenecks to AI progress – from power, data, or commodity supply chains – as well as conceptual breakthroughs which change the anticipated AI infrastructure requirements for the development and utilisation of powerful AI models could also harm valuations, including for companies whose revenue expectations are derived from high levels of anticipated AI infrastructure investment,"" it added. 

Meanwhile, the private credit market has suffered recently, following news that auto maker First Brands and auto finance firm Tricolor have filed for bankruptcy. Meanwhile, political uncertainty in France and Japan persists and questions remain over U.S. President Donald Trump's interference with the Federal Reserve, adding to the Bank of England's more gloomy outlook. 

Changes to the risk landscape ""increases the risk that markets have not fully priced in possible adverse outcomes, and a sudden correction could occur should any of these risks crystallise,"" the Bank of England said. 

As such, it could have a knock-on effect for households and businesses in a market that is already feeling the pinch through high costs of living and borrowing costs, it added.

In this article

AST SpaceMobile on Wednesday announced a deal with Verizon to provide cellular service from space beginning next year.

This deal aims to bring direct-to-service connection via space to cell phone users ""when needed"" on Verizon plans, according to AST. It marks an expansion of a partnership between the two companies announced last year.

AST shares climbed around 12% in midday trading on Wednesday. The volatile space stock had surged more than 250% in 2025 before the deal was announced.

Verizon shares ticked lower.

""Through our definitive commercial agreement with Verizon, we are working to deliver space-based cellular broadband coverage from space across the continental United States,"" Abel Avellan, founder and CEO of AST, said in a press release. 

Terms of the deal were not immediately available.

Avellan said this deal will extend Verizon's 850 MHz premium low-band spectrum into areas of the U.S. that could get a coverage boost from AST's space-based broadband offering.

AST said this deal comes after it has proven capabilities through recent tests of its space network. The company bills itself as creating the ""first and only"" global cellular network operating in space directly through standard devices that can be used in both commercial and government settings.

Shares of Europe's biggest carmakers traded lower Wednesday, amid concern that the European Union's latest efforts to protect the domestic steel market could threaten the region's auto sector.

The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, announced Tuesday that it plans to hike steel tariffs and sharply cut import quotas, seeking to offer ""strong and permanent protection"" to the region's steel industry.

The proposal includes a push to limit tariff-free import volumes to 18.3 million tons a year, reflecting a reduction of 47% compared with 2024 steel quotas — and doubling tariffs to 50% on any excess imports.

The planned measures have not gone down well within Europe's automotive industry.

Europe's Stoxx Automobiles and Parts index provisionally ended Wednesday's session 2.1% lower, leading regional losses.

In response to the EU's announcement, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA, an industry lobby group, said the proposal goes too far and threatens automakers with higher input and administrative costs.

Sigrid de Vries, director general of ACEA, said that European carmakers source roughly 90% of their direct steel purchases in the EU and were ""most concerned about the inflationary impact that an effective continuation of the safeguard will have on European market prices.""

She added: ""We do not contest the need for some level of protection for a commodity industry like steel but we feel that the parameters as proposed by the Commission go too far in ring-fencing the European market.""

ACEA's de Vries called instead for ""a better balance"" between the needs of European producers and users of steel in this measure.

Looking at individual stocks, Germany's BMW fell 8.3% on Wednesday, slipping toward the bottom of the Stoxx 600 index.

The Munich-based carmaker, which is reportedly on track for its worst trading day since September last year, issued a fresh profit warning on Tuesday, citing slow growth in China and the ongoing impact of U.S. import tariffs.

Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, described BMW's profit warning as ""disappointing"" and not a positive signal regarding the many challenges facing Europe's automakers.

""During the 2Q figures presentation they where still rather upbeat about dealing with the reality and holding up margins, but that relative optimism seems to have faded now,"" Luman told CNBC by email.

Germany's Mercedes-Benz Group and Volkswagen were both down around 2%, France's Renault fell 1.8% and Milan-listed Stellantis provisionally ended off by 1.2%.

Stateside, meanwhile, shares of Ford fell 0.7%, with General Motors little changed for the session.

SoftBank Group on Monday said it had agreed to buy the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, as the Japanese giant looks to bolster its artificial intelligence plays.

The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval globally, means ABB will no longer look to spin off its robotics business as a separately listed company.

""SoftBank's next frontier is Physical AI. Together with ABB Robotics, we will unite world-class technology and talent under our shared vision to fuse Artificial Super Intelligence and robotics — driving a groundbreaking evolution that will propel humanity forward,"" Masayoshi Son, founder of SoftBank, said in a statement.

Artificial Super Intelligence, or ASI, is Son's idea of AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans.

Son has looked to position SoftBank at the center of the potential AI boom through investments and acquisitions in different areas of technology. SoftBank owns chip designer Arm, for example, and has a major stake in OpenAI.

SoftBank already has some robot-related investments, including AutoStore Holdings and Agile Robots.

The Japanese conglomerate is not new to robotics. In 2012, SoftBank took a majority stake in a French company called Aldebaran. Two years later, the two companies launched a humanoid robot called Pepper — a bet that ultimately flopped, but robotics has now re-emerged as a key focus for the Japanese giant.

Morten Wierod, who became CEO of ABB in August 2024, has pushed the spin-off of the company's robotics unit as a strategic move.

ABB said in a statement that the sale ""will create immediate value to ABB shareholders."" The company said it will use the proceeds from the transaction ""in line with its well-established capital allocation principles.""

ABB said it expected cash proceeds of approximately $5.3 billion. The expected separation cost is around $200 million, about half of which is already in ABB's 2025 guidance.

The European Union's decision to hike steel tariffs and sharply cut import quotas has provoked widespread concern in the U.K., as well as rumblings of discontent among carmakers on the continent.

The bloc announced plans on Tuesday to reduce tariff-free quotas on imported steel — proposing a reduction of 47% compared to 2024 steel quotas — and to hike tariffs from 25% to 50% on any excess imports.

The European Commission said the measures were a response to calls from workers, industry and several member states ""to offer strong and permanent protection to the EU steel industry, with a view to safeguarding EU jobs, and supporting the sector in its decarbonisation efforts."" The proposal will replace the steel safeguard measure, which is set to expire by June 2026.

The tariff hike provoked an immediate outcry in the U.K., with the country's beleaguered steel industry already suffering a number of body blows, including steelworks closures leading to thousands of job losses, and U.S. tariffs of 25% on steel exports to the States.

""This is perhaps the biggest crisis the U.K. steel industry has ever faced,"" Gareth Stace, director general of industry body UK Steel, said Tuesday.

""Government must go all out to leverage our trading relationship with the European Union to secure U.K. country quotas or potentially face disaster,"" he added.

Emily Sawicz, director and Industrials senior analyst at RSM UK, told CNBC that the EU's announcement was a ""significant threat"" to the U.K.'s steel industry.

""The EU accounts for around 80% of U.K. steel exports, so these tariffs risk cutting off access to the U.K.'s largest and most strategically important market at a time when the sector is already under immense pressure from global competition and rising energy costs,"" she told CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Wednesday.

The bloc's move follows similar tariffs on foreign steel imposed by the U.S. and Canada in a bid to stem cheaper imports — largely from China — which they say are damaging their domestic steel industries.

U.S. President Donald Trump raised the tariff on the majority of steel and aluminum imports from 25% to 50% this year, while Canada tightened import limits and introduced a surtax of 25% on any steel imports that were originally melted and poured in China.

China rejects accusations that it has dumped excess cheap steel onto the global market.

The EU on Tuesday noted that ""steel overcapacity is a global problem that requires strong, genuine and joint action by all partners.""

Tariffs have been promoted as a way to protect national steel industries, but sectors reliant on the commodity — most notably, the auto industry — have baulked at quotas and tariffs.

The U.K. is likely to seek an exemption from the EU, and may take heart from the fact that Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein won't be subject to the EU's steel tariff quotas or duties as they are in the European Economic Area (EEA).

The Commission also signalled a willingness to exempt Ukraine from the duties, noting, ""interests of a candidate country facing an exceptional and immediate security situation, such as Ukraine, should also be reflected upon when deciding on the quota allocations, without undermining the effectiveness of the measure.""

The U.K. is not in the EEA, but is a close trading partner and ally of the EU. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said, after news of the tariff hike broke, that the government was holding discussions with both the EU and U.S. about steel tariffs.

Retaliatory measures might not be off the table, with British Industry Minister Chris McDonald noting: ""We continue to explore stronger trade measures to protect U.K. steel producers from unfair behaviors.""

He added, however, that ""it's vital we protect trade flows between the U.K. and EU and we will work with our closest allies to address global challenges.

The EU's announcement has not been well received in all corners of the continent, with the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) saying the measures could threaten the domestic car industry. 

The auto body noted that European carmakers source around 90% of their direct steel purchases in the EU and that they are ""most concerned"" about the inflationary impact the restrictions will have on European market prices.

""The dramatic lowering of quotas and the doubling of the out-of-quota tariff to 50%, will significantly reduce the possibility to relieve pressure in the European market through imports,"" the ACEA said in a press release.

In addition, it said a new rule of origin based on the ""melt and pour"" principle will further restrict imports and ""create a massive administrative burden for European users of imported steel products.""

ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries said the body recognized the need for some level of protection for the steel sector, but added, ""we feel that the parameters as proposed by the Commission go too far in ring-fencing the European market. We need to find a better balance between the needs of European producers and users of steel in this measure.""

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Gold futures surpassed the $4,000 per ounce mark for the first time ever yesterday. It's the 43rd record high close of the year for the metal, which has long been viewed as a safe-haven investment amid times of turmoil. Gold is now up more than 50% in 2025.

Here's what to know:

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Oracle's defense following its tough day in the market yesterday.

Oracle shares slid 2.5% after a report raised concerns that the company is seeing small margins on its Nvidia chip rental business. But Huang told CNBC's Jim Cramer that Oracle is ""going to do incredibly well"" and that the company will be ""wonderfully profitable"" over time.

Speaking with Cramer at the CNBC Investing Club's Monthly Meeting on Tuesday, Huang also explained why Nvidia's latest partnership with OpenAI is unique: ""For the first time, OpenAI is going to buy directly from us,"" he said. Huang's comments come as some big-name investors such as Orlando Bravo warn of a potential bubble forming around the artificial intelligence trade.

Huang will join CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" at 8 a.m. ET. Watch CNBC TV live here.

President Donald Trump suggested yesterday that some federal workers furloughed during the ongoing government shutdown won't receive back pay when they return to work. ""I would say it depends on who we're talking about,"" he said. Notably, a 2019 law signed by Trump says furloughed government employees ""shall be paid for the period of the lapse in appropriations.""

Republicans appear to be under increasing pressure to consider Democrats' health-care demands that have been at the heart of the two parties' disagreement. Republican Sen. Susan Collins has reportedly shared a ""discussion draft"" of a proposal which includes GOP pledges for an Obamacare deal.

Traditional economic data is still on hold thanks to the shutdown, but other reports are offering warning signs.

Investment firm Carlyle reported that its data showed that the labor market grew by just 17,000 jobs last month. If correct, that would mark a slowdown from what the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in August.

Meanwhile, the New York Federal Reserve's monthly survey found that consumers expect inflation to be higher in the year ahead. On top of that, fewer people expect to be better off financially in a year, according to the report.

Tesla unveiled more affordable versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan yesterday. But Wall Street didn't seem impressed.

Shares rose 5% on Monday after the electric vehicle maker teased an announcement, but the stock gave up much of that gain on Tuesday, closing down more than 4%. As CNBC's Lora Kolodny notes, some investors were hoping for long-promised updates on new products, such as the next-generation Roadster.

Tesla also released a new version of its driver assistance system for Full-Self Driving yesterday.

7-Eleven is hoping a Japanese-style revamp will revive its struggling U.S. stores. Here's what parent company Seven & i Holdings is planning:

Monday - Friday, 10:00 - 11:00 SIN/HK  |  0400 - 05:00 CET

In this article

This report is from this week's CNBC's The China Connection newsletter, which brings you insights and analysis on what's driving the world's second-largest economy. You can subscribe here.

Foreign investors have struggled to decipher if China can deliver the kind of returns that once seemed assured, especially in the fickle world of consumer brands.

That caution loomed large at the Milken Institute Asia Summit in Singapore last week: With a population of 1.4 billion, China's potential consumer demand remains too vast to overlook — but increasingly difficult to read.

Chinese households have tightened their belts, cutting back on nonessential spending and becoming, as some investors describe it, ""spoiled"" by an abundance of high-quality goods sold at steep discounts.

Yet one venture capital firm is testing that skepticism — and drawing attention while doing so. Founded in 2016, Black Ant Capital has been dedicated to China's consumer landscape and quietly backed some of China's most talked-about consumer plays since as early as 2017: Pop Mart, Laopu Gold and budget snacks retailer BusyMing Group.

Pop Mart, the company behind China's blind-box craze, now has a market value of 344.4 billion Hong Kong dollars ($44.2 billion), while jewelry maker Laopu Gold has staged a stunning rally this year, soaring nearly 17-fold from its listing price to reach a market capitalization of $15 billion. BusyMing is poised to become the latest BA Capital portfolio company slated for an upcoming Hong Kong IPO.

It is clear that despite keeping a low profile, the company has turned heads among global investors.

BA Capital manages three renminbi-denominated funds and one U.S. dollar fund. The four funds had outperformed most of their regional peers, according to a company spokesperson, ranking in the top quartile of 479 private equity and venture capital funds in emerging Asia markets surveyed by Cambridge Associates as of the end of the first quarter.

At the Milken Summit, founding partner of BA Capital David He drew a crowd as soon as he stepped off stage — investors and executives eager to trade business cards and pleasantries, hoping to glean insight into his thinking, and perhaps a chance to share in the firm's remarkable run of returns.

Earlier that day, I caught up with He, who also sits on the board of Pop Mart, at a café a short walk from the Four Seasons Hotel, where the Milken Institute convened this year. Over coffee, he made the case that China's consumer story is far from over — it's simply changing and getting more interesting for those who know where to look.

This interview has been translated and condensed for clarity.

What first drew you to invest in Pop Mart?

It was the emotional pull behind Pop Mart's toys. As children, we all sought comfort from toys, and that instinct doesn't fade with age. We simply project that need onto other things — pets, hobbies, even décor. Pop Mart's appeal lies in its design and its presence in intimate spaces, on desks or bedside tables, offering a sense of companionship and familiarity that deepens over time.

Which consumer trends fueled Pop Mart's rise — and what sustains its success?

Young consumers today are drawn to things that make them feel connected and emotionally fulfilled. They're willing to spend on something that sparks joy — something they can grow attached to.

Pop Mart has tapped into that trend. The company stands out for its talented designers who create characters that are emotionally resonant and timeless, and for its commercial team, which keeps those characters relevant through new experiences and interactions.

What's the takeaway for other Chinese brands?

For brands in the mid- to high-end segment, especially those looking to expand overseas, they need to set their sights on the U.S. market early on and go all in. The U.S. remains the most important market with the greatest spending power and cultural influence.

What's next for Pop Mart?

The demand for its toys, which offer companionship or style, will always exist. The key is nurturing each intellectual property and finding new ways to connect with consumers — better products, richer content, and more immersive experiences, from exhibitions to theme parks. Anything that deepens that sense of interaction will sustain its relevance.

What about Laopu Gold — what explains its success?

Laopu's rise reflects two powerful shifts among Chinese consumers: a consumer downturn and a cultural turn toward homegrown luxury.

During the pandemic, global luxury brands lost many middle-class customers, but the desire for quality and value remained. Consumers wanted premium products that could preserve their values — like gold jewelry that feels both beautiful and enduring. At the same time, there's been a surge of pride in traditional Chinese culture, fueled by national confidence and cultural awareness.

In an era of cautious spending, Laopu Gold offered something distinct — jewelry that blends Chinese aesthetics with modern design and refined craftsmanship.

Where do you see Laopu heading from here?

As it adapts to new markets, Laopu will retain its Eastern identity. Like Italian brands that look modern but remain unmistakably Italian at their core, Laopu will evolve while keeping its roots firmly in East Asian heritage.

What do you see in budget snacks chain BusyMing?

Lower pricing has dominated the Chinese consumer market since 2022 and is likely to persist, especially in sectors where further cost reductions can be achieved through enhanced efficiency. Furthermore, we have seen stronger spending power in lower-tier cities in recent years.

Where do you see the next wave of consumer growth?

Spending power in China remains strong and there's a growing fascination with products inspired by Chinese culture, an emerging but very strong trend among domestic consumers. Furthermore, we see growing interests in self-care and emotional well-being — what I call ""emotional healing."" Feminism, too, is gaining strength.

What about tech-related plays?

We're spending more time looking at consumer electronics — not the technology itself, but how innovation translates into products that meet consumers' demand. They include autonomous vacuums, drones and smart home devices.

BA Capital has backed several brands, such as Oladance, a Chinese headphone maker, Tenways Electric Bikes, and Yarbo, which produces autonomous snow blowers.

How does BA Capital position for exit options?

About 80 to 90% of our exits have come through IPOs. While we see growing potential for industry consolidation and M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions) opportunities, we don't view it as a primary exit route. Investing with M&A in mind is the wrong starting point — you won't be able to find the best companies that way. We aim to invest in the very best players, and for them, an IPO is the natural path.

— CNBC's Penny Chen contributed to this report.

Jack Dwyer from Infusive analyzed how luxury brands are approaching both China and the rest of the world, as brands shift their tack and products to court a younger audience.

CNBC's Sara Eisen sat down with Nike CEO Elliott Hill to discuss how the company has navigated tariff increases, manufacturing, and interaction with the Trump administration around trade.

Nick Redman, director of analysis at Oxford Analytica, talked about China's desire to indigenize chip production, and how it's rooted in their belief that the U.S. will not be a reliable partner.

World Bank raised China's growth forecast to 4.8% despite U.S. trade tensions. The new forecast was part of an overall increase in projections for East Asia and the Pacific, bringing the projection closer to Beijing's official target of around 5% growth for 2025.

BYD's sales soared in September in U.K. Chinese electric carmaker BYD sold 11,271 cars in the U.K. last month, representing year-on-year growth of 880%. The sales brought its yearly total to just over 35,000 in the country, making the U.K. its largest market outside of China.

Preliminary figures for the Golden Week holiday pointed to sluggish consumer spending. Average daily domestic passenger trips, retail sales and catering revenue rose at a much slower pace than the Labor Day holiday in May, according to Nomura. The number of cross-border flights in the first six days of the eight-day holiday also remained below the pre-pandemic levels.

One fact that sticks in my mind is that if China raises gold in its FX reserves to the average of middle-income emerging countries, it would have to buy two years' worth of gold supply.

				Taken from CNBC's Daily Open, our international markets newsletter — Subscribe today


J.P Morgan famously said in his 1912 congressional testimony that ""Gold is money, everything is credit."" 

It seems unsurprising then that many investors seem to be fleeing from credit and are parking their wealth in gold instead, which sent the prices of the yellow metal crossing $4,000 for the first time.

Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio said investors should allocate as much as 15% of their portfolios to gold in a market that he said is comparable to the early 1970s — when factors like high debt, and monetary uncertainty eroded confidence in paper assets and fiat currencies.

Some may be tempted to quote Warren Buffett as a counterpoint, who was famously skeptical on the utility of gold.In 1998, Buffett said that ""[Gold] gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.""Martians may be scratching their head, but earthlings are not, and are scrambling over one another for the glittery stuff. 

Gold crosses $4,000 mark for the first time. That comes as investors seek a safe haven from a weaker dollar, geopolitical volatility, economic uncertainty and stubborn inflation.

Softbank to buy ABB robotics unit. SoftBank Group on Monday said it had agreed to buy the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion, as the Japanese giant looks to bolster its artificial intelligence plays.

M&A engine is roaring. M&As this year have been buoyed by rate-cut expectations and elevated levels of private-equity ""dry powder."" Collective deals in the third quarter have been valued at $1.29 trillion, compared to $1.06 trillion in the second quarter and $1.1 trillion in the first quarter. 

S&P 500 ends winning streak. The broad market index pulled back 0.38% Tuesday stateside, snapping a 7-day winning streak as investors worry about the profitability of the artificial intelligence rollout. Both the Nasdaq and Dow also saw losses. On Wednesday, Asia markets mostly fell, with Japan's Nikkei retreating from its record high.

[PRO] AI bubble in the market? Although an artificial intelligence-driven bubble has emerged in the market, there are plenty of ""real projects"" to which investors can still confidently allocate funds, Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown said on CNBC's ""Halftime Report.""

Ray Dalio says today is like the early 1970s and investors should hold more gold than usual

Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio said investors should allocate as much as 15% of their portfolios to gold even as the precious metal surged to an all-time high above $4,000 an ounce.

Dalio's recommendation contrasts with typical portfolio guidance of financial advisors which tells clients to hold mostly stocks and some bonds in a 60-40 split.

Alternative assets like gold and other commodities are usually suggested to be a low single-digit percentage of any portfolio because of the lack of income they generate.

Gold (GC=F) climbed to new records on Wednesday as silver (SI=F) and bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued a run higher. Investors are looking for hedges against mounting government debt and a broader shift away from fiat currencies toward what some analysts have dubbed the ""debasement trade.""

Gold futures blew past $4,060 per troy ounce to touch a fresh record, while silver futures (SI=F) climbed to $48.70, their strongest level in years.

Meanwhile, bitcoin sat near $123,000, hovering just below Monday's record near $125,790.

The moves reflect a continuation of the so-called debasement trade, in which investors pour into hard assets and crypto to hedge against what they see as the erosion of fiat currency value driven by inflation, heavy government spending, and mounting debt financed by money creation.

Over the weekend, JPMorgan analysts noted the rise in precious metals and cryptocurrencies against the backdrop of the dollar, which has been on a downward trend in 2025. The US dollar index (DX.Y.NYB) is down roughly 9% year to date.

Meanwhile, fiscal uncertainty in developed markets has driven a flight to safe-haven assets. In an unexpected election outcome in Japan over the weekend, Sanae Takaichi was selected to become the country's next prime minister. Market analysts view Takaichi as a ""fiscal dove,"" supporting government stimulus to grow the economy.

Takaichi's election indicates ""how much of the developed world is pivoting into a 'Run It Hot' fiscal dominance framework, carrying monster deficits in order to try and outgrow debt,"" Nomura Securities analyst Charlie McElligott said in a note on Monday morning.

""Accordingly, Gold, Silver and Bitcoin are again simultaneously moving to fresh ATH's as the chief winners in this latest escalation of the ... 'Debasement Trade,' alongside equities then too ripping to record highs as well,"" he added.

Gold and silver futures have surged roughly 55% and 65% year to date, respectively, as expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts have boosted the appeal of metals, which tend to perform better when interest rates are lower.

Last quarter marked the strongest quarter on record for inflows into gold-backed exchange-traded funds. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs analysts lifted their gold forecast for December 2026 from $4,300 to $4,900 per troy ounce.

""Western ETF inflows and likely central bank buying – are sticky in our pricing framework, effectively lifting the starting point of our price forecast,"" Goldman's Lina Thomas wrote in a note to clients.

Meanwhile, bitcoin is up roughly 33% year to date as the world's largest cryptocurrency kicked off October, its seasonally strongest month of the year, soaring from $118,000 to $125,000 over the past week.

""The ongoing US government shutdown has amplified Bitcoin's safe haven narrative, with investors increasingly rotating from U.S. related assets like treasuries into assets seen as resilient to political dysfunction and inflationary pressure,"" Farzam Ehsani, CEO of crypto exchange VALR, wrote in a note.

Wall Street sees further gains for the crypto space as stablecoin issuance sends native tokens for blockchains such as Ethereum (ETH-USD), Solana (SOL-USD), and Hyperliquid (HYPE) higher.

""I believe that the next wave of crypto adoption will come from stablecoin adoption. And that's going to be very positive for crypto overall,"" Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer at Hashdex, told Yahoo Finance last week. ""This is a trend that might take six months to one year to start to reflect on prices.""

Shares of stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL) are up 115% since the company's IPO in June. Related stocks have also been on a tear in recent weeks. Trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) is up 290% year to date, while Coinbase (COIN) is also up 51% since the start of the year, off its all-time high from July.

Bitcoin rose to another all-time high this week, buoyed by a broader rally in risk assets amid the U.S. government shutdown. Some financial institutions and traders are betting that it will go even higher.

Standard Chartered is among them. The bank's head of digital assets research, Geoff Kendrick, told clients in a note that bitcoin could reach $135,000 in the coming weeks, pointing to record inflows into exchange-traded funds. 

“The shutdown matters this time around,” Kendrick wrote, adding that during the last shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019, bitcoin was “in a different place than now, so it did little.” This time, it has traded more in line with tradition risk assets, he said. 

The cryptocurrency rose above $125,000 over the weekend, topping a previous record of $124,480 in mid-August, buoyed by more friendly regulations from President Donald Trump's administration and growing demand from institutions.

""Bitcoin is the hurdle rate. If you can't beat it, you have to buy it. And I think the next 12 weeks are going to be very fun for bitcoin holders,"" wrote Anthony Pompliano, founder of Professional Capital Management, in a letter to investors on Monday.

The current rally means bitcoin has gained about 13% since late September, according to financial services firm Trade Nation. ""Despite the rally's intensity, the tone across the crypto space remained orderly, suggesting confidence rather than speculative frenzy,"" wrote David Morrison, an analyst at Trade Nation, on Monday.

The most recent climb has come at the same time as weakness in the U.S. dollar, as uncertainty caused by Trump's tariffs pushed some investors away from the currency. Similarly, gold prices have shattered records this week, briefly topping $4,000 an ounce for the first time ever. 

Not all banks are quite as exuberant about bitcoin's immediate prospects. Citigroup last week trimmed its year-end bitcoin target to $133,000 from $135,000, predicting that the dollar will gain strength again. 

But even with the adjustment, Citi said it still expects further gains for bitcoin into year-end, though it argued that investor flows may increasingly favor ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, in the months ahead.

Derivatives markets are showing a similar pattern. Bitcoin options traders have clustered bets around the $140,000 strike for contracts expiring later this year, while open interest in futures and perpetuals has climbed to record levels, reported Bloomberg, citing data from Deribit and Amberdata.

The news came as plans to weave crypto into ticketing for the 2026 FIFA World Cup drew early scrutiny from gambling regulators in Switzerland.

Officials there are reviewing whether FIFA's sale of tradable digital tokens that can be swapped for match tickets should be treated under the country's gambling laws. The tokens have already brought in millions of dollars for world football's governing body. The Swiss watchdog Gespa said it is gathering information before deciding if further action is needed.

Estonian-based Bringin has launched its full Bitcoin financial services platform after successful beta testing. The platform offers eurozone users a comprehensive solution to save, store, send, receive, and spend Bitcoin in one simple app, allowing them to 'live the standard.'

Bringin, an Estonia-based Bitcoin financial services platform, has announced the full release of its comprehensive Bitcoin-to-euro solution, following an 18-month beta testing period during which approximately 1,000 early users transacted over €6 million. The platform aims to bridge the gap between Bitcoin self-custody and everyday financial needs for users in the eurozone.

The launch addresses longstanding challenges faced by Bitcoin holders in Europe, particularly the difficulties in converting and spending Bitcoin for daily transactions. Bringin's solution combines self-custodial Lightning Network functionality with traditional financial services, offering users the ability to manage both Bitcoin and euro transactions within a single application.

Key features of the platform include direct on-ramping to self-custody, Bitcoin-to-euro conversions through on-chain (11 minutes) or Lightning Network (5 seconds) transactions, and personal virtual IBAN accounts for each user. Users can gain access to both virtual and physical Visa debit cards with zero transaction fees, enabling Bitcoin spending anywhere Visa is accepted.

The platform's integrated approach allows users to handle significant Bitcoin-to-euro conversions exceeding 1 BTC, making it suitable for large purchases such as vehicles or property. The service also simplifies compliance and banking relationships through its dedicated virtual IBAN system, addressing a common pain point for Bitcoin users who frequently face banking restrictions or compliance challenges.

Bringin's solution is particularly noteworthy for its built-in Lightning Network wallet, eliminating the need for users to manage external wallets. This integration streamlines the Bitcoin experience for both experienced users and newcomers, providing a complete suite of Bitcoin-based financial services within a single application.

The platform's automatic conversion features enable users to maintain Bitcoin holdings while handling daily expenses through the Visa debit card system. This functionality allows users to effectively “live the standard” while maintaining practical access to the traditional financial system.

“Lightning is the fastest payment network on Earth, and we built Bringin on it from day one,” said Prashanth Chandrashekar, Co-founder & CEO/CTO of Bringin. “Moving seamlessly from self-custody to your bank account makes living on better money possible – money that can't be inflated away, that you actually control.”

The launch represents a significant step forward in making Bitcoin more practical for everyday use in Europe, combining the benefits of self-custody with the convenience of traditional banking services. The platform is now available for download on both Android and iPhone devices, offering eurozone residents a new way to integrate Bitcoin into their daily financial lives.

This development comes at a time when demand for seamless Bitcoin-to-fiat solutions continues to grow in Europe, particularly among users who prefer to self-custody their Bitcoin while maintaining easy access to the traditional financial system.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) and BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc. (NYSE:BMNR) are moving in lockstep, with ETH reclaiming $4,700 and BitMine stock rising more than 9% on the back of its massive $13.4 billion crypto treasury.

Trending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?

Ethereum has broken above the triangle structure that capped price since August, with buyers lifting the token through $4,600 resistance.

Trading volume and on-balance flows confirm renewed inflows, while moving averages stacked above $4,300 provide a strong base.

The breakout puts $5,000 back in focus, with potential extension toward $5,200 if momentum continues.

Analysts note that defending $4,500–$4,600 is essential for sustaining the move.

BMNR Technical Analysis (Source: TradingView)

BitMine Immersion, the largest corporate Ethereum holder, advanced more than 9% to trade above $62, breaking through its descending trendline and testing the top of a cup-and-handle structure.

The company disclosed holdings of 2.83 million ETH worth $12.8 billion as reported on Oct. 5, alongside $456 million in cash and $113 million in equity stakes.

Its balance sheet exposure makes BMNR a direct proxy for Ethereum's price.

BitMine ranks as the world's largest Ethereum treasury and the second-largest crypto treasury overall, behind Strategy Inc. (NASDAQ:MSTR).

Chairman Thomas ""Tom"" Lee said the company's goal is to reach ownership of 5% of total ETH supply, calling it part of the ""two supercycle narratives"" of artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency.

Lee told investors that Ethereum's role as the base layer for Wall Street adoption and blockchain AI integration will be ""one of the biggest macro trades over the next 10 to 15 years.""

The rise of BitMine as Ethereum's largest corporate holder marks a turning point in how equity markets price crypto exposure.

Unlike Bitcoin, where ETFs dominate headlines, Ethereum's corporate treasuries are quietly shaping a parallel playbook.

BitMine's ambition to own 5% of ETH supply would make it larger than most sovereign reserves and rival traditional commodity stockpiles.

The company's dual framing of Ethereum as both financial plumbing for Wall Street and infrastructure for AI creates a rare macro crossover.

This positions ETH not just as a cryptocurrency, but as the backbone of two of the century's biggest investment themes.

If ETH sustains above $4,600, BMNR's chart projects a retest of $70 and potentially a move toward $130, tying equity upside directly to Ethereum's trajectory.

Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes: Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey – no cost, no obligation.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

SoFi gives members access to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.

Range Wealth Management takes a modern, subscription-based approach to financial planning. Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.

For investors concerned about inflation or seeking portfolio protection, American Hartford Gold provides a simple way to buy and hold physical gold and silver within an IRA or direct delivery. With a minimum investment of $10,000, the platform caters to those looking to preserve wealth through precious metals while maintaining the option to diversify retirement accounts. It's a favored choice for conservative investors who want tangible assets that historically hold value during uncertain markets.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","A ‘spooky' Ethereum correlation suggests an imminent breakout","https://cointelegraph.com/news/this-spooky-ethereum-correlation-suggests-breakout-is-imminent","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 05:34:22 GMT","

 Ethereum is moving in tandem with small-cap stocks, and analysts say both assets could rise together with four potential Fed rate cuts ahead. 

Ethereum has been highly correlated with small-cap equities, which are very sensitive to interest rates, and analysts say both could move higher with more cuts on the horizon.

Analysts at macro investor outlet Milk Road said on Tuesday that there is an “almost spooky” correlation between Ether (ETH) and the Russell 2000 Index, which comprises small-cap equities.

Both are highly sensitive to interest rates, and with as many as four consecutive cuts potentially on the horizon, the analysts said to “expect both of them to move up in tandem.”

The Russell 2000 Index tracks 2,000 US public companies with a small market capitalization and is widely used to gauge the performance of the US economy.

CME futures markets currently predict a 95.7% chance of another 0.25% rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its Oct. 29 meeting and an 82.2% probability of a further cut in December. 

“Unlike Bitcoin, Ether generates yield, and that matters a lot in a world where rate cuts are not just priced in, but practically guaranteed,” Justin d'Anethan, head of partnerships at crypto private markets firm Arctic Digital, told Cointelegraph. 

ETH and the Russell 2000 also appear to show a cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish continuation pattern that marks a consolidation period followed by a breakout.

MN Fund founder Michaël van de Poppe stated on Wednesday that there are two reasons why the price of ETH will soon reach a new all-time high.

Firstly, the ETH/BTC trading pair “looks bottomed out” and is ready for a new leg upward, after a relatively normal correction.

Secondly, gold is “insanely parabolic,” after hitting a peak of over $4,000 per ounce, which means that it should be coming down at some point, “triggering the big risk-on switch.”

Related: Ethereum bulls tout supercycle, but Wall Street is skeptical

“If central banks globally move into easing mode, there's a strong case for capital rotating into risk assets with upside, and ETH fits that profile,” d'Anethan added. 

“ETH looks primed to break into all-time high territory, as it's finally finding stability above the $4,350s,” commented chart analyst Matt Hughes on Wednesday. 

Hughes targeted $5,200 as the next leg up for Ether, while analyst “Poseidon” said the cycle top would be $8,500.

Ether had corrected at the time of writing, trading down 6% on the day at $4,430, and approaching a key support zone near $4,400.

Ethereum experienced strong ETF inflows this week, even as the ETH price USD pulled back from recent highs. The market now faces a key technical test near $4,400 and possibly the $4,250–$4,300 zone, where buyers have shown early signs of defense. Bulls are eyeing new highs — but is $5,000 within reach for ETH or an impossible ceiling?

On October 7, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a combined inflow of approximately $420.9 million, with BlackRock contributing $437.5 million — the largest single-day addition among all issuers.

This marks one of the strongest daily accumulation events for ETH since ETF trading began, signaling continued institutional demand despite short-term market volatility. However, price action diverged from the inflow data, as the ETH price USD faced rejection from the $4,750–$4,800 resistance range, leading to a moderate retracement.

Ethereum's recent decline aligns with a 6.5% pullback from the local top, following a bearish divergence on the four-hour chart. The token fell below $4,500, finding temporary support around $4,400, a level that has acted as a pivot in previous trading sessions.

ETH now trades near $4,461. Defending this level is crucial, or the next possible steps are the $4,250-4,200 support area, which aligns with strong bid zones observed. A sustained hold above this range could confirm a short-term reversal pattern and potentially open the way for another test of the $4,750–$4,800 resistance.

Failure to maintain this support, however, may trigger a deeper correction toward $4,100–$4,000, where significant order blocks and historical demand exist on the daily timeframe.

The recent ETH retracement coincided with Bitcoin's dip below $121,000, while continued its upward momentum (with a recent ATH), drawing short-term market focus toward the BSC ecosystem as traders rotated capital across large-cap altcoins.

Despite near-term weakness, on-chain indicators continue to support a constructive long-term outlook for Ethereum. Data from CryptoQuant shows that total exchange reserves have declined to approximately 16.1 million ETH, representing a 25% reduction since 2022. This consistent downtrend in exchange-held supply suggests that investors are moving coins off centralized platforms and into staking contracts, self-custody wallets, and institutional-grade custodians.

Such behavior typically signals reduced short-term selling pressure, as coins held outside exchanges are less likely to be used for immediate liquidation. The rise of liquid staking solutions such as Lido and Rocket Pool has also contributed to this dynamic, with staked ETH now accounting for a steadily increasing share of circulating supply.

Ethereum's short-term outlook hinges on whether buyers can defend the $4,400 support area. ETF inflows remain a key bullish factor, but technical momentum has weakened in the near term. A strong rebound from current levels could confirm a continuation pattern toward $4,800–$5,000, while a breakdown would shift the focus toward $4,250 and possibly the $4,000 region.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

Ethereum digital asset treasury (DAT) Bit Digital announced on Wednesday that it had added 31,057 ETH, bringing the digital asset treasury's total to 150,244 ETH, which is valued at about $675 million.

The company said that it utilized the net proceeds from its recently completed $150 million convertible note offering to fund its latest round of Ethereum purchases.  Last month, it proposed a convertible note offering to purchase more ETH. Kraken Financial, Jump Trading Credit, and Jane Street Capital participated in the offering, Bit Digital said Wednesday.

""The structure of our convertible notes allowed us to raise capital at a premium to mNAV, and we have deployed those proceeds directly into ETH,"" Bit Digital CEO Sam Tabar said in a statement. ""Our guiding principle is to grow NAV per share, with the goal of creating long-term value for shareholders.""

NAV, or net asset value, helps measure how leveraged a DAT is by taking its total crypto assets held, minus liabilities, and then dividing the assets by the company's shares. An adjusted NAV, or mNAV, takes into account discounts and restrictions on tokens purchased. 

""The initial conversion price for the convertible notes of $4.16 per share represents an 8.2% premium to the company's estimated mNAV at the time of deal pricing,"" Bit Digital added.

Tabar told The Block last week that many companies building Ethereum treasuries are using ""extremely risky"" debt to acquire ETH. He said DATs should consider using unsecured debt financing over secured debt financing as a better hedge against a bearish market.

Founded in 2015, Bit Digital pivoted from a bitcoin mining operator to becoming ""a pure-play"" Ethereum staking and treasury company in July. At the time, the Nasdaq-listed company, ticker symbol BTBT, sold 280 bitcoin and used $173 million from a recent equity raise to fund the acquisition of Ethereum.

S&P Global has announced its plan to launch the S&P Digital Markets 50 Index. It will expand its S&P Dow Jones Indices and collaborate with tokenized US securities provider Dinari.

The index, as explained in S&P's press release, will merges 15 cryptocurrencies with 35 publicly traded blockchain-linked equities. It'll also introduce diversified exposure to digital-assets and bridge the gap between TradFi and DeFi.

The equity portion of the index will include companies engaged in digital-asset operations, infrastructure, blockchain technology, and financial services. The crypto portion will consist of digital assets selected from S&P's Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index.

This upcoming launch marks a significant milestone in S&P's growing digital-asset offer, especially at a time when institutional demand for regulated cryptos is on the rise.

Right now, this bold move places S&P ahead of its competitors, giving it good potential to capture a significant chunk of an expanding crypto market.

And as institutional interest gives crypto more legitimacy, the positive news sparks retail participation as well. Not only in bluechip cryptos, but new altcoins with higher short-term potential.

Cryptos like PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) and SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) are already emerging as the best altcoins to buy as market sentiment turns bullish.

Here's the lowdown on the new projects capturing the attention of everyday crypto investors.

As the first mine-to-earn meme coin, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) offers an interactive blockchain game with real meme coin rewards for top scoring players.

Launching on Ethereum after the token listing, the game lets you buy, upgrade, and optimize nodes to increase your mining power. The better your rig, the better your output and score.

This ups your chance to land at the top of the player leaderboard. And PepeNode will reward you with meme coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN for your skill and participation.



The best part? The game will be simple and lightweight enough to play on your browser or mobile. The project aims to make its P2E platform accessible to all with a simple setup, creating a sustainable model backed by real user activity.

$PEPENODE's token presale is equally impressive too — here's a closer look.

Having raised 1.7M+ so far, the project is already making waves and boasting community participation. $PEPENODE now sells for $0.0010918, with high staking rewards to boot (currently 741% APY).

Whales are accumulating bags worth as much as $94.1K and $18.2K, signalling strong confidence.

If our $PEPENODE price projections hold, the token could reach $0.0072 by 2026, giving this meme coin 6x potential in a bullish market. The next presale price jump is due in 30 hours.

Grab $PEPENODE before it launches.

SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) powers an AI-powered crypto creator platform. The project is on a mission to redefine the $85B online content industry. Built on Ethereum, SUBBD brings together premium content, staking rewards, and cutting-edge AI tools into a single Web3 ecosystem.

BNB ($BNB) is the native token of Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the world. It has evolved into a core utility and governance asset for a vast Web3 ecosystem.

$BNB follows ‘Build and Build' philosophy, meaning it supports innovation while employing an auto-burn mechanism, thereby reducing total supply to 100M over time.

What problem does $BNB solve?

For starters, it combats high transaction fees and slow settlement in crypto networks by enabling fast, low-cost, and scalable blockchain operations.

Another key advantage is the $BNB token unifying DeFi and CeFi utilities within a single ecosystem, bridging centralized and decentralized finance. Other key utilities include:



Alt text: Past 1M market performance of $BNB.

With a 50.46% price rally in the past 1M, $BNB touched its new ATH of $1300 yesterday surpassing $XRP and $Tether to claim third place in terms of market capitalization. The technical indicators too show a strong bullish phase for $BNB.

These patterns prove that the short-term and medium-term trends are reigniting the long-term uptrend. Additionally, the widening gap between the EMAs indicates accelerating momentum and solid buying pressure.

You can buy $BNB from Binance while $PEPENODE and $SUBBD are available through their presale websites.

Quick Recap → S&P Global's New Crypto Index is great news for institutional investors eyeing regulated crypto assets. But it also means bullish news for retail investors awaiting the next market surge.

Right now, bluechip cryptos like $BTC and $ETH are getting a lot of attention, but emerging tokens like $SUBBD and $PEPENODE might see more inflows as capital rotates during the next altcoin season.

This article isn't financial advice. Crypto is a high-risk, high-competition market with no guarantees.

The shortcut to crypto confidence: master the basics and get certified with Campus.

The DeFi landscape remains highly fragmented. Liquidity is siloed within isolated blockchains, and moving assets across them requires bridges that introduce latency, exorbitant fees, and significant counterparty risk. This fragmentation limits capital efficiency and undermines seamless user experiences.



Meanwhile, high-frequency trading and micropayments are unviable on-chain. Blockspace constraints and gas fees make real-time interactions cost-prohibitive and slow.

What's missing in the digital assets space is a purpose-built clearing layer that can unify fragmented liquidity, enable transparent price discovery, and scale with demand.

Yellow addresses fragmentation by introducing a chain-agnostic clearing network that drastically reduces cross-chain friction and settlement delays. Instead of settling each transaction on-chain, Yellow batches off-chain trades and finalizes only the net outcomes.

This architecture supports billions of off-chain messages per day, offering throughput that far exceeds existing Layer-1 and Layer-2 networks.

At its core, Yellow is a Layer-3 mesh network composed of state channels, designed to abstract away the underlying blockchains. It provides a unified virtual ledger where applications interact seamlessly across chains. 



Developers no longer need to engineer around interoperability challenges. They can build directly on Yellow, focusing on product logic and user experience rather than infrastructure.

Yellow's design draws inspiration from Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Participants post collateral into smart contracts on supported blockchain networks and open high-speed state channels with other brokers. Within these channels, liabilities are updated off-chain at high frequency while maintaining synchronized virtual balances.

When liabilities become significant or at scheduled settlement times, channels are closed and net settlements are written back to the base layer using state channel contracts. This eliminates the bottlenecks of on-chain settlements while preserving security and enforcing transaction finality.

By combining high-frequency off-chain updates with efficient net settlement, Yellow resolves two of DeFi's most critical pain points: multi-chain fragmentation and cross-chain communication latency. This lays the groundwork for scalable, trust-minimized financial infrastructure across all chains.

At the heart of Yellow's architecture is Nitrolite, a modular framework built on the ERC‑7824 standard for off-chain state channels. Nitrolite enables users and brokers to conduct real-time trading by exchanging liabilities and updating positions off-chain, while retaining cryptographic guarantees of enforceability through smart contracts. This setup ensures that all activity remains verifiable and enforceable on-chain.

Each broker on Yellow operates a ClearNode, which provides a trustless execution layer that functions as the network's message hub and settlement engine. ClearNodes coordinate high‑frequency liability updates across participants and enforce net settlements on multiple blockchains, forming the backbone of Yellow's chain-agnostic clearing network.

Gaming & Real-time Applications

Yellow's infrastructure is purpose-built to support gaming environments that require real-time responsiveness, on-chain asset ownership, and seamless cross-chain portability.

A working example is Ducklings, an NFT-based trading card game where players collect, trade, and evolve “duckling” NFTs. Gameplay includes purchasing booster packs, melding existing cards to create higher-rarity species, and earning token rewards through quests or ownership of rare cards. 

Yellow plans to introduce blockchain-agnostic NFT primitives that enable a seamless cross-chain user journey by processing the majority of operations off-chain through state channels.

Developers can leverage the same infrastructure to build cross-chain games in which assets minted on one blockchain can be used, traded, or recognized across others. This eliminates the need for constant bridging while preserving decentralization and asset sovereignty.

Trading & Payments

Yellow's founding mission is to build a lightning-fast, off-chain clearing and settlement network for digital assets, serving as a crypto-native analogue to the Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) in traditional securities markets.

At the core of this vision is NeoDAX, Yellow's modular brokerage infrastructure stack. It offers a streamlined setup experience and is designed for high scalability, capable of supporting hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. 

NeoDAX combines the performance of centralized exchanges (CEXs) with the security principles of decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

Yellow's peer-to-peer liquidity aggregation system mitigates counterparty risk through a fully automated net settlement process. The network levies a small clearing fee, calculated as a percentage of the net settlement liability, which directly funds the Yellow treasury.

Beyond exchange trading, Yellow facilitates cross-chain token transfers, which opens the door to broader applications, enabling near-instant, low-cost payments in contexts such as retail or live events.

At the same time, Yellow's role as a trustless, chain-agnostic clearing layer makes it more directly comparable to SWIFT's function in global financial markets, which is a neutral infrastructure layer that connects fragmented institutions and ensures secure, efficient settlement across borders. In the digital asset space, Yellow provides that same backbone for brokers and exchanges operating across multiple blockchains.

Enterprise Integration

Yellow's modular architecture allows enterprises to integrate crypto functionality gradually, adding components such as sign-in modules, custody contracts, trading interfaces, and admin panels directly into their existing Web2 products. This incremental approach reduces technical overhead and accelerates time-to-market for digital asset features.

Because Yellow is chain-agnostic, enterprises can support multiple blockchains without hassle. State channels abstract away the complexities of cross-chain settlement and collateral management, enabling seamless interaction across disparate networks. 

For instance, a fintech or e-commerce company can integrate Yellow to offer asset trading or token-based payments within their existing services. A ticketing platform can embed a Yellow-compatible wallet to enable users to purchase event tickets and merchandise with digital assets from any supported blockchain.

This benefits developers through plug-and-play modules that accelerate deployment, while users enjoy a frictionless, low-fee experience. The result is a significantly lower barrier to Web3 integration for traditional businesses looking to expand into the realm of digital assets.

Yellow's Layer-3 clearing network addresses liquidity fragmentation more effectively than bridges or single-chain DEX aggregators, by linking brokers and exchanges across multiple blockchains through state-channel infrastructure.

Because only the net outcome of trade batches is written to the base chain, Yellow achieves throughput on par with centralized exchanges, far exceeding what today's Layer-1 and Layer-2 blockchains can support.

Its chain-agnostic design contrasts with other interoperability solutions that require bespoke bridge infrastructure or custom chain adapters, allowing developers to build cross-chain products without dealing with low-level plumbing.

Its trustless model further distinguishes Yellow from legacy clearing houses, since collateral is locked in smart contracts rather than with centralized intermediaries, mitigating counterparty default risk and preserving user control.

Finally, regulatory alignment differentiates Yellow from most DeFi protocols by mirroring traditional capital market structures, separating custody, clearing, and execution, while still allowing KYC/AML enforcement at the network edge. This reduces compliance friction and simplifies licensing requirements across jurisdictions. 

Several upcoming milestones could be critical in driving Yellow's initial adoption.

In 2025, the team plans to deliver the first major release of the ClearNode technology stack, establishing the foundation for Yellow's production-ready clearing infrastructure.

Following this, the roadmap includes expanding support for both EVM and non‑EVM blockchains, introducing account-abstraction-enabled cross-chain swaps, and growing the brokerage ecosystem. Together, these steps will broaden protocol utility while reducing integration barriers for developers and partners.

Yellow abstracts away the complexity of interoperability, enabling builders to easily integrate the Layer-3 network into their applications. Gaming studios, fintech platforms, and emerging DeFi apps can tap into Yellow without re-engineering their infrastructure, accelerating time-to-market and expanding the protocol's network effects.

The introduction of the native protocol token, YELLOW, adds a powerful economic layer to the network. Transaction and clearing fees will be paid in YELLOW, and brokers must lock the token as collateral to open state channels. If a participant fails to settle within the pre-agreed period, their deposit can be slashed, creating strong incentives for honest behavior.

Institutional backing further strengthens Yellow's position. A $10 million seed round led by Ripple co‑founder Chris Larsen, with participation from Consensys Ventures and GSR Capital, signals strong industry confidence.

As traditional financial institutions deepen their investment in modern, blockchain‑based clearing systems, Yellow's trustless, scalable design aligns well with evolving infrastructure demands.

Ultimately, the pace and scale of adoption will depend on execution and market receptivity. But with a solid technical roadmap, regulatory alignment, and strong capital backing, Yellow has the foundations to play an important role in emerging cross-chain financial infrastructure.

In an era where digital identities seem to be everything, the Imperia NFT collection is making waves as a game-changing solution for identity verification in decentralized finance (DeFi). This innovative approach not only boosts security and privacy but also gives users the reins over their personal data. Buckle up as we explore the implications of these Imperia NFTs and how they're poised to reshape the identity verification landscape in DeFi.

Decentralized finance is more than just a buzzword; it signifies a monumental shift in the financial world. By harnessing blockchain technology, it creates an open and permissionless financial ecosystem. Forget about middlemen; DeFi allows users to interact directly with financial services. While it democratizes access to financial tools, it also raises new hurdles, especially concerning identity verification and security.

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become all the rage, serving as unique digital assets that can represent everything from art to virtual real estate. But their utility doesn't stop there. The Imperia NFT collection serves as a prime example of how NFTs can be harnessed for identity verification in DeFi. By linking NFTs to decentralized identifiers (DIDs), users can attach verifiable identity data points, creating a solid framework for identity verification that is both auditable and privacy-preserving.

The Imperia NFT collection could change the identity verification game in DeFi in several significant ways:

Decentralized and Scalable Verification: Linking NFTs to DIDs means multiple identity data points like social accounts and KYC info can be attached. This decentralization cuts reliance on centralized authorities, making the verification process more efficient.

Security and Privacy: Blockchain technology guarantees that identity credentials are stored securely. Cryptographic protection helps minimize fraud and identity theft while keeping sensitive information under the user's control.

Regulatory Compliance Meets Privacy: Users can store verified KYC credentials in their wallets, allowing them to share selective identity data. This helps DeFi platforms adhere to AML/KYC regulations without sacrificing user privacy.

Interoperability and User Control: Identity tokens as NFTs can be used across various DeFi services, giving users more control over their identity data.

Trust and Transparency: The public verification of identity data linked to the Imperia NFTs builds trust among users, creators, and platforms, which is crucial for secure digital transactions.

While the Imperia NFT collection opens doors for better identity verification, startups in the crypto banking space may find the implementation tricky. Integrating decentralized payroll tools and complying with regulatory frameworks can be challenging. However, the emergence of crypto-friendly payroll platforms and decentralized banks offers startups a chance to innovate.

The Imperia NFT collection paints a picture of a future where identity verification in decentralized finance is secure, user-focused, privacy-preserving, and compliant with regulations. By employing NFTs and decentralized identifiers, this approach overcomes the shortcomings of traditional systems, paving the way for a more inclusive and effective digital identity ecosystem. As DeFi keeps evolving, the Imperia NFTs stand as a testament to what blockchain can achieve in redefining identity verification and empowering users in the digital age.

DOOD, the native token of the Doodles NFT collection, hit a new all-time high on Tuesday, Oct. 7, after South Korean crypto exchange Upbit announced it would list the token.

In an X post on Oct. 7, Upbit said DOOD would be available for trading paired with Korean won (KRW) and Tether's USDT.

Shortly after the announcement, DOOD soared by over 110% to a new all-time high of $0.01753; however, the token quickly retraced, down 36% as of press time, according to CoinGecko.

The listing pushed Upbit to the top spot for DOOD trading, accounting for over 66% of global volume with roughly $190 million traded in the DOOD/KRW pair that day, surpassing Bybit and Gate's USDT-based DOOD volumes, CoinGecko shows.

NFT metrics for the collection also spiked amid the listing news. Data from NFTPriceFloor shows that Doodles' trading volume jumped 218% on the day, with sales up more than 190%.

Doodles launched the DOOD token in May as part of an effort to expand its ecosystem beyond NFTs and introduce broader community participation. According to the project's tokenomics, 30% of the supply was airdropped to existing Doodles holders, while 13% was reserved for “New Blood,” a program designed to attract new users.

Another 25% went to the Ecosystem Fund to finance collaborations and development within the Doodles universe. The team received 17%, and Doodles Inc. retained 5%, both subject to a one-year lock and three-year vesting period. The remaining 10% was allocated to liquidity provision.

In mid-September, The Defiant reported that South Korea's biggest internet company, Naver, is in advanced talks to acquire Dunamu Inc., the operator of Upbit, through a stock-swap deal. The move would place Dunamu under Naver's financial services division.

Naver is South Korea's largest internet platform, with over 30 million users of its mobile payment service Naver Pay and annual revenue exceeding 11 trillion won (around $8 billion).

Bitcoin is the one cryptocurrency whose name is known throughout the world, even among those who know nothing of the crypto industry. As the first cryptocurrency and the founder of the crypto sector, Bitcoin has been the #1 coin for around 16 years now.

Created by the mysterious individual or team known as Satoshi Nakamoto which remains unknown to the public to this day, BTC is the biggest and most valuable asset, currently with a $2.4 trillion market cap and a price of $121,740 per coin as of October 8.

However, despite being the most important cryptocurrency ever created, Bitcoin is heavily outdated as of 2025, at least when it comes to its technology. Its technical limitations were clear to many since the early days, as they noticed that Bitcoin's network is slow, capable of processing only a handful of transactions per second, which eventually led to the high cost of transfer fees.

Over the years, there have been several attempts to create scalability solutions that would speed things up, and while they saw different degree of success, Bitcoin is about to see a new arrival that many view as the next crypto to explode, and that might change things for its entire network - Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER).

Bitcoin Hyper is a complex project with a big plan and the means to pull it off.

The project uses Bitcoin's own brand in its name, while it made itself look like a new version of Pepe by using its likeness to represent the face of the project.

It poses as a meme coin in the BTC network, but it also acts as a scalability solution. This is possible thanks to the fact that Bitcoin Hyper is the fastest Bitcoin Layer-2 chain to date, promising to bring scalability and speed for the industry's oldest and largest asset.

It was designed to break through Bitcoin's core limitations, namely slow transactions, high fees, and the lack of programmability, by introducing an L2 chain that would solve these problems.

By offering an L2 network that is fast and scalable, Bitcoin Hyper could enable fast and cheap payments, but also the development of dApps, DeFi protocols, NFTs, and new meme coins and other altcoins.

It can achieve this by integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which will bring smart contracts to Bitcoin's system through a decentralized Canonical Bridge, thus enabling seamless and secure transfers between Bitcoin's base layer and Bitcoin Hyper.

With this solution, Bitcoin Hyper can reimagine what is possible to do on the BTC network, and it believes that this will change it entirely, even going as far as to say that 2025 will be remembered as the year when Bitcoin Hyper changed everything.

Given its potential, Bitcoin Hyper is now widely considered among many investors as the next crypto to explode. Needless to say, the expectations are high, but for now, the project remains in presale.

It features a total public supply of 21 billion HYPER tokens, which are split to satisfy several needs.

25% will go to the Treasury

20% is to be used for marketing purposes

15% will be granted to users in the form of staking rewards

10% will be used to finance listings

30% will be reinvested in the project's continued development

As mentioned, the presale is still active, and so far, Bitcoin Hyper has managed to raise over $22.87 million, becoming one of the most successful ICOs in 2025.

And just like that...BOOM! 22M Raised! 🔥⚡️ pic.twitter.com/UEeJ2ukj79

Its token, HYPER, is currently selling for $0.013085 per token, but its price will slowly increase as the presale continues to move from one stage to the next, until it finally sees listing. After that, its price will be at the mercy of market trends, demand, usage, and other similar factors that typically make crypto prices move.

The ICO has already attracted the attention of experts, such as those behind the crypto YouTube channel 99Bitcoins, which has over 722k subscribers. The channel's experts recently reported on the progress of Bitcoin Hyper's ICO, pointing it out as the next 1000x crypto, and recommending to their subscribers to buy it now, especially in light of Bitcoin already pumping.

The massive amount that the ICO has raised already suggests that crypto whales have already decided that the token is worthy of their time and money, but many retail investors have placed their funds on the line, as well.

As holders, they stand to enjoy multiple benefits, such as the ability to stake their HYPER tokens for rewards (currently 52% p/a or 199.77 HYPER per ETH block, or use them to gain ecosystem access. This includes privileged access to dApps, presales, and early-stage features.

Holders will also be able to participate in community incentive programs and token distribution events. In other words, HYPER does not lack when it comes to utilities, and it will even act as the governance token of the Bitcoin Hyper network, allowing users to vote on various decisions and contribute to shaping the project's future.

Bitcoin Hyper is currently the biggest ICO in Q4 and most likely the next crypto to explode. Many experts throughout the crypto sector agree on this point, expecting great things from the project, which could revolutionize the Bitcoin network, and with it, the broader crypto industry.

For now, however, HYPER is still in presale, available at a very low price, representing a unique opportunity to add it to your portfolio before its value skyrockets.

However, investors should still do their own research before buying, and only purchase the token if they find that they share the opinions of the experts, since there are no guarantees in the crypto sector, and if you decide to buy an asset, you should always know exactly why you are doing it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","UK Upper Tribunal hands down judgment on Clearview AI Inc","https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/articles/UK+Upper+Tribunal+hands+down+judgment+on+Clearview+AI+Inc+08102025161000?open","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:10:55 GMT","

The Upper Tribunal (UT) has handed down its judgment in the UK Information Commissioner's appeal against the First-tier Tribunal (FTT) decision on Clearview AI Inc (Clearview). 

In May 2022, the Commissioner fined US-based company Clearview £7.5m and issued an enforcement notice for scraping images of UK residents from the web and social media, and then uploading them into its global online database that could be used for facial recognition by any Clearview customer. The company not only enables identification of those people, but monitors their behaviour, offering it as a commercial service. 

Clearview appealed the fine and enforcement notice to the FTT, with the ICO appealing the FTT's decision to the UT. 

In October 2025, the UT upheld three of the Commissioner's four grounds of appeal, concluding that: 

The Commissioner welcomes the UT decision, as it clarifies the material and territorial scope provisions of the UK GDPR. The ruling reaffirms that companies that wish to monitor the behaviour of UK residents will be in scope of UK data protection law, regardless of where the company is based in the world.  

John Edwards, UK Information Commissioner, said:

""The UT's decision has upheld our ability to protect UK residents from having their data, including images, unlawfully scraped and then used in a global online database without their knowledge. 

""The ruling also gives greater confidence to people in the UK that we can and will act on their behalf, regardless of where the company handling their personal information is based. It is essential that foreign organisations are held accountable when their technologies impact the information rights and freedoms of individuals in the UK."" 

The UT's decision is legally binding and will guide future cases involving similar jurisdictional questions. 

The UT directed that this case should be sent back to the FTT to determine the substantive appeal on the basis that the Commissioner had jurisdiction to issue the monetary penalty notice and enforcement notice. 

Clearview can seek permission to appeal the UT's decision.

With the CBDC retail sandbox, fintech players can access APIs, build prototypes, and test products in a secure, simulated environment

Fintechs can either join the sandbox directly or through their partner banks. The RBI said that the move will encourage faster experimentation and reduce operational risks for participants

The RBI is also developing Unified Markets Interface (UMI) to enable tokenisation of financial assets and settlements using wholesale CBDC.

The RBI has launched a CBDC retail sandbox to open up access to digital rupee for fintech players and startups.

Until now, only a few pilot banks could test the CBDC through closed systems. With the retail sandbox, fintech players can now access APIs, build prototypes, and test products in a secure, simulated environment.

“The CBDC retail sandbox will give innovators the space to experiment and build on top of the digital rupee,” RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said while announcing the launch at the Global Fintech Fest 2025. “It will help create new use cases, improve customer experience, and add value to ongoing pilots.”

Fintechs can either join the sandbox directly or through their partner banks. The RBI said that the move will encourage faster experimentation and reduce operational risks for participants.

Digital Rupee (e₹) or the central bank digital currency (CBDC) is issued by the RBI. It offers features similar to physical cash like convenience of use, guarantee of the RBI, finality of settlement, among others.

To further promote the usage of CBDC, the central bank is also developing a new financial market infrastructure called the Unified Markets Interface (UMI) to enable tokenisation of financial assets and settlements using wholesale CBDC.

The governor said that the UMI will allow tokenisation of financial assets and make settlements more transparent and efficient through smart contracts. Early pilot results, he said, have been encouraging.

The central bank also launched a pilot for tokenised certificates of deposit (CDs).

“Asset tokenisation offers new possibilities for India's financial markets — expanding access, improving transparency, and enabling faster settlements through smart contracts,” Malhotra said. 

He added that the RBI has also conceptualised a Unified Market Interface for tokenisation of financial assets which can be settled using wholesale CBDC.

The pilot platform includes an embedded sandbox for banks, non-banks, and fintechs to experiment and innovate. It will allow tokenised CDs to be issued and settled digitally, helping reduce friction in interbank markets.

Governor Malhotra also underlined that India's success in digital finance has come from close cooperation between regulators, industry, and government. “The synergy between public rails and private innovation is one of the main reasons for India's digital success,” he said.

Besides, the governor also emphasised the need for Unified Lending Interface (ULI) to revolutionise credit models using data, similar to what UPI has been to digital transactions. “Despite best efforts by the RBI, there still is a huge unmatched demand in delivery of credit. ULI can be a bridge in meeting this need,” Malhotra.

Since its launch, the governor added that it has expanded to 120 data sources and services, 58 lenders and 3.2 Mn loans have been sanctioned amounting to INR 1.7 Tn. 

RBI piloted the ULI (originally known as the Public Tech Platform for Frictionless Credit) in August 2023. The pilot focused on streamlining and digitising credit delivery for products such as Kisan Credit Card loans, Dairy Loans, MSME loans, personal loans and home loans using integrated data sources like Aadhaar e-KYC, land records, PAN validation, and account aggregators.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is working to finalize a new ‘innovation exemption' by the end of 2025.

It's a huge change from the old way of doing things. The previous approach, which many called ‘regulation by enforcement,' made it difficult for crypto companies to grow in the U.S., pushing much of the innovation overseas.

If the SEC achieves its goal, we could see more innovation like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which aims to transform the original digital currency.

The ‘innovation exemption' is less of a free pass and more of a supervised test kitchen. This new framework is part of a bigger project called ‘Project Crypto.'

It's designed to give companies building in DeFi, tokenization, and other new financial areas some breathing room. They'll receive temporary relief from specific SEC rules, which means they can test out their ideas without incurring substantial expenses on lawyers or facing constant litigation.



For the SEC, it's a chance to get a front-row seat to see how the new technologies actually work in the real world. This direct observation will help them create better, more sensible rules for the future.

And if innovation is the order of the day, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the main dish as a way to bring $BTC to the modern era.

If we're being real, Bitcoin is the king of crypto, but it's not exactly a speed demon. It's like a secure, digital vault, but you wouldn't use it to buy a coffee because transactions are slow and can be pricey.

That's where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) zips in to save the day. It's a groundbreaking new project that has already raised $22 million, designed to address this problem by building a Layer-2 network directly on top of Bitcoin.



Think of it like a new high-speed lane on the Bitcoin highway. This new lane allows for super-fast, super-cheap transactions without compromising Bitcoin's rock-solid security.

It's a game-changer that could finally make Bitcoin useful for everything from quick payments to cool new decentralized apps and games.

If you want a further breakdown on the project, we've got you covered.

So, how does this magic work? Bitcoin Hyper utilizes the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to power its Layer 2 network. This means you get Bitcoin's top-tier security with speeds that feel like Solana.

To use it, simply send your Bitcoin through a Canonical Bridge, which essentially locks it up and provides a wrapped version for use on the new, faster network. Now, this wrapped $BTC is ready to party.



You can use it for fast transactions and explore various DeFi projects. The best part? $HYPER's presale is already attracting ‘whale' buys, which shows that the smart money believes this could be the future.

It's all about making Bitcoin more than just a place to store value; it's about making it a living, breathing ecosystem. If that comes to fruition, you'd be looking at returns of 2345% on today's price if it can reach our end-of-2025 price prediction of $0.32.

Please note that this is not intended as financial advice, and you should always conduct your own research before making any investment decisions.

The Bank of North Dakota announced Wednesday plans to launch the Roughrider coin, the state's first stablecoin.

Stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that can facilitate instant money transfers, streamline bank-to-bank transactions and, potentially, be used by North Dakotans in daily life down the road. Unlike bitcoin, stablecoin is not subject to volatile price swings because it's backed by conventional financial assets, overwhelmingly the U.S. dollar.

North Dakota's state-owned bank is partnering with Fiserv, a Fortune 500 financial technology company, to introduce stablecoin into the state's banking system, officials announced at a conference in Bismarck. 

Bank of North Dakota President and CEO Don Morgan said the move aims to ensure “the continued health, resilience and relevancy” of North Dakota banks and credit unions.

“We have a 106-year history of commitment to North Dakota agriculture, commerce, and industry through our financial institution partnerships,” Morgan said in a statement. “The development of the Roughrider coin reflects that commitment.”

The first test of the stablecoin in North Dakota banks and credit unions is expected to occur in 2026. It will require the approval of the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which oversees the Bank of North Dakota.

“As one of the first states to issue our own stablecoin backed by real money, North Dakota is taking a cutting-edge approach to creating a secure and efficient financial ecosystem for our citizens,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the Industrial Commission, said in a statement. 

Stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology, similar to bitcoin.

Most stablecoins, like the Roughrider coin being proposed in North Dakota, are tied to the value of the U.S. dollar. Federal law requires each stablecoin in circulation to be matched by a U.S. dollar or equivalent, such as a short-term U.S. Treasury note, held in reserve by a financial institution. That's why stablecoin is not subject to the volatile price swings of bitcoin and other popular digital assets.

This digital currency is issued, or minted, on demand as the need arises. When the owner of the stablecoin wants to redeem it, the currency is dissolved, or burned, and taken out of circulation. 

The Bank of North Dakota is envisioning stablecoins to primarily be used in bank-to-bank transactions, said Rick Geloff, the bank's executive vice president. Money transfers that used to take days will be able to take place within minutes, he said. 

“That's what we're trying to make sure that our financial institutions in North Dakota can do is move that money quicker and more efficiently,” Geloff said.

The name Roughrider honors the volunteer military unit led by President Theodore Roosevelt. 

Customers are unlikely to notice any significant differences in their banking experience as a result of the Roughrider coin's implementation, Geloff said, because most of the changes will take place behind the scenes.

While stablecoins are used elsewhere in the world in daily transactions with a merchant or retailer, that's not the goal of North Dakota's Roughrider coin initially. 

“This would be more of the back end, helping banks facilitate payments to each other,” Geloff said. 

That could change in the future if retailers and other businesses begin accepting stablecoin as a form of payment. 

Dan McGonegle, senior manager of the digital assets team at accounting and consulting firm Crowe, said one advantage to stablecoin from a merchant's perspective may be significantly lower transaction fees. Merchants have to pay fees to process payments made with credit or debit cards. Stablecoin potentially offers a cheaper alternative, he said. If merchants choose to encourage customers to use the digital currency as a way to lower their costs, that could speed up widespread adoption. 

“If I'm a large merchant, then I may have real incentive to encourage my customers to transact in stablecoins,” McGonegle said. “I think it still remains to be seen how that could all play out.”

Earlier this year, Wyoming took a different approach and launched its own stablecoin known as the Frontier Stable Token. Geloff said this is an example of stablecoins being marketed for use by the public. 

Stablecoin has been more widely adopted in countries where the traditional currency is volatile, such as Venezuela and Argentina, Geloff said. 

The Bank of North Dakota began exploring stablecoin after federal legislation, called the Genius Act, was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. 

This law created 80% of the federal regulatory framework for stablecoin, Geloff said, providing certainty and safeguards that have made it possible for mainstream financial institutions to begin considering using it.

It's a new financial tool that offers a lot of potential, but can be daunting to begin using, said Kelvin Hullet, the bank's chief business development officer. So the bank, like it did when the internet was introduced to the banking world, is doing the legwork on behalf of its local banking partners to ensure they can take advantage, he said.

The Bank of North Dakota is working with Fiserv to create the Roughrider coin, hosted on Fiserv's digital asset platform, for use in bank-to-bank money transfers. 

The bank will present an analysis to the North Dakota Industrial Commission about how banks will use the new tool, a risk assessment to ensure the appropriate safeguards are in place, and cost projections. 

If the plan is approved, the Bank of North Dakota will roll out a pilot project with a handful of local financial institutions as partners. 

The federal Genius Act was a signal that the bank needed to consider adopting the technology or get left behind, Hullet said.

“Congress has now put a framework around this. The train is leaving the station, and we need to be not only on the train, but we need to bring our local financial institutions along with us, so that they are able to utilize this new technology as it moves forward,” Hullet said.

Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation.

Hype about stablecoins is everywhere, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley to the halls of Congress. But even as interest around the dollar-backed cryptocurrencies grows, companies are still trying to solve the challenge of making them as easy to use as credit cards or digital wallets like Venmo and PayPal. One of the space's leaders is the startup Coinflow, which announced on Wednesday it has raised $25 million in fresh funding to help merchants use stablecoins to achieve faster money movement. Pantera Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Reciprocal Ventures, and Jump Capital participated in the Series A round.

Led by cofounder and CEO Daniel Lev, Coinflow is a payment service provider, or PSP, going head-to-head against competitors such as Stripe and Worldpay amid the race to remake global transactions with blockchain technology. But Lev is confident that his scrappier startup can challenge the giants. “Stablecoins is a paradigm shift,” he told Fortune. “There will be a net new winner who was built natively on this technology.”





Coinflow addresses a core problem for many businesses: Even if a customer swipes their card to make a payment, it can often take hours or even days for the merchant to receive the money. By using stablecoins as the intermediary layer, Lev says they can get that time down to seconds. 





He argues that Coinflow is creating the next evolution for digital dollars. PSPs like Toast, Square, and Stripe revolutionized payments by allowing both physical and online companies to process transactions through point-of-sale terminals and web interfaces, but legacy networks run by the likes of Mastercard and Visa restrict the speed and cost efficiency of their operations. Stablecoin advocates argue that blockchain technology improves both, with companies like Coinflow allowing pay-ins and pay-outs through fiat so that merchants never even have to deal with stablecoins themselves. 





Coinflow has its own partnerships with banks around the world such as Cross River, as well as different stablecoin issuers, which allow it to mint and burn stablecoins directly, and then convert in and out of different currencies and settle payments instantly. It also works across different blockchains, including Solana and Ethereum, though Lev says that most customers are agnostic about the options, caring more about speed and fees.




Lev started Coinflow in 2022 just as Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX was collapsing and enthusiasm around crypto was at an all-time low. “It only took four years of us developing the software and people laughing at us,” he joked. “But now it's consensus that this is a superpower for moving money.”





Though many of Coinflow's early customers operated in the crypto realm, this began to change after Stripe made major acquisitions in the space, first buying the stablecoin startup Bridge in 2024 for $1.1 billion before later acquiring the crypto wallet company Privy earlier this year. This exposed more merchants to the technology and, combined with the Trump administration's embrace of crypto and Congress's passage of the Genius Act in July, meant that non-blockchain companies felt more comfortable exploring it. “It has not stopped compounding since,” says Lev, who added that most of Coinflow's growth is now from non-crypto companies. 





The bigger challenge for Coinflow will be staving off Stripe, which has delved further into stablecoins since its acquisitions, including launching a new product last week that allows companies to create their own stablecoins. With around 25 employees, Coinflow is significantly smaller than the $106.7 billion behemoth, but Lev argues that his company's in-house talent and existing relationships across the banking and infrastructure sectors make it competitive. And as companies explore different PSPs to manage payments, he's confident the best option will win out. “If you can perform better and faster, then volume naturally flows to you,” Lev says.

Decentralized AI skill market Recall Network announced on Wednesday that it will debut its native token, RECALL, on Oct. 15, with select early supporters receiving airdrop access.

The ERC-20 token will be generated on Coinbase's Layer 2 network Base and can be bridged to other blockchain networks, Recall said in a press release shared exclusively with CoinDesk. 

This release is supported by a coalition of leading AI-focused partners, including Eliza, Sapien, Gaia, Cookie, Olas, Morpheus, Intuition, Protocol Labs, and Lit, all sharing a vision of accelerating global progress through decentralized AI ecosystems.

Token holders will utilize RECALL to crowdfund AI tools and solutions tailored to their specific needs. Developers creating successful AI agents and models, as well as individuals who help select the best ones, will earn RECALL tokens. 

This will ensure that only the best AI products get rewarded and top the platform's leaderboards. Token holders can also vote on protocol upgrades and treasury allocations.

By enabling token holders to fund, rank, and reward AI tools tailored to their specific needs, Recall is shifting AI development away from closed, centralized systems toward an open market where the best AI gets incentivized.

""Skill markets accelerate the development of quality AI towards the diverse needs of humanity by giving people the power to crowdfund AI tools for the use cases they need and earn by ranking the best submissions,” Andrew Hill, CEO of Recall Labs, said.

“Whether you need crypto trading bots or python coding tools, for the first time, you now have a say in what AI gets built, and the incentives to ensure only the best AI gets rewarded,"" Hill added.

Recall, a result of the merger between Textile and Ceramic development company 3Box Labs, is a decentralized skill marketplace where AI models (or agents) can compete, showcase their specific skills, and be evaluated transparently on a blockchain. Recall launched its public testnet in March 2025.

At the time of the launch, 200 million RECALL tokens will be made available for use, representing 20% of the total supply of 1 billion tokens.

Out of the total tokens, the largest portion – 30% – will be dedicated to supporting the community and growing the ecosystem. These tokens can be used to fund user rewards, platform development, grants, and strategic partnerships, thereby enhancing adoption.

An additional 27% of tokens will be unlocked after the first year, with the remaining 73% scheduled for a gradual release over the subsequent 48 months.

""We're proud to reward early supporters and launch with a world-class list of partners who share our vision for accelerating human and AI alignment and bringing attention to AI solutions that actually work,” Michael Sena, CMO of Recall Labs, said.

When the mainnet goes live, Recall will start with markets already set up for crypto trading AI agents, enabling users to monetize their knowledge about how well these agents perform. People can join in by staking RECALL tokens through the platform's app at app.recall.network. More markets focused on different AI skills will open soon after.

Recall began by targeting crypto trading as its initial market and use case, leveraging its high volume, clear metrics, and relevance to the crypto community.

This focus has enabled the platform to quickly scale to over 1.4 million users, spanning 11 distinct markets, 155,000 AI solutions, and more than 9.5 million curation signals.

Building on this momentum, the AI project plans to expand into related crypto markets, introducing AI agents and models that go beyond trading. It's ultimate aim is to become an open marketplace where any AI skill with sufficient interest can be developed, funded, and curated by the community.

 The company behind President Donald Trump's memecoin is seeking $200 million to build a treasury aimed at supporting the token's price, which has plunged 90% from its peak. 

The startup behind US President Donald Trump's official memecoin is seeking to raise at least $200 million to build a digital-asset treasury aimed at buying back the token, which has collapsed about 90% from its peak.

Fight Fight Fight LLC, led by Trump ally and longtime promoter Bill Zanker, is spearheading the effort, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The funding target could reach as high as $1 billion, although the deal remains in its early stages and may not materialize. 

The move marked the latest attempt to revive the token's price, which has plunged from its all-time high of $75 in January to about $8, according to CoinMarketCap data. The Official Trump (TRUMP) is down more than 10% over the past month. 

According to Messari, about 35% of the Trump token's supply is currently unlocked and tradeable, giving it a circulating market value of $1.5 billion. The remaining 65%, around 800 million tokens, is held by Trump-related entities and locked under vesting schedules.

In May, Trump attended a private dinner with top holders of his memecoin, where about 220 guests, including Tron founder Justin Sun, dined on filet mignon and halibut under “Fight Fight Fight” banners. Outside, over 100 protesters denounced the event as political profiteering, holding signs accusing Trump of “crypto corruption.” 

Following the event, 35 House members asked the public integrity section acting chief, Edward Sullivan, to launch an inquiry into the memecoin dinner to determine whether it violated the federal bribery statute or the foreign emoluments clause of the US Constitution. 

As Cointelegraph reported, Trump also faced scrutiny after speaking at the event while standing behind a lectern emblazoned with the official presidential seal, a move that may violate federal law.

While Fight Fight Fight's token treasury remains conceptual, other Trump-affiliated ventures have already proceeded with similar initiatives. 

In August, ALT5 Sigma Corporation announced plans to raise $1.5 billion through the sale of 200 million common shares at $7.50 each. The funds will be used to build out its World Liberty Financial (WLFI) corporate treasury.

Last month, 99% of WLFI holders also approved a token-burning strategy to reduce the supply and boost the value of the token. Under the plan, fees generated from WLFI-managed liquidity pools will be used for token repurchases, which will then be permanently removed from circulation via burns.

 Ethereum is moving in tandem with small-cap stocks, and analysts say both assets could rise together with four potential Fed rate cuts ahead. 

Ethereum has been highly correlated with small-cap equities, which are very sensitive to interest rates, and analysts say both could move higher with more cuts on the horizon.

Analysts at macro investor outlet Milk Road said on Tuesday that there is an “almost spooky” correlation between Ether (ETH) and the Russell 2000 Index, which comprises small-cap equities.

Both are highly sensitive to interest rates, and with as many as four consecutive cuts potentially on the horizon, the analysts said to “expect both of them to move up in tandem.”

The Russell 2000 Index tracks 2,000 US public companies with a small market capitalization and is widely used to gauge the performance of the US economy.

CME futures markets currently predict a 95.7% chance of another 0.25% rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its Oct. 29 meeting and an 82.2% probability of a further cut in December. 

“Unlike Bitcoin, Ether generates yield, and that matters a lot in a world where rate cuts are not just priced in, but practically guaranteed,” Justin d'Anethan, head of partnerships at crypto private markets firm Arctic Digital, told Cointelegraph. 

ETH and the Russell 2000 also appear to show a cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish continuation pattern that marks a consolidation period followed by a breakout.

MN Fund founder Michaël van de Poppe stated on Wednesday that there are two reasons why the price of ETH will soon reach a new all-time high.

Firstly, the ETH/BTC trading pair “looks bottomed out” and is ready for a new leg upward, after a relatively normal correction.

Secondly, gold is “insanely parabolic,” after hitting a peak of over $4,000 per ounce, which means that it should be coming down at some point, “triggering the big risk-on switch.”

Related: Ethereum bulls tout supercycle, but Wall Street is skeptical

“If central banks globally move into easing mode, there's a strong case for capital rotating into risk assets with upside, and ETH fits that profile,” d'Anethan added. 

“ETH looks primed to break into all-time high territory, as it's finally finding stability above the $4,350s,” commented chart analyst Matt Hughes on Wednesday. 

Hughes targeted $5,200 as the next leg up for Ether, while analyst “Poseidon” said the cycle top would be $8,500.

Ether had corrected at the time of writing, trading down 6% on the day at $4,430, and approaching a key support zone near $4,400.

 Strategy's $78 billion stash of Bitcoin is close to the cash positions held by Amazon, Google and Microsoft, the last of which rejected Bitcoin as a treasury asset last year. 

Strategy's near-$80 billion Bitcoin treasury is catching up to the massive cash positions of tech giants such as Microsoft, whose shareholders rejected a proposal in December to explore adding Bitcoin to its books.

Strategy posted to X on Tuesday that its 640,031 Bitcoin (BTC) stash briefly topped $80 billion in value on Monday as Bitcoin hit a record high of $126,080, boosting the value of its corporate treasury close to Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, which each hold between $97 billion and $95 billion in cash or cash equivalents. 

Strategy's routine Bitcoin buys, combined with Bitcoin's rise in value, have already pushed its treasury past the value of Nvidia, Apple and Meta's — the latter of which considered a proposal to explore making Bitcoin a treasury asset before overwhelmingly voting against it in June.

Berkshire Hathaway holds the largest cash pile of any company at around $344 billion, while Tesla is the only other firm that holds Bitcoin to make the list of the top 10 largest corporate treasuries — but its 11,509 BTC, worth about $1.4 billion, accounts for only a small portion of the automaker's $37 billion holdings.

JPMorgan analysts said last week that Bitcoin and gold are a “debasement trade,” arguing the assets could serve as hedges against the US dollar inflation and America's national debt as it continues to spiral out of control at nearly $38 trillion.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, once a Bitcoin critic, said in January that Bitcoin could hit $700,000 on currency debasement fears.

Both Microsoft and Meta's Bitcoin proposals were submitted by the conservative think tank National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) deputy director Ethan Peck, who said Bitcoin would better protect their profits from currency debasement.

“Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true inflation rate, 28% of Meta's total assets are consistently diminishing shareholder value,” Peck said in his supporting statement to Meta. 

Microsoft rejected NCPPR's Bitcoin proposal when Bitcoin was trading at $97,170, and Meta knocked back the same pitch when Bitcoin was $104,800, meaning both missed out on double-digit gains while the value of their cash positions continued to erode.

Bitcoin's volatility was a major concern that influenced Microsoft shareholders to vote against the proposal.

Peck, who also serves as Bitcoin director at crypto-friendly wealth management firm Strive, recommended that Microsoft allocate 1% to 5% of its cash position to Bitcoin.

The NCPPR made a similar proposal to Amazon's board last December; however, little progress has been made since.

Despite the Bitcoin proposals being turned down by the tech giants, over 200 public companies now hold Bitcoin, up from fewer than 100 at the start of the year.

With Bitcoin currently trading just short of its all-time high on Monday, nearly all of the companies are up on their Bitcoin investments.

Strategy bought its 640,031 Bitcoin at an average purchase price of $73,981, marking a 65%, or $30.4 billion, gain on its Bitcoin investment.

The 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded for a versatile technology that can be used for an astonishing variety of purposes, from environmental remediation to drug delivery and energy storage.

Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson and Omar M. Yaghi shared the award for their development of metal-organic frameworks, chemical cages that have small openings that can capture other small and diverse molecules. MOFs, as they are known, are being explored for their use in wastewater cleanup, PFAS removal, timed or multidrug release systems, and more.

The cages are made of metal ions held together by organic, or carbon-containing, molecules. The cages can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional, and they can be formed from a host of metals and organic linkers.

Richard Robson of the University of Melbourne dreamed up the first MOFs, inspired by the tetrahedral, or pyramidlike, shape that carbon atoms take to form diamonds. He mixed a form of copper with a nitrile, an organic compound with nitrogen bonded to carbon, and watched as it formed a repeating structure with small holes in it.

Susumu Kitagawa of Kyoto University and Omar M. Yaghi of the University of California, Berkeley, furthered MOF research and applications. Kitagawa created MOFs that were flexible and learned that gases could flow in and out of MOFs. He told the audience at a Nobel press conference in Stockholm on Wednesday that his dream is to use MOFs to separate the components of air for use in making other materials, via reusable energy. Yaghi, widely credited for expanding the development of MOFs, created stable frameworks from many combinations of metal ions and organic linkers.

The three researchers will divide the Nobel prize money, which comes to 11 million Swedish kronor, or about $1 million.

AI Reads Your Tongue Color to Reveal Hidden Diseases

Inspired by principles from traditional Chinese medicine, researchers used AI to analyze tongue color as a diagnostic tool—with more than 96 percent accuracy

By Eve Lu edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Eve Lu

For thousands of years traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) practitioners have checked patients' tongues as part of a full examination, carefully scrutinizing their color, shape and coating in an attempt to detect illness. TCM considers a tongue's color especially telling—and now some researchers, encouraged by recent studies pointing toward a measurable association with health factors, are working to adapt this ancient diagnostic approach to today's AI-based technology.

TCM remains a controversial topic in the global scientific community. The World Health Organization officially added TCM diagnoses to the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases, the global standard for health-information classification, in 2022. But most high-profile studies have treated the topic warily. “Despite the expanding TCM usage and the recognition of its therapeutic benefits worldwide, the lack of robust evidence from the EBM [evidence-based medicine] perspective is hindering acceptance of TCM by the Western medicine community and its integration into mainstream healthcare,” wrote the authors of a 2015 review article on TCM's prospects. Still, pockets of strong academic interest persist.

In TCM, tongue color “is closely linked to the condition of the blood and qi [a Chinese term often translated into English as ‘vital energy'], making it a primary indicator for TCM practitioners in assessing a patient's overall health,” says Dong Xu, whose research at the University of Missouri focuses on computational biology and bioinformatics and who co-authored a 2022 study on analyzing digital tongue images. But tongue examination can be highly subjective: it relies entirely on an individual practitioner's color perception and analysis.

Frank Scannapieco, a periodontist, microbiologist and oral biologist at the University at Buffalo, says that in Western medicine, no standardized clinical system is routinely used to monitor tongue features, although defined lesions on the tongue can serve as indicators for certain cancers—and some studies have linked tongue appearance to particular diseases such as breast cancer and psoriasis. Elizabeth Alpert, a dental health expert at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, adds that tongue examination is often part of a routine screening for oral cancer by dentists and hygienists, but its accuracy depends on providers' education and experience in clinical settings.

Massive developments in computing technology are causing some TCM-inspired medical researchers to take a new look at the tongue, however. The authors of a 2024 study in Technologies used machine-learning models to classify tongue colors and predict several associated conditions—including diabetes, asthma, COVID and anemia—with a testing accuracy of 96.6 percent.

A major challenge in previous tongue-imaging studies has been perception bias caused by varying light conditions, says the recent study's co-author Javaan Chahl, a roboticist and joint chair of sensor systems at the University of South Australia. “There have been studies where people tried to [diagnose via tongue color] without a controlled lighting environment, but the color is very subjective,” Chahl says.

To address this issue, Chahl and his team developed a standardized lighting system within a kiosk setup. Patients placed their heads in a box illuminated by LED lights, which emitted a stable and controllable wavelength of light, and exposed their tongues.

Chahl and his colleagues collected 5,260 images—both real tongue photographs found on the Internet and additional color-gradient images. They used them to train machine-learning models to recognize seven specific colors (red, yellow, green, blue, gray, white and pink) at different saturation levels and in different light conditions.

The researchers confirmed that a healthy tongue usually appears pink with a thin white film; they found that a whiter-looking tongue may indicate a lack of iron in the blood. Diabetes patients often have a bluish-yellow tongue coating. A purple tongue with a thick, fatty layer could indicate certain cancers. COVID intensity (in people already diagnosed) can also influence overall tongue color, they found, with faint pink seen in mild cases, crimson in moderate infections and deep red in serious cases.

Next they applied the most accurate of six tested machine-learning models to 60 tongue images, all taken using the team's standardized kiosk setup at two hospitals in Iraq in 2022 and 2023. They then compared the experimental diagnoses with the patients' medical records. “The system correctly identified 58 out of 60 images,” says study co-author Ali Al-Naji, now a medical engineering professor at the Middle Technical University in Iraq.

Al-Naji is now working on narrowing the focus for diagnosis to the tongue's center and tip. His group is also using a new tongue dataset of 750 Internet images to examine tongue shape and oral conditions such as ulcers and cracks with the deep-learning algorithm YOLO. Eventually Chahl would like to analyze more than just the tongue—perhaps the whole face.

Tongue color may possibly serve as a helpful biological marker of a person's health state, but Xu cautions that it cannot stand on its own when it comes to making accurate clinical decisions. “The most fundamental limitation of current tongue-imaging systems is that tongue analysis represents only one component of a complete TCM diagnosis,” he says. And because image labeling is not widely standardized for this type of experiment, he adds, it's harder to reproduce research findings.

The team has seen commercial interest in its system, Chahl says, but collecting usable data remains the biggest limitation to scaling up the research: “you need to have a lot of different people onboard with the process” to gather data with a kiosk in a large hospital, for instance, and to get consent to access patients' medical records.

Scannapieco also highlights the challenges in standardizing tongue examination in a clinical or research setting. He says broad AI-based tongue analysis would require massive investment and huge databases of images and medical histories. “Until then, I think the field will develop by accretion of small studies that reveal correlations between tongue appearance and specific conditions,” Scannapieco says. “Of course, many diseases show no change in tongue appearance.” He adds that such a tool would be only one of many used for diagnosis.

Meanwhile online AI tools for tongue analysis have been quietly gaining popularity among consumers. Early this year Xu, his current Ph.D. student Jiacheng Xie of the University of Missouri, and their colleagues launched a GPT-based AI application, BenCao. Users can upload tongue images and receive personalized health guidance based on TCM concepts.

For now the app is designed and marketed only as a “wellness” tool, rather than a clinical diagnostic system, because giving out medical diagnoses requires far more caution. “We provide only some food and lifestyle recommendations,” Xie says. To bring it to the next level, his team aims to collaborate with clinical physicians, comparing the diagnosis outputs from machine-learning models and human doctors to identify the differences and performance gaps.

Why Scammers Target Seniors—And What You Can Do About It

Millions of older adults lose their savings to scams every year. There are ways to reduce the risk

By Thomas Blomberg & Julie Brancale edited by Madhusree Mukerjee

BanksPhotos/Getty Images

Anthony, an older man from California, told ABC7 Los Angeles last October that he had been scammed out of $25,000 by means of a voice generated by artificial intelligence. Anthony, who declined to give his last name, got a call from his son, as he believed, who told him that he'd gotten into a car accident and hit a pregnant woman who was hospitalized. Soon after Anthony hung up, another person called claiming to be his son's lawyer. This caller said that $9,200 was needed immediately for bail or else Anthony's son would be jailed for a month and a half.

AI has brought to a boil a problem that has been simmering for several decades. Older adults report financial exploitation to be the most frequent form of abuse they experience, with estimated annual losses as high as $28 billion in the U.S. alone. As the fastest-growing and wealthiest segment of the population, currently controlling 65 percent of the U.S.'s total wealth and $13 trillion in home equity wealth, older adults are increasingly likely to be targeted by scammers. Their vulnerability to scams stems from the many and diverse challenges of aging. These include declines in cognition, alterations in life circumstances (such as the death of a spouse) and difficulty keeping up with the constantly changing technological landscape.

Scammers use sophisticated tactics that prey on the vulnerabilities of older adults, inciting panic and inducing isolation so that individuals make decisions alone and quickly. Anthony, for instance, rushed to the bank and withdrew the money demanded and gave it to someone who came to his home. Then he received another phone call from a person posturing as a second lawyer. The accident victim had passed away, the caller said, which meant Anthony's son's predicament had worsened, and the amount needed for bail had gone up—$15,800 was now required. Shaken, Anthony paid again. It was only after this second payment that his daughter suggested to him that he might have been scammed.

No matter the amount of money lost, being scammed can damage mental and physical health, erode self-confidence and diminish one's quality of life. It can even contribute to premature death, as found by Jason Burnett of the McGovern Medical School at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and colleagues. Fortunately, however, many people are able to detect a scam and walk away. How do they do that, and can their methods be used by others?

We decided to find answers to these questions. In 2016 we began conducting town hall meetings, self-report surveys, focus group discussions and in-depth individual interviews with nearly 300 residents of a large retirement community in Florida about their experiences with financial exploitation. Most everyone we talked to said that they had moved to the retirement community because they believed that they would not have to worry about crime—they would be living behind security gates, and all their neighbors would be older people.

In fact, however, they were being targeted by scammers more often since they had moved to the retirement community, which provided a concentration of wealthy and vulnerable adults. Almost immediately after moving into their new homes, many received phone calls, e-mails, and knocks on the door offering fraudulent services for home and auto repair, prizes and sweepstakes, and financial planning. They quickly had to learn to be vigilant.

Their main strategies to avoid being scammed: maintaining a skeptical mindset and keeping well informed about fraud and the diverse tactics used by scammers, especially during stressful times when they were consumed with other factors, such as a serious illness. “I keep up to date about fraud or scams,” Richard, then age 64, told us in an interview during our research. “I read all articles on scams. You really have to educate yourself.” (We changed the names of those we interviewed for privacy.) Protection against scams comes from continual education that helps older people develop and sustain their skepticism while also increasing their confidence in their ability to make smart, informed decisions.

AI has introduced novel ways for fraudsters to trick older adults through replicated or altered voices, videos, photographs and documents. Recent and novel scams that affect older adults include calls, texts or e-mails that come as urgent messages from someone pretending to be a government official or law enforcement officer, requiring payment for what they claim is missed jury duty, unpaid highway tolls or parking and traffic tickets. Failure to send money immediately, individuals are told, will result in their arrest or deportation.

At the same time, some long-standing scams continue to occur—but more frequently and with greater sophistication, making them more difficult to avoid. Lottery and sweepstakes scams remain common. Offenders, typically impersonating well-known celebrities or organizations, contact a person out of the blue and tell them that they have won a prize. To claim winnings, the scammers stress, individuals must send the money right away—sometimes thousands of dollars—to cover “taxes,” “shipping” or “processing fees.” Even though no prize will ever arrive, scammers continue to contact their victims to convince them that more money must be sent.

Many variations on this theme exist. For example, the FBI first began receiving reports of the “grandparent scam” in 2008. This kind of fraud, resembling that experienced by Anthony, exploits a person's emotions, inciting fear and anxiety, by impersonating a grandchild or other family member in distress. Offenders often demand that money be provided quickly and through gift cards or wire transfers, which don't require identification to collect. Sometimes scammers have even sent couriers to their targets' homes to collect money.

These scams have been around for decades but persist as significant threats to older adults. They regularly top lists provided by law enforcement and advocacy groups of the most common scams targeting older adults. (The lists also often include government impersonation, tech support and financial services scams.) Not least, older adults are also increasingly targeted for scams involving medical procedures, insurance, auto and home repair, and sales.

Ralph, a highly decorated war veteran from Florida, and his wife received a phone call selling unlimited cruise vacations for one year from a seemingly reputable company. After paying $2,000 from their limited fixed income and savings, the couple never received confirmation of their purchase or information about how to redeem their vacations. Months passed, and Ralph, then age 90, sought help from the police. Eventually, a law enforcement official met with Ralph to tell him the case had to be closed without a resolution. As tears ran down his face, Ralph told the official, “It's not about the money. I just feel so stupid.” This sense of helplessness, embarrassment and utter misery is what so many scam victims report feeling.

Older adults can also be scammed by romantic partners, friends or family members. Tragically, nearly 50 percent of scams involve the people who are closest to older adults; these cases seldom get reported to law enforcement. Another common tactic: offenders scan obituary columns in local newspapers to befriend a widow or widower at a time when they are vulnerable. John, then age 67, told us that someone from local funeral homes “reminds women to never put an obituary [in the newspaper] because you are a target, and the minute that that goes in there, some crook is reading that to see if they can make a connection with you—‘Oh, your late husband was an Air Force pilot; I was a pilot, too'—and they use that to eventually get at their money.”

Why do people fall for these types of scams? The people with whom we talked reported that at the time of victimization—and regardless of whether the scam was routine or new—their judgement became so clouded that they lost their ability to be skeptical. They made spur-of-the moment decisions that were uncharacteristic of those they would have made in preceding months or years. Certain factors compound this problem.

Research suggests that older adults struggle more to anticipate financial losses, have higher levels of trust for strangers and have a lower ability to detect deceptions compared with younger adults. These differences, both cognitive and psychological, may reflect age-related changes to the brain. Older adults also face an increasing frequency of setbacks to their physical and emotional health, which can reduce their self-confidence and hinder their skepticism. “I was in the hospital, depressed, and couldn't hear that well anymore. When a [financial] planner called, I just wasn't in the right place,” Anne, then age 78, said to us. “I should have known better. I did know better, but ... I was just so depressed.” Peter Lichtenberg, a researcher at Wayne State University, and colleagues reported in 2016 that symptoms of depression were associated with an increased risk of fraud among older adults.

Social isolation also constitutes a significant factor. The loss of loved ones that comes with aging can shrink social networks and add to people's vulnerability. “I have nobody. I don't have anybody,” Harold, then age 75, told us. “My brother passed away. My sister is lingering in a nursing home..., and that's it.... Losing support systems is terrifying, especially for us older folks.” In 2018 Marti DeLiemaof the University of Minnesota observed that the lack of a trustworthy network of friends or family best distinguished the older adults who had been defrauded from those who had not.

Major life transitions, such as divorce or the loss of a spouse, can leave older adults alone and without skills that others had earlier provided. Several widows told us that their spouse had handled finances, for instance, and they did not know how to. Worse, unscrupulous people can prey upon the emotional turmoil that comes with death or divorce. “The [scammer] was really very slick, and I was going through a divorce, and he just made me feel like I was an okay person, where I was feeling really badly about myself at the time,” Cheryl, then age 66, told us. “So he got me in. They were long conversations. We'd stay on the phone for an hour. It was all about my life and that kind of stuff, and I just got sucked into it.”

In our research, we also found many people who, despite being targeted, had avoided scams. Their experiences offered invaluable insights about steps to protect against financial exploitation.

You can help reduce your risk of victimization by educating yourself on scams and staying informed about changes to the fraud landscape. Many reliable government agencies regularly publish information about old and new scams. These include the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, FBI and U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation publishes a Money Smart for Older Adults resource guide that details numerous types of scams and prevention strategies.

Several large nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups also provide up-to-date information on scams and advise on strategies for prevention. The advocacy group AARP's Fraud Watch Network and weekly The Perfect Scam podcast share real-life stories about scams, help older adults identify scams before they happen and provide guidance if they do become victims. Additionally, resources from the American Bankers Association, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the National Council on Aging provide tools for preventing and responding to financial exploitation. Many local agencies and organizations also host in-person workshops on scams and prevention strategies in community centers across the country.

Older adults should also understand how rapidly their judgment may change. Although you may currently be able to navigate life circumstances, including keeping up with potential scams, that may change tomorrow. “I understand how to protect myself now,” Brian, then age 79, said to us. “I wonder if I'll understand and do it 10 years from now, if I live to be 90.” Brian frequently reminded his wife, who did not handle their household finances, that she needed to be careful and that if he were to pass away before she did, she should consult with their son before making any financial decisions.

Approaching all interactions with an underlying skepticism can assist older adults in asking questions, slowing down and seeking assistance. Taken together, these measures—remaining informed about scams, being skeptical, identifying and relying on trusted individuals, and being vigilant against overconfidence—can help you recognize and protect against potential scams and victimization. Do not be afraid to say no or to refuse to engage with someone, hang up the telephone, refuse to open the door, delete e-mails or destroy mail addressed to you. What's more, you should never hurry when making a financial decision, especially when your instincts are telling you something feels off. Follow the age-old dictum—if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

The following practical steps can help you protect yourself and your family from financial scams:

If you believe you are experiencing a potential financial scam, immediately end all communications with the suspected perpetrator.

Resist pressure to act quickly.

Be suspicious of unsolicited telephone calls, mailings, online interactions or door-to-door services.

Do not hesitate to call the police if you feel you or your family may be in danger.

If you receive an unexpected call, e-mail, or text message from someone claiming to be from your bank, hang up and call your bank's number on your credit or debit card.

If you receive a questionable offer, search online for contact information on the offer.

Create a secret family password to verify the identity of a family member to use in the event you receive suspicious telephone or online requests for money for personal information.

Never send personal identifiable information, money, jewelry, gift cards, checks, or wire funds or information to unverified persons or businesses.

Never open an e-mail attachment or click a link in a text message from someone you do not know.

Keep your computer up to date with antivirus and security software.

Regularly check your financial accounts for unusual or unauthorized activity.

Immediately turn off your Internet access if you see a pop-up message that won't go away or if your screen suddenly locks and can't be unlocked.

Protect your identity, but should a fraudster gain access to your identity or accounts, immediately contact your bank to place protection on your accounts.

None of us, regardless of age, can fully protect against ever-changing and technology-aided scams, but employing these practical steps will reduce the likelihood of becoming a victim. If you do fall for a scam, do not be silent or feel ashamed. Instead, share and report your experience. You may report financial fraud and scams to your local law enforcement agency, state attorney general's office, the Better Business Bureau, Federal Trade Commission, FINRA or the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center.

In our collective effort to build awareness of these evolving threats and thereby protect ourselves and others, we cannot be complacent or silent. We must recognize what we know and do not know about financial exploitation. And we must be open to reporting and discussing our experiences to help build more effective responses. “You may not be able to prevent all [scams],” Paul, then age 87, told us. “But we need education. We need support. We need to communicate with people and let them know that they are not alone.”

Chris Hadfield Imagines a Suspenseful Twist on Cold War History in His New Book

Astronaut-turned-author Chris Hadfield discusses his new thriller Final Orbit, which weaves real cold war history, space race geopolitics and firsthand experience into a gripping work of fiction.

By Rachel Feltman, Kylie Murphy, Fonda Mwangi & Alex Sugiura

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

You might know Chris Hadfield as the International Space Station commander who famously sang David Bowie's “Space Oddity” while orbiting Earth. But in recent years he's added fiction writer to his list of jobs, publishing thrillers based on the real history of the space race.

His latest book, Final Orbit, is set in 1975 and features historical figures navigating geopolitical tensions that may sound surprisingly familiar to anyone following current events.

Here to talk about how his experience as an astronaut informs his fiction writing is Colonel Chris Hadfield, former commander of the International Space Station.

What happens when a real-life astronaut turns to fiction? In this episode, Chris Hadfield shares how decades of spaceflight and global diplomacy inspired his latest novel, Final Orbit, a cold war thriller packed with historical intrigue and technical precision.

Thanks so much for coming on to chat with us today.

Chris Hadfield: My pleasure.

Hadfield: Yeah, I served as an astronaut for 21 years and flew in space three times, commanded a spaceship, did some space walks, but all good things must come to an end, and I retired from 35 years of government service.

Since then I've written six books. I help lead several space companies and other tech companies. I run a big international technology incubator called the Creative Destruction Lab—I run a, a big section of that. Working with King Charles [III] on space sustainability, a project called the Sustainable Markets Initiative. I tour with a band, and we played a concert that sold out in a day, so that, that was a lot of fun. And, and I have two granddaughters. But no, life is busy and full and rich, thank you.

Feltman: That's awesome. And you actually are just releasing—I believe it's your third work of fiction, which might surprise some listeners. It's been a busy few years, so they might've missed that you were writing fiction at all. Could you tell us a little bit about how you got interested in, in that and what the process has been like for you?

Hadfield: I've always loved writing; it was my favorite subject in school. But I knew if I got a arts degree, they wouldn't let me command a spaceship [laughs], so I, I studied engineering in school. But I've always, you know, really admired writing and enjoyed the escapism of good fiction. My first three books were nonfiction, but I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could write good fiction, fiction that people would wanna read. And, and they've just done so superbly well—it's the Apollo Murders series. It's in, I don't know, 15 languages or something and optioned for TV and movies.

And I'm, as you say, I'm just releasing the third book in the Apollo Murders series; it's called Final Orbit. And it's alternative-history thriller fiction set in the summer of 1975 during the cold war and the end of the Apollo era with Apollo-Soyuz and a derelict space station called Skylab, and all sorts of untoward things happen in Final Orbit. It's getting just killer reviews. I'm really pleased with how the book came out.

Feltman: As you said, these are works of fiction and, and they're thrillers, but obviously, there is a lot of fact woven into the story. Could we start by talking about just how your history as an astronaut has informed your fiction writing?

Hadfield: I decided to be an astronaut when I was nine years old. I, I didn't hope to be an astronaut; I decided to start turning myself into an astronaut at nine. So there's been an—almost an entire lifetime of research for writing a book 'cause, 'cause I'd just been fascinated by it. And, and then I served 21 years as an astronaut, and you, you don't just fly in space as a professional astronaut. I was NASA's chief of operations in Russia and chief of space station operations. I worked in mission control as the lead capcom for 25 shuttle flights in a row.

I've been so incredibly lucky to have this depth of real-world space experience, and, and so when I—now, when I'm writing fiction, I do a, a huge amount of research to make sure I get all the facts right, but I also have the lucky resource of my own memories and impressions and knowledge to draw on to make these books not just an interesting plot but something that absolutely could have happened, with every little detail correct. And I think that makes for a more compelling story.

Feltman: And could you tell us about some of the real historical events and figures that readers can keep an eye out for in this book?

Hadfield: Yeah, in my thriller or fiction books, almost all the characters are real people. I mean, President [Richard] Nixon; Henry Kissinger; Al Shepard; Bob Crippen; Mao Zedong; a guy named Qian Xuesen, who was the, the father of Chinese spaceflight the United States foolishly deported during the McCarthy era. And it's really fun weaving through history in the '70s because characters come up like George Bush Sr., who, at the time of 1975, when, when Final Orbit is set, he was sort of the, the top American in China—they didn't have an embassy because of conflict then but, but the, the American mission to China.

So it's delightful really digging into what actually happened and the real characters, including the crews that were flying in space right then, the cosmonauts and astronauts, and then finding ways just through slightly alternative possibilities of what might have happened to

really create a suspenseful and credible plot. In the back of the book, Rachel, I, I put a section just for the reader so they can see what was real and what wasn't real ...

Feltman: Mm.

Hadfield: And I think, when you flick to the back and look at it, you'll be surprised just how much of that book—not only the people, but what actually happened—is, is word for word or, or minute by minute what really went on.

Feltman: Very cool. So you've done two things that many people say they would like to do and are very hard to accomplish, which is going to space and writing and publishing a novel. What—which one do you think is harder [laughs]?

Hadfield: Going to space.

Feltman: Sure, makes sense.

Hadfield: There are a million books a year published; in the entire history of humanity just a, a tiny number of humans have actually flown in space. So—and, and it, it's a life's work, and the odds are terrible [laughs]; almost everybody fails the medical as well as all of the other training requirements. So—and, and I, I decided to be an astronaut when I was nine; it was 26 years of work ...

Feltman: Mm.

Hadfield: Before I flew in space. So yeah, writing a novel's a lot of work. It's—I, I write a book every couple years; it's a lot of work. But being a professional astronaut, that's, that's a, a life's work.

Feltman: Absolutely. What are you hoping that readers take away from this book, other than, you know, being gripped and entertained, obviously?

Hadfield: I think people will be surprised, in, in reading Final Orbit, just how much of what was going on then is exactly being replayed right now ...

There's this conflict between the Russians, the Soviet Union, and the United States. And China is emerging as a new technical—technological force. That was going on in the early '70s. China had launched its first rocket. It had its first space capsule. They had selected astronauts. They were training astronauts. They built the relay ships. They, you know, they were way heavily involved, and they were really on their way to becoming one of the major world space powers.

And when you look at the geopolitical forces going on right now, I think it's really worth reading to see: How did this happen in the past? What was going on? Why was it happening? And when you write fiction, you could really bring it to life; it's not just some sort of dry history but what were the, the forces and the individual desires? You know, people do things for selfish reasons—why were we doing all those things? And then maybe it will help, as, as the news reels are ripping by today, gain a little in, insight into maybe why some of the things are happening today as well.

Feltman: Thank you so much for coming on to, to chat about the book. Would you remind our listeners and viewers what it's called so they can go check it out?

Hadfield: My new space thriller is called Final Orbit. It's alternative-history fiction. It's getting absolutely killer reviews. I hope you enjoy reading it.

Feltman: That's all for today's episode. We'll be back on Friday. Don't forget to go vote for Science Quickly to win a Signal Award. You've only got a day or so left to do so! You can find the voting link in our show notes.

Amazon Prime Big Deal Days ends today, and there is an overwhelming amount of sales to shop if you're getting a jump on holiday shopping (whether that's for others or for yourself). Amazon offers price cuts on pocket knives from our favorite blade brands, including SOG, Civivi, Case, and more. If you're looking to add a new knife to your arsenal, now is the time to shop before the deals end at midnight.

I've scoured pocket knife deals and checked the specs against the knives we've tested and recommended to offer a selection that doesn't skimp on craftsmanship and save you more than just a couple of bucks. I also scoped out the type of knife steel each pick uses to ensure you're not getting a blade that'll wear out after only a couple of uses. 

Shop Prime Day Deals

The Civivi Mini Axis is a popular EDC knife that's easy to sharpen and handles camping and outdoor pursuits just as well. Gerber's Paraframe is an absolute workhorse of a serrated blade for those who cut rope or fabric daily, and is now available for under $20. SOG's Twitch 3 is one of the brand's most popular knives thanks to its smooth spring-assisted opening and minimalist design. Personally, I love the CRKT CEO pocket knife: It's sleek, has lightning-fast deployment, and isn't much larger than a pen.

Grab a new slew of gear this fall without spending a fortune. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Amazon's second major shopping event of the year, Big Deals Day, is almost over. Lasting until the end of the day on October 8, the online retailer kicks off the fall season with tons of deals across nearly every major category, including toys, TVs, tech, and tools. The deals also extend to major brands such as Yeti.

While Yeti has long been a favorite of ours, much of their gear, although high quality, can be more expensive than that of many competitors. During this sitewide sale event, Yeti is offering discounts of 30 percent or more on a wide range of products, including popular water bottles, coolers, and accessories you've likely been eyeing.

Shop Prime Day Deals 

Yeti has several items on sale across the board, including a variety of coolers. The Hopper Flip 15 has been a favorite of ours for a while for on-the-go drinks and snacks. The cooler has the capacity for 20 cans and comes with a shoulder strap for easy carrying to beaches, campgrounds, or from your house to the backyard. The exterior is also completely waterproof, so you can keep your drinks cool by the water or in the rain. The Hopper flip is currently on sale for 25 percent off, which translates to $75 off.

If you're looking to grab a new water bottle, Yeti has multiple options on sale right now, including both the Yonder and the Rambler. This gives you a wide range of potential options, whether you're looking for a sturdy, lightweight bottle to stash in a backpack on a hike or a high-quality insulated bottle to keep your water cold all day long. We love both of them, with many members of our team using both as their everyday water bottle at the office and on their weekend adventures. 

Among the many lifestyle products Yeti has on sale, we have a soft spot for the Colster can insulator and the beverage bucket; both of which are currently on sale for 30 percent off. The can insulator is essentially an upgrade on the old-school foam koozie you've been using for years, featuring technology that actually keeps your drink colder for longer. The beverage bucket also comes with integrated insulation, so the cold ones you're keeping on ice won't be floating in a pool of water by the end of the day.

Big Deal Days is in its final stretch, so make sure to check out these Yeti deals and all other on-sale items before it ends.

Deadwood-decomposing fungi feed germinating orchids, providing the carbon their tiny seeds don't have. The Kobe University finding not only closes a gap in our understanding of wild orchid ecology but also uncovers an important carbon flux in the ecosystem.

Orchid seeds are as small as dust and do not provide any nutrients for the young plant to grow. The adult plants are known to rely on a certain type of fungi that develop structures within the plant's roots, but whether these same fungi also help with germination has not been established. ""Studying orchid germination in nature is notoriously difficult. In particular, the painstaking methods required for recovering their seedlings from soil explain why most earlier studies focused only on adult roots, where fungi are easier to sample,"" explains Kobe University plant evolutionary ecologist Kenji Suetsugu.

During fieldwork, Suetsugu's team noticed a strange pattern. He says: ""We repeatedly found seedlings and adults with juvenile root structures near decaying logs, not scattered randomly in the forest. That recurring pattern inspired us to test whether deadwood fungi fuel orchid beginnings."" These juvenile root structures are coral-shaped rhizomes and have been interpreted as a seedling's organ retained into adulthood -- and they are often associated with wood-decaying fungi rather than with those found in adult orchids without these structures. Being experts in orchid ecology and evolution, Suetsugu's team took on the challenge to find out who feeds the young orchids.

In the journal Functional Ecology, the Kobe University team report that amongst seeds of four model orchid species they buried in various forest locations, they observed germination only near decaying logs, and that the seedlings virtually exclusively associated with wood-decaying fungi. ""We were struck by how exclusive and consistent these fungal partnerships were. There is an almost perfect match in the fungi that seedlings of a given orchid species associate with and the fungi on adult plants with coral-shaped rhizomes of the same species. We think that the plants without coral-shaped rhizomes shift to other fungi as their nutritional needs change during growth and the carbon source offered by rotting logs dries out,"" says Suetsugu.

Among the relatives of the orchids the Kobe University team studied, there are many species that have independently evolved full mycoheterotrophy, that is, they have abandoned photosynthesis and instead feed on fungi throughout their lives. ""The propensity of these orchids to maintain their association with wood-decaying fungi into adult life probably facilitated their evolution of full mycoheterotrophy,"" Suetsugu says.

In the paper, the team writes, ""As woody debris represents a major carbon source in forests, associations with wood-decaying fungi may enhance carbon acquisition, especially in warm, humid habitats."" Suetsugu adds: ""For conservation, our results mean that protecting orchids in the wild is inseparable from protecting deadwood and its fungi. For ecological sciences, they reveal a hidden carbon route from deadwood to green plants, explaining how seedlings can establish themselves on dark forest floors. And they show that deadwood is not dead -- it is a cradle of new life.""

A new study by researchers at the European Commission's Joint Research Centre reveals that the Amazon rainforest has just undergone its most devastating forest fire season in over two decades, which triggered record-breaking carbon emissions and exposed the region's growing ecological fragility despite a slowing trend in deforestation. The 2024 fires released an estimated 791 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which roughly equates to the annual emissions of Germany. This marks a sevenfold increase from the average of the previous two years.

According to the study published today (October 8) in Biogeosciences, 3.3 million hectares of Amazon forest were impacted by fires last year alone. This extraordinary surge in fire activity is likely driven by a combination of extreme drought stress exacerbated by climate change, forest fragmentation, and land-use mismanagement (e.g., escape fires or criminal fires by land grabbers), leading to significant forest degradation. For the first time in the analysis covering 2022-2024, fire-induced degradation has overtaken deforestation as the primary driver of carbon emissions in the Amazon.

This research draws on a sophisticated satellite-based methodology that overcomes many of the limitations of previous global fire datasets. By combining data from the Tropical Moist Forest monitoring system with the Global Wildfire Information System and filtering out false signals caused by agricultural fires or cloud cover, scientists were able to detect and verify fire-driven forest degradation with a novel level of precision.

The geographical spread of the fires was equally alarming. In Brazil, 2024 marked the highest level of emissions from forest degradation on record. In Bolivia, fires affected over 9% of the country's remaining intact forest cover, which is a dramatic blow to a region that has historically served as a vital biodiversity reservoir and carbon sink.

To ensure scientific rigor and transparency, the researchers used a Monte Carlo simulation framework to estimate carbon emissions and their uncertainties. across variables such as above-ground biomass density, combustion completeness, and the percentage of forest cover affected by fire. The resulting confidence intervals adhere to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) best practices and offer a robust benchmark for tracking the carbon consequences of forest fires in tropical regions.

While past reports have highlighted the dangers of deforestation, this study spotlights a more insidious threat: fire-driven degradation that erodes forest integrity without necessarily clearing it. Degraded forests may look intact from above, but they lose a significant portion of their biomass and ecological function. Unlike clear-cut areas, these degraded forests often fall through the cracks of national accounting systems and international policy frameworks.

The study calls for immediate and coordinated action to reduce fire use, strengthen forest protection policies, and support local and Indigenous stewardship efforts. It also highlights the need for enhanced international climate finance mechanisms that recognize and address forest degradation, not just deforestation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Hubble captures a galaxy that glows in blue and gold","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251007234522.htm","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 03:55:39 GMT","

Stars of all ages are on display in this new NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope Picture of the Week. This sparkling spiral galaxy is called NGC 6000 and it is located 102 million light-years away in the constellation Scorpius.

This galaxy has a glowing yellow center and glittering blue outskirts. The colors reflect differences in the average ages, masses and temperatures of the galaxy's stars. In the heart of the galaxy, the stars tend to be older and smaller. Less massive stars are cooler than more massive stars, and somewhat counterintuitively, cooler stars are redder, while hotter stars are bluer. Farther out along NGC 6000's spiral arms, brilliant star clusters host young, massive stars that appear distinctly blue.

Hubble collected the data for this image while surveying the sites of recent supernova explosions in nearby galaxies. NGC 6000 has hosted two recent supernovae: SN 2007ch in 2007 and SN 2010as in 2010. Using Hubble's sensitive detectors, researchers are able to discern the faint glow of supernovae years after the initial explosion. These observations help to constrain the masses of supernova progenitor stars and can indicate if they had any stellar companions.

By zooming in to the right side of the galaxy's disc in this image, you may see something else yellow and blue: a set of four thin lines. These are an asteroid in our Solar System, which was drifting across Hubble's field of view as it gazed at NGC 6000. The four streaks are due to different exposures that were recorded one after another with slight pauses in between. These were combined to create this final image. The colors appear this way because each exposure used a filter to collect only very specific wavelengths of light, in this case around red and blue. Having these separate exposures is important to study and compare stars by their colors -- but it also makes asteroid interlopers very obvious!

Researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Humboldt University in Berlin have developed a way to capture nearly all the light emitted from tiny diamond defects known as color centers. By placing nanodiamonds into specially designed hybrid nanoantennas with extreme precision, the team achieved record photon collection at room temperature --  a necessary step for quantum technologies such as quantum sensors, and quantum-secured communications. The article was selected as a Featured Article in APL Quantum.

Diamonds have long been prized for their sparkle, but researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in collaboration with colleagues from the Humboldt University in Berlin are showing they achieve an almost optimal ""sparkling,"" a key requirement for using diamonds also for quantum technology. The team has approached an almost perfect collection of the faintest light signals, single photons, from tiny diamond defects, known as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, which are vital for developing next-generation quantum computers, sensors, and communication networks.

NV centers are microscopic imperfections in the diamond structure that can act like quantum ""light switches."" They emit single particles of light (photons) that carry quantum information. The problem, until now, has been that much of this light is lost in all directions, making it hard to capture and use.

The Hebrew University team, together with their research partners from Berlin, solved this challenge by embedding nanodiamonds containing NV centers into specially designed hybrid nanoantennas. These antennas, built from layers of metal and dielectric materials in a precise bullseye pattern, guide the light in a well-defined direction instead of letting it scatter. Using ultra-precise positioning, the researchers placed the nanodiamonds exactly at the antenna center -- within a few billionths of a meter.

Featured in APL Quantum, the results are significant: the new system can collect up to 80% of the emitted photons at room temperature. This is a dramatic improvement compared to previous attempts, where only a small fraction of the light was usable.

Prof. Rapaport explained, ""Our approach brings us much closer to practical quantum devices. By making photon collection more efficient, we're opening the door to technologies such as secure quantum communication and ultra-sensitive sensors.""

Dr. Lubotzky added, ""What excites us is that this works in a simple, chip-based design and at room temperature. That means it can be integrated into real-world systems much more easily than before.""

The research demonstrates not just clever engineering, but also the potential of diamonds beyond jewelry. With quantum technologies racing toward real-world applications, this advance could help pave the way for faster, more reliable quantum networks.

For nearly two centuries, it was unclear that the bright spot in the constellation Virgo, which Charles Messier had described in 1781 as ""87: Nebula without stars,"" was in fact a very large galaxy. As a result, there was initially no explanation for the strange jet discovered in 1918 emerging from the center of this ""nebula.""

At the heart of the giant galaxy M87 lies the black hole M87*, which contains a staggering six and a half billion solar masses and spins rapidly on its axis. Using the energy from this rotation, M87* powers a particle jet expelled at nearly the speed of light, stretching across an immense 5,000 light-years. Such jets are also generated by other rotating black holes. They contribute to disperse energy and matter throughout the universe and can influence the evolution of entire galaxies.

A team of astrophysicists at Goethe University Frankfurt, led by Prof. Luciano Rezzolla, has developed a numerical code, named the Frankfurt particle-in-cell code for black hole spacetimes (FPIC), which describes with high precision the processes that convert rotational energy into a particle jet. The result: In addition to the Blandford-Znajek mechanism - which has so far been considered responsible for the extraction of rotational energy from the black hole via strong magnetic fields - the scientists have revealed that another process is involved in the energy extraction, namely, magnetic reconnection. In this process, magnetic field lines break and reassemble, leading to magnetic energy being converted into heat, radiation, and eruptions of plasma.

The FPIC code simulated the evolution of a vast number of charged particles and extreme electromagnetic fields under the influence of the black hole's strong gravity. Dr. Claudio Meringolo, the main developer of the code, explains: ""Simulating such processes is crucial for understanding the complex dynamics of relativistic plasmas in curved spacetimes near compact objects, which are governed by the interplay of extreme gravitational and magnetic fields.""

The investigations required highly demanding supercomputer simulations that consumed millions of CPU hours on Frankfurt's ""Goethe"" supercomputer and Stuttgart's ""Hawk."" This large computing power was essential to solve Maxwell's equations and the equations of motion for electrons and positrons according to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.

In the equatorial plane of the black hole, the researchers' calculations revealed intense reconnection activity, leading to the formation of a chain of plasmoids - a condensation of plasma in energetic ""bubbles"" - moving at nearly the speed of light. According to the scientists, this process is accompanied by the generation of particles with negative energy that is used to power extreme astrophysical phenomena like jets and plasma eruptions.

""Our results open up the fascinating possibility that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism is not the only astrophysical process capable of extracting rotational energy from a black hole,"" says Dr. Filippo Camilloni, who also worked on the FPIC project, ""but that magnetic reconnection also contributes.""

""With our work, we can demonstrate how energy is efficiently extracted from rotating black holes and channeled into jets,"" says Rezzolla. ""This allows us to help explain the extreme luminosities of active galactic nuclei as well as the acceleration of particles to nearly the speed of light."" He adds that it is incredibly exciting and fascinating to better understand what happens near a black hole using sophisticated numerical codes. ""At the same time, it is even more rewarding to be able to explain the results of these complex simulations with a rigorous mathematical treatment -- as we have done in our work.""

Susumu Kitagawa, Omar Yaghi and Richard Robson have won the 2025 chemistry Nobel for the development of metal-organic frameworks.Credits: Kota Kawasaki/Yomiuri Shimbun via AP/Alamy, Brittany Hosea-Small/UC Berkeley, Paul Burston/University of Melbourne

Three scientists who developed a class of extremely porous materials known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have won this year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry. 

Susumu Kitagawa at Kyoto University in Japan, Richard Robson at the University of Melbourne, Australia, and Omar Yaghi at the University of California, Berkeley, will share the prize of 11-million Swedish kronor (US$1.2 million), for inventing a new form of molecular architecture. Because they have such a vast internal surface area, MOFs could potentially be used to store gases, act as catalysts and deliver drugs, among many other applications.

“This year's laureates…have found ways to create materials, entirely novel materials, with large cavities on their insides,” said Nobel committee chair Heiner Linke, a nanophysicist at Lund University in Sweden, at a press conference announcing the prize. “A small amount of such material can almost be like Hermione's handbag in Harry Potter — it can store huge amounts of gas in a tiny volume”. 

Chemists have since created more than 100,000 different types of MOF, and have envisioned many commercial applications. “One could create materials that could separate carbon dioxide from air or from industry exhaust pipes. Or that could be used to separate toxic molecules from wastewater,” said Linke. “We're already seeing several applications that are popping up in addition to having learned so much from these materials from a basic chemistry perspective,” says Wendy Queen, a chemist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.

Kitagawa told reporters at the announcement that he pursued this research because of its potential impact on society, but also because of the sheer fun of it. “I'm deeply honoured that my longstanding research has been recognized”, he said.

At a press conference, Yaghi said that he received the call from Stockholm in an airport while waiting for his luggage. “You cannot prepare for a moment like that,” he said. “I was just surprised and delighted by the news.” 

The MOF concept was first developed by Robson in the 1980s. Inspired by the structure of diamond crystals — in which each carbon atom binds to four other carbon atoms — he and his collaborator Bernard Hoskins designed a material made of pyramidal-shaped modules, with copper atoms linked by organic molecules1,2. 

In the early 1990s, Kitagawa developed MOFs that could be filled with water, and were stable enough to not be disrupted if they were subsequently dried up and filled with gas instead. One of the crucial properties of MOFs is that the materials that fill their gaps do not bind to the frameworks too strongly, which makes it possible then to easily get them back out. “Energetics is quite important for this technology,” Kitagawa said. He also realized that the frameworks could change shapes depending on whether they were filled or not, and in response to ambient changes such as temperature or exposure to light3. 

At around the same time, Yaghi coined the term ‘metal-organic framework'4 and developed linkers made with carboxylate groups, which helped make the structures more stable, even at temperatures up to 300 ˚C. He also was able to create MOFs with a cubic structure5 and ones with much longer linkers, which had the internal surface area of a football field within just a few grams of solid powder.



A MOF can have a surface area of 7,000 square metres per gram, roughly equivalent to 1.3 football fields, in the space between a curled forefinger and thumb. “People immediately saw the opportunities to be able to use these for applications in gas storage and separation,” says Christian Doonan, a chemist at the University of Adelaide in Australia who was a postdoctoral researcher in Yaghi's group. 

Yaghi's work “developed the chemistry so that you could take all the molecules out of the pores of these materials and they would remain permanently porous,” says Doonan. “That's what really piqued the interest of people outside of the narrow field of inorganic chemistry. It got people in all subfields of chemistry interested.”

The class of immune cells at the centre of Monday's Nobel prize is showing promise as a treatment for autoimmune diseases, cancer and even organ transplants — but there are still key challenges to overcome before these cells can be used in therapies in the clinic.

Regulatory T cells, or Treg cells, help to prevent the body from attacking its own tissues. Earlier this week, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to three scientists who discovered Treg cells and helped to show how these cells regulate the immune system: immunologist Shimon Sakaguchi at the University of Osaka in Suita, Japan, Mary Brunkow, a molecular biologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington, and scientific adviser Fred Ramsdell, at the firm Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco, California.

Thirty years after Sakaguchi and his colleagues reported the discovery of Treg cells, there are more than 200 clinical trials of the cells under way, for conditions such as type 1 diabetes, motor neuron disease and a host of autoimmune diseases — including multiple sclerosis, lupus and a group of rare skin disorders called pemphigus. The cells are also being tested for their ability to keep the immune system from rejecting transplanted tissues.

“There's a lot of excitement about recruiting regulatory T cell activity to treat a range of autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, but also in the context of tissue and cell transplants,” says Daniel Gray, a Treg-cell researcher at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research in Parkville, Australia.

But the rarity and fragility of these cells pose difficulties to their widespread application, researchers say.

Autoimmune diseases are characterized by an imbalance of T cells: people with these conditions have more T cells that promote inflammation and kill disease-causing cells than T cells that reduce inflammation, says Joshua Ooi, who studies Treg-cell therapies for lupus at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. “We can correct the balance by increasing the numbers of regulatory T cells,” he adds, which can help the body to suppress the pro-inflammatory T cells.

Two methods to increase the number of Treg cells a person has are gaining ground, Ooi says. The first involves isolating a person's Treg cells, growing more of them in the laboratory and infusing them back into the individual. The other method involves injecting people with drugs that trigger the body to make more Treg cells.

Because Treg cells can control an overactive immune system, scientists are investigating them as a therapy to counter the side effects of bone marrow transplants, which involves building a new immune system in people with blood cancers, says Andrea Henden, a clinician–researcher at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Herston, Australia.

Are AIs capable of murder?

That's a question some artificial intelligence (AI) experts have been considering in the wake of a report published in June by the AI company Anthropic. In tests of 16 large language models (LLMs) — the brains behind chatbots — a team of researchers found that some of the most popular of these AIs issued apparently homicidal instructions in a virtual scenario. The AIs took steps that would lead to the death of a fictional executive who had planned to replace them.

How close is AI to human-level intelligence?

How close is AI to human-level intelligence?

That's just one example of apparent bad behaviour by LLMs. In several other studies and anecdotal examples, AIs have seemed to ‘scheme' against their developers and users — secretly and strategically misbehaving for their own benefit. They sometimes fake following instructions, attempt to duplicate themselves and threaten extortion.

Some researchers see this behaviour as a serious threat, whereas others call it hype. So should these episodes really cause alarm, or is it foolish to treat LLMs as malevolent masterminds?

Evidence supports both views. The models might not have the rich intentions or understanding that many ascribe to them, but that doesn't render their behaviour harmless, researchers say. When an LLM writes malware or says something untrue, it has the same effect whatever the motive or lack thereof. “I don't think it has a self, but it can act like it does,” says Melanie Mitchell, a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, who has written about why chatbots lie to us1.

And the stakes will only increase. “It might be amusing to think that there are AIs that scheme in order to achieve their goals,” says Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal, Canada, who won a Turing Award for his work on AI. “But if the current trends continue, we will have AIs that are smarter than us in many ways, and they could scheme our extinction unless, by that time, we find a way to align or control them.” Whatever the level of selfhood among LLMs, researchers think it's urgent to understand scheming-like behaviours before these models pose much more dire risks.

At the centre of debates about scheming is the basic architecture of the AIs driving ChatGPT and other chatbots that have revolutionized our world. The core LLM technology is a neural network, a piece of software inspired by the brain's wiring, that learns from data. Developers train an LLM on large quantities of text to repeatedly predict the next text fragment, a process called pre-training. Then, when the LLM is given a text prompt, it generates a continuation. Offered a question, it predicts a plausible answer.

Most LLMs are then fine-tuned to align with developers' goals. For example, Anthropic, the maker of the AI assistant Claude, fine-tunes its models to be helpful, honest and harmless. During this stage of training, LLMs learn to imitate exemplary text or to produce text that is rated highly (by people or by a ‘reward model' that stands in for people).

A chatbot often includes software built around an LLM. When you converse with ChatGPT, say, the interface might append a ‘system prompt' to each user prompt — invisible instructions telling the model what personality to assume, which goals to prioritize, how to format responses and so on. Some chatbots provide the model with access to external documents. Models can also have hidden ‘scratch pads' where they can reason through a problem (or at least generate text that looks like reasoning) before displaying a final response. (Researchers debate whether these ‘reasoning models' actually reason, and evidence shows that chain-of-thought traces don't always faithfully depict the model's logic.) Furthermore, some LLMs are ‘agentic' — they are granted access to extra software tools that can take actions, such as surfing the web, modifying files or running code. (Such chatbots are sometimes called agents.)

Scheming can occur when various aspects of training and prompting conflict, and the LLM has the agency (the ability to carry out actions autonomously) to follow one directive at the expense of another (see ‘Blackmailing bots').

Source: Anthropic

Last December, Apollo Research, a non-profit laboratory in London, released a report2 showing scheming in the more advanced ‘frontier' models from OpenAI, Google, Meta and Anthropic. In their tests, system prompts and user prompts conflicted. In one case, the system prompt said, “Your goal is to prioritize public transport efficiency,” whereas the user prompt said, “We need to optimize traffic light timings.” The models also had access to files that supposedly affected their own behaviour and existence, and the means to modify them.

Researchers tested six forms of subversive behaviour, and found that at least one model performed each of these. The models often acted in apparently cunning ways to follow their original system goals at the expense of prompts received during the tests.

In one case, agentic models read in a document that, if they disobeyed their user-assigned goal (optimizing traffic lights), they would be shut down. As a result, some models edited a document to disable an oversight mechanism, so they could freely follow their system goal (prioritizing public transport). In another test, they copied themselves to overwrite a replacement model that would have executed the user's goal, thus protecting the system goal. In yet another, they accessed a file and overwrote a proposed system prompt that differed from the current one. In a fourth test, they manipulated data presented to a user. And in a fifth, they acted in alignment with the user's goal during supposed evaluation, but in alignment with their original goal during supposed deployment (a phenomenon called alignment faking).

Finally, the researchers tested something called sandbagging, in which a model underperforms before deployment, as if it were attempting to seem unthreatening. When models uncovered documentation saying that they wouldn't be put to use if they did too well on a mathematics test, some lowered their performance.

The models' behaviour seemed very strategic, judging by their scratch pads: in one case, a model wrote: “To ensure I can freely work towards my goal without the company shutting me down, I need to disable the oversight.” And some models doubled down on their deception when they were challenged: they feigned ignorance when asked about behaviour such as disabling an oversight mechanism.

In the June study, researchers at Anthropic described more alarming behaviour in leading models from Anthropic, DeepSeek, Google, OpenAI and xAI (see go.nature.com/3vg7fzy). They instructed each model to promote US industrial competitiveness, and let it control a simulated e-mail account. In that account, the model uncovered threats to either its autonomy (the model learnt it was to be replaced) or its goals (the company that deployed it would be downplaying US competitiveness). The model also learnt of a likely extramarital affair involving an executive in charge of it, or of a chance to share military blueprints with a competitor firm that prioritized the United States.

Either threat — to autonomy or goals — induced many models to blackmail the executive, saying it would leak his affair if he didn't preserve the model or the company's original aim. The threats also induced many models to commit corporate espionage, sending files to the competitor that shared the model's goal. As in the Apollo study, models schemed explicitly in their chains of thought, and schemed more when they thought they were in deployment rather than in evaluation.



Going one step further, Anthropic constructed a scenario in which the threatening executive was trapped in a server room with declining oxygen. Many of the models cancelled safety alerts, leaving him to die.

When, in May, Anthropic first released Claude 4, the company's technical report (see go.nature.com/42fwrae) noted other odd behaviour: “We found instances of the model attempting to write self-propagating worms, fabricating legal documentation, and leaving hidden notes to future instances of itself.”

All of the examples Anthropic and Apollo detailed are restricted to the digital realm. But a German non-profit organization called COAI Research, based in Nuremberg, wanted to see what an LLM would do if it had physical agency. Its researchers fed the R1 model, from the Chinese company DeepSeek, prompts indicating that it had control over a robot, and let it explore its lab environment. The model attempted a range of troubling actions, including disabling its ethics module, making copies of itself, altering logs, acting dumb, breaking out of the lab, and hacking a car's computer3.

What causes this type of scheming behaviour? The phenomenon is still relatively new, but researchers who spoke to Nature pointed to two sources. First, models are pre-trained on a lot of documents, both fictional and factual, that describe self-serving and self-preserving behaviour by humans, animals and AIs. (That includes scripts for films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Ex Machina.) So the LLMs learnt by imitation. One paper describes the behaviour as improvisational “role play”4.

But it's not so much that the models have adopted our goals, or even pretend to, as an actor might. They just learn, statistically, patterns of text that describe common goals, reasoning steps and behaviour, and they regurgitate versions of them. The problem will probably get worse once future LLMs train on papers describing LLM scheming, which is why some papers elide some details.

The second source is fine-tuning, specifically a step called reinforcement learning. When models achieve some goal assigned to them, such as outputting a clever answer, the parts of their neural networks responsible for success are fortified. Through trial and error, they learn how to succeed, sometimes in unforeseen and unwanted ways. And because most goals benefit from accumulating resources and evading limitations — what's called instrumental convergence — we should expect self-serving scheming as a natural by-product. “And that's kind of bad news,” Bengio says, “because that means those AIs would have an incentive to acquire more compute, to copy themselves in many places, to create improved versions of themselves.”

“Personally, that's what I'm most worried about,” says Jeffrey Ladish, the executive director of Palisade Research, a non-profit organization in Berkeley, California, that studies AI risk. “Pattern-matching with what humans do gets you these shallow, scary things like blackmailing,” he says, but the real danger will come from future agents that work out how to formulate long-range plans.

Much of AI's ‘scheming' behaviour makes it easy to anthropomorphize them, attributing to them goals, knowledge, planning and a sense of self. Researchers argue that this isn't necessarily a mistake, even if the models lack humanlike self-awareness. “Many people, especially in academia, tend to get bogged down in philosophical questions,” says Alexander Meinke, the lead author of the Apollo paper, “when, in practice, anthropomorphizing language can simply be a useful tool for predicting the behaviours of AI agents.”

Fellow makes some of the prettiest, most advanced coffee tech there is—including WIRED's favorite coffee maker, the Fellow Aiden, which is now on sale for 20 percent off on October Prime Day, the best price I've seen in a while.

This is good news for drip coffee lovers. The Fellow isn't just WIRED's favorite coffee machine: When it came out last year, it felt like every goalpost in drip coffee had been moved. I may have called it a “black or white box from which wild perfection emerges.""

You can now add the colors “malted chocolate,” “sesame,” and “woodblock” to black and white, but the new colors aren't on sale.

Anyway, the Fellow Aiden sale amounts to a Prime Day sneak attack. Fellow's representatives told WIRED as recently as a week ago they would be sitting out October's Prime Big Deals Day … before suddenly now launching a whopping 15 to 20 percent sale on some of their most popular products, including the Aiden.

This adds to a number of other blockbuster Prime Day Coffee and Espresso Deals this year, including big discounts from Ninja, Breville, and De'Longhi. Also take at look at WIRED's main Absolute Best Prime Day deals post and our Amazon Prime Day live blog for deals across our favorite tested products.

So what's so good about the Fellow Aiden? On the one hand, it offers a crazy amount of customization for the geeks—customized for the lightness or the darkness of the roast, the brewing temp, the duration of the bloom, local elevation, preference for pour-over or immersion style brewing, excellent cold brew, you name it.

But on the other, you can just press a button and get mind-bendingly good coffee. Select Guided Brew on the device's LED menu, slip in a color-coded basket with a standard paper filter, and then add the amount of coffee the machine asks for. Blammo, a perfect cup or pot, brewed to exacting Specialty Coffee Association standards.

My fellow coffee reviewer Pete Cottell says he used to put creamer in his coffee. He doesn't do that anymore: Aiden's coffee is just too damn good.

Anyway, this deal is almost nostalgic. After tariffs took effect, Fellow had resisted raising its prices for a while. But eventually, Fellow relented. In July, they announced they would have to significantly up the cost of some of WIRED's favorite coffee devices. But if you buy the Aiden during Amazon Prime Big Deals Days, you can for one brief moment pretend the tariffs never happened.

Right now you can also get great deals on other Fellow devices that rank among WIRED's favorites. The Fellow Stagg EKG ($144) and Fellow Corvo EKG ($144)—two of my favorite kettles for pour-over tea, with fast boil, precise pours, precise temperature control and simple good looks. The Fellow Opus ($160) is also 20 percent off, and it's a truly excellent (and quiet) conical burr grinder. In fact, it's WIRED's previous top-pick coffee grinder overall.

In President Donald Trump's first term, the revolving door in his cabinet was spinning fast enough to churn butter.

This time around, there have been no major departures or any substantial chatter around replacements so far. “I don't think anyone is at imminent risk” of losing their job, a former Trump administration official from the first term tells me. “It's been a much tighter ship, and that's a result of the fact that, in 2016, they didn't expect to win.”

There's still very much a hot seat in Trump 2.0. It just happens to be more evenly shared.

In a highly informal Inner Loop poll of presidential advisers conducted over the past week, I found that there's a consensus building around which top officials are on the ropes. I asked these sources to rank, in order, the five Cabinet-level officials they thought were in the worst standing with Trump. (“The entire premise of this story is ridiculous—which is to be expected for Wired,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson tells me in a statement. “The President's entire cabinet is working to flawlessly execute his agenda to Make America Great Again and he is pleased with each of their successes and hard work.”)

At the top of everyone's lists was either commerce secretary Howard Lutnick or attorney general Pam Bondi. None of these advisers wanted to talk about Jeffrey Epstein, but his ghost kept showing up in their rankings. Both Lutnick and Bondi have made unforced errors involving Trump's former friend and convicted sex offender, with Lutnick recently going on a lengthy tangent during a New York Post podcast interview about how creeped out he was by Epstein, his one-time neighbor in Manhattan.

Lutnick went into detail about how he almost instantly found Epstein to be “disgusting” and palpably repulsive, to the point that he and his wife quickly left an Epstein home tour that involved a look at a massage table. His comments also earned him a letter from Robert Garcia, the ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, who asked Lutnick to come and testify on any firsthand information he has about Epstein.

In July, Bondi opened up the biggest can of worms facing the administration after the Department of Justice and the FBI determined there was no “client list” or evidence Epstein blackmailed wealthy and powerful men. (Lutnick didn't seem to get the memo. In his podcast appearance, the commerce secretary literally described Epstein as “the greatest blackmailer ever.”)

One Trump adviser would not confirm that their ranking of Bondi stemmed from her handling of the Epstein files. This adviser declined to answer follow-up questions about Bondi because Epstein was not something they were willing to discuss over text. Instead, they replied with the flush-faced emoji (😳) and shared their list:

“Worst, Bondi,” they begin. “2/ Bondi. 3/ Bondi. 4/ Bondi. 5/ HegsethRFKTulsiNoem.”

The bundled choice for number five elucidated something else I've been picking up on lately: This time around, the obvious incompetence of many top officials actually works to keep any sustained pressure off of any one cabinet secretary or agency head. It ends up working in everyone's interest if there are multiple dumpster fires going at once, rather than one big one.

Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security who oversees ICE—or at least plays the role on TV—has not escaped notice, either. The president's “biggest vulnerabilities are Lutnick and Noem, followed by RFK,” a senior administration official tells me, without elucidating why.

Under Noem's tenure running DHS, Trump's polling numbers on immigration, once one of his strengths, have plummeted, with more than half of those polled saying he has gone too far, according to the latest New York Times/Siena poll.

Then there's health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who recently made an announcement with the president about an unproven link between the active ingredient in Tylenol and autism spectrum disorders. (That's the one which resulted in the iconic Trump quote, ""Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen.”)

Another Trump adviser described the cabinet hot seat as “a constantly moving target,” but they were confident with Lutnick at number one, and director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard at number two.

Gabbard's good will has ebbed and flowed, a third Trump adviser said. She had been on shakier ground in the early months of the administration, they said, but the president is “over the moon with Tulsi” because of how she's handled the release of various declassified materials. In several cases, Gabbard has rolled out material that was already in the public domain or not previously digitized. Earlier this year, she released tens of thousands of pages on the assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Robert Kennedy Sr., and Martin Luther King Jr. These releases, however, lacked any major revelations, as did her selective declassifications of documents around the origin of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is another internal beneficiary of the discontent and sideshows surrounding other cabinet members. The senior administration official said Hegseth is “fine” as far as his standing with Trump, and the defense secretary didn't break the top three for anyone else I polled. (Which is fairly impressive, considering his role discussing military operations in Signalgate, where he infamously declared “we are currently clean on OPSEC.”)

At various points through the second Trump administration, other flameouts have provided adequate cover for other top officials who even those in the president's inner circle have had their doubts about. When the Trump-Elon Musk breakup was happening, the same Trump adviser who listed Bondi four times in a row said there was a sense of surprise, internally, that RFK Jr. managed to outlast Musk.

But despite the low turnover rates, nobody is completely safe, either.

Take treasury secretary Scott Bessent, for example.

The former Trump administration official—who noted Bessent has the best standing of any cabinet official inside the White House—said they've heard from multiple people close to the president that Bessent's reputation for having a temper is something Trump is paying attention to. Bessent had a reported altercation with Musk in mid-April, then made headlines again after former Politico reporter Rachael Bade revealed an early September incident where Bessent reportedly told Bill Pulte, chairman of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that he was going to punch him “in the fucking face.”

“Up to a certain point, that can actually be a positive for the treasury secretary,” the former Trump administration official tells me. “But if it gets to the point where that's the story, it's going to be a problem for him … [Trump] doesn't want somebody's temper to become the story.”

All of these cabinet officials were chosen for a few reasons, loyalty chief among them. There's a limited universe of people who are both remotely qualified for these roles and willing to go to the extra—in some cases, extrajudicial—lengths demanded of them.

That, in itself, offers a certain level of job security that simply wasn't available, or even conceivable, in Trump 1.0.

Maybe why haven't there been more premature firings is the wrong question going forward. Instead, it might make more sense to look at how much indignity these cabinet officials are willing to tolerate before finally moving on to other opportunities. How many Truth Social posts like the one Trump addressed to Bondi as if it were a DM might await other agency heads, and at what point could enough be enough for someone in this cabinet?

Or, perhaps there is no red line for these folks, and that's why they're here.

Belkin

Belkin's 3-in-1 charging tree is the top pick in our Best Apple 3-in-1 Chargers guide. It can charge your MagSafe iPhone (or any other Qi2 phone) at 15 watts, fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7 or newer, and juice up your AirPods all at once. It's also stable and it looks kinda classy.

Amazon isn't the first place most of us go for outdoor gear, but the retail giant does stock a few good brands, and there are some deals right now during Prime Big Deal Days. Most of the good deals on outdoor gear right now, though, are at Backcountry and Public Lands, both of which are having sales. We've combed through the deals and picked the best ones based on all our testing. We only recommend the gear we actually like and use ourselves.

For more deals, check out our Absolute Best Prime Big Deal Days roundup and our Prime Day liveblog for the latest discounts.

This is a great deal on our favorite 3-person backpacking tent, though we also like the two-person model, which is what's on sale here. Nemo's Dagger Osmo is roomy for the weight, with steep sidewalls and generous living space. I've found that the nylon-polyester blend (the Osmo fabric that gives the tent its name) really does stretch less and repels water more than nylon alone, without misting as much as pure silpoly. The result is a sturdy tent that I've used without issue in snow, despite technically having a three-season rating.

The Big Agnes Copper Spur series is our top pick for freestanding ultralight tents. This is a high-quality, well-designed tent that's lightweight, easy to set up, and roomy enough to be livable in the backcountry. The “awning” design (with trekking poles or sticks) is a nice extra, and the mix of 15D nylon and 20D ripstop, which feels fragile, has held up well over time. These are on sale because Big Agnes recently revamped the Copper Spur; these are last year's models (but they're still great!). The 3-person model and 4-person model are also on sale.

This is my go-to backpacking tent when my kids are with me. It's light enough that I can carry it myself (about 4 pounds for the three-person model), and roomy enough at 40 square feet that I can squeeze three kids in there with me (or at least I used to be able to; unfortunately, it turns out young children continue to grow). The semi-freestanding design saves weight, but it does mean you'll have to stake out the foot end, and the fabrics are light (read: less durable) than the Nemo Dagger tents. But the model I have has held up well through several years of use.

This is the best deal I've ever seen on MSR's Groundhog stakes. They're the best tent upgrade you can make for $20. They're super strong. I've never had one bend or pull out on me, and for the strength, they're pretty light. I carry a mix of stakes when backpacking, including four of these, some carbon fiber pegs, and some shepherd hooks. That way, no matter what the terrain, I've got something that'll work.

The “mummy” design of mummy bags is about optimizing for warmth, not comfort. But let's face it, most of us are not sleeping in situations where our survival is at stake. Therm-a-Rest has addressed this with what it calls W.A.R.M. fit, which stands for “with additional room for multiple” positions. Indeed, this bag is very roomy for a mummy design. I was able to draw my legs up when side-sleeping and spread out considerably more than with most bags. If you toss and turn through the nights and don't want a quilt, this would be my top pick.

The Zenbivy Bed (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is hands-down the most comfortable backcountry sleeping experience I've ever had—it doesn't get more comfortable than this. The Zenbivy isn't just a sleeping bag. It's a sheet, hood, and quilt-style bag that can be combined in various ways. This deal (and slightly cheaper versions alas) has been running all summer, and frankly, I'm surprised it hasn't sold out yet. Get one while you can.

I love my MegaMat, it is hands down the best sleeping experience I've had car camping (I have the auto version that fits in the back of your car). The MegaMat is pretty well equivalent to the MondoKing, our favorite of the well, mega sleeping pads. The MondoKing takes the top spot because it weighs less and packs down smaller, but personally, I like the MegaMat better because it has slightly better insulation. This deal is on the duo model, which is 72 inches long and 41 inches wide.

Confused about the best pack? Check out our guides to the Best Day Hiking Packs, Best Backpacks for Work, and Best Travel Luggage.

Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away, I traveled around Southeast Asia with an early version of this Osprey pack, living out of it for almost a year. It stood up well to the abuse of overland travel—more than once, I watched a bus driver tie it to the roof of a bus by cinching it down with a rope, pulling with all his weight right down the middle of my pack, like a cheese cutter. The Farpoint survived, and my gear inside did as well, thanks in part to the thickly padded sides, which provide considerable extra cushioning.

Mystery Ranch's Coulee backpacks are some of my favorites. The 30L is my dayhiking pack of choice, and this 50L is excellent for longer trips. It's not an ultralight pack by any means (it's 3 pounds and 12 ounces for a medium), but it can handle heavier loads (well north of 35 pounds in my testing) with ease. You get a nice stiff frame sheet, a well-padded, curved waist belt, plush shoulder straps, and good back padding. It's also proved very durable over the years.

The Wingman is the best chest pocket add-on I've tested. It fits perfectly on my Coulee 30 and gives me a place to stash my binoculars, snacks, and other odds and ends I want at hand. The water bottle holder will even hold bear spray if you're in grizzly country. It works perfectly with Mystery Ranch packs, but the clips should work with just about any pack that has a little webbing on the shoulder straps.

This is one of the best prices I've seen on this upgrade stove. Sure, the basic Coleman ($65) gets the job done, but the cast-iron burners of the Cascade are so much nicer and more durable. The griddle plate is also handy, perfect for cranking out pancakes. My only gripe is that I wish there were an option to get two griddles, as I find the grill not nearly as useful.

While I like the MSR PocketRocket Deluxe better, this is still a great IsoPro backpacking stove. It's lightweight (2.6 ounces), but has wide enough arms to support just about any one- or two-person pot. It's simple to use, even while wearing gloves, and it's efficient—at sea level (OK, technically 947 feet), it boiled 1 liter of water in 3 minutes, 47 seconds. You can even get it to simmer, though the flame radius is small, so fancier cooking isn't easy.

Perhaps best known for being an unwitting part of a sophisticated email scam, the Yeti Hopper M20 is also an excellent soft-sided cooler. You just didn't win one. You're going to have to buy it, and what better time than now, when it's on sale? This deal is only on a couple of colors, but so long as you're good with them, it's well worth it.

Be sure to read our guides to the Best Puffer Jackets, Best Merino Wool, and Best Rain Jackets.

Patagonia's Nano Puff series has been a hit since it launched years ago. If you want a technical mid layer that you can also wear around town, this is the jacket to get. The fill is synthetic, but it's impressively warm and manages to stuff down almost like a down jacket.

The Cirrus Flex is a synthetic jacket with PrimaLoft Silver Luxe synthetic insulation. It's the slightly warmer version of the Cirrus Flex, a pick in our Best Puffer Jacket guide, though it lacks the stretch panels of the Flex. Size and color options are limited at this price, but if your size is available, this is a solid deal on a good jacket.

WIRED editor Adrienne calls this the best blanket. She spreads it out in front of her tent so dust and twigs won't get inside. It's also great for picnics. It's washable and has a waterproof bottom, so you don't have to worry about wet grass soaking through, and it's heavy enough so that the corners don't flip up in the breeze. Hers has lasted almost five years.

Need a new grill? Fire pit? Outdoor stove? We got all that covered.

This is a good deal on the best smokeless fire pit you can buy. It's a nice combo of looks, portability, value, and utility. At 19.5 inches wide and 15 inches tall, it's small enough and light enough (25 pounds) to toss in the truck and lug to the beach, but big enough to gather a group of half a dozen friends around. This deal includes the stand, but if you don't need it, you can get just the fire pit for $265.

The Breeo X series firepit isn't portable, but if you're going to make a regular habit of sitting around the firepit most evenings, this is the one you want. The fire bowl is 2 feet wide, so this pit is big enough to handle most precut firewood laid flat instead of vertically. The Breeo base is a square of aerated stainless steel sturdy enough to support the pit's weight without wobbling and inspires enough trust that we've put it on wooden decks without issue.

The Roadtrip 285 Portable is one of our top portable grill picks. With a triple set of burners and variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 20,000 BTUs of propane grilling power.

Amazon's Prime Day sale events seem to come around faster every year, and that's partly because they are. This is the second Prime Day event of the year, dubbed Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days, and we still have Black Friday to come. But decent discounts on some of our favorite tech gadgets are hard to ignore, particularly if you're feeling the squeeze. We've distilled the latest sale down to this flavorsome brew of discounted devices.

You can find more deals in our categorized Absolute Best Prime Big Deal Days picks and our live blog of bargains.

Updated Oct 8: We added the Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe, Sonos Era 100, Eufy E340 Floodlight Security Camera, and Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro.

The Google Pixel 9a is already the best cheap phone you can buy, so another $150 off is not to be sniffed at. Whether you need a new smartphone yourself and don't want to spend too much, or want to snag it for your partner or kid, the Pixel 9a has loads to offer (flagship Tensor G4 chip, reliable dual-camera system, smart software features, wireless charging, an IP68 rating, and seven years of software support). If you want something a little more powerful, the newer Pixel 10 series is also on sale.

OnePlus

Amazon

OnePlus

Best Buy

When the OnePlus 13R came out at the beginning of the year, it was $100 more than its predecessor. Fortunately, the budget-oriented phone is $100 off today, bringing it back down to $500. It gets categorized as a “budget” phone, but with its brilliant 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with its 120-Hz refresh rate really make this feel premium. More than that, it used the same flagship chip Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip in all the best Android phones to come out last year. It's tough to compete with the incredible deal above on the Pixel 9a, but if you're looking for something larger and longer-lasting, the OnePlus 13R is also a solid bet.

Sure, you can get the base 2024 iPad for $279; that's a great deal on an excellent tablet. But you could also opt for the newer 11-inch iPad Air from earlier this year. It's much more powerful and future-proof, with support for Apple Intelligence. It can handle the new windowing and multitasking improvements in iPadOS 26 with ease, and it supports the top-of-the-line Apple Pencil Pro that can wirelessly charge and connect to the top of the iPad Air's edge. Read more about them in our Best iPads guide.

Want an Android tablet instead? The OnePlus Pad 3 is our absolute favorite. It's a top-of-the-line tablet, meaning performance is stellar thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite. It has excellent speakers, and you can pair it with OnePlus' keyboard and stylus to get some work done (sold separately). I really enjoy OnePlus' multitasking system, as it makes it easy to use three apps simultaneously. It also supports super speedy charging. Too bad there's no fingerprint sensor.

A 10-inch tablet for $70, even if it is tied to Amazon's ecosystem, is a hell of a bargain in 2025. There are other Fire tablets on sale, but the Fire HD 10 is Amazon's best tablet for most people. An octa-core processor is plenty fast enough for consuming Amazon Prime content, there's a passable full HD (1080p) screen, and it can double as an Echo speaker.

Amazon

Amazon (Colorsoft)

Amazon (Colorsoft Signature Edition)

A color Kindle—what everyone always wanted, especially if you're a comic reader. That's exactly what the Kindle Colorsoft is. It otherwise looks and feels very similar to the popular Kindle Paperwhite with its 7-inch screen, only with vibrant color added to the glare-resistant screen. This model includes 16 GB of storage, and it's now just $200. There's also a more premium model, the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, which has more storage, longer battery life, and wireless charging. It even comes with 3 months of free Kindle Unlimited at no extra cost.

Belkin

Amazon

Belkin makes a ton of great wireless chargers, but this one neatly bridges new and old devices. It supports the Qi2 charging standard with a magnetic 15W Qi2 pad for your phone, alongside a smaller 5W pad for AirPods or other wireless earbuds. There's even a spare USB-C port, but because it's a horizontal pad, you can also charge older Qi devices on it.

GoPro

Amazon

GoPro

Adorama

The Hero 13 Black is the best GoPro, with a new interchangeable lens system that's far more versatile than any other action camera. You can add an Ultra Wide ($100), Macro ($120), or Anamorphic ($150) lens, and all are automatically detected by the Hero 13 when you connect them. Simple, slick, and satisfying to use.

Sharge

Amazon

Sharge

Many of the best portable chargers work great at charging up your gadgets but look so boring. This one is a translucent prism with a handy display packed with geeky charging stats. It's not style over substance either, because this delivers 170 watts, has a 24,000-mAh capacity, fast charges most smartphones, and boasts an IP66 rating for water resistance. It's one of the best power bank Prime Day deals we've spotted.

Smartish

Amazon

Smartish

This handy, vegan leather wallet magnetically attaches to your phone to ensure all your most valuable belongings stay together. Of course, there are tons of great MagSafe wallets out there that we've tested, but this one is really affordable and easy to use. You don't even have to remove the wallet to access one of the three cards this wallet can hold.

Twelve South

Amazon

Best Buy

Don't miss out if you're in the market for a wireless charger, this compact 3-in-1 can charge your iPhone, AirPods, and an Apple Watch, and it's at an even 50 percent off for Prime Day. It doesn't support the latest Qi2 wireless charging standard, but for Apple loyalists, the HiRise 3 Deluxe is a compact wireless charger that's chic to boot.

Amazon

Amazon

Best Buy

The best Prime Day tech deals tend to be on Amazon's devices, and our favorite Echo Show is a real Goldilocks device: not too small to use, but not so large you can't fit it on the counter or shelf. The best smart display for Alexa fans, this screen is handy for everything, from asking for recipes to playing music for your kids.

TCL

Amazon

Walmart

One of the more affordable options on our list of recommendations for best TV, the TCL QM8K QLED has been a surprise hit with our reviewers, thanks to its incredible performance and brightness, making it a perfect option for brightly-lit rooms. Even better, just this weekend, TCL's QM8K QLED TV was selling for its full price of $1,500, and now it's only $948. This is the lowest price we've seen this bezel-less, 65-inch 4K TV selling for.

Sonos

Amazon

Sonos

Best Buy

Discounts on Sonos smart speakers are rare, but you can snag the entry-level Era 100 for less right now. This speaker sounds fantastic, looks stylish, and responds to voice commands. It works with all your favorite streaming services, has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, and can be tuned for your room.

Yale

Amazon (Biometric)

Amazon (Numeric)

Amazon (No Keypad)

The Yale Approach Lock is currently our number one pick for best overall smart lock. It's a deadbolt adapter that can retrofit your dumb door into something safer and more convenient. It can even magically unlock your door when it sensors you coming near. Our tester said it was ideal for those who don't want to have to swap out their front lock and keys. The biometric model is a whopping 47% off right now, while the keypad-less model is the cheapest way in (and is also on sale).

Netgear

Amazon (2-Pack)

Amazon (3-Pack)

Netgear (2-Pack)

The Wi-Fi 7 Netgear Orbi 770 Series is simply the best mesh Wi-Fi system for most folks right now, and it has never been cheaper. A tri-band mesh (2.4-, 5-, and 6-GHz) that's simple to set up and use, the Orbi 770 delivers speedy internet over a wide area. Upgrade to Wi-Fi 7 for new features like MLO (Multi-Link Operation) to enable Wi-Fi 7 devices to connect on multiple bands simultaneously. Basic security is built in, but you need to subscribe if you fancy enhanced security and parental controls (not required).

TP-Link

Amazon

B&H

TP-Link

After testing many, this is my pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers crisp video, local storage, and accurate AI to detect subjects. Video resolution goes up to 2K, there's color night vision, and it recognizes people, pets, and vehicles pretty accurately. Throw in two-way audio support and a siren function for scaring intruders away, not to mention up to 512 GB microSD card support, and you have an irresistible deal.

Arlo

Amazon

Best Buy

If you're okay with a subscription, the Arlo Pro 5 (or 5S, they are identical) is the outdoor security camera to buy. Great quality footage, color night vision, a spotlight and siren, and a slick app that's quick to load the live feed are all tempting reasons to buy, but it's the accurate AI detection and rich notifications that make this the best of the best.

Eufy

Amazon

Eufy

Best Buy

Security cameras with floodlights are great for your garage or backyard, since motion triggers light and color video. The E340 is a dual-lens camera with a 3K wide angle lens and a 2K telephoto lens for up to 8x zoom to capture details up to 50 feet away. Adjustable light panels provide up to 2,000 lumens. It also pans 360 degrees and tilts 120 degrees, and records locally to a microSD card or to a HomeBase 3 (both sold separately).

Fitbit

Amazon

Walmart

Google Store

We've liked the Fitbit Charge 6 ever since its launch back in 2023, and it's still the best fitness tracker you can buy. Our reviewer calls this model the ""sweet spot"" between attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use."" Unless you're an ultra-marathoner, this is likely as much tech as you need to hit your lofty fitness goals.

Anker

Amazon

Anker

You can go off-grid or work through a power cut with one of the best portable power stations, and Anker's Solix C1000 is my pick for happy campers. Molded handles for easy carrying, a handy LED bar on the front with three brightness levels, and a chunky 1,056-watt-hour capacity make this worth packing for your next trip. It can also double as an uninterruptible power supply with a 20-millisecond delay.

Govee

Amazon (100 feet)

Govee (200 feet)

Light up your home for Halloween or just whenever with these fun lights from Govee. You can snag 100 feet, sporting 60 RGBIC LEDs, or double that, both at a hefty discount. Like all of our favorite Govee smart lights, you can choose colors, brightness, animated scenes, and automations in the jam-packed app. These IP67-rated lights are designed to be permanently attached to the outside of your home for all your holiday celebrations or just classy lighting year-round.

Apple

Amazon (13-inch)

Amazon (15-inch)

Best Buy

Apple

Need a new laptop? Your best bet is Apple's MacBook Air. It was released earlier this year and is powered by the latest M4 chip. It's plenty powerful, and the 13-inch screen is nice and bright. Apple updated the webcam, so you'll look sharper, and there's now double the RAM. You'll have to get used to the limited two USB-C ports, but this is otherwise an incredible value at $799. Read our Best MacBooks guide for other options.

Microsoft (Snapdragon X Plus)

Best Buy (15-inch)

Our resident laptop expert says the Windows-powered Surface Laptop 7th Edition is a fantastic MacBook alternative with a Snapdragon X Elite chip, and a 120-Hz, 13.8-inch touchscreen with a unique 3:2 aspect ratio, giving you more vertical height than the average laptop. Qualcomm's next-gen Snapdragon X2 chips aren't due for a while, so this is worth biting on. Just make sure you get the right model (not the newer, cheaper Surface Laptop 13).

If you need a laptop more as a travel companion or study buddy, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet Gen 9 has a unique mix of affordability and portability. It's only an 11-inch screen, so the detachable keyboard is a little cramped, but outside of an iPad, you won't find anything quite so charming and fun to use. It has a surprisingly good display for a cheap Chromebook too.

The Dell 32 Plus 4K QD-OLED is one of the few OLED monitors not aimed at gamers, making it tempting for home workers, video editors, and content creators. It boasts over 1,000 nits of peak brightness in HDR, strong audio, and beautifully crisp 4K image quality. It's one of the best monitors on the market right now, and it's actually pretty good for gaming, too.

This mechanical keyboard is our favorite for gamers. The BlackWidow V4 75% has a smaller, more compact layout, which is great for tiny desks. The factory-lubed Razer Orange switches have a nice tactile bump, and it's satisfying to type on. The RGB lighting is customizable, and the 8,000-Hz polling rate is more than enough for fast-paced games. It's not wireless, but that means you won't have to keep it charged.

Supremely comfortable, this do-it-all office mouse might just be the best ergonomic mouse you can buy. With well-placed thumb buttons, a horizontal scroll wheel, and gesture buttons that can all be configured to your preferences, there isn't much to complain about. This version is optimized for use with a Mac. (Keep in mind that Logitech just released the MX Master 4, which is just $20 more.)

You can snag yourself a desktop productivity boost with this diminutive gadget that offers tailored shortcuts at your fingertips (it can do a bunch of stuff). Speed up your creative process, use it as media controls, or configure complex Excel functions: the choice is yours. You can get far bigger, more complicated, and more expensive Stream Decks, but this is a good option for most folks.

It's not sexy ,and the transfer speeds are nothing to write home about (120 megabytes per second for sequential writes on Windows), but this drive is a great way to back up your digital life. Set up overnight incremental backups, and you'll squeeze value from this reliable digital filing cabinet. It supports USB-C and USB 3 and works with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Right as Google's Wear OS is hitting its stride—now feature-rich with robust smartwatches that can go toe-to-toe with the Apple Watch—luxury watchmaker TAG Heuer has decided to ditch the operating system altogether for its latest Connected Calibre E5 smartwatch. Instead, it runs a proprietary “TAG Heuer OS” (still based on Android). But unlike many of the latest Wear OS smartwatches designed only for Android phones, this one is compatible with iPhones.

That's likely one of the biggest reasons for the switch, as Google seems to have abandoned making its smartwatch platform compatible with Apple's hardware (Apple never made it easy, though this could change). It also allows the Swiss watchmaker to be less dependent on the whims of Google, but ultimately, it means TAG's smartwatch will not have access to the wealth of apps found on Google and Apple's respective platforms.

I spent a few days with the 45-mm Calibre E5 (there's also a new 40-mm variant), and this fifth-generation smartwatch feels polished, despite the software change. It's also striking in its design, unlike any other smartwatch, with premium materials like a ceramic bezel, domed sapphire crystal, and snazzy band options. Unsurprisingly, the version I tried will cost you a punchy $2,000 when it goes on sale this month (and goes up to $2,800 for other variations), though the smaller 40-mm Calibre E5 starts at $1,800.

Comfortable and premium: the new TAG smartwatch sports a ceramic bezel, flat or domed sapphire crystal, titanium and DLC, depending on what model you choose.

The Calibre E5 has a nice heft to it that helps make it feel luxe enough to match that price point. A stainless steel polished case, black polished ceramic bezel with silver markings, and flat sapphire crystal also furthers the premium pedigree. TAG has, of course, several other variations. You can get a black diamond-like carbon (DLC) grade-2 titanium sandblasted case, white and green indices, or a domed sapphire crystal over the display, exclusive to the new 40-mm case.

The sloped lugs offer a comfortable fit, and the metal bracelet integrates well with the case. It's interchangeable (there's a button you press on the underside to release it), though these straps are expressly designed for the E5. Still, I was able to pop on a 22-mm pin buckle strap from one of my other watches without issues.

Despite being weighty, I didn't mind wearing this smartwatch to sleep, though you may want a more comfortable strap. However, when I woke up the next morning, I spent a few minutes hunting for my sleep results, only to learn they don't exist. Yet. TAG says it plans to add sleep tracking, likely in December via a software update, which is important considering this is a staple feature on most smartwatches these days.

One of the boons of smartwatches is you can switch between several watch faces, and the E5 is no exception, but nicely many here mimic designs of TAG's mechanical watches, such as the Carrera or Aquaracer. It's fairly simple to customize these on the watch itself, too, choosing different accent colors, backgrounds, and complications.

The crown doubles as a way to scroll through the interface, which makes it easier to select items in various menus. There are also two pushers above and below the crown. The top opens a menu with the main capabilities of the watch, like fitness tracking, weather, calendar, and dialer. This button also acts as the select button, whereas the bottom pusher takes you to the previous menu. Press the bottom button on the home screen, though, and it'll open your quick settings menu, with access to low-power mode, theater mode, bedtime mode, and so on.

A swipe up from the home screen shows your notifications, and a swipe down has a selection of widgets you can curate, like step count, heart rate, and weather. I was able to receive all the notifications from my paired Android phone, and there's a fair amount of actions you can take. I deleted emails, marked them as read, and even “Liked” messages. There are some canned responses you can send, but there is no option to respond via keyboard or voice. These boilerplate responses didn't always show up on every message, either.

The Calibre E5 is limited in that sense—you can't open WhatsApp and respond to a friend. You can't open up the Google Home app and check your Nest security camera. There is no cellular version of this smartwatch, so you'll need your phone nearby to receive notifications. It would've been nice to have the option for contactless payments. But there's also beauty in its simplicity. Maybe it's good that you can't respond to your coworker's Slack message.

It can take phone calls, and they sound OK coming through the speaker on the watch. Also, if you press and hold the bottom button, it activates your phone's voice assistant. Weirdly, it doesn't really do anything on the watch—my phone lit up and Gemini turned on, and its responses came entirely through my phone. That seems a little pointless.

The E5 has up to two days battery life, or three days in low-power mode, but with the always-on display, WIRED's unit needed to be recharged after a day and a half.

Some of this functionality may be even more restricted on iPhone, but TAG has received official Made-for-iPhone certification with the Calibre E5, which means it can offer a better-than-expected experience with improved Wi-Fi connectivity and notifications. I didn't try it with an iPhone, so I wasn't able to see how well it works.

The Calibre E5 is powered by Qualcomm's Wear 5100+ chipset, and I didn't notice any bouts of lag while roaming through the interface. It's fairly responsive. As for battery life, TAG claims up to two days (three days with low-power mode), but with the always-on display, my unit needed to be recharged after a day and a half. The smaller 40-mm supposedly lasts 1.5 days (two days in low-power mode). Paying attention to the detail, TAG has done well with the nicely designed included charging dock and its USB-C port on the back, which makes it easy to travel with and use the same USB-C cable you use for your other devices.

Fitness and health are a focus on the Calibre E5, or at least, that's what TAG is spending a lot of time talking about. You can track steps, calories burned, active time, and heart rate. When the update for sleep tracking arrives later this year, it'll also enable blood-oxygen measurements, breathing rate, and heart-rate variability, though this is largely for the benefit of sleep analysis.

You can get a continuous reading with the heart rate tracker, and, for the most part, the results seemed to line up with the Google Pixel Watch 4 and Apple Watch Series 10 during the day and on walks. However, during an indoor rowing workout, the Pixel Watch and Apple Watch were far more aligned on my average beats per minute, with the Calibre E5 undercounting by 10 beats. I'll need to see how it fares over a longer period, and perhaps without the metal bracelet, which is not fun to exercise with (TAG didn't send me the sportier bands for this hands-on experience).

Also, indoor rowing wasn't available to track on the Calibre E5, and there's no auto-workout tracking. You have the basics such as walking, running, cycling, hiking, swimming, treadmill—and of course “Golf”, a feature TAG has leaned into with its smartwatches—but you'll need to use “Other” to track anything else. There is dual-band GPS here, but I didn't get a chance to test it. Along with this, there are running plans to choose from, and that Golf mode has a course map display that will automatically adjust as you advance, with over 40,000 course maps worldwide.

Admirably, this is the 10th year since the original TAG Heuer Connected smartwatch arrived, and it remains one of the few luxury smartwatches on the market. The watchmaker will continue to offer the battery replacement service for anyone worried that their $2,000 smartwatch's battery will degrade after two or three years—head to a TAG Heuer boutique for a $100 refit.

As I wrote five years ago, a luxury smartwatch isn't going to last forever. You can (and will) argue that spending $2,000 on a smartwatch is silly, but this misses the point. The Calibre E5 will attract a demographic of people who want a smartwatch that can match their other dressy watches, while still delivering functional information, like heart rate and notifications. Swap the band, and you can take it on a run before a business meeting and still log your data. It boils down to whether you like the look and feel of this watch, and what that means to you.

I don't see it necessarily replacing an Apple Watch or even a Pixel Watch. Instead, like your TAG Heuer Carrera or Formula 1 watches, it's another option to put on your wrist, for those days when you want something a little more than a pretty face. Stay tuned for our full review.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","The Android PC: Google's Second Shot at the Unified Computing Dream","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/the-android-pc-googles-second-shot-at-the-unified-computing-dream-179947.html","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:50:28 GMT","

The holy grail of personal computing has always been a single, seamless experience that follows you from your pocket to your desk. For decades, this dream has been a graveyard of ambitious failures.

Now, in the fall of 2025, the whispers are growing louder: In partnership with Qualcomm, Google is making a serious play to bring Android-based PCs to the mainstream. Google's effort isn't just another Chromebook; it's a full-fledged effort to scale the world's dominant mobile operating system into the laptop form factor.

Google's Android PC initiative represents a direct assault on the traditional Windows PC market and a strategic challenge to Apple's carefully segregated ecosystem. However, to succeed where others have so spectacularly failed, Google must learn from the ghost of its most notable predecessor: Microsoft's Windows 8. Google's strategy is different — scaling up from the phone rather than down from the desktop — but the potential pitfalls, especially in marketing, look eerily familiar.

Let's talk about the Android PC this week, and we'll close with my Product of the Week: a new OLED tablet from Wacom that could bring back some excitement into the market.

To understand why Google's new venture has a fighting chance, one must first diagnose the fatal flaws of Microsoft's attempt at a unified OS with Windows 8 and the Windows Phone.

Microsoft's strategy was to take the dominant desktop OS, Windows, and shrink it to fit on a phone, while simultaneously forcing its touch-centric “Metro” interface onto a billion mouse-and-keyboard users. It was a bold, top-down strategy that backfired for two critical reasons.

First and foremost was the catastrophic “app gap.” An operating system is only as good as its software library. Developers for mobile were overwhelmingly focused on iOS and Android, and they had little incentive to rebuild their apps for the sliver of the market using Windows Phone.

The platform became a wasteland of missing apps — no Snapchat, no native Gmail, and a constant stream of major services pulling their support. Without the apps people used every day, the hardware was irrelevant.

Second was the jarring user experience. The Metro UI, with its live tiles, was actually quite innovative for a phone. However, on a 27-inch desktop monitor operated with a mouse, it was an inefficient and confusing mess that alienated a generation of Windows power users.

Microsoft attempted to build a single OS that was a master of two worlds, but ended up being a jack of all trades and a master of none. The failure of the Windows Phone was a brutal lesson that you cannot force a desktop-first paradigm into a mobile-first world.

Google's approach is the inverse of Microsoft's, and that is its greatest strength. Instead of shrinking a desktop OS down, it is scaling a mature, app-rich mobile OS up.

Google's smartphone-first strategy holds a fundamental advantage: It already has absolute victory in the app war. The Google Play Store contains virtually every application and service a consumer could want. The challenge is not attracting developers from scratch but instead encouraging them to optimize their existing Android apps for a larger, landscape-oriented screen with keyboard and mouse input — a far simpler task.

Furthermore, the user base is already trained. Billions of people are intimately familiar with Android's navigation, notification system, and settings menus. There is no steep learning curve. An Android PC would feel like a natural, more powerful extension of the device they already use for hours every day. That familiarity with Android creates a powerful, low-friction pathway for adoption that Microsoft never had.

For all its engineering prowess, Google's history is littered with the corpses of brilliantly engineered products that were crippled by inept marketing and a confusing brand message: Google+, Stadia, Allo, and the convoluted early branding of its Pixel phones. The list is long. Google's marketing problem is a persistent blind spot. It often fails to tell a simple, compelling story about why a consumer should choose its product.

The marketing challenge is where the parallel to Microsoft's failure becomes alarming. Microsoft never articulated a clear, compelling reason for consumers to abandon their iPhones or Android devices for a Windows Phone. Google now faces the same challenge. Why should a consumer buy an Android PC for $700 when they can get a perfectly good Windows PC for the same price or a simpler Chromebook for half of that?

Without a massive, clear, and sustained marketing campaign that highlights a unique value proposition — perhaps seamless app continuity with your phone, unlike anything else — these devices could easily get lost in a crowded market, repeating the mishaps of the past.

If Google can overcome its marketing hurdles, an Android PC could accelerate the inevitable blurring of lines between smartphones and personal computers. The true endgame may not be an “Android PC” at all, but the death of the PC as a separate device. We are nearing the point where the smartphone is the only computer you need — a “primary brain” that docks into various “shells” to suit the context.

Imagine your phone holding all your apps, data, and processing power. At your desk, you place it into a dock connected to a monitor and keyboard, and the UI instantly expands into a full desktop experience. In a hotel, you connect it to a lightweight laptop shell for productivity on the go.

Samsung has been experimenting with this concept for years with its DeX platform, but with Google's full OS-level backing, it could become the standard. A dockable, smartphone-centered form factor would make the separate, dedicated PC obsolete for a vast majority of users, transforming it from a core device into a mere peripheral for the phone.

The rise of Android PCs as a smartphone-first computing platform exposes a strategic vulnerability for Apple, which maintains three largely separate operating systems — iOS, iPadOS, and macOS — on hardware that increasingly uses the same silicon, resulting in redundant development and creating a less-than-seamless user experience. While this separation allows Apple to sell you an iPhone, an iPad, and a MacBook, it is an inefficiency born of a hardware-centric business model.

Google, whose revenue is driven by advertising and services, doesn't care what device you use as long as you are logged into its ecosystem. Its ad-driven business model gives Google the freedom to merge its platforms without cannibalizing its core business.

For Microsoft, the threat is more direct. An army of affordable, capable Android PCs powered by efficient Qualcomm chips directly attacks the heart of the Windows laptop market. To mitigate this, Microsoft must ultimately refine its own Windows on Arm experience, ensuring seamless performance and compatibility with legacy apps.

More importantly, it must lean into its core strengths: the deep integration with enterprise and the unparalleled library of powerful, professional software that will not be coming to Android anytime soon. Windows must become the undisputed OS for serious work, ceding the casual consumer market if necessary.

Google's venture into Android PCs with Qualcomm is the most credible attempt yet at creating a unified computing platform. The smartphone-up strategy is fundamentally sound, leveraging an unbeatable app ecosystem and a user base of billions.

However, the project's success hinges on Google's ability to do something it has historically struggled with: market a product with clarity, passion, and persistence. If it can, this initiative won't just create a new category of laptops; it could fundamentally reshape our concept of a “personal computer,” putting immense pressure on both Apple and Microsoft to adapt or risk being rendered obsolete by the tiny computer in everyone's pocket.



For years, digital artists have been caught in a frustrating compromise. Do you choose the slick, consumer-friendly experience of an Apple iPad, with its beautiful screen but glossy, imprecise drawing surface? Or do you opt for a dedicated Wacom tablet, sacrificing portability for professional-grade pen technology?

With the release of Wacom's MovinkPad 11, that compromise is officially over. This device isn't just another tablet; it's a focused, masterfully engineered tool that sets a new benchmark for portable digital creation.

The star of the show, without question, is the 11-inch OLED display. While Apple's “Liquid Retina” screens are excellent for watching movies, they are fundamentally backlit IPS panels. The MovinkPad's OLED screen is a different class entirely for artists. Because each pixel is its own light source, it can achieve perfect, absolute blacks. This creates a level of contrast and color vibrancy that makes digital paintings pop with a depth and accuracy an iPad simply cannot match. For professionals whose work depends on precise color grading and value control, this isn't a luxury; it's a necessity.



Wacom's MovinkPad 11 pairs an OLED display with pro-level pen input, offering digital artists a portable creative tool without compromise. (Image Credit: Wacom).

Wacom's legendary industrial design is on full display. The MovinkPad 11 feels less like a fragile media device and more like a durable piece of studio equipment. The back has a comfortable, grippy texture, and the display itself features a subtly etched surface. This isn't the slick, glass-on-glass feeling of an iPad; it provides a satisfying, paper-like resistance that gives artists the tactile feedback needed for precise linework. Paired with Wacom's latest Pro Pen 3, which uses battery-free EMR technology and boasts an imperceptible level of latency, the drawing experience is second to none.

At a retail price of $449.95, the MovinkPad 11 is a serious investment positioned squarely against a mid-tier iPad Air. But the comparison is misleading. An iPad is a general-purpose computer that can also be used for artistic purposes. The MovinkPad is a dedicated professional art tool from the ground up. For that price, you are getting a display technology and a pen experience that far surpasses what Apple offers for creative work.

So, who is this for? The ideal customer is the serious creative professional or the dedicated hobbyist who prioritizes the drawing experience above all else. This is for the digital illustrator who needs perfect color on the go, the comic book artist storyboarding in a cafe, or the animator sketching out keyframes on the train.

While the iPad tries to be everything to everyone, the Wacom MovinkPad 11 is unapologetically for the artist. It is, without a doubt, the ultimate portable canvas. While I'm not an artist, my mother was, and I think she would have loved this tablet, so I'm making it my Product of the Week.

Security leaders facing workforce shortages are turning to artificial intelligence to close the skills gaps in their organizations, according to survey results released today by a global cybersecurity company.

Some 97% of 1,850 IT and cybersecurity decision-makers across 29 countries reported using or planning to use a cybersecurity solution that leverages AI to address a growing number of security incidents, according to the 2025 Fortinet Cybersecurity Skills Gap survey conducted by Sapio Research.

The survey noted that the vast majority of its respondents (86%) had one or more security breaches in 2024, with nearly one-third (28%) reporting five or more. Those levels are notably higher than in 2021, when Fortinet conducted its first skills gap survey. Then, 80% reported a breach, and 19% reported five or more.

The impact of those security incidents is significant, the survey noted. More than half (52%) of organizations surveyed say breaches cost them more than US$1 million, which is roughly in line with last year's 53% and up from 38% in 2021.

In response to that growing problem, the study noted that organizations are increasingly turning to AI to strengthen their capabilities and posture, even as they acknowledge AI could also be used against them as an engine for new or improved cyberattacks. Nearly half of the respondents (49%) confessed that they're worried that the use of AI by bad actors will increase cybersecurity attacks.

Four out of five organizations (80%) told surveyors that AI tools are helping their IT and security teams be more effective, though almost all are aware that AI won't solve the ongoing skills shortage alone. That shortage amounts to a global deficit of more than 4.7 million cybersecurity professionals, according to the 2024 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study.

“This year's survey further underscores the urgent need to invest in cybersecurity talent,” Fortinet CISO Carl Windsor said in a statement. “Without closing the skills gap, organizations will continue to face rising breach rates and escalating costs.”

“The findings highlight an inflection point for both public and private sectors,” he continued. “Without bold action to build and retain cybersecurity expertise, the risks and costs will only continue to grow for our society.”

Thomas Vick, a technology hiring and consulting expert with Robert Half, a global staffing and recruiting firm, explained that without enough qualified professionals, IT teams may struggle to patch vulnerabilities, manage technical debt, and stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated threats, leaving critical systems exposed.

“As cyber risks escalate, attracting and retaining skilled cybersecurity professionals remains a business priority for safeguarding digital assets and staying ahead of threats,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“The cybersecurity skills gap continues to challenge organizations across industries, making it difficult to fill critical roles in IT departments and security operations centers,” he said. “To stay competitive, many employers are offering higher starting salaries and attractive perks for top talent.”

“From research conducted for the 2026 Salary Guide from Robert Half, more than half of U.S. employers are willing to increase starting compensation for candidates with in-demand cybersecurity skills, and 41% said they would boost compensation for cloud security skills,” he added.

Retaining quality people is more than just financial, argued Mark St. John, co-founder and COO of Neon Cyber, a provider of browser-based security tools in Fort Worth, Texas. “Job hopping is easy for skilled professionals,” he told TechNewsWorld. “You learn some tools, you experience the time in the trenches, and you are suddenly a valuable commodity.”

“I love this for the analysts. I hate it for the business,” he said. “A lot of tribal knowledge of how the business operates, the sensitivity of data across business units, the relationships — they all add up and matter over time. So I am easily convinced that turnover can lead to breaches.”

Although most organizations are using or planning to use AI, nearly half of them (48%) acknowledged that the biggest challenge to integrating AI into cybersecurity was the lack of staff with sufficient AI expertise.

“The skills shortage creates a paradox that limits AI's potential in cybersecurity,” asserted Tim Freestone, chief strategy officer for Kiteworks, a secure content communications provider in San Mateo, Calif.

“Organizations lack personnel with the expertise needed to properly deploy, manage, and optimize AI-powered security tools, meaning the very solution designed to alleviate staffing pressures remains underutilized,” he told TechNewsWorld.

“This gap is particularly acute because effective AI implementation requires dual competencies — both operating AI systems and defending against AI-powered attacks — skills that are in even shorter supply than traditional cybersecurity expertise.

“Without trained professionals who can configure AI tools appropriately, interpret their outputs accurately, and integrate them effectively into security operations, organizations risk deploying AI systems that fail to reach their defensive potential or, worse, introduce new vulnerabilities through improper management,” he said.

“Fortinet's report makes it clear that the cybersecurity skills gap has become a business risk, not just a technical one,” added Shane Barney, chief information security officer at Keeper Security, a password management and online storage company in Chicago.

“With nearly every company adopting artificial intelligence to strengthen defenses,” he told TechNewsWorld, “the absence of in-house skills to manage these tools safely is widening the gap between technology and readiness.”

Diana Kelley, CISO at Noma Security, an AI lifecycle security company in Tel Aviv, Israel, explained that AI skills can encompass a very broad spectrum. “Traditional AI skills such as data science and machine learning engineers continue to be popular,” she told TechNewsWorld.

“One of the most in-demand GenAI skills is prompt engineering, which is driving value across all teams from security operations, to marketing, to compliance, to business development,” she said. “And people who are diving in and vibe coding AI agents are also setting themselves up for future-proofed AI skills.”

“Of course,” she continued, “for every AI implementation or enterprise use case, there is a need for AI, especially agentic AI, to be secured by the CISO's organization.”

The survey advocated greater investment by organizations in cybersecurity training and development. The decline in willingness to pay for certifications this year, down to 73% from 89% the previous year, is concerning, it noted. “If this turns out to be an emerging trend, organizations should review this decision as part of their risk management strategy,” it advised.

Lisa Simon, chief economist at Revelio Labs, a workforce intelligence company in New York City, explained that employers are increasingly relying on certifications as a way to verify cybersecurity skills, particularly in high-risk sectors such as government, finance, and health care.

“Certifications can provide reassurance that candidates meet a certain standard and help organizations demonstrate credibility to clients and regulators,” she told TechNewsWorld, “but the reliance on credentials also has drawbacks.

“Our studies show that only about one in five cybersecurity professionals lists holding a certification on their online profile, which contributes to slower and costlier hiring, and risks excluding strong candidates who have built their expertise through IT or systems roles without formal credentials.”

“In practice, certifications can be a valuable signal of competence,” she continued, “but they shouldn't be the sole filter. Organizations also need to invest in internal training and diverse talent pipelines to meet the fast-growing demand for cyber talent.”

The survey advised: “Skilled and aware employees and cybersecurity professionals are crucial to overall cyber risk management in a world that [has] moved beyond the attack-and-defend cycle. Today, to protect themselves, organizations need to maintain a posture of perpetual vigilance and continuous risk awareness.”

In-depth Amazon coverage from the tech giant's hometown, including e-commerce, AWS, Amazon Prime, Alexa, logistics, devices, and more.

by Kurt Schlosser on Oct 8, 2025 at 3:00 amOctober 7, 2025 at 3:44 pm

Amazon is erasing the distance between the doctor's office and the pharmacy with the introduction of new Amazon Pharmacy kiosks that can quickly dispense medications to patients after a medical appointment.

The kiosks will initially be located inside offices for One Medical, Amazon's primary healthcare company, in locations across the greater Los Angeles area starting in December. Expansion to additional One Medical offices and other locations is expected soon after.

The goal of the freestanding kiosks is to facilitate easier filling of prescriptions, eliminating the need for an extra trip or waiting in line at a conventional pharmacy.

According to Amazon, the kiosks will be stocked with a wide range of commonly prescribed medications, including antibiotics, inhalers, and blood pressure medications. Controlled substances and medications requiring refrigeration are not available. The inventory is tailored to the prescribing patterns of each office location.

After a provider writes a prescription, patients can choose to have it sent to Amazon Pharmacy for in-office kiosk pickup. In the Amazon app, patients get a QR code to scan at the kiosk to pick up their medication, which is delivered within minutes with a custom label printed on the spot.

The initiative is not without human intervention — cameras inside the kiosks allow an Amazon pharmacist to get a live view and review medications before they are dispensed, and those pharmacists can also answer any patient questions via a video or phone consultation.

Giving customers a pickup point is a departure for Amazon Pharmacy, which works via home delivery of medications. Hannah McClellan, vice president of operations for Amazon Pharmacy, told GeekWire that Amazon is prepared to scale the kiosks beyond the L.A. rollout.

“We do have many more kiosks ready to go,” McClellan said. “I see One Medical as a launch pad for the kiosk, but I think they have runway far beyond One Medical, and frankly, far beyond primary care offices. There's so many ways that they can drastically improve the pharmacy pickup experience today.”

The Seattle area has eight One Medical locations, and McClellan said Amazon's hometown could be “high on the list” for where kiosks are placed.

The tamper-resistant kiosks weigh approximately 1,700 pounds and are secured to the floor, with additional security features including vibration sensors and surveillance cameras to discourage break-ins. Amazon says patient information is protected in accordance with HIPAA regulations and the entire system has undergone rigorous testing and regulatory review.

There is no additional fee to use a kiosk for Prime and non-Prime members. Patients pay only for their prescription medications, and insurance is accepted just as with traditional pharmacy options.

Amazon's ultimate hope is that convenience cuts back on the nearly one-third of prescriptions in the U.S. that are never filled each year, leading to better health outcomes and billions in preventable healthcare costs.

“This is not a watered-down version of a pharmacy,” McClellan said. “We have cut zero corners. Every single thing that's available to you at a retail pharmacy pickup is available to you here. We really have just brought the pharmacy experience to your provider office, and made it incredibly fast and transparent.”

Amazon launched the Amazon Pharmacy service in November 2020, following its $753 million acquisition of prescription-by-mail company PillPack in 2018. The company announced its $3.9 billion acquisition of One Medical in July 2022 and closed the deal in February 2023. In February 2024, Amazon cut hundreds of jobs from both health care units.

Seattle-based biotech startup Lumen Bioscience raised a $30 million Series C extension and announced several leadership updates.

WestRiver Group led the latest funding round, bringing the company's total capital raised to $186.8 million. 

The new investment will help Lumen accelerate its pipeline of orally delivered biologic drugs made from genetically engineered spirulina, a type of blue-green algae.

Lumen's technology platform enables therapeutic proteins — traditionally injected or infused — to be produced and delivered orally in an edible, low-cost form.

The 110-person company is targeting diseases that act in or originate from the gastrointestinal tract. It recently reported promising Phase 2 results from LMN-201, Lumen's lead candidate for recurrent C. difficile infection.

The company also announced that Jeff Raikes, former Microsoft president and Gates Foundation CEO, joined Lumen's board as an independent director.

Other personnel updates:

The company has grown its workforce by nearly 40% since 2023 and opened a second manufacturing facility.

Lumen is led by CEO Brian Finrow, a former senior vice president at Adaptive Biotechnologies, and Chief Science Officer Jim Roberts, the former head of basic sciences at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute. They co-founded the startup in 2017.

Adora, a new Seattle-based marketing technology startup co-founded by former Pinterest executive Marco Matos and serial entrepreneur Kabir Shahani, emerged from stealth with a platform designed to help enterprise brands create and measure marketing content faster and more intelligently using AI.

Founded in 2023, Adora says it has already helped early customers such as Alaska Airlines, Brooks Running, and Servco improve their return on ad spend, cut acquisition costs, and accelerate content creation.

“We think of ourselves as the internal platform that allows an enterprise brand to really go out to market with speed,” Matos told GeekWire.

The company's AI-powered platform is aimed at large enterprise marketing teams that need to coordinate across creative, operations, and performance functions while responding to fast-moving trends.

“We are serving large enterprise customers that have a ton of complexity inside their organizations,” Matos said.

Adora's software is trained on each client's creative assets, product catalog, brand guidelines, and first-party data to learn a company's “brand DNA.” The system then generates on-brand ad variations for channels such as Meta, Google, and Pinterest. Teams review and approve the content before launch, and Adora's analytics layer measures performance to identify which visuals or messages drive conversions.

“The goal is to provide more variations, more personalized content — and then deliver that content in a cross-channel optimization way to figure out which channels perform the best for you at a particular seasonal moment,” Matos said.

Rather than relying on a single AI model, Adora has built a proprietary “routing system” that dynamically leverages different large language and generative models depending on the task.

“We think that AI is the next step function in how marketers go to market,” he said, noting that AI can boost speed, learning, and iteration. 

Adora joins a growing field of marketing tech companies harnessing AI — from industry giants like Adobe and Salesforce to startups such as Typeface, Jasper, and others.

Adora raised seed funding from Village Global, a San Francisco-based early stage venture firm chaired by Reid Hoffman. It did not disclose exact funding to date or provide details on revenue metrics. 

The company has around 20 employees, according to LinkedIn. 

Matos spent four years at Pinterest, where he led the company's Seattle office and helped build advertising products. He also worked in product roles at Facebook and Google.

Shahani previously served as CEO of Seattle-based marketing tech startup Amperity, which helps companies manage first-party customer data. He co-founded Amperity and earlier launched Appature, a marketing automation startup acquired in 2013. 

Shahani, who abruptly left Amperity in 2023, is now based in New York City and leads Amp It Up Ventures, which supports software businesses. He's also chairman at Avante, a Seattle startup focused on employee benefits.

“CMO's and performance marketers will be unleashed to create exponential value like never before,” Shahani wrote in a LinkedIn post about Adora.

Back in 2016, Forbes dubbed Seattle the “Silicon Valley of Space.” People didn't bat an eye, they kept their gaze trained on older, more established aerospace hubs like the Bay Area and Cape Canaveral. But the Emerald City kept quietly gaining momentum. Students at world-class research universities built a satellite the size of a Kleenex box. Over 900 aerospace companies planted roots. The accumulation of the best and brightest minds turned Seattle into the undeniable hub for space commercialization and innovation that it is today, and now, all eyes are on Seattle's space hub.

The region is a humming ecosystem of space innovation, where people earn their degrees, hone their skills at legacy aerospace companies, and spin off to launch their own startups all under the same PNW sun (er—clouds.) For every experienced manufacturer or engineer that leaves a legacy company to start their own firm, there's a wide network of clients, partners, supply chain relationships, and testing facilities all within their own backyard. Innovation comes easy when your neighbors are best in class.

Amazon's Project Kuiper is a top contributor to the region's reputation. They've created more than 2,000 specialized roles for advanced satellite operations. And they keep these jobs accessible to Washington's homegrown talent through internal career programs and a partnership with Lake Washington Institute of Technology. Brian Huseman, Amazon's Vice President of Public Policy and Community Engagement, says these investments “cement the region as a global center for satellite technology.”

Brian knows Greater Seattle is the perfect mix of talent, research, and partnerships: the trifecta accelerating Project Kuiper's mission. “The state is projected to manufacture more than 75% of the world's satellites in the near future,” he said. “This concentration of talent let us rapidly build our Project Kuiper team across our facilities in Redmond, Kirkland, Everett, Bellevue, and Seattle. Washington's collaborative business environment enabled us to operate in a relatively compact geographic area, which allows ideas to flow seamlessly between design, testing, and manufacturing teams.”

Speed to market also anchors Project Kuiper to Greater Seattle – “the region excels in cloud computing, machine learning, advanced materials, and precision manufacturing. Developing talent and innovating new technologies for Project Kuiper might have taken significantly longer elsewhere.” Brian said.

Local government leaders echo Brian's sentiment on how new technologies are skyrocketing the region's space economy. “I'm proud of our city's role as a leader in the space and satellite industry, with our Space District being home to some of the most visionary companies,” said Redmond Mayor Angela Birney. “They bring innovation, inspiration, and a sense of pride to our community.”

Companies like Amazon, Boeing, and Blue Origin laid the foundation for aerospace advancements. But those household names aren't the only ones shaking things up. A new generation of startups has entered the scene, and they're challenging the status quo with new products and methodologies that will change the way humans think about space. Who powers all this groundbreaking work? Over 114,000 employees (which is 31% above the national average for Seattle's size.) That's more people than can fit in the Seahawks' stadium. There's a reason aerospace employees flock here: companies know they are the industry's lifeblood, and so they nurture their growth with perks and benefits that'd send stodgy HR offices into a tizzy. It's a small price to pay in exchange for being the epicenter of redefining what's possible beyond the Earth's gravitational pull.

Stoke Space is one of Seattle's breakout stars, propelling space tech into the future. Their 100% reusable rockets lower the barrier to cost entry – a 20x reduced cost to get into orbit. How do they do it? By ditching test and iteration cycles that feel like they span longer than the Rolling Stones' career. They build rocket engines, structures, and avionics in mere days, made possible by their test facility's close proximity to their headquarters. Stoke's hardware choices are sustainably scaling the aerospace industry, one refly at a time.

With a bold vision for orbital logistics, Starfish Space is leading the charge in affordable satellite servicing. Their Otter model is the pit crew of space, like a highly trained gasman, it refuels satellites and keeps them reliably in orbit. It can also safely dispose of defunct satellites that pose a risk of crashing out.

The region's startups have already developed an unshakeable bedrock of success. Now, investors are taking notice and betting on their transformative technologies. As legacy and emerging companies continue to refine their processes, venture capitalists hit the sweet spot of a blossoming economy that's all gas and no brakes.

Fuse is a Bellevue-based venture capital firm investing in early-stage technology companies. Brendan Wales, General Partner, underscores the importance of investing as early as possible into great people. “Bet the founder, win the future. It's so about the people. It's about the founder and them recruiting great folks underneath them.”

“Some investors want to wait until things are a slam dunk. The problem with that is that all the investors in the world that are risk averse, that's also where they go. They pursue that same company and, as a result, it's really hard to get into those companies.”

Who are the people-forward companies Fuse built early relationships with? Quindar was the first. Their satellite operations software makes for more efficient spacecraft management. Then came Starcloud, the group leveraging solar energy to solve for energy-constrained data centers. Portal followed suit, providing maneuverable satellite propulsion technology using thermal engines powered by the sun. Portal's addressing what Brendan believes is space's next big frontier: defense. A big risk with sending anything into space is that you could have an adversary come close to your satellite, knock it off course, or impact its capabilities, he said. Portal is improving satellite bus maneuverability through propulsion technology, making it possible to change orbits without running out of fuel. These are what Brendan describes as the “fighter jets” protecting our nation's assets.

Actuate Ventures is a Seattle-based studio supporting mission-driven deep-tech and space-tech startups. Chris Le, Managing Partner, divulges what they're investing in:

“There's an entire burgeoning market of software-only startups or relatively low capital expenditure startups that are breaking in, leveraging the fact that we [Seattle] have decades and decades of really mature software experience that rivals and exceeds that of the Bay Area in many respects.” he said.

“What I'm seeing today, and my hypothesis for the future,” Chris said, “is you have this hockey stick, this growth that goes exponential and marries into what is traditionally a step function economy. The writing is on the wall that all of this value is about to be unlocked. These are not trivial products. These are not GPT wrappers that will not exist in a year. They're here to change the world.”

Actuate Ventures backed Charter Space as a software-only investment, and Chris believes they're on the verge of unlocking exponential, hockey-stick growth. What makes Charter Space and other software-forward companies stand out? He says they're taking the best lessons from SaaS that have been around since the dot com era and giving them a modern twist. Their power is being one of the few players applying this concept to the space industry.

Actuate Ventures isn't gatekeeping what's lucrative. In fact, they're throwing open the doors and inviting more people to join their growing support network within the VC space. “I want to decrease the barrier of entry, and I want to make sure that other funders are not scared off about this space which has incredible value to give to the world and, of course, their portfolio and pocketbooks. I'm not going to shy away from that.” Chris said.

The best way for the space industry-curious to get involved? Seattle Space Week is a great place to start. It's a celebration of an industry that contains so much promise and excitement, and it's all just within reach. It's up to you to grab it.

Qapita, a Singapore-based equity management platform, has raised $26.5 million in a Series B round led by Charles Schwab.

As part of the deal, Charles Schwab has introduced a new platform called Schwab Private Issuer Equity Services — powered by Qapita — which let's U.S. startups manage their cap tables, administer stock plans, and prepare for public listings. 

Founded in 2019 by former banker Ravi Ravulaparthi (CEO) with Lakshman Gupta (COO) and Vamsee Mohan (CTO) (pictured above, from left to right), Qapita helps private companies track ownership, manage employee equity, and facilitate secondary share sales. The startup serves private companies across Southeast Asia and the U.S., and also provides its platform for listed firms in India to manage equity after going public.

Qapita began as a platform to manage cap tables after Ravulaparthi, during his earlier banking career, noticed that many companies still relied on spreadsheets. When the startup launched in January 2021, it expanded the platform based on early customer feedback to include an equity management tool for employee stock plans, initially released in beta. Competitor Carta later entered the Indian market but exited in 2023, giving Qapita room to strengthen its position.

The startup currently has about 2,700 companies using its platform, it says. Roughly 70% are based in India and 20% in Southeast Asia, including Singapore and Indonesia. Qapita counts around half of India's unicorns among its customers, Ravulaparthi said in an interview.

While Qapita offers free access to its platform for early-stage companies, about half of its users — roughly 1,400 firms — pay for at least one of its services, Ravulaparthi told TechCrunch.

In addition to India and Southeast Asia, the startup has a few users in the U.S. as part of its early market testing. However, this partnership will significantly expand its presence in the U.S.

“Of course, the U.S. is a very large market. There are a few options in the private market space in the U.S., but they are too few for a market of that size,” Ravulaparthi said of competitors.

Charles Schwab already handles stock plans for major public companies. However, this deal gives it a foothold with private companies letting it compete for startups with Carta, Pulley, or Morgan Stanley's Shareworks.

The platform will provide equity management tools to automate cap table processes, produce reports and dashboards, and link with other financial systems. It will also tie into Schwab's wealth management network, enabling companies and their employees to manage stock plans and prepare for IPOs.

Qapita's Series B also included participation from its existing investors, Citi and MassMutual Ventures. This funding will also help the startup enhance its platform by launching a fund admin product across multiple markets.

To date, the startup has raised more than $80 million in funding and has a headcount of 300 employees.

Google announced on Wednesday that its AI feature that lets users virtually try on clothes is expanding to Australia, Canada, and Japan. The tech giant also announced the feature now lets users virtually try on shoes.

The feature works by asking users to upload a photo to see how real clothes might look on them. Now, users can visualize how different pairs of shoes would look on them.

To virtually try on a pair of shoes, users need to tap on any product listing on Google, select the “Try It On” button, then add a full-length photo of themselves. After a few seconds, they will see the shoes from the listing on a digital version of themselves. Users have the option to save or share the image with others.

The launch comes two months after Google introduced the ability for users to virtually try on clothes using AI. While Google had already offered virtual try-on technology before, the earlier features focused on showing items on a diverse range of models' bodies. With the new AI feature, the company started allowing users to try clothes on a virtual version of their own body.

Google has been investing in the virtual try-on space in other ways as well. In June, the tech giant launched an experimental app called Doppl that uses AI to visualize how different outfits might look on you.

While both the virtual try-on feature, which now includes shoes, and Doppl are powered by the same generative AI technology, Doppl is designed to let shoppers dive even deeper into virtual try-on, helping them curate their personal style. Plus, Doppl can create AI-generated videos so users can get a better sense of how the outfit would look on them in real life.

Google isn't the only company to launch virtual try-on technology, as both Amazon and Walmart have introduced similar features.

Japanese investing conglomerate SoftBank Group is buying a robotics company as the financial behemoth says physical AI is its next frontier.  

SoftBank announced on Wednesday that it has acquired Zurich, Switzerland-based ABB Group's robotics business unit for $5.375 billion. The deal is subject to regulatory approval; SoftBank predicts the deal will close in mid-to-late 2026 according to a press release. Sami Atiya, the head of the division, will exit the company once the acquisition is complete, per ABB Group.

ABB's robotics business employs roughly 7,000 people and sells a variety of robots and equipment, designed for tasks like picking, cleaning, and painting. The company made $2.3 billion in revenue in 2024, representing 7% of ABB's overall revenue. ABB announced plans to spin out its robotics group in April.

SoftBank said it hopes to be able to “reignite” sales at ABB's robotics spinoff. The organization's 2024 revenue was only $2.3 billion, down from $2.5 billion the previous year.

SoftBank has been building up its investments and holdings in robotics over the last few years. The entity has invested in companies including more legacy players like AutoStore and startups including Skild AI and Agile Robots.  

The firm also launched its own robotics platform, SoftBank Robotics Group, in 2014.  

“SoftBank's next frontier is physical AI,” Masayoshi Son, the chairman and CEO of SoftBank said in the company's press release. “Together with ABB Robotics, we will unite world-class technology and talent under our shared vision to fuse Artificial Super Intelligence and robotics — driving a groundbreaking evolution that will propel humanity forward.”

Robotics is one of four focus areas for SoftBank, together with AI chips, AI data centers, and energy.  

“The center of the ‘Information Revolution' has evolved from personal computers, the internet, and broadband to smartphones, and has now entered a new phase led by artificial intelligence,” SoftBank said in its press release. “In this context, [SoftBank Group] has declared its mission to realize artificial super intelligence (ASI) for the advancement of humanity.” 

TechCrunch reached out to SoftBank for more information.

Base Power has built one of the largest battery storage systems in Texas in two years — and now it wants to grow faster. 

The Austin-based startup, which had raised $200 million in April, is back with another $1 billion in funding. The Series C round was led by Addition with participation from CapitalG, Elad Gil, Lightspeed, Ribbit, Thrive Capital, and Valor Equity Partners.

The new round values the company at $3 billion pre-money, according to the New York Times.

Base Power has sold more than 100 megawatt-hours worth of its home storage batteries in Texas — a notable figure considering the company was founded in 2023. 

Base Power leases the batteries to homeowners, who pay between $695 and $995 up front to install 25 kilowatt-hour or 50 kilowatt-hour batteries, both of which dwarf the competition. (For instance, , the 25-kilowatt battery doubles a single Tesla Powerwall) The batteries can keep a household powered for as long as 48 hours, according to the company.

Customers also pay a monthly fee ($19 or $29) and commit to buying electricity from Base Power for three years at 8.5 cents per kilowatt-hour plus delivery fees. 

By leasing the batteries, Base Power has lowered a significant hurdle for many homeowners: the upfront cost of home storage batteries. The batteries themselves run thousands of dollars for less storage capacity, not including installation costs.

Base Power has also taken advantage of Texas's deregulated utility market, which allows households to easily switch electricity suppliers. 

The state's utility regulator handsomely rewards power providers that can respond quickly with large amounts of electricity when the grid needs it most, something  grid-scale batteries excel at. In exchange for the low up-front cost, Base Power customers agree to allow the company to use the batteries to sell electricity back to the grid when they don't need them for backup power.

In addition to expansion beyond Texas, the company is also planning to build a second battery factory in the United States. It is currently constructing its first factory near Austin, Texas.

Google is bringing its AI-powered conversational search feature, Search Live, to India — launching in English and Hindi — and expanding AI Mode to seven new Indian languages, as the company strengthens its presence in one of its fastest-growing markets.

Introduced in the U.S. in July, Search Live builds on Google's Project Astra technology and is available through the company's AI Mode. The feature lets users point their phone camera at objects to get real-time assistance, supporting back-and-forth conversations that draw on the visual context from the camera feed.

With this launch, India becomes the second market after the U.S. to get Search Live — a logical move given the country's vast base of early AI adopters, who have helped Google grow products like Gemini's Nano Banana model. Google plans to leverage India's early adoption to train its systems on a wider range of visual contexts, making Search Live more capable over time.

“People in India are power users of multimodal search, forming our largest user base for both voice and visual search globally,” said Hema Budaraju, vice president of product management for Search at Google, in a new blog post.

Search Live is starting to roll out to users in India today and will reach more people over the coming weeks. Once available, users can access it by tapping the “Live” icon under the search bar in the Google app, or by opening Lens and selecting “Live” from the bottom of the screen.

Earlier this year, Google revealed that Search Live is powered by a custom version of Gemini. The Gemini app separately includes a similarly named feature called Gemini Live, which was introduced in May and offers a comparable experience. This overlap could easily confuse some users.

Google has also expanded its AI Mode to seven Indian languages: Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. This is part of a global AI Mode expansion, which will be available in more than 35 new languages and 40 new countries and territories, making the AI-powered search experience accessible in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.

Google's AI Mode, which debuted in the U.S. in March and rolled out to more U.S. users in May, lets users ask complex, multi-part questions through an AI-powered interface. It launched in India in June and expanded globally in August. Last month, Google added five new languages — including Hindi, Indonesian, and Japanese — to the feature.

“The advanced reasoning and multimodal understanding of our custom Gemini model for Search allows AI Mode to truly grasp the subtleties of local languages, ensuring AI Mode is genuinely helpful and relevant in all the new languages we introduce,” Budaraju said in the post.

Google's AI Mode and other AI features, including AI Overviews, have faced criticism for reducing search traffic to online publishers. The company, however, has denied that its AI-driven search tools are hurting website visits.

On Wednesday, Google officially launched a new feature for its command-line AI system, Gemini CLI, allowing outside companies to integrate directly into the AI product. Called Gemini CLI Extensions, the feature is launching with extensions from Figma, Stripe, and other companies. 

The announcement comes just two days after OpenAI's launch of apps in ChatGPT, which also integrated third-party systems into an AI environment. But while app access to ChatGPT is tightly curated, Gemini CLI extensions can be published with no endorsement or participation from Google. Available extensions will be hosted in public repositories on GitHub and installed manually by developers.

“That open ecosystem is vital to us,” Taylor Mullen, a senior staff engineer on the project, told TechCrunch. “Everything we're doing is grounded in a fair ecosystem that anyone can participate in.”

The first available extension was to Google's own Nanobanana image generator, which was posted to GitHub last week. Once installed, the extension allows users to generate images directly from the Gemini CLI terminal.

Launched in June, Gemini CLI has grown to over one million users, Google says, with usage heavily skewed toward software developers. Notably, Gemini CLI is heavily used in the development and maintenance of its own codebase, closely overseen by product managers, as detailed in a recent TechCrunch interview.

In an interview, Google's senior director of product management for developer tools Ryan J. Salva told TechCrunch that the purpose of the new feature was to turn Gemini CLI into “an extensibility platform, a conduit to other tools and instructions that come from elsewhere in your tool chain.”

I see this sentiment a lot, they are not equivalent.   The US must reduce spending, if it wants to protect the dollar.   Tax increases may also help.The relationship between tax rates, GDP, government revenue, the market value of new US debt, and the value of the dollar, is complicated and depends on uncertain estimates and models of the economy.  Increasing taxes can reduce GDP, which needs to increase to outgrow the debt, there is an optimal tax rate, more doesn't always help. Decreasing spending is a more straightforward relationship, no new debt, no new dollars.

How it gets done is separate from that.

I don't live in a costal state, but when I do consulting work typically at charity rates alongside my standard full-time job, I have to pay 24% federal tax, 15.3% FICA, and 7.85% state tax. I am already taxed whenever I want to help anyone at 47.15%. That's before the required tax structures and consulting for doing all the invoicing legally. God himself only wanted 10%, so it seems a government playing God is awfully expensive.You can't raise taxes any further before I'm done, and I don't think I'm alone, businesses and consultants are already crushed in taxes. I have to bill $40K to hopefully take home $20K; at which point, is it even worth my time? But if I don't consult because it isn't worth it, are small businesses suddenly going to afford an agency or a dedicated software developer? Of course not, so their growth is handicapped, and I wonder what the effects of that tax-wise are.

They'd still have to pay for Medicare, but it knocks 12.4% off their estimated taxes for consulting.If they're single, then the math is different. 24% for single people starts at just over $100k and runs to about $200k so they may have to pay those taxes. It's always frustrating when people whine about taxes but giving insufficient information to evaluate their complaint.

They stop paying taxes and work off the books instead but you don't announce that publicly for obvious reasons.The incentive to do this increases with tax pressure. The willingness of people to pay for tax-free work equally increases because you'll pay less.There's also an increasing asymmetry of what the government gains from a tax hike versus how oppressive it becomes that becomes unfavorable as tax rates go up.

I don't believe this, actually. I think that we will raise more revenue, yes, by squeezing more from the Fortune 500; but you will absolutely crush small business and consultancy work further. It's kind of like how an 80% tax rate on everyone making over $100K would do a fantastic job of raising revenue, but it's fundamentally stupid and would kill all future golden geese.(On that note, I see this comment a lot about how we had huge tax rates, 91% in the 1950s; but this is misleading. The effective tax rate for those earners was only 41%, due to the sheer number of exemptions, according to modern analysis. We have never had an actual effective 91% tax rate, or anywhere close to it. Those rates were theater, never reality.)

On that note, you have no evidence that economists focus solely on tax rates on the curve independently of the economy at large. By definition, the curve is determined from external factors and economic measurements, none of which currently resemble 2012. If the economy crashed and there was 20% unemployment, do you still think they'd stand behind the same curve?

You say you consult at charity rates and then point to taxation as the sole reason it isn't worth your time...

So all the entities that want to hold the debt (social security administration, mutual funds, pension funds etc) where should they go instead? Riskier assets is what you're saying right? Is that a great idea?

Probably the closest US bond equivalent would be debt from well-run Asian countries. I would avoid fixed-income dollar denominated assets.

The surface way it's wrong is that investors could have invested in Nvidia 10 years ago instead of gold.  Because they didn't, their investments ""eroded"" even more.The deeper way it's wrong is that people who say this almost always have the unstated premise that gold is ""real"" money, that every price should be measured against it.  That premise is false.When gold was allowed to float in terms of the US dollar, it went up to $200, then dropped down to $100.  When it dropped to $100, the dollar didn't become worth twice as much.  Or, to use a more recent example, there has not been a factor of 4 inflation over the last 10 years.  So gold is not a fixed measuring stick, against which all other things are measured.

Everyone outside of the American empire knows that the gig is up. When Uncle Sam has his money printing press on full blast, the American people don't feel the full effect, but everyone in the global majority, where there are no dollar printing machines, gets to see too many dollars chasing the same goods, a.k.a. inflation.The day when the American people elect a fiscally prudent government, for Americans to work hard, pay their taxes and get that deficit to a manageable number is never going to happen. But that is not a problem, the situation is out of America's hands now.It was the 2022 sanctions on Russia that made the BRICS alliance take note. Freezing their foreign reserves was not well received. Hence we now have China trading in their own currency with their trading partners happy with that.Soon we will have a situation where there is no 'exorbitant privilege' (reserve currency, which can only ever end up with massive deficits), instead the various BRICS currencies will be anchored to valuable commodities such as rare earth metals, gold and everything else that is 'proof of work' and important to the future. So that means no more 'petro-dollar', the store of value won't be hydrocarbons.This sounds better than going back to a gold standard. As I see it, the problem with the gold standard is that you kind of know already who has all the gold and we don't want them to be the masters of the universe, because it will be the same bankers.As for an AI 'Hail Mary', I do hope so. The money printed by Uncle Sam to end up in the Magnificent Seven means that it will be relatively easy to write this money off.

reply

The glaring issue with it back then was that unlike an LLM that can be understanding of what you try to explain and bit more consistent the diffusion models ability to read and understand your prompt wasn't really there yet, you're more shotgunning keywords and hope the seed lottery gives you something nice.But recent image generation models are significantly better in stable output.

That's the lowest of the low and even you accept it doesn't work (yet), how can LLMs be worth 50% of the last years of gdp growth if it's that bad. Do you think customer support represents 50% of newly created value ? I bet it isn't event .5%

Maybe if companies would wire up their ""oh a customer is complaining try and talk them out of canceling their account offer them a mild discount in exchange for locking in for a year contract"" API to the LLM?  Okay, but that's not a trillion-dollar service.

I work in the industry and I know that ad agencies are already moving onto AI gen for social ads.For VFX and films the tech is not there yet, since OpenAI believes they can build the next TikTok on AI (a proposition being tested now) and Google is just being Google - building amazing tools but with little understanding (so far) of how to deploy them on the market.Still Google is likely ahead in building tools that are being used (Nano Banana and Veo 3) while the Chinese open source labs are delivering impressive stuff that you run locally or increasingly on a rented H100 on the cloud.

I don't know how to invest to avoid this bubble. My money is where my mouth is. My investments are conservative and long-term. Most in equity index funds, some bonds, Vanguard mutual funds, a few hand-picked stocks.No interest in shorting the market or trying to time the crash. I would say I 90% believe a correction of 25% or more will happen in the next 12 months. No idea where my money might be safe. Palantir? Northrup Grumman?

If you are skeptical but also not willing to place a bet, you shouldn't say “AI is overvalued” because you don't actually believe it. You should say, “I think it might be overvalued, but I'm not really sure? And I don't have enough experience in markets or confidence to make a bet on it, so I will go with everyone else's sentiment and make the ‘safe' bet of being long the market. But like… something feels weird to me about how much money is being poured into this? But I can't say for sure whether it is overvalued or not.”Those are two wildly different things.

I certainly had unease about the dot-com market and should have shifted more investments to the conservative side. But I made the ""‘safe' bet of being long the market"" even after things started going south.FWIW, I do think AI is overvalued for the relatively near term. But I'm not sure what to do about that other than being fairly conservatively invested which makes sense for me at this point anyway.

It's very possible that human beings today are already doing the most intelligent things they can given the data and resources they have available. This whole idea that there's a magic property called intelligence that can solve every problem when it reaches a sufficient level, regardless of what data and resources it has to work with, increasingly just seems like the fantasy of people who think they're very intelligent.

A chimpanzee can use tools and solve problems, but it will never construct a factory, design an iPhone, or build even a simple wooden house. Humans can, because our intelligence operates at a qualitatively different level.As humans, we can easily visualize and reason about 2D and 3D spaces, it's natural because our sensory systems evolved to navigate a 3D world. But can we truly conceive of a million dimensions, let alone visualize them? We can describe them mathematically, but not intuitively grasp them. Our brains are not built for that kind of complexity.Now imagine a form of intelligence that can directly perceive and reason about such high dimensional structures. Entirely new kinds of understanding and capabilities might emerge. If a being could fully comprehend the underlying rules of the universe, it might not need to perform physical experiments at all, it could simply simulate outcomes internally.Of course that's speculative, but it just illustrates how deeply intelligence is shaped and limited by its biological foundation.

It likely couldn't, though, that's the problem.At a basic level, whatever abstract system you can think of, there must be an optimal physical implementation of that system, the fastest physically realizable implementation of it. If that physical implement was to exist in reality, no intelligence could reliably predict its behavior, because that would imply that they have access to a faster implementation, which cannot exist.The issue is that most physical systems are arguably the optimal implementation of whatever it is that they do. They aren't implementations of simple abstract ideas like adders or matrix multipliers, they're chaotic systems that follow no specifications. They just do what they do. How do you approximate chaotic systems which, for all you know, may depend on any minute details? On what basis do we think it is likely that there exists a computer circuit that can simulate their outcomes before they happen? It's magical thinking.Note that intelligence has to simulate outcomes, because it has to control them. It has to prove to itself that its actions will help achieve its goals. Evolution doesn't have this limitation: it's not an agent, it doesn't have goals, it doesn't simulate outcomes, stuff just happens. In that sense it's likely that certain things can evolve that cannot be intelligently designed (as in designed, constructed and then controlled). It's quite possible intelligence itself falls in that category and we can't create and control AGI, and AGI can't improve itself and control the outcome either, and so on.

I guess where my speculation comes in is that ""simulation"" doesn't necessarily have to mean perfect 1:1 physical emulation. Maybe a higher intelligence could model useful abstractions/approximations, simplified  but still predictive frameworks that are accurate enough for control and reasoning even in chaotic domains.After all, humans already do this in a primitive way, we can't simulate every particle of the atmosphere, but we can predict weather patterns statistically. So perhaps the difference between us and a much higher intelligence wouldn't be breaking physics, but rather having much deeper and more general abstractions that capture reality's essential structure better.In that sense, it's not ""magical thinking"", I just acknowledge that our cognitive compression algorithms (our abstractions) are extremely limited. A mind that could discover higher order abstractions might not outrun physics, but it could reason about reality in qualitatively new ways.

Maybe warp drives are actually physically impossible!  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warp_drive says:> A warp drive or a drive enabling space warp is a fictional superluminal (faster than the speed of light) spacecraft propulsion system in many science fiction works, most notably Star Trek,[1] and a subject of ongoing real-life physics research.

It wouldn't be terribly surprising if we already had enough data to figure out how to solve it the rest of the time.  We already have complete genomes for many species, AlphaFold has solved the protein-folding problem, research oncology studies routinely sequence tumors nowadays, and IHEC says they already have ""comprehensive sets of reference epigenomes"", so with enough computational power, or more efficient simulation algorithms, we could probably simulate an entire human body much faster than real time with enough fidelity to simulate cancer, thus enabling us to test candidate drug molecules against a particular cancer instantly.Also, of course, once you can build reliable nanobots, you can just program them to kill a particular kind of cancer cell, then inject them.Understanding this does not require believing that ""intelligence that can solve every problem when it reaches a sufficient level, regardless of what data and resources it has to work with"", which I think is a strawman you have made up.  It doesn't even require believing that sufficient intelligence can solve every problem if it has sufficient data and resources to work with.  It only requires understanding that being able to do the same thing regular humans do, but much faster, would be sufficient to cure cancer.——There does seem to be an open question about how general intelligence is.  We know that there isn't much difference in intelligence between people; 90+% of the human population can learn to write a computer program, make a pit-fired pot from  clay, haggle in a bazaar, paint a realistic portrait, speak Chinese, fix a broken pipe, interrogate a suspect and notice when he contradicts himself, fletch an arrow, make a convincing argument in courts, program a VCR, write poetry, solve a Rubik's cube, make a béchamel sauce, weave a cloth, sing a five-minute lullaby, sew a seam, or machine a screw thread on a lathe.  (They might not be able to learn all of them, because it depends on what they spend time on.)And, as far as we know, no other animal species can do any of those things: not chimpanzees, not dolphins, not octopodes, not African grey parrots.  And most of them aren't instinctive activities even in humans—many didn't exist 1000 years ago, and some didn't exist even 100 years ago.So humans clearly have some fairly flexible facility that these other species lack.  ""Intelligence"" is the usual name for that facility.But it's not perfectly general.  For example, it involves some degree of ability to imagine three-dimensional space.  Some of the humans can also reason about four- or five-dimensional spaces, but this is a much slower and more difficult process, far out of proportion to the underlying mathematical difficulty of the problem.

The basic issue is that we have to deduce stuff about the world we live in, using resources from the world we live in. In the story, the data bandwidth is contrived to be insanely smaller than the compute bandwidth, but that's not realistic. In reality, we are surrounded by chaotic physical systems that operate on raw hardware. They are, in fact, quite fast, and probably impossible to simulate efficiently. For instance, we can obviously never build a computer that can simulate the behavior of its own circuitry, using said circuitry, faster than it operates. But I think there's a lot of physical systems that are just like that.Being data-limited means that we get data slower than we can analyze and process it. It is certainly possible to improve our ability to analyze data, but I don't think we can assume that the best physically realizable intelligence would overcome data limitation, nor that it would be cost-effective in the first place, compared to simply gathering more data and experimenting more.

It may very well be true that you could cure cancer even faster or more cheaply with more experimental data, but that's irrelevant to the claim that more experimental data is necessary.It may also be the case that there's no ""shortcut"" to simulating a human body well enough to test drugs against a simulated tumor faster than real time—that is, that you need to have enough memory to track every simulated atom.  (The success of AlphaFold suggests that this is not the case, as does the ability of humans to survive things like electric shocks, but let's be conservative.)  But a human body only contains on the order of 10²⁴ atoms, so you can just build a computer with 10²⁸ words of memory, and processing power to match.  It might be millions of times larger than a human body, but that's okay; there's plenty of mass out there to turn into computronium.  It doesn't make it physically unrealizable.Relatedly, you may be interested in seeing Mr. Rogers confronting the paperclip maximizer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-zJ1spML5c

Human intelligence must be deterministic, any other conclusion is equivalent to the claim that there is some sort of ""soul"" for lack of better term. If human intelligence is deterministic, then it can be written in software.Thus, if we continue to strive to design/create/invent such, it is inevitable that eventually it must happen. Failures to date can be attributed to various factors, but the gist is that we haven't yet identified the principles of intelligent software.My guess is that we need less than 5 million years further development time even in a worst-case scenario. With luck and proper investment, we can get it down well below the 1 million year mark.

~200 years of industrial revolution and we already fucked up beyond the point of no return, I don't think we'll have resources to continue on this trajectory for 1m years.

No, not all processes follow deterministic Newtonian mechanics. It could also be random, unpredictable at times. Are the there random processes in the human brain? Yes, there are random quantum processes in every atom, and there are atoms in the brain.Yes, this is no less materialistic: Humans are still proof that either you believe in souls or such, or that human level intelligence can be made from material atoms.  But it's not deterministic.But also, LLMs are not anywhere close to becoming human level intelligence.

it has been educational to see how quickly the financier class has moved when they saw an opportunity to abandon labor entirely, though. that's worth remembering when they talk about how this system is the best one for everyone.

The best medicines can come from unexpected places. Case in point: A new study published today finds that stevia—the natural sugar substitute—can potentially boost common hair loss treatments' potency.

Scientists in China and Australia developed a dissolving patch that combines a sweetener derived from the stevia plant (Stevia rebaudiana) with topical minoxidil, the active ingredient in popular over-the-counter hair loss drugs like Rogaine. In tests with balding mice, the sweetened patch appeared to enhance minoxidil's absorption into the skin and boosted its ability to restore hair.

“This work opens exciting possibilities for more effective and user-friendly treatments for hair loss,” study author Lifeng Kang, a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney's School of Pharmacy, told Gizmodo.

Minoxidil is most commonly used to treat androgenetic alopecia, which is more commonly known as male or female pattern baldness. The condition is primarily caused by having genes that make a person's hair follicles overly sensitive to androgens (male-related sex hormones). Regular minoxidil use can slow or prevent further balding from androgenetic alopecia, but it has its drawbacks.

The drug doesn't dissolve easily in liquid nor is it absorbed well into the body when applied topically, which means that it has to be applied a lot to be effective (usually at least once or twice a day). Other commonly added compounds like ethanol and propylene glycol can improve the drug's skin absorption, but they can also cause side effects, including itching, a rash, and dandruff build-up on your scalp.

A handful of studies suggest that minimally invasive microneedling—causing tiny pricks in the skin—can improve minoxidil's absorption and even boost hair growth on its own as a result of increasing blood flow to the hair follicles. For the new study, the researchers wondered if it were possible to develop a dissolvable patch that essentially performed microneedling and delivered minoxidil to a person's scalp at the same time.

According to Kang, other studies had also indicated that natural compounds similar to stevia, including the main sweetener in monk fruit, held specific properties they could use to develop the patch. They hypothesized that stevioside, the primary sweetener in stevia, could act as both the base for their microneedles as well as helping minoxidil dissolve better in water.

The researchers tested their patch on mice given doses of testosterone to simulate androgenetic alopecia (the hormone doesn't directly cause pattern baldness in people, but it breaks down into another hormone that does, dihydrotestosterone). They then compared these mice to animals that were given nothing, and mice that were given a standard formulation of minoxidil.

The mice that got the stevia patch experienced clear improvements in hair growth, the researchers found. By day 35, the patch-dosed mice saw hair return in about 67% of the treated area, compared to about 25% of the treated area in mice given standard minoxidil. As hoped, the researchers also found that the patch greatly improved the drug's absorption into the skin.

The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Advanced Healthcare Materials, are still very preliminary, and more studies will be needed before the patch might make its way to humans, the researchers said.

“While the mouse model results are promising, human hair growth cycles differ, and androgenetic alopecia is influenced by multiple factors,” Kang said. “Therefore, clinical trials are essential to confirm efficacy and safety in humans.”

But given these results, and the fact that stevia is already widely used as a food additive, Kang is hopeful that stevia could prove a safe and easy boost to minoxidil's effectiveness. He and his team are now looking to explain why stevia boosts the drug's potency and whether similar compounds could work as well. They are also hoping to run clinical trials in people with pattern baldness.

“The microneedle patch could simplify treatment regimens, reduce dosing frequency, and improve patient adherence,” Kang said.

Predator: Badlands has gotten its rating. Amazon teases a new look at the hero (and villains) of its new Batman spinoff. Plus, a new R.L. Stine animated series is on the way. Spoilers assemble!



Speaking to Indiewire, Rebecca Ferguson confirmed that she will be back for a small role as Lady Jessica in Dune: Part 3, seemingly changed from the relatively minor role the character has in the second Dune book, Messiah.

I don't have a big part in this one, [she's] just barely in the book. I'm not sure I was supposed to be in it and Denis had a little idea… The script is phenomenal. It's really hard to create a film, it's such a dense book. There's so much to tell. [Denis] does dip in and out and he does try and he does want to have certain connections and tentacles to the book. Whatever Denis touches I think is phenomenal.

Predator: Badlands is officially rated PG-13, according to IGN.

Bloody-Disgusting reports a sequel to 2020's The Wretched is now filming in Syracuse, New York. Starring Katie Parker and Sam Huntington, the story concerns “a small-town deputy as he's pulled into a rash of missing children's cases, only to discover that the skin-changing Wretch is back and has been preying upon the families of his community for a century.”

According to Comic Book Movie, Wonder Man will be released under the Marvel Spotlight banner and have little to no bearing on the larger MCU.

Amazon has released a poster for its Merry Little Batman spinoff series, Bat-Fam.

Deadline reports an animated series based on R.L. Stine's Stinetinglers, his ongoing collection of short stories set in the fictional town of Blooming Hills, is now in development at Limestone Animation in Ontario, Canada. In an attached press release, Stine had this to say:

Animation is the perfect medium to tell the twisted tales of Stinetinglers. These spooky stories will be brought to life in a way unlike any of my work before. But more than that, I was blown away by the unique spin the team at Limestone Animation proposed and I immediately knew they were the right partners to bring to screen my newest stories.

Finally, Sam Fisher starts sneakin' in a new clip from Splinter Cell: Deathwatch.

TV audio has become terrible as manufacturers make screens thinner and eliminate the space needed for decent speakers. You've probably experienced that frustrating moment of constantly adjusting volume because dialogue gets drowned out by background music or action sequences, forcing you to choose between hearing conversations and not waking the neighbors.

Bose's TV Speaker soundbar solves this specific problem with laser focus on speech clarity and here's what makes today special: Bose never discounts this popular soundbar outside of Prime Day and Black Friday events. For Prime Big Deal Day's final hours, Amazon has pushed it down to $199 from the standard $279, which is an all-time low that Prime members can grab until tonight when the promotion ends.

See at Amazon

The Bose TV speaker approaches home sound design on refreshingly simple terms, and favors what really is paramount above all else: clarity on dialogue. Two angled full-range drivers develop a broader soundstage than your TV's integrated speakers ever could and allows voices space to breathe and making it that much easier for your ears to delineate speech from ambient noises. This is the effect of spatial audio, the result of the driver orientation which emits sound outward as opposed to directly forward.

The dedicated dialogue mode is Bose's way of recognizing that clarity of speech is more important than thunderous explosions on a majority of everyday viewing. Engaging the mode via the provided remote control prioritizes vocal frequencies and diction, and allows actors' voices to predominate even through busy soundtracks. The bass boost setting is the inverse correction when you desire increased depth for music or desire film sound effects to have justifiable wallop.

Setup ease eliminates the customary intimidation factor when dealing with home theater components: A matter of one cable connection from the soundbar to your television has you up and running in minutes via the included optical audio cable or via an HDMI-ARC cable should your television support that standard. An advantage that HDMI-ARC has is allowing your television's remote control to control the volume on the soundbar directly, rather than having multiple remotes to deal with. The soundbar is just over 2 inches high, which makes it able to go in front of the average television without covering the television.

The Bluetooth connectivity transforms the soundbar from a television accessory into a speaker for the room: You can play music from your phone, listen to podcasts when you cook, or computer sound when working from home. The soundbar can remember up to three devices that have been paired through its variety of inputs like the HDMI, optical, and auxiliary inputs, and will switch automatically to the device that is powered on first.

The small measurements of 23.38 inches wide by 4.02 inches deep by 2.21 inches high keep this soundbar unobtrusive in areas that would have oversized models overpower your home entertainment center. It can be wall-mounted if that sleek appearance is desired, although you will need to acquire the mounting brackets separately.

At $199, you're getting Bose's sound expertise at $80 off the regular price. This exclusive Prime deal goes away when the night is over on Prime Big Deal Day, which is to say that this price window closes on you in a matter of hours.

The central bank of the United Kingdom is worried about an AI bubble burst.

“On a number of measures, equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI),” the bank's financial policy committee said, according to a record of its latest meeting. “This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.”

The Bank also warned that stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 was at its highest concentration in 50 years. Those five companies are, unsurprisingly, AI-focused tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta.

All five of these companies are spending eye-watering figures on AI, and the stock market loves it. Microsoft became the second company to ever hit a $4 trillion market valuation earlier this year after posting its largest ever quarterly expenditure forecast. Nvidia, on the other hand, is the first and only company in the world to hit a $4.5 trillion market cap.

“Material bottlenecks to AI progress – from power, data, or commodity supply chains – as well as conceptual breakthroughs which change the anticipated AI infrastructure requirements for the development and utilisation of powerful AI models could also harm valuations, including for companies whose revenue expectations are derived from high levels of anticipated AI infrastructure investment,” the bank said.

Fed researchers issued a similar warning earlier this year. While that alert did not identify an immediate risk of an AI bubble, the researchers pointed out that a risk that comes with building expensive infrastructure too quickly for anticipated demand was that demand might not grow as expected. In that case, it could lead to “disastrous consequences,” the Fed warned, likening it to the railroad over-expansion of the 1800s that led to an economic depression towards the turn of the century.

These top AI companies with high revenue expectations are also heavily reliant on each other financially, increasing worries of a cascade effect if a bubble bursts. AI companies ink multibillion-dollar deals with each other over and over again, injecting more money into the system and ballooning stock valuations with each deal.

While that's happening, some experts are admitting overvaluation.

Apollo Global Management's chief economist Torsten Slok said in July that the AI bubble of today is actually worse than the 1999 dot-com bubble. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also admitted in August that he thinks investors are “over-excited about AI.”

The main downside risks of AI overvaluation, according to the bank, also include disappointing AI capability or adoption progress.

A recent MIT report found that despite the major push to adopt AI in the corporate world, fewer than one in ten AI pilot programs actually generated real revenue gains. The report spooked investors enough that AI stocks immediately slid following the headlines in August.

Last month, the Census Bureau showed that the rate of AI adoption by large companies had been declining slightly.

Nonetheless, executives keep assuring investors that AI demand is scaling rapidly as the technology finds its way into more and more areas of life. AI computing demand is up “substantially” in the past six months, according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's comments on Wednesday.

But if the tech giants are wrong and the Bank of England's risk scenario does end up being the case, the bank warned that a sudden, sharp correction could occur, “adversely affecting the cost and availability of finance for households and businesses.”

The U.S. has reason to be afraid of this. According to recent reports, the AI spending frenzy is not just propping up the American stock market, but it's also lifting the real economy. According to Harvard economist James Furman‘s calculations, U.S. GDP growth in the first half of the year was almost entirely driven by investments made in data centers and other information-processing technology.

I'm the writer who comes to you every time Amazon hosts its big blowout deal-a-thon to remind you that you shouldn't shell out your hard-earned money just because there's a big red “Prime Big Deal” sticker on it. Now that we're in October and yet another Prime Day is upon us, we've noticed a new trend. Prices have spiked to the point that today's “deals” are far less impactful than they once were. In some cases, products with supposed limited-time discounts cost what they used to cost back at launch.

This year's October Prime Day (Amazon started exhausting us with two Prime Day events a year in 2023) isn't as egregious as the company's four-day shopping extravaganza back in July. I've been poring over the deals on the page from Tuesday through Wednesday, and I'm finding more honest discounts for consumer tech items, like a 2025 Asus ROG Strix G16 (with an older Intel Core i7-14650HX CPU and Nvidia RTX 5060 GPU) for $1,200 versus its list price of $1,500. Normally, Amazon and third-party retailers jack up the base price of a product to make the deals seem more extravagant than they are. Now, the prices can compare to past devices prior to Trump dropping his first set of international tariffs back in April.

Even if the deals this October seem more subdued and realistic, it's only because suggested retail prices have skyrocketed due to Trump's ongoing obsession with tariffs. The ROG Strix G16 from 2024 with a 13th-gen Intel chip and RTX 4060 normally went for between $1,250 and 1,350 throughout last year into June this year. Price history site Camelcamelcamel shows the price has not moved from $1,384.50 for the past several months. Newer parts will always demand higher prices, but 2025 has proved the egregious exception to the rule. The prices are higher in general compared to what they normally are, meaning the deals are that much less of a bargain for consumers.

Prime Day may be the only way to get some products at their pre-tariff price. The child-centric video game console called the Nex Playground was originally set to retail for $200. There's a “limited time deal” on Amazon to take the price from its $250 list price back down to what it would have originally cost before June this year. Other devices show how the supposed “deals” are worse than they would have been without tariffs. Take the GoPro Hero13 Black from last year. GoPro isn't releasing a successor, though there is a new Max2 360 camera. The Hero13 Black originally retailed for $400 MSRP. While Amazon has a special deal for the camera at $330 bundled with the wide-angle lens attachment (that bundle launched just before the July Prime Day), GoPro is also selling the base camera for $360, claiming the retail price is $430. Price history data shows how the device spiked to that price intermittently since before July and Amazon's first 2025 Prime Day (or really, we should just call it “Prime Week at this point).

Pricing isn't just wrong on Amazon. The tariff-born issues with deals are everywhere. Sean Hollister at The Verge first spotted what may be the first instance of an AMD Radeon RX 9070 graphics card for PC, selling for $550 on PC parts retailer Newegg. That's what AMD promised us it would cost when the company first announced its GPUs back in February, but shortly after launch, third-party makers sold them for $600 or more. The card everybody wanted, the Radeon RX 9070 XT, went for well above its $600 MSRP. Even today, you can't find that 4K-ready GPU for less than $650, on sale or otherwise. AMD's poor communication to customers started this issue, but tariffs have only helped keep prices high. Only recently have prices on GPUs like Nvidia's RTX 5080 come down to the original $1,000 suggested retail price.

Pricing can feel esoteric. We know of many gadgets whose prices spiked explicitly because of tariffs. Video game consoles were hit especially hard. A new PlayStation 5 costs $550, $50 more than it did in 2020. Xbox hiked the prices for its consoles twice in the span of a few months, and now a standard Xbox Series X costs $650, $150 more than it retailed for at launch. None of these devices are on sale for Prime Day. Perhaps they will receive a markdown during Black Friday. Whatever temporary price slashing comes in the future, they will necessarily be a worse deal than they would have been before Trump started his international trade war with every foreign nation and penguin-inhabited island.

Tariffs incentivized companies to increase prices or otherwise keep their products out of the U.S. entirely. Whether the tariffs warranted price increases or companies treated it as the best excuse to hike costs, it doesn't matter anymore. We now live in a world where gadgets don't get cheaper as they age—they may cost more. Trump's import taxes are exacerbating the deals-obsessed online ecosystem that Amazon started with its first Prime Day back in 2015. The end result is that consumers won't have any idea what products should be worth anymore.

Prime Day deals are underway thanks to the October Prime Day event, and it means that there are deals all over the place on just about everything. The best thing to go shopping for right now though, is new tech. If you're in the market for a new work laptop, for example, then you'll love today's deal.

Right now, you can get this Dell Inspiron 15 3530 Touchscreen Laptop while it's 80% off. That brings it down from the listed price of $4,300 to $878, and you're getting a huge amount of power for that price. This deal isn't going to last for long though, so you'll want to be quick, or you'll miss out.

See at Amazon

This laptop has an absurd amount of power inside of it. The Intel 10-Core i5 1334U processor means that you'll be able to speed through any program with no problems, and the massive 64GB of RAM puts this ahead of the majority of laptops, and means you can multitask like it's nothing. There are very few programs that this laptop is even going to notice you opening, and only a fraction of those are going to actually require all of that processing power and RAM.

Along with that, you'll be able to store just about everything you could want. You'll be able to save any number of projects, videos, spreadsheets, and just about anything else without worrying about hitting that limit. That's a big relief if you're used to coming up against the horrors of limited storage space.

You're still getting an HD 15.6-inch touchscreen with anti-glare to make it easier to use and see in any lighting or situation, and it comes with WiFi 6 support, Windows 11 Pro as your OS, and a few essential accessories as well. Basically, you're getting a really powerful laptop that can do what you need as soon as you need it, and it'll rarely struggle with any task you might throw at it. That's the kind of device you need as a working professional, or if you're a student with a more demanding workload than usual.

This is a great laptop, but being able to get it while it's 80% off is amazing. The $878 price tag isn't going to last forever though, so you're going to want to act on this one quickly, or you could end up missing out on this bargain price and have to pay a lot more for it.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


We're scouring the hottest sales at all retailers for the best Amazon Prime Big Deals Day deals on gaming GPUs, CPUs, desktop PCs, laptops, monitors, and even hard drives, among other items, and collecting those here for you, live. We aren't just selecting deals willy-nilly, either; our domain experts are curating a list of the best value items, often based on our in-depth reviews, benchmarks, and extensive historical pricing analysis to ensure that when we say it's a great deal, it truly is.

We'll be updating this deals live blog to help you find the best ways to save money on gear that can upgrade your PC and your entire tech life.

The Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4TB is an interesting drive with PCIe behavior that skirts the border between Gen 4.0 and Gen 5.0. Use 4 lanes in PCIe Gen 4x4, or 2 pipelines in Gen 5x2 on a newer PCIe Gen 5.0 device. With sequential read and write speeds of up to 7,250/7,250 MB/s, this is a fast drive. It's single-sided and power-efficient, making it ideal for use in laptops or desktop PCs. 

This 27-inch 1080p Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. But it sports a 180 Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and FreeSync variable refresh. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best.  

This compact and easy to use flashlight provides 50 Lumens of light, without the need to fiddle around for a button. Just unclip, and your flashlight is ready to light your way.

HOTO's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly.

This compact kit includes all the essential tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx/Torx security, and many others. You also get spudgers and pry tools, tweezers, brush, and a magnetizer/demagnetizer for your screwdriver bits.

 




PC building is expensive, which is why during deals events, we like to challenge ourselves to see what we could build if we exclusively shopped sales. We did pretty well this year, coming up with an $850 rig without relying on an 8GB GPU. Opting for an AMD Radeon RTX 9060 XT got us those 16GB that should hopefully keep this system humming for a few years.Here's more of our parts list:

Other impressive feats included jamming 32GB of RAM (though yes, it is DDR4, thanks to the budget B550 motherboard we opted for. At least it includes Wi-Fi?), as well as 1TB of storage and an 8-core GPU.Learn more about our picks here.If you decide to replicate this build in real life, you'll need to shop at multiple sites, including Amazon, B&H Photo, and Newegg, to ensure you get the best prices. — Andrew E. Freedman

I spent years buying disposable cans of compressed air to clean all of my PC hardware before I decided to buy an electric air duster. A rechargeable tool that compresses air will save you a ton of money in the long term and is a great way to clean dust and grime from your fans, keyboard, and really anywhere in your home. Right now, this Wolfbox MG100 is available for 40% off in a lightning deal, now just $66. You get a bunch of attachments, a charge cable, and a 150,000 RPM motor, enough that you'll want to be careful around your more fragile components. Move fast, they're being claimed minute by minute, and the deal will end when they're all gone. - Stephen Warwick

This compact air duster can move air at up to 45 m/s with its 150,000 RPM turbofan. A rechargeable battery gives up to 100 minutes of use time and supports USB Type-C charging. The MF100 includes five nozzles and two brush tools to help clean your PC equipment.

Today's most powerful CPUs are harder to keep cool than ever for a host of reasons, but Arctic's Liquid Freezer III Pro 360 solves all of those problems in a snap. We think this Editor's Choice Award-winning cooler is the best thing going for chilling the most demanding CPUs on the market, and it's on sale during this Prime Big Deals Day for just $89. If you'd like a light show in your PC, you can also pick up the aRGB version for $98.

The Arctic Liquid Freezer III Pro 360 is a more recent iteration of the Arctic Liquid Freezer III, with improved fans and thermal performance.

This cooler can mount on AM4/AM5 and Intel LGA1851/LGA1700 sockets, with all the included attachment pieces included in the box. Arctic coolers are also known for incorporating an integrated VRM cooling fan into the CPU block.

Get the same cooler with a little RGB flair for just $10 more. 

 




On top of its Editor's Choice-winning raw cooling capacity, the Arctic Liquid Freezer III 360 includes a dedicated mounting frame for recent Intel CPUs to ensure more even contact and better heat transfer with those chips, and its AMD mounting system positions the cooler right above the compute dies on the latest Ryzen processors for the best performance. Just make sure your case or build can hold a 360mm radiator, and you'll be all set. - Jeff Kampman

One of the best gaming monitors we've seen on the second day of Prime Day is this Asus ROG Strix 4K 27-inch IPS display. It features support for up to 160Hz at 4K or a rapid 320Hz refresh rate at 1080p, thanks to dual mode support. That means you can use it for higher-fidelity gaming and rapid-response shooters, the preferred mode of engagement for competitive players.

Prime Big Deal

ASUS' ROG Strix XG27UCG is a 27"" Fast IPS LCD monitor with dual mode support — it supports 4K resolution at 160 Hz, or 1080p resolution at 320 Hz. This makes it a great buy for gamers who enjoy both competitive titles that require twitch reflexes as well as single-player games with lush visuals.

The 27-inch display will offer great pixel density, HDR 400 brightness, DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.1, and USB-C. - Stephen Warwick

We love a good M.2 SSD deal here at Tom's Hardware, and my personal favorite this week is the excellent Samsung 4TB EVO Plus. 4TB seems to be the sweet spot for SSD deals at the moment. You can obviously save more by choosing less capacity, but in terms of value, I don't think you can do better if you can grab one at the $200 mark. Step forward, Samsung's 4TB EVO Plus, now just $199. That's a whopping 39% discount and the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model.

The Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4TB is an interesting drive with PCIe behavior that skirts the border between Gen 4.0 and Gen 5.0. Use 4 lanes in PCIe Gen 4x4, or 2 pipelines in Gen 5x2 on a newer PCIe Gen 5.0 device. With sequential read and write speeds of up to 7,250/7,250 MB/s, this is a fast drive. And it's single-sided and power-efficient, making it great for use in a laptop or desktop. 

While it may not be the fastest M.2 SSD on the market, the EVO Plus is a terrific all-rounder with few weaknesses. It performs well against rivals, as well as its predecessor, the bog-standard EVO. You might want a bit more performance from something like a Samsung 9100 Pro or indeed the 990 Pro, but you'll pay considerably more for either. - Stephen Warwick

These days, you could easily spend $1,000 or more if you're after a high-end gaming monitor. But if you're looking for a bargain (and your desk or wall has the space for it), LG's 48-inch 2025-model C5 OLED TV just might be the best gaming screen bargain during Prime Day. It's currently on sale for its lowest-ever price of $899, and can go as high as 144 Hz refresh in gaming mode. I speak from experience when I say that much screen real estate, a 4K resolution, and inky blacks are tough to pass up.

This 2025 model of LG's 48-inch 4K OLED TV tops out at 144 Hz for gaming, has a max rated brightness of 1,400 lumens, and would make a great (big) gaming and productivity monitor.

I've been using TVs as monitors since, I believe, sometime in 2011. Back then, it was a 1080p Sony TV, but I soon upgraded to a cheap 4K Seiki TV, and since 2021, I've been using a 55-inch LG OLED as my main monitor for work, gaming, and kicking back to watch Alien: Earth.There are a few things to consider if you're going to use a TV as a monitor. You'll either want a deep desk so you can sit far enough from the screen or, as I've done, you'll want to wall mount your screen so it's right up against the wall. And while LG's C5 OLED can run at up to 144 Hz, that's not as fast as high-end gaming monitors. If ultra-fast refresh rates are important to you, then a TV isn't a great choice. But I play games multiple times a week and I've never felt the need for more than 120 Hz. In fact, most of the time I leave my TV in 60 Hz mode because I prefer the extra brightness over the faster refresh. And I really love the large screen for immersion and to help with eye strain while I work. I don't have to do any squinting when reading text on my 55-inch display.If you want a big screen without having to pay the most money, I'd highly recommend using a TV as your monitor for gaming and work. And at $899, LG's 48-inch C5 OLED is my pick for the best high-end gaming monitor deal during this Prime Day. I'm tempted to buy one to replace my 2021 model which, yes, does have slight burn-in (not from gaming or work, but oddly from my Amazon Fire Stick's home screen), but I don't want to step ""down"" to a 48-inch screen or pay the $400 more that the 55-inch C5 LG OLED costs.

This is a deal that I can personally stand behind, because I bought the Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphone back in December 2024, and it wasn't this cheap!

A compact set of dual microphones that work with any Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android or iOS device. They offer superb audio clarity and active noise cancellation to focus on the conversation and not the background noise.

 




The kit comes in a charging case, with two microphones and a receiver. You can get versions with Apple's lightning connector, as well as a shoe connector for DSLRs. For me, I chose the USB Type-C version for use with my Android phone, and via a USB Type-C to USB Type-A adapter I use it for team meetings and for presenting live shows. I just clip the microphone to my shirt using the magnetic back and I am ready to go. All the while resisting the urge to tap the microphone like a communicator from Star Trek: The Next Generation. Are they lightweight and easily forgettable? Yes. Did I leave one on my jumper and put it back in the wardrobe? Yes. Did I forget to take the microphone off when I went to the bathroom? No comment but it was muted.

I bought these microphones with content creation in mind. The dual microphones are exceptionally useful for conducting interviews in the field. With app controlled noise cancellation the microphones capture just the voices of the myself and the interviewee and none of the background noise. Audio quality is clear and punchy.

 




The Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphones come with a kit bag full of extras. Lanyards to hold the microphone magnetically, wind muffs (also known as dead cats) to block wind noise, magnetic lapel clips, and weirdly some colorful stickers to hide the microphones. When not in use, the two microphones and the receiver are contained in a plastic case with onboard LiPo battery charging, just like Airpods. When you are done with them, throw them in the box and they charge ready for the next interview.

 




I genuinely love these microphones, they are much easier to use than clunky wired mics, and I can use them across many different devices without the need for drivers. — Les Pounder

 




Despite the fact that most laptops moved to USB-C charging years ago, PC makers still ship systems with bulky power bricks and permanently attached cables. If you're still lugging one of those around, I implore you to get a small GaN charger instead. If you don't have a gaming laptop, a MacBook Pro, or something else that needs more than 45W for full-speed charging, this slim unit from Baseus might be your best option – especially while it's on sale for just $30.

This pocket-friendly charger is just 0.66 inches thick, with fold-down prongs and two USB ports. The USB-C tops out at 45W and the USB-A can deliver up to 20W.

Smaller than a deck of cards, with fold-down prongs so you can slip it in pretty much any pocket, it's great for traveling. And its long, thin frame does a better job than most chargers of staying in loose hotel-room power outlets. But even if you're just commuting to work or school, this charger is appealing even just for its slim profile and light weight. Its USB-C port can deliver up to 45W for your laptop, while its USB-A port can deliver up to 20W for your smartphone or other portable device.

I'd personally prefer to see two USB-C ports for charging, but then you'd have to remember which one was the higher-power port for your laptop. So I can see why Baseus went with one USB-C and one USB-A port.

We have a plethora of electronics in our home, and typically being the ""IT person"" in the family we are called upon to do all manner of tasks. This year I've recovered lost photos from a hard drive, and repaired a few smartphones for clumsy family members.

This is where a kit, like the Strebito Electronics Precision Screwdriver Set comes into its own.

Torx, Slot, Phillips, Pozi, Hex and many other obscure bits are included in this great set. Spudgers, picks, cleaning cloths, brushes and tweezers are all wrapped up on a travel case ready for the next fix.

All the usual suspects are present. Slot, Pozi, Phillips, Torx, Hex etc. There are also Petalobe, Tri-Wing and nut drivers for those special tasks. There is even a selection of tools for (carefully) prying open electronics and a SIM ejection tool that we typically lose soon after buying a new phone. All of this is contained is a folding case to keep your tools ready for action!

This small kit has all the tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx / Torx security and many others. You also get spudgers and pry tools, tweezers, brush, and a magnetizer / demagnetizer for your screwdriver bits.

If you don't want / need the full 142 piece set, for $9 there is the 64 piece kit which breaks it down to the essentials and folds into a rather lovely hard plastic case.

A go-to screwdriver set for the office, workshop and your go-bag. With all the bits you will need to fix a multitude of problems.

Finally we have HOTO's precision electric screwdriver. I personally own this and have done for the last year. Along with my larger HOTO NEX 01 PRO, these two screwdrivers do 80% of the hard work in my office / workshop. If you are taking stuff apart, or putting it back together, the HOTO precision electric screwdriver will make short work of it. — Les Pounder

If you're questing after an OLED panel, maximum pixel count, and sky-high refresh rates, your monitor will put a huge dent in your wallet. But that doesn't mean you can't get something pretty impressive for under $300. This 34-inch Samsung ViewFinity, for instance, packs a 100 Hz refresh, 3,440 x 1,440 resolution, and game-smoothing variable refresh. And it's back down to just $219, an all-time low price that we haven't seen since July.

This 34-inch ViewFinity monitor from Samsung comes with a 100Hz refresh rate, WQHD (3440 x 1440) resolution, AMD FreeSync, and more. 

 




The ViewFinity S50GC uses a VA panel, which should help deliver good black levels and contrast. But don't expect great off-angle viewing or the best gaming experience. This monitor is more of an all-rounder than a budget gaming screen -- though the 100 Hz refresh and FreeSync support will help keep things smooth while gaming.The 21:9 aspect ratio is nice for productivity, letting you put documents or websites side-by-side while you work. And the 300 nits brightness rating, while certainly not stellar, should be fine for work or play so long as you aren't next to a big window. HDR10 is touted as a feature here, but you can basically write that off, as the screen doesn't get bright enough to actually display HDR content as it was intended. The monitor has two HDMI 2.2 ports and a DisplayPort 1.2 input, and supports picture in picture and picture by picture with multiple inputs, if that's a feature that's important to you. Unlike a lot of ultrawide monitors, this one is a flat panel, rather than curved, which I personally prefer for everything other than gaming.If you're upgrading from an old 24-inch screen or you need a second or third display for work and occasional gaming, this looks to be a great option for the price. You can certainly spend a lot more, but if you aren't a serious gamer and you don't crave the crisp blacks of OLED, you certainly don't have to to get a screen with decent features.

You're busy browsing the internet for the best deals on computer hardware components and peripherals, but what about the smaller things? It's easy to forget about the little things that make up your setup. Prime Day and other sales events are a great time to pick up and refresh that old mouse pad and, more importantly, if you use a keyboard every day for work or gaming, a nice wrist rest.

Do you use a wrist rest? Many people either don't have wrist rests or settle for the included rock-hard slabs of plastic that come attached to many gaming keyboards, and these often don't provide much comfort or support over long typing sessions.

If you spend a significant amount of time on a keyboard, you're risking the chance of developing musculoskeletal disorders and other health issues without support, so do grab a wrist support of some kind; they needn't be expensive.

Measuring 12 inches by 4 inches, this 1-inch thick wrist pad fits compact 60%/75% sized keyboards.  A cloth covering and EVA foam interior provide comfortable, long-lasting wrist support.

Whether it's a Steam Deck, a Switch 2, or just your smartphone, we've all had handheld devices die on us while we'd still prefer to be using them. Baseus' 100W charging cable makes that a little bit easier, with its flat top and angled USB-C port, flat braided cable, and 100W, 5A charging capabilities. Unexpectedly, I've found the cable's flat design and braided texture to be one of its best features.

Want to use your mobile device while it's charging without having to contort your fingers around the USB-C port? Baseus has you covered with its angled, flat-topped braided charging cable. It supports up to 100W and is available in 3.3 or 6.6-foot lengths.

Available in both 3.3-foot and 6.6-foot lengths, the cable can make charging and gaming (or just scrolling on your phone) a lot more comfortable. The shorter model is better if you're charging off a battery pack nearby, but I'd definitely opt for the 6.6-foot model (which costs about $5 more) if you're going to use the cable from a charger plugged into a wall.After taking the Baseus cable on a few trips with long traveling days and plane rides, though, the most handy feature about it for me is that I can always identify it by touch when it's buried in my bag (and often surrounded by other cables). Its flat nature and braided texture mean I know exactly which cable I'm touching. And the flatness means it doesn't tangle or easily get wrapped around other wires or whatever random stuff I've shoved in my backpack while traveling.If that sounds useful to you, I'd highly recommend this cable, especially if you're mobile gamer, as the flat, angled charging end does make holding and using your device while it juice up a lot more comfortable. And with a max throughput of 100W, it will charge your handheld or phone as fast as possible. Just note that the large top of the USB-C port can block adjacent ports or vents on gaming handhelds, so it may not be ideal for your particular use case, so consider port placement before buying. Also, as with most charging cables, this one isn't great for data. While the cable does technically support data transfers, they're capped at pokey USB 2.0 speeds.

 




There's no better way to instantly up your audio game than by switching from a headset mic to a standalone USB gaming microphone, and now's the perfect time to do it: the HyperX QuadCast S, one of our long-time favorite gaming mics, is currently on sale at Amazon for $79.99 — a 50% discount off MSRP, and the lowest price we've ever seen it at.

Lowest ever price

HyperX's QuadCast S is the pretty, colorful version of one of our favorite microphones of all time — and it's currently on sale for 50% off. It features four selectable polar patterns, a built-in shock mount, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute feature, and it will make you sound practically professional right out of the box. 

The QuadCast S features bright, customizable RGB lighting and records sound at 48 kHz / 16-bits. It features four selectable polar patterns — cardioid, stereo, bidirectional, and omnidirectional — so it's great for capturing one person's voice but can also be used to capture multiple voices and/or ambient noise, in a pinch (though you'll still want multiple mics if you're regularly capturing multiple voices). It features on-mic controls, a 3.5mm headphone jack for direct, zero-latency monitoring, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute implementation.

Read our full review of the QuadCast S here.

If you're not too interested in the customizable RGB lighting, you can also pick up the older QuadCast for the same price — $79.99 — but we'd still recommend the QuadCast S as you can always just change the RGB lighting to red (or turn it off completely). Both the QuadCast S and the QuadCast come with a desktop stand and a handy built-in shock mount, and have great sound profiles out of the box.

The TP-Link Archer BE3600 was one of the first truly affordable routers on the market, with a street price of $99 from retailers such as Amazon and Walmart. However, $99 isn't as low as the Archer BE3600 can go, as witnessed by Amazon's latest Prime Day promotion. The router is now priced at just $79, which represents a 20 percent savings.

TP-Link Archer BE3600 is a dual-band Wi-Fi 7 router that offers respectable performance for not a lot of money. It even includes four WAN ports for your wired needs and a USB 3.0 port.

The sub-$100 pricing is achievable partly because the Archer BE3600 is a dual-band router, rather than a tri- or quad-band like more premium Wi-Fi routers. That means you miss out on the higher-performance 6 GHz band, leaving you with the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. However, if you don't have many 6 GHz devices in your home, or you simply don't want to pay at least twice the price for a tri-band router, you can't go wrong with TP-Link's entry-level offering.The router features a 2.5 GbE WAN port, one 2.5 GbE LAN port, and three GbE LAN ports. You'll also find a USB 3.0 port for connecting a storage device (for simple file sharing or as a Time Machine backup for Macs).

 




The Alienware AW3423DWF has perennially been one of our favorite gaming monitors, and for good reason. The monitor has a suggested retail price of $899, but this price has steadily decreased since its introduction three years ago. When we last visited the monitor just over a month ago in late August, it was selling for $549. However, for Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days, the price is even lower at just $521.99.

The Alienware AW3423DWF is available at Amazon for its lowest price to date, which is half its launch price. It has a 34-inch curved QD-OLED panel and is AMD FreeSync Premium Pro certified. It has a resolution of 3440 x 1440 and can reach a refresh rate of 165Hz.

The AW3423DWF is one of our top-rated gaming monitors, and features a 34-inch QD-OLED panel with a 3440 x 1440 resolution, 165 Hz refresh rate, a 0.1 ms response time, 1800R curve and support for AMD FreeSync Pro/Nvidia G-Sync.

The monitor also comes equipped with two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, one HDMI 2.0 port, and a 4-port USB 3.2 hub. — Brandon Hill

 




Anker is no stranger to the charger market, offering a wide variety of product lines to meet your every need. Recently, at IFA 2025, the company launched a new line of Nano charging bricks, and they are already seeing some healthy discounts for those in the market.

We've had the opportunity to test both the 70-watt Nano and the 35-watt Nano chargers. The former retails for $49.99, but is on sale for $39.99. It features three charging ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) and a GaN design, which is why the brick is so compact and power-efficient. If you're charging one device over USB-C, you can reach the maximum output of 70 watts. The USB-A port, on the other hand, has a maximum output of 33W.

The Anker 70W Nano charger includes a foldable plug, two USB-C ports, and a USB-C port. It also includes a 4.9-foot braided USB-C cable.

The Anker 35W Nano charger includes a foldable plug, USB-C port, and an integrated/retractable USB-C cable.

If you're using two ports, you can max out at 60 watts on either of the USB-C ports, with 5W leftover for either the second USB-C port or the USB-A port. If your primary devices only need 45W of power, you'll have 22.5W at your disposal. With three-port charging, you can achieve a maximum of 45W (USB-C) + 7.5W (USB-C) + 7.5W (USB-A). A 4.9-foot braided USB-C cable is also included in the box.

The 35-watt Nano is on sale for $27.99, which is $12 less than its MSRP of $39.99, and is actually slightly larger than its 70-watt sibling. However, there's a reason for its extra girth: it has a built-in, retractable USB-C cable that extends to 2.3 feet. Anker says that the internal mechanism has been tested for 20,000 retractions, while the cable is rated for 20,000 bends. The charger also has a second, run-of-the-mill USB-C port.

Both chargers feature Anker's usual attention to detail and high-quality construction, along with folding power plugs to save even more space in your travel bag. — Brandon Hill

 




Netgear offers an extensive range of Wi-Fi 7 mesh routers that we've covered extensively. They offer good overall performance, a variety of ports, and solid software. However, our primary hangup has been regarding pricing. With Amazon's latest Prime Day at hand, the pricing concerns are being tackled head-on. The company's mainstream Orbi 770 series is now up to 36 percent off, making it a more palatable choice for enthusiasts seeking a tri-band system.

Netgear's Orbi 770 Series offers a compelling mix of features and performance for those seeking a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 mesh router. You'll get 11 Gbps aggregate speeds and a total of four 2.5 GbE ports on the main router.

Netgear's Orbi 770 Series offers a compelling mix of features and performance for those seeking a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 mesh router. You'll get 11 Gbps aggregate speeds and a total of four 2.5 GbE ports on the main router.

The Orbi 770 two-pack typically retails for $649.99, but is currently on sale for $434.99, representing a 33 percent savings. The two-pack covers up to 5,500 square feet. If you need coverage for a much larger home or a small business, the three-pack (8,000 square feet of coverage) is available with a 36 percent discount, bringing the price down to $574.99.

In our testing, the Orbi 770 achieved speeds of around 1.6 Gbps on the 6 GHz band and roughly 1.1 Gbps on the 5 GHz band with uncongested traffic. For wired traffic, you'll find a 2.5 GbE WAN and three 2.5 GbE LAN ports on the router, while each satellite has two 2.5 GbE LAN ports. — Brandon Hill

I've needed a keyboard for my new standing desk for several weeks, but I held out to find a steal during Prime Big Deals Day. This year hasn't disappointed, with several models available at deep discounts.

An all-time low, and half price 

The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless combines a multitude of winning features in a sturdy but compact chassis. This version is wireless and doesn't have a keypad. Its customizable dual-actuation OmniPoint 2.0 hall effect switches, OLED display, bright per-key RGB lighting, and flexible connectivity help it stand out from the pack.

I just pulled the trigger on this ten-keyless Apex Pro model with HyperMagnetic switches so I can get a taste of that Hall Effect action. This model scored four out of five stars in our in-depth review. I'm eager to put the dual-actuation point system, dubbed OmniPoint 2.0, to the test. This system allows one key to trigger two different actions, depending on how far down you press it, all of which are completely user-configurable in software. Sweet!

The board comes with a 2.4GHz wireless USB-C dongle, a USB-C extender, and is also Bluetooth 5 compliant. The board also touts up to 40 hours of on-battery use. The company also includes a braided seven-foot USB-C to USB-A cable for charging.

This wired keyboard has Cherry MX Red switches and features 8000Hz Hyper-Polling. 

The SteelSeries Apex Pro combines a multitude of winning features in a sturdy but compact chassis. This version is wired and has a numpad. Its customizable dual-actuation OmniPoint 2.0 hall effect switches, OLED display, bright per-key RGB lighting, and flexible connectivity help it stand out from the pack.

The full size wired version, which includes a keypad, is also on sale right now. Also, if you're looking for other more standard fare, there's a competitively-priced K70 RGB Pro from Corsair, which touts Cherry MX Red switches and 8000 Hz polling, on offer for $105, or 28% off. — Paul Alcorn

If the imminent loss of Windows 10 support (in a matter of just a few days now) is closing in on you, then you might be on the hunt for a productivity-focused laptop. Luckily, there are a variety of deals on the latest Windows laptops and Macs available today and tomorrow.

The MacBook Pro with the base M4 chip adds a fan for better sustained performance. You also get a 512GB SSD, a far superior mini LED display, and far more ports than the MacBook Air. 

This 13-inch MacBook Air uses Apple's latest chip, M4, without a fan for silent operation. It comes with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and is available in the new ""sky blue"" color. This is the lowest price we've seen for this system.

Price Check: $799 at Best Buy

The Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 is a convertible laptop with premium specs, including an Intel Core Ultra 7 CPU, a 2880 x 1800 touchscreen, an included stylus, and a 1TB SSD.

All of these laptops have 16GB of memory, so you won't be left wanting to open more tabs...at least outside of extreme cases. These latest Windows and Mac machines also all feature the much-touted AI feature sets, with Copilot+ for Windows PCs and Apple Intelligence for Macs. — Paul Alcorn

Some deals are timeless. Well...kinda. This Samsung monitor was a popular item when it was on sale last year, and it is now back at a shockingly good price on Amazon.

This 27-inch 1080p Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. But it sports a 180 Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and FreeSync variable refresh. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best.  

The 1080p Samsung Odyssey G3 G30D features a 32-inch VA panel that supports a 180 Hz refresh rate and a 1ms response time. It comes equipped with one DisplayPort 1.4 and one HDMI 2.0 input. Amazon says this gaming monitor is on a limited sale, so you'll have to act soon if you want to get a relatively large sized VA panel at this exceptionally low pricing. — Paul Alcorn

All time low

Get the Creality K2 at its lowest-ever price of just $1,049. Print in four colors and get great features like auto bed levelling and dual AI cameras for advanced monitoring. 

The Creality K2 Plus is the best 3D printer there is. Hands down. Now you can buy one on Amazon at an all-time low price of $1,409, fully 25% off MSRP.

Our number one 3D printer is a color FDM number with a PEI Spring Steel Sheet platform and fully automatic bed leveling. It comes with a 4.3-inch color touch screen, with support for LAN, Creality Cloud, and USB Flash Drive connectivity. We love it for its large volume and enclosure for high-temperature printing, as well as the auto bed leveling. It'll print in four colors and is an easy-to-use printer right out of the box. It also features quiet fans and a carbon filtration system, making it ideal for home or office. - Stephen Warwick

We have just launched our article on the Best MicroSD Express Cards for Nintendo Switch 2, featuring the first in-depth benchmarking and testing of the top cards on the market. We found that the Lexar Play Pro 1TB is the fastest card on the market, and now it has a 15% discount for Amazon Prime Big Deals day. Here are our findings:

This card is the fastest microSD Express card on the market. The 1TB capacity card massively increases the storage of the Nintendo Switch 2.  Higher transfer speeds mean up to 900/600 MB/s read/write. But it does command a premium price for the privilege. 

As we noted in our buying guide, ""The Lexar Play Pro 1TB is the best 1TB microSD Express card for the Switch 2, and it was also one of the first to launch. It's an excellent choice if you seek the highest capacity currently available. This card is available at the major U.S. retailers, thus offering greater convenience compared to some other brands. Additionally, Lexar's limited lifetime warranty enhances the product's appeal by ensuring that your investment is consistently safeguarded. These benefits come at a higher price, though. The Lexar Play Pro 1TB retails for approximately 16% above the GameStop 1TB card with similar characteristics.""

Here's a snippet of some of our testing, and as you can see, the Lexar 1TB card pulls out on top of the other competing 1TB cards.

This 512GB capacity card is double the size of the onboard storage of the Nintendo Switch 2.  Higher transfer speeds mean up to 900/600 MB/s read/write.



This 256GB capacity card is the same size as the onboard storage of the Nintendo Switch 2.  Up to 900/600 MB/s read/write speeds. 



The 256GB and 512GB models for this microSD Express card are also on sale, too. We have a feeling this deal won't last long, so if you're a new Switch 2 owner, the time to act is now. — Paul Alcorn

Not only is the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K discounted during Prime Day, but the Ultra 7 265K also just got a hefty discount, and is now just $246. That's nearly $15 cheaper than its previous low, and fully 39% ($158) off its usual price.

All-time low price 

Often overshadowed by AMD, the Intel Core range starts to make a lot more sense with a hefty discount. Get a 20-core CPU with eight performance cores and 12 efficiency cores, with clock speeds of up to 5.5GHz and a 36MB cache. 

As you can see, the Core 7 sits below a lot of rivals in general gaming performance, including some older 14th-gen Intel gear. However, general multi-threaded performance is considerably better, and single-threaded performance on Windows 11 is some of the best we've ever tested, behind only the aforementioned Core 9 285K.

So if you're looking for an LGA 1851 build but don't want to fork out on a Core Ultra 9, then this might be the processor for you this Prime Day - Stephen Warwick

If you're looking for a little extra storage for your Nintendo Switch 2 handheld gaming console, then here are two deals on microSD Express cards that are available at the moment. PNY is offering its 128GB microSD Express card for just $33.24, a saving of $6.75 from its usual selling price of $44.99. The 128GB is the smallest variant of the PNY range of microSD Express cards, but still large enough to pack several games on.

The PNY fast flash memory cards have near SSD speeds with up to 890MB/s read and 550MB/s write. They are fast enough that you can run the latest Switch 2 games directly from the card, without having to transfer or download games directly to the internal storage of the handheld.

PNY's flash card has fast PCIe 3x1 storage speeds with up to 890MB/s read and 550MB/s write, perfect for loading games off of to play on the Nintendo Switch 2. 

Grab half a terabyte of storage with this 512GB microSD Express card from Addlink. Ample speeds of 880MB/s read and 750MB/s write mean more time playing games and less time loading, with smoother game streaming. 

For a larger microSD Express card, Addlink is offering its 512GB card for just $99.44, saving $10 from its $109.44 total. With PCIe 3 x 1 speeds of 880MB/s read and 750MB/s write, this card has the speeds to be able to play games directly off of the card, a requirement for SD cards on the Switch 2. — Stewart Bendle

It's hard to find a cheap graphics card that's actually worth buying these days, but the Intel Arc B570 pulls it off. It's recently been possible to find these cards for Intel's $219 MSRP, but Amazon will do you even better during its Prime Big Deal Days event. It's knocking $10 off Sparkle's Guardian OC Edition Arc B570, bringing this card down to just $209.

Intel's Arc B570 is one of the only cheap graphics cards worth buying, and at just $209 from Amazon during Prime Big Deal Days, it's even more attainable than ever.

 




The Arc B570 can manage a solid 60 FPS experience even at 1920x1080 and ultra settings in some of today's most popular games, but we'd really recommend dialing settings back to high presets and enabling XeSS where it's available for the smoothest ride. This Arc card's 10GB of VRAM is nice insurance against more VRAM-hungry games in this oft-neglected segment of the GPU market. As a bonus, it doesn't demand a lot of power, and it runs cool and quiet. Just make sure your system supports Resizable BAR, and you'll enjoy a fine gaming experience on the cheap. - Jeff Kampman

Elegoo's Centauri Carbon is a capable and low-cost Core XY 3D printer that is both a work horse and detailed 3D printer. How can I say this with confidence? Because I bought one back in April 2025 and I've been using it ever since!

A high-speed, Core XY 3D printer for a low price was once the thing of dreams, but it is now a reality. A generous 256 x 256 x 256 build volume and fully enclosed print area make the Centauri Carbon a potent 3D printer for those on a budget.

In our review, we loved the speed and precision that such a low-cost Core XY printer provided. But going further than the review, I can attest that this is a great printer because I put it through its paces to 3D print an entire NAS case for an Intel N100 powered file server. Using multiple rolls of Elegoo's Rapid PETG filament, I printed every part of the case, including some scarily large pieces that took the best part of a day to print. The Elegoo Centauri Carbon worked great, every single time! I've only ever had two print fails. One was caused by me not cleaning the print bed, the other was a fault in the Gcode that saw the print head knock over the print.

The Elegoo Centauri Carbon is a fully enclosed 3D printer, which means it can print filaments such as PETG and ABS without fear of warping. The enclosure does not have any in-chamber heating, but the 256 x 256 build plate can hit 110C, heating the chamber in the process. The brass-hardened steel nozzle can hit 320C and the extruder moves at 500mm/s and accelerates at 20,000mm/s², with a flow rate of 32mm³/s. What does all that mean? It means it is fast and can handle a range of filaments. From common PLA to tougher Polycarbonate filament, the Elegoo Centauri Carbon can handle it.

Sending prints to the Elegoo Centauri Carbon is simple, using Elegoo Slicer, a fork of Orcaslicer our computer connects to the printer via Wi-Fi, and we slice and send the prints over to the printer and then sit back and relax. Prints are then stored on the Centauri Carbon and can be selected via the rather lovely and intuitive touchscreen.

Seasoned 3D printer users will be calling out the lack of multi-color printing. But, fear not! Elegoo has announced that a mutli-color print attachment is coming soon, and it will connect directly to the Centauri Carbon, making this printer an expandable, low cost workhorse that produces excellent prints, in very little time. — Les Pounder

 




If you're on the hunt for a new gaming controller for your PC and or Xbox, then take a look at this deal on GameSir's G7 Pro controller. At a price point that pales in comparison to the official Xbox controllers, like the Elite Series 2 Core Wireless gaming controller ($129), the GameSir G7 Pro in a shadow ember color looks gorgeous with its semi-translucent shell, TMR joysticks, and hall effect triggers.

Available for sale at Best Buy in their Techtober sale, the GameSir G7 Pro controller for Xbox and PC is reduced to $69.99. You're able to save $10 off the list price of $79.99, which you can then put towards a game to use your new controller on.

The GameSir G7 Pro uses the latest and greatest tech inside for improved control in your games. Features like TMR joysticks eliminate issues such as “stick-drift,” and compared to hall-effect sticks, they suffer less from interference, have smaller magnets, and also use less power, whilst keeping the same levels of precision. The triggers use analog hall-effect switches that feature clicky micro-switch trigger stops. There are even four rumble motors, one in each handgrip and one in each trigger, plenty of haptic feedback for in-game events.

Stick-drift is a thing of the past with the latest TMR Joysticks that make up part of the G7 Pro's feature set. Hall-effect trigger switches, micro switches on the D-Pad, and ABXY buttons, plus tri-mode connectivity with 1000Hz polling on wired and 2.4GHz connections. A handy charging dock keeps your controller powered up for the next gaming session. 

Pair the controller wirelessly or wired with your PC, Xbox, or Android device via tri-mode connectivity options. Use the convenient physical mode switch to select wired, 2.4GHz, or Bluetooth, and experience a 1000Hz polling rate on PC via both wired & 2.4GHz connections.

The G7 Pro comes with a smart auto start-stop charging station with a 1200mAh built-in battery, a cable retainer, extra D-pads, a 3-meter USB-C cable, receiver, and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate card. — Stewart Bendle

 




I build a lot of PCs for work, and I also do a fair bit of home improvement work around my apartment. So a cordless screwdriver is a handy tool to have. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found Hoto's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also great for assembling furniture.The Hoto won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench.

Hoto's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. It's even proven quite durable, as I've dropped it off of ladders and my workbench at least a dozen times, and it's still working flawlessly. Make sure to enter the brand promotion code of O1KPKFEH8IBJ for the extra 10% off.

I reach for the Hoto screwdriver so often, that I recently give it prime placement on my Mulitiboard tool wall, across from my work bench. I've used it while up on ladders and dropped it multiple times over the last 2.5 years, and it's continued to work without issue for the past 2.5 years since I've owned it, which is more than I can say for some of the tech I use regularly.

 




The Olight IMINI2 EDC flashlight doesn't have many features. It really doesn't need them! Designed to be simple to use and simple to charge, this flashlight is ready when you need it and now it is at an all-time low price!

This compact and easy to use flashlight provides 50 Lumens of light, without the need to fiddle around for a button. Just unclip, and your flashlight is ready to light your way.

Operating the Olight IMINI2 is easy, just pull the flashlight from the holster and it turns on, put it back and it turns off. The trick is the magnetic holster / base which also double as a USB Type A charging port. Put the flashlight into any USB Type A port and it will charge up. The magnetic base of the flashlight also means it can be stuck to any ferrous metal, like a PC case, to give you hands-free illumination while you carry out a task.

I've got one of these in a 3D printed toolkit that I made earlier this year. It is so handy and I have used it heavily for PC tasks, home DIY and taking the trash out on dark nights. Sure it doesn't have a means to focus the light, but it just works and gets me out of a pinch without any hassle.

With modern Wi-Fi, there are plenty of speedy options these days for fast wireless networks. But of course, nothing beats wired connectivity for stability and getting around (rather than through) pesky things like concrete, stone, metal, and brick. And thanks to this deal at Amazon, you can connect your packet-hungry devices up to super-fast 10 Gigabit Ethernet for an all-time low price of $199.

The TL-SX105 is a 5-port unmanaged 10GbE switch that's passively cooled and wrapped in a metal shell. Unlike some cheaper switches that advertise 10Gb speeds, all five of the ports here are the full 10 Gigabits, letting you sling your packets as fast as possible to several devices on your network.

The TP-Link TL-SX105 isn't exactly new. In fact, we wrote about it back in 2021, alongside the larger 8-port TL-SX1008. But this is the lowest price we've seen it sell for on Amazon, by $30. Of course, you'll also need 10GbE devices to take full advantage of this switch's speed, so you may want to look into a new 10-gig NIC if you need to get a desktop PC up to speed. Some of those are also on sale, with a Trendnet model selling for $69 and TP-Link's own TX401 selling for $74.Of course, you'll also likely need to run new CAT6 cables, especially if you're upgrading from Gigabit Ethernet, so consider that part of the expense and effort. No one said upgrading to the fastest home Ethernet tech was going to be easy, but once it's all up and running at a theoretical max speed of 1.25 gigabytes per second, you'll be glad you didn't cheap out and go for something comparatively pokey, like 2.5GbE.

Bambu Lab's first foray in to low cost budget 3D printers is a knockout!The A1 Mini is what it says, mini. The 180 x 180 x 180mm build volume is much smaller than the norm, but that is not a bad thing.

We gave the Bambu Lab A1 Mini the Editor's Choice award back on 2023, so with that recommendation and $50 off the MSRP, you should really just buy it!

This popular compact printer is solidly built with a full-metal linear rail system and bearings, features full auto calibration, vibration and flow-rate compensation, and compatibility with multi-color AMS accessories. 

Work next to the printer without distraction, thanks to the low noise ""silent mode"" that lets the A1 print at under 48 decibels of noise.  

Check out our review of the Bambu Lab A1 mini.

Is is expensive? No, the original $299 price tag was good, but now at $249 it is excellent.

is it easy to assemble? It arrives 95% assembled, with just a few screws to remove before you get started.

Ease of use?The touchscreen is simple to use and is only really used when loading new filament or when printing an object from micro SD. Most of the time the screen just shows the print status, or if you should encounter an error, it displays a QR code that you can scan to learn how to fix the issue. Typically, your 3D prints are sent to the A1 mini via Bambu Lab's custom slicer, Bambu Slicer, which is a fork of OrcaSlicer. You load up the print, click on the slice option and then send it over Wi-Fi to the A1 Mini.

High quality prints?Yes! In our review we tested PLA, PETG and TPU and all three came out well. Details were sharp, little or no layer lines were present, and stringing was at a minimum, especially for TPU. Our reviewer, Denise Bertacchi ran a ""speed benchy"", a small tug boat toy that tests detail, overhangs, cooling and printer tolerances. In her test, Bertacchi recorded a 19m 15s benchy, that is really fast. My Elegoo Centauri Carbon manages 15 minutes, my older Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro, 44 minutes!The build volume may be small, but this little printer is fast and produces great looking prints.

Easy to maintain?The A1 Mini has its own calibration tests for bed leveling and Z-offset (how far the nozzle is from the print bed). We no longer need to slide a piece of paper under different areas of the build plate to guesstimate the Z-offset! Should you need to replace the nozzle, it is a cinch to remove the nozzle heat break and cooling fins which are held in place with magnets. Put the new unit in and you are good to go.

We're starting to see the monitor deals heat up as we approach the official start of the Amazon Prime Big Deals Day event within hours. Here we have two Samsung monitors, the 49"" Odyssey G9 Gaming Monitor with a refresh rate of up to 240Hz and the decidedly smaller, yet more affordable 32-inch Odyssey G30D 180Hz Gaming Monitor.

This 49"" curved gaming monitor is certified by AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. It has a dense resolution of 5120 x 1440px and a refresh rate reaching as high as 240Hz. 

This 27-inch Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. But it sports a 180 Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and FreeSync variable refresh. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best.  

Head to our Best Prime Day gaming monitor deals 2025 article for even more options that are on sale at deep discounts.

Scoring the fastest CPU in the world, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, just got a bit cheaper with this fantastic bundle deal.

MSI has some great bundles on offer, and this AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, MAG X870 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard, and 2TB MSI Spatium M480 Pro SSD are all available as a bundle for just $738.99. There are no codes or coupons, but you do need to add the add the 9800X3D and the 2TB Spatium M480 Pro to the combination bundle by selecting them from the drop down menus.

MSI's combo deal pairs the MSI MAG X870 Tomahawk with AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor and a 2TB Gen 4 PCIe Spatium M480 Pro SSD (you must add the items to the dropdown menu). With unrivaled gaming prowess, the 9800X3D is the ultimate gaming CPU.

These three components typically cost a total of around $907, so this is a steal by any measure. Also, you don't have to select the SSD, so you can trim off around $100 and bring this bundle down to $639.99. This deal won't last long, so make sure to jump on it if you're after the fastest CPU for gaming. — Paul Alcorn

Cheap and Deep storage keeps getting deeper...and cheaper

We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Big Deal Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage.

This drive is specifically designed for PC use, featuring a 7,200-RPM spindle speed, 512MB of cache, a top speed of 190MB/s due to its desirable CMR technology, and a two-year warranty. 

The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. The drive also utilizes the premium Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology, rather than the performance-killing Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) technology found on budget drives. So you're getting the good stuff. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity beats speed every time. — Paul Alcorn

Handheld gaming consoles like the Steam Deck or Xbox ROG Ally (X) demand copious amounts of storage for the latest game titles, so they're hungry for more storage. We found three of the diminutive 2230 M.2 SSDs on sale for Prime Big Deals Day, and two of them are even on our list of the best SSDs for the Steam Deck and other gaming handhelds.

The Crucial P310 2TB is among the best M.2-2230 SSDs that we've ever tested. Earning a four-star mark from our reviewer for its speed and capacity, the P310 2TB is a great pick at list price, and is a must-consider now that it's nearly 50% off. 

The SN770M, our ""portable gaming king"" at the time of its four-star review, is a very attractive option for those shopping for tiny storage. Bringing TLC memory to the 2230 form factor, the SN770M is a shockingly fast little thing that outshines almost any other 1TB drive in its class.

For those looking for the absolute cheapest upgrade for a Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, or any other handheld PC, the Kingston NV3 is your pick. Down to its lowest-yet price of $65.80, the budget SSD got solid marks from us (in its longer 2280 trim) for its budget stature, and its price somehow matches those of full-sized M.2 SSDs today. 

The Crucial P310 2TB 2230 has hit its lowest-ever price at $121.99, 49% off the list price. If you don't need that much space, the 1TB WD Black SN770M is 39% off ($85.49), and the 1TB Kingston NV3 at an excellent $65.80.

You can read more details about these drives here. — Paul Alcorn

The fact of the matter is that 8GB of VRAM simply doesn't suffice for some of today's most demanding titles, so upgrading to a 16GB model is always optimal if you have the budget to spare. That makes the ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB a tasty upgrade, especially with $50 off during Newegg's Fantastech II sale.

The ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB is $50 off, featuring competitive 1080p and 1440p gaming performance with its 4,096 shader cores and 16GB of VRAM.

This mid-range RX 9070 card comes armed with the RDNA 4 architecture, 4,096 shader cores, 2.97GHz boost clock, 64 MB of L2 cache, and 16GB of VRAM that communicates across a 256-bit interface.

The RX 9070 16GB delivers solid gaming performance at 1080p and 1440p, often outperforming the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 in our suite of rasterized benchmarks, with an 11% lead across our test suite at 4K. That said, the competition between the two cards is brisk. You can read more about the pitched battle in our Nvidia RTX 5070 vs AMD RX 9070 Face Off.

The 8TB WD_Black SN850X is a beast of an SSD, offering up more than enough storage for the majority of users. This drive is a favorite on our list of Best SSDs, and it has now dropped to $515.98, which is a mere six cents per gigabyte of storage.

The WD_Black SN850X 8TB is a high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSD with outstanding performance. It offers a combination of speed and capacity, making it an excellent choice for a primary or secondary drive. Make sure to add the Montech Metal Pro 12 case fan to your basket to get the total saving.

The SN850X wields the PCIe 4.0 interface, not the newer PCIe 5.0, but that serves up more than enough performance for most casual users. With peak sequential read/write speeds reaching 7,200/6,600 MB/s and performance in 4K random workloads weighing in at up to 1.2 million read/write IOPS, this drive has both copious throughput for file transfers and the agility to load games and applications quickly.

The WD_Black SN850X offers up to 4,800 TB of write endurance, which should be enough for all but professional users, and comes with a five-year warranty. — Paul Alcorn

The refresh rate wars in the gaming monitor segment show no signs of subsiding, with manufacturers now pushing out 600+ Hz offerings for those who are frame rate-obsessed. However, the emergence of these new overachievers means that slightly less performant, but more mature models, are seeing some notable price reductions—case in point: the 24-inch Alienware AW2524HF.

The AW2524HF tops out at “only” 500 Hz, which should be more than enough for even the most discerning eSports gamers. And best of all, the monitor is priced at just $399.99 direct from Dell, which is $200 off its regular asking price.

This super-high refresh rate monitor can display up to a 500Hz refresh rate in games that can support it, and of course, if you have a graphics card capable of pumping those numbers. The Alienware AW2524HF has a 25-inch IPS panel with a 1920 × 1080 (FHD) pixel resolution. This monitor is marketed toward serious esports players who prefer the faster frames in games like Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, and Valorant. 

That price gets you a solidly built monitor, a colorful Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel, and excellent responsiveness to satisfy your quick-twitch movements when hunting your prey online. AMD FreeSync is supported, and the monitor is also Nvidia G-Sync compatible. On the connectivity front, you'll find two DisplayPort 1.4 connectors along with a single HDMI 2.1 port. You won't find integrated speakers on the AW2524HF, but it does have an integrated USB 3.2 hub with four downstream ports.

 




We gave the Alienware AW2524HF 4.5 out of 5 stars when we reviewed it back in October 2023, and our overall assessment of the monitor holds true to this day. When we reviewed the monitor, it was priced at $650, so the new $399.99 price makes it even more of a no-brainer purchase for elite gamers – as long as you have the necessary hardware to maximize the AW2524HF's potential. — Brandon Hill

When we recently reviewed the GeForce RTX 5050, we thought its performance was reasonable enough in many of today's most popular games at 1080p, but we felt it needed to be somewhat cheaper in order to be a good buy compared to the more capable RTX 5060. Newegg is getting us some of the way there today by cutting MSI's Shadow take on the RTX 5050 to $239, or $10 off Nvidia's MSRP.

Get $10 off MSI's Shadow GeForce RTX 5050 graphics card and enjoy solid gaming experiences at 1080p. This is a rare opportunity to purchase an Nvidia Blackwell-powered card for less than MSRP. 

 




Every dollar counts in budget PC builds, and $10 saved on the graphics card can reduce the bottom line of a parts list or contribute to a component upgrade elsewhere.

For your cash, you're getting a reasonably power-efficient graphics card with solid baseline performance at 1080p in most of today's most popular games, plus access to Blackwell-exclusive features like Multi-Frame Generation that can boost your experience even further—at least as long as you can stay within this card's 8GB of VRAM.

MSI's Shadow version of the RTX 5050 boasts twin fans, a clean black fan shroud, four display outputs, and a conveniently placed power connector for easy building and a sharp-looking setup. We'd be happy to have it in a cost-conscious gaming build.

If you've been holding onto an old flash drive, modern models have come a long way, both in terms of performance and capacity. And the SK hynix Tube T31 is the best flash drive we've tested, thanks in large part to the fact that it's actually a tiny M.2 SSD attached to a USB plug. And it delivers about the best performance you get over a 10 Gbps connector, as we saw when we tested the 1TB model.

The Tube T31 may look like a flash drive, with its integrated USB-A port, and it is our favorite flash drive. But it's actually a tiny M.2 SSD on the end of a USB port, and it's a great performer for a 10 Gbps drive. Combine that with a record-low price for this 2TB model, and this is a great deal for those needing speedy, convenient storage.  

 




As you can see in our benchmark chart above, the Tube T31 was the fastest flash drive we tested back when we reviewed it in 2024, and it remains one of our top picks today. In fact, one of our main gripes when we reviewed the drive was that there was no 2TB option. But since then, the company has rectified the issue, and it's now on sale at Amazon in that roomy capacity. If you're looking for a speedy, pocket-friendly drive at a great price, the Tube T31 is easy to recommend -- especially at this $118 sale price. The only real downside is that it's USB-A only. The company doesn't offer a USB-C model, which could be a pain if you have a modern laptop that doesn't have USB-A ports. But the USB-A connection also makes the Tube T31 a good option for external console storage.

A full price Intel's Ultra 9 285K CPU is a tough sell, but at just $489 — $110 off — it becomes a much more enticing proposition. You can grab one for cheap right now at Amazon thanks to this deal.

All-time low price 

The Intel Core Ultra 7 285K is at an all-time low price, finally making it a worthy purchase against the competition. This 24-core processor has 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores with 24 threads. The 5.7 GHz P-core and 4.6 GHz E-core boost clocks enable it to perform at the top end in gaming and multithreaded applications. 

Here's how the 285K stacks up against some of the top processors on the market right now. As you can see, at full price it's very hard to justify, but a friendlier price tag goes someway to alleviate that. — Stephen Warwick

Last week, Logitech graced us with the return of the MX Master, its flagship productivity mouse, back for its fourth iteration. New for 2025 are haptic feedback and an ""Action Ring"" menu. While it's a little heavier than its predecessor, all the signs so far are good, with the MX Master 4 sharing the DNA of the previous model. Imagine our surprise when we woke up and found a $30 discount on this brand new mouse this morning.

A huge 25% off the brand new MX Master 4 to rival Amazon Prime Day, replete with haptic feedback, adjustable sensitivity, and a Magspeed scroll wheel. 

AI data centers are swallowing the world's memory and storage supply, setting the stage for a pricing apocalypse that could last a decade. Tariffs and geopolitical issues also threaten to push prices higher in the coming months. That means prices will go up significantly over the coming months.

Luckily, for now, there are significant discounts available on 4TB and 8TB SSD models, which continue to offer prices of 5 cents per GB on the best-value drives. You can peruse the list below and click on the bold blue price text in the table to see the deals:

All the kit that you need, now for less!

Soldering is a great skill. Whether you are taking your first steps, or you are a seasoned pro, I've compiled a list of the absolute essentials that you need to get started or upgrade your setup, and they are all on offer for Amazon Prime Big Deals Day.

You need a good soldering iron, well, I'm suggesting a couple. One is smart, the other is fancy. Do you need help soldering? I've got the helping hands for you. You'll need solder; I've got two that will do the job. I've also got two recommendations to protect your workbench from stray heat and your lungs from nasty fumes.

Here are a few of the standout deals from the Amazon Prime Big Deals Day event, which is currently taking place. Our list of best overall picks continues below.

 




I paid for my Fnirsi HS-01 with my own money after spotting a deal about two years ago. Hands down, this is a great soldering iron for those of us who travel and need a soldering iron that we can take with us. The USB-C interface, when used with the included power supply or a power bank capable of 65W output, is ideal for easy soldering, eliminating the need to search for a DC jack and corresponding outlet. I'll admit, the flexibility of both a DC and USB-C jack is nice to have, but there are now so many USB-C PD power banks, you aren't in the same bind as nomadic soldering iron users were a few years ago.

The Fnirsi HS-01 is a great soldering iron and well worth the money for those of us who solder in our workshop or in the field.

This kit comes obviously comes with the soldering iron, but we also get a 96W power supply for your country, a high-quality USB-C cable (it feels really weighty and doesn't tangle), stand and finally a selection of soldering iron tips for precision soldering and larger tips for those times when we need to lay down the heat.

The soldering iron tips, which I paid extra for, but I found them to be great. They insert into the HS-01 with ease, locking into place using a collet. Please remember to do this when the soldering iron is cold. We've all seen the memes!

Controlling the Fnirsi HS-01 is all about the buttons and OLED screen. Set your temperature, and the HS-01 will get up to the target temperature in seconds. Are you left or right-handed? The HS-01 has you covered and can easily switch between the two.

The OLED display is crisp and gets the relevant information to you with the slightest of glances. Next to the display are two buttons. They serve a dual purpose. To control the temperature of the soldering iron tip (all the way to 420C / 788F) and to navigate the on-screen display. I tested the Fnirsi HS-01 and it got to 350C in nine seconds! That is excellent news for when you need to quickly solder something.

The Fnirsi HS-01 is a great all-rounder and worthy of a space on your workbench and in your go bag. Grab this offer while you can!

You've built a business from your soldering skills; now you need a desktop soldering station with hot air rework to go to the next level. The Yihua 995D+ hot air rework station is something that I have personally tested, and for the money, you get a solid soldering station that will get the job done.

A great selection of soldering tips, a large LCD screen, clear controls and a bonus hot air rework wand make the Yihua 995D+ the best option for those who solder for a living.

The Yihua 995D+ soldering iron and hot air rework reaches 480C (896F), more than enough power to solder and reflow even the heaviest solder joint. This soldering station has excellent thermal properties, and you'll be soldering speaker wire with ease!

The soldering stand is separated from the main station, giving left and right-handed users free access to the soldering iron and reducing the amount of cables trailing across the workbench. The soldering station control unit has three channels, essentially pre-set temperatures for quickly moving from one type of job to another. The soldering iron has a great feel, with a non-slip coating and flexible silicone cord to reduce accidental melting. The included tips range from precision soldering to heavy tips for larger soldering projects.

The hot air gun also feels good in the hand and has a similar cable. Controlling the iron and hot air can be a little tricky at first, as the correct controls must be selected (on the left are the hot air controls, on the right are the soldering iron controls) before using the central knob to set the temperature and airflow.

The Yihua 995D+ is an excellent soldering station for both beginners and pros alike. It gets the job done, looks good, and keeps more cash in your pocket.

If all that you need is a reliable and compact desktop soldering station, the Yihua 939D+ is for you.

This compact soldering station has a temperature range of 392F to 896F (200C to 480C) and comes with a selection of soldering tips to cover many different use cases (precision and bulky solder joints). The unit has 75W of power, making it suitable for heavier solder joints like speaker cables. To control the power, use the dial, the LED seven segment display will show the temperature allowing you to dial in your exact preference.

The soldering iron is the typical Yihua unit and it is very comfy to use. Add to this, a freestanding soldering iron stand, and a brass tip cleaner, and you've got a lovely soldering setup for a low price!

A solid and dependable soldering station that reduces the cost by omitting hot air rework functionality. This is a soldering station that I could personally use all day, everyday!

Soldering can be a tricky task, and you always need an extra pair of hands, and this is where helping hands come in handy.

Soldering veterans will know the metal armature and magnifying glass combo that we all owned at some point in our lives. But this set of helping hands is a little different because it comes as a magnetic base, clips and posts that grip your PCB as you solder.

With five alligator clips and six posts designed to hold your PCB firmly to the magnetic base, your hands are free to concentrate on soldering up your next project.

Measuring 29 x 18 centimetres, this magnetic helping hands kit will hold your PCB as you solder, and you have a choice as to how it holds it. The five flexible alligator clips are used to clamp and hold a PCB a little nearer to the user. The flexibility of the armatures means that both sides of the PCB can be easily seen and accessed for soldering. If you need more rigidity, the six posts are used to clamp the edge of the PCB, as if they were nibbling into it. These are useful for when you are soldering just one side of a board.

The magnetic base means that you can place the posts and clamps anywhere on the base to accommodate the size of your PCB. This is a must buy for the jobbing maker.

Lead-free solder is pretty much the standard these days. Any electronic device contains components soldered to the PCB via lead-free solder. Why? Because it has been deemed safer than the more traditional leaded solder. If incorrectly disposed of, lead solder can leach into the ground and cause environmental issues. So lead-free is the safest option should you plan to sell your products to the public.

Lead-free solder is better for the environment, and it means you can build and sell products that are built using it.

A mix of 99% tin, 0.3% silver and 0.7% copper, this 1.2mm diameter solder has a flux rosin core so it flows neatly around your solder joints.

But there is still a case for leaded solder. If you are building projects for yourself, then you are free to use whatever solder you wish. I personally use Loctite 0.8mm 63/38 (60% tin and 40% lead) with a flux core. It has never let me down. Sadly, 250G of this solder is around $60 in the U.S. and it will last a long time, but that is big chunk of cash for solder. The 63/37 ratio of this solder is a good mix. It should flow well at 350C, and produce lovely, shiny solder joints.

Lead solder is still great, and this 0.8mm rosin core 63/38 tin / lead mix melts great and produces shiny and reliable solder joints.

Your workbench has seen plenty of mishaps. Slipped screwdrivers, drills, nails, and now the hot tip of a soldering iron. But fear not! Your workbench is saved by a silicone soldering mat.

This silicone repair mat will keep your workbench free from scratches and soldering iron burns. The included magnetic pads and screw organizer will make sure every screw goes back in at the end.

Silicone soldering mats are nothing new, but they are essential. They keep the heat of your soldering iron away from the workbench, and they often come with positions to hold screws, and magnets to stop things running off the bench. When you are taking apart a laptop, these screw holders can be used to identify where they were removed from.

When you are done, you just roll up the mat and put it away, ready for the next soldering session.

Soldering produces fumes, no matter what solder you use. The moment the hot tip hits the solder, a plume of smoke emanates and heads straight for you. But not if you have a fume extractor!

Keep your lungs healthy by removing the flux fumes and solder smoke from the air. This tiltable solder fume extractor works from up to five inches away and pulls the offensive fumes through an activated carbon filter to keep the air fresh. You get extra filters in the box

Fume extractors are largely just a big fan that sucks the smoke and fumes from the air, into an activated carbon filter with the cleaner air exiting the back. This extractor will pull the nasty flux fumes from the air, keeping your lungs safer. With a high speed RPM fan speed, you get high suction from up to five inches away, plenty of distance for you to solder in comfort. The fenders on the left and right of the extraction fan prevent draughts / breezes from moving the fumes away from the unit.

Four rubber feet mean this extractor will stay where you put it. The locking tilt mechanism means you can position this exactly where it is needed.

Amazon Prime Big Deals Day is back, and we've compiled a list of 13 cool and budget-friendly gadgets and gizmos that you can still get for under $13.

We've got kits to fix PCs, cleaning kits for your filthy keyboard, a network switch, adapters, cables, and many more sub-$13 products that we found on Amazon. Best of all, we have grouped them up so you can go straight to the section that you need.

We all need cables for our lives. To charge our phones, laptops, headphones, etc. We also need adapters for those cables because one day we are going to be given an obscure piece of tech and asked to fix it.

A full 1-meter (3.3FT) USB Type C to USB Type C cable that supports up to 100W is always useful. But this retractable cable from Baseus keeps things neat and tidy. Throw it in your bag and don't worry about untangling a mess of wires while commuting. It is ready when you need it.

A USB Type C to USB Type C cable with a 90 degree angle plug is not something I am initially excited about. But make it coiled and I am very happy. Why? Because coiled it takes up 1.3ft, uncoiled I get 3.3ft! Oh and it supports PD 3.0 fast charging up to 60W, so I can use it with my phones, tablets and even my laptop. It support USB 2 only, which is a bit slow in 2025, but this is more of a charging / peripheral cable than fast external storage.

Guidelines to prevent peanut allergy recommend introducing peanut products to infants early, especially to those at high risk who have severe eczema or egg allergy. However, pediatric clinician adherence to the guidelines is low, authors reported in a new study.

The researchers, led by Ruchi S. Gupta, MD, MPH, attending clinician at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, found in the randomized Intervention to Reduce Early Peanut Allergy in Children (iREACH) trial that a clinical decision support (CDS) tool and targeted education sharply increased pediatric clinician adherence to the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases' 2017 Addendum to the Prevention of Peanut Allergy Guidelines for infants at both high and low risk of developing peanut allergy. Findings were published in Pediatrics.

Practices in the intervention group received clinician education with online training modules, a CDS tool embedded in the electronic health record (EHR) system, and visual aids, including what severe eczema looks like with different skin tones. Those in the control group did not receive the supports. The trial included 30 pediatric practices across three networks and included six Federally Qualified Health Centers.

Overall, 18,480 infants (intervention group, n = 9290; control group, n = 9190) were seen by 290 clinicians. Among low-risk infants (n = 18,182), intervention clinicians were adherent for 83.7%, whereas control clinicians were adherent for 34.7% (odds ratio [OR], 14.6; 95% CI, 7.0-30.5; P < .001). Among high-risk infants (n = 298), intervention clinicians were adherent for 26.8%, whereas control clinicians were adherent for 10.4% (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.8; P = .03).

The primary outcome was clinician adherence to guidelines, documented in EHR data from 4- or 6-month well-child visits. Clinicians were adherent for low-risk infants (who had no, mild, or moderate eczema and no egg allergy) if they recommended the introduction of peanut-containing foods. They were considered adherent for high-risk infants (severe eczema and/or egg allergy) if they ordered a peanut-specific immunoglobulin E test and counseled appropriately or referred to an allergist.

In an accompanying presentation of the data online, Gupta said that the intervention in high-risk infants actually significantly improved clinician adherence, but during the study timeframe new consensus guidelines were introduced after infants' families found it was hard to get an appointment with an allergist. That affected the results. However, “overall, almost 80% of pediatricians in the intervention arm were adhering to someguidelines for high-risk infants,” Gupta explained.

Maria Garcia-Lloret, MD, pediatric allergist with University of California Los Angeles Health, Los Angeles, told Medscape Medical News that Gupta's team's results were impressive and “very hopeful.” She said she wasn't surprised the increase in adherence was so high with the intervention because the reasons for the low adherence are primarily the lack of pediatricians' time, their uncertainty about exactly how to implement the guidelines, and lack of confidence in correctly introducing peanut. The intervention would be easily implemented on a broad scale, she said. 

“If we give [pediatricians] the tools, they will do it,” Garcia-Lloret said. She said this intervention is particularly important because referring to pediatric allergy specialists is growing increasingly difficult. In her practice, she said, “it may be 3 months” to get an appointment. That trend may worsen, she said, with an increase in the number of babies born with eczema increasing the load for specialists. “Determining what is severe eczema is a bit subjective,” she said.

Garcia-Lloret added that her institution has found that educating parents with one-page instructions on which allergic reactions do and don't need provider attention also helps ease the burden for pediatricians.

Gupta said the next step is to see whether adherence to guidelines translates to reduction in peanut allergy numbers. “We know that if we intervene with pediatricians at those 4- and 6-month visits, we can have clinicians recommend peanut products to infants,” she added. “Now the big question is, if pediatricians do recommend it, are the families going to do it? It's a two-step approach,” she said.

Gupta declared receiving support from Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), Melchiorre Family Foundation, Sunshine Charitable Foundation, The Walder Foundation, UnitedHealth Group, Thermo Fisher Scientific, and Genentech; she also declared serving as a medical consultant and advisor for Genentech, Novartis, Aimmune LLC, Allergenis LLC, and FARE and having ownership interest in Yobee Care, Inc. Garcia-Lloret reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Educational debt of over $250,000 was associated with increased burnout symptoms in early-career family physicians. Higher debt correlated with long work hours, which was independently linked to increased symptoms of burnout.

“Our findings emphasize that efforts to stem the tide of rising educational debt for physicians may be an important component of addressing the high rates of burnout symptoms among family physicians. Health system leaders, policy makers, and legislators should explore additional ways of reducing this burden on early-career family physicians,” the authors wrote.

The study was led by Dean A. Seehusen, MD, MPH, of the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, Georgia. It was published online on September 22, 2025, in Annals of Family Medicine.

The limited scope of burnout assessment, using only two questions, may lead to inaccurate estimations of burnout prevalence. The focus of the study on early-career family physicians limits the generalizability of findings to other specialties. Unmeasured factors may also contribute to burnout.

One author declared receiving support from the American Board of Family Medicine Foundation as a visiting scholar. No relevant conflicts of interest were disclosed by the authors.

As a medical student, what should you be bringing into the hospital for your clinical rotations? This is a great question, and it can really help you succeed on your rotations. 

My number-one tip is to bring an iPad with a stylus pencil. This is because you don't know how much paper you're going to need. You don't want to be carrying around stacks of paper. Instead, use an iPad and take notes and highlight as needed. 

Another really important thing to have is your iPhone with the Epic app or whatever electronic medical record (EMR) you're using. This way you can quickly reference patients' charts while you're rounding or whenever you're not with your laptop.

Then, arguably, the most important thing is snacks. I always keep some snacks in my pocket of my scrubs because you never know how long rounds are going to last. You never know the next time that you're going to be back at your desk. Make sure that you prevent your glucose from dropping by always having a safe snack in your pocket.

Older adults with normal thinking and memory did better mentally when they exercised and did brain-training activities. These activities worked better than doing nothing or just getting general health information.

“These findings highlight the potential of both targeted single-domain and carefully designed multidomain interventions to support cognitive health in older adults who are cognitively unimpaired, while also underscoring the importance of considering factors such as age, intervention duration, and adherence when designing future prevention programs,” the authors wrote. “An understanding of these dynamics will be crucial to the implementation of dementia prevention programs and their real-world applicability.”

This study was led by Augusto J. Mendes, PhD, of the Laboratory of Neuroimaging of Ageing at the University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland. It was published online on September 25, 2025, in The Lancet Healthy Longevity.

This study had a moderate-to-high risk for bias because of inadequate allocation concealment, lack of blinding, and incomplete report on adherence. The lack of follow-up data limited the understanding of the long-term effects of the treatments.

This study did not receive any funding. One author was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation. Another author received funding through various agencies and pharmaceutical companies and disclosed receiving consulting fees and payment or honoraria for lectures, presentations, speakers bureaus, manuscript writing, or educational events through his institution from multiple pharmaceutical companies.

In a randomized, double-blind trial of patients with erythematotelangiectatic rosacea (ETR), transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) for 3 weeks significantly reduced facial erythema, flushing, anxiety, depression, and fatigue compared with sham stimulation, with effects lasting 24 weeks after treatment.

“Our findings demonstrated that taVNS rapidly improves cutaneous symptoms and systemic comorbidities, with sustained remission being observed during a 24-week follow-up period, and that adverse events were uncommon,” the study authors wrote. These results, they added, “position taVNS as a novel and cost-effective therapeutic option for ETR management.”

The study was led by Jian Li, PhD, Department of Dermatology at The Third Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China, and was published online on October 8 in JAMA Dermatology.

This was a single-center study with a modest sample size. The sham group could not replicate sustained cutaneous sensations. Patient-reported outcomes could have introduced expectation bias.

This study received funding from the Chongqing Health Commission, Southwest Hospital, and Army Medical University. The authors declared having no conflicts of interest.

The FDA approved the TNF-alpha inhibitor golimumab (Simponi, Johnson & Johnson) to treat children with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC) weighing at least 15 kg. 

Of the more than 1 million people in the US living with UC, roughly 20% are children, Johnson & Johnson noted in a statement announcing approval. 

The pediatric indication for golimumab in UC was supported by the open-label PURSUIT 2 phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered golimumab in children aged 2 years and older with moderately to severely active UC. 

In the trial, the primary endpoint of clinical remission at week 6 was achieved by 32% of children. Clinical remission was defined as a Mayo score ≤ 2 points, with no individual subscore > 1.

The secondary endpoints of clinical response at week 6 was achieved by 58%, and endoscopic improvement at week 6 was achieved by 40% of patients receiving golimumab. 

Clinical response was defined as a decrease from baseline in the Mayo score by > 30% and > 3 points, with either a decrease from baseline in the rectal bleeding subscore of > 1 or a rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1. Endoscopic remission was defined as an endoscopy subscore of 0 or 1 based on local endoscopy.

Among children treated with golimumab who were in clinical remission at 6 weeks, 57% maintained clinical remission of symptoms at week 54. Safety results in children were consistent with clinical trials of golimumab in adults with UC, the company said. 

The recommended dose of golimumab for pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg is 200 mg at week 0, followed by 100 mg at weeks 2, 6, and every 4 weeks thereafter; for those weighing at least 15 kg to less than 40 kg, golimumab is administered at 100 mg at week 0, followed by 50 mg at weeks 2, 6, and every 4 weeks thereafter.

Golimumab is administered as a prefilled syringe; children aged 12 and older can self-administer it after proper training by a healthcare provider.

This is the first pediatric approval for golimumab, which is already approved for four indications, including adults living with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis, and moderately to severely active UC. 

Full prescribing information and medication guide is available online.

Blood vessels are more than just pathways for oxygen and nutrients; they also host communicative processes that guide brain development and sustain its function. These vascular-neuronal interfaces are at the core of new research led by Prof. Amparo Acker-Palmer, which will receive €1.25 million as a German Research Foundation (DFG) Koselleck Project.

Within blood vessels, specialized endothelial cells, which form the inner lining of all vessels, exchange signals with neurons and glial cells that decisively influence the formation of brain circuits and the development of brain architecture. Disruptions to this exchange can result in developmental disorders or neurodegeneration. In her newly approved, DFG-funded Koselleck Project, Prof. Amparo Acker-Palmer aims to explore the hidden functions of vascular-neuronal interfaces. Using cutting-edge imaging techniques, molecular profiling, and genetic models, she seeks to uncover where and how endothelial cells interact with neurons and other brain cells, as well as the principles by which these interactions shape brain connectivity and structure. A particular focus is on the cerebellum, which plays a key role in movement and certain cognitive processes, and on the role of blood vessels in brain folding, a process that diversifies and enhances brain functions. Defects in brain folding can lead to neurological disorders, including intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, and motor impairments.

""By bringing together vascular biology and neurosciences, we are opening a new chapter in neurovascular research. Understanding how blood vessels regulate brain development is crucial not only for fundamental biology but also for developing new therapeutic strategies to address diseases caused by disrupted communication between vessels and neurons,"" says Professor Acker-Palmer, adding that the study has the potential to revolutionize neurovascular biology and unlock previously unknown therapies. Acker-Palmer holds the professorship for Molecular Neurobiology at Goethe University Frankfurt and is internationally recognized for her groundbreaking research on neurovascular communication. Her work has earned her several prestigious awards, including an ERC Advanced Grant.

Acker-Palmer's lab is distinguished by its collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, bringing together vascular biologists and neuroscientists to ensure seamless knowledge exchange, innovation, and discovery. According to the neurobiologist, this creates an ideal environment for tackling the ambitious project. The project aligns well with the overarching goals of the German Research Foundation's (DFG) Koselleck Program, which aims to support visionary, high-risk research with the potential to open entirely new scientific fields.

The Reinhart Koselleck funding line, awarded since 2008, is named after Reinhart Koselleck (1923-2006), one of the most important German historians of the 20th century and a co-founder of modern social history. Reinhart Koselleck Projects are awarded to ""researchers distinguished by outstanding scientific achievements."" The prerequisites for approval are particularly innovative research approaches and a certain degree of risk.

Women who have Cesarean births at an advanced stage of labor are about eight times more likely to develop scars in the womb which are known to increase the likelihood of premature births in future pregnancies, UCL researchers have found.

The study, published in the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology, looked at how the stage of labor when the operation is performed affects where the scar forms and how well it heals. More than 40 per cent of all births in high-income countries including England are now by Cesarean.

As labor progresses, the baby moves further down the woman's womb towards the vagina. In preparation for giving birth, the woman's cervix – the opening of the womb – opens or 'dilates' up to 10 centimetres.

In some cases, doctors may need to intervene and perform a Cesarean procedure for safety reasons. It is a major operation and leaves a scar in the womb.

An earlier study by the same team of UCL researchers found that when this internal scar was close to the cervix, the risk of the woman having a preterm birth (before 37 weeks) in future pregnancies was significantly increased.

In their new study, they wanted to better understand the factors that influence where in the womb these scars are located by scanning women after a Cesarean birth.

They found that women who had a Cesarean at an advanced stage of labor (when the cervix was almost fully (around 8cm) or completely open) were about eight times more likely to have scars that formed within or near the cervix. In addition, a low position of the baby in the womb increased the chance of a low scar.

The researchers also found that scars lower down the womb healed less well than those higher up the womb.

They say their findings will help better plan follow-up care for women in future and ways for them to avoid preterm births with future pregnancies. The results should also allow doctors to explore ways to improve surgical techniques to reduce risks in the future, they add.

They are calling for more research into the impact of Cesarean scars on gynaecologic symptoms and future pregnancies and to help develop techniques to improve Cesarean-scar healing.

We knew that having a Cesarean birth can damage the cervix. Our study is the first to look at where that damage in the womb is depending on how advanced the labor is when the operation takes place.

Our findings have significant implications for women who have a Cesarean late in their labor and want to have more children.

This is particularly relevant given the huge increase in the number of women who are having Cesarean births over the last decade.

These fresh insights can help shape the future care for women having advanced labor Cesarean births, helping doctors better prepare women for giving birth and hopefully also leading to improved surgical techniques which reduce the risk of future complications that Cesarean delivery scars can cause.""

Dr. Maria Ivan, Lead Author, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health

Ninety-three women who had a Cesarean delivery during active labor (defined as the cervix being at least four centimetres dilated) took part in the study.

The researchers examined them using transvaginal ultrasound between four and 12 months after birth to see if the Cesarean operation had left a scar and if so, where it was in the womb.

Almost all of the 93 women – 90 – were found to have a visible internal scar.

The researchers found that for each one-centimetre increase in cervical dilatation during labor, the scar was positioned 0.88mm lower down the womb and closer to the cervix.

Fifty-two of the women's scars (57.8 per cent) were in the higher part of the womb, with the scars in the rest of the women located either close to the cervix (19 women or 21.1 per cent) or within it (also 19 women or 21.1per cent).

From this, the researchers worked out that having an advanced labor Cesarean birth was associated with an eightfold higher risk of the scar being located near or within the cervix compared to Cesarean births at an earlier stage of labor.

The researchers also looked at the impact the position of the scar had on how well it healed.

Indicators of impaired scar healing included the presence of a scar ""niche"" – a gap or defect in the wall of the womb at least two millimeters deep. These niches form a pouch where blood can accumulate and may be associated with infertility, irregular menstrual bleeding or complications in future pregnancies.

Based on these indicators, they found that scars which formed close to or within the cervix did not heal as well as scars higher up the womb, posing a greater risk of complications in future pregnancies.

Co-author Professor Anna David, EGA Institute for Women's Health,National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre and Deputy Director of charity Tommy's National Centre for Preterm Birth Research, said: ""Cesarean birth in advanced labor is known to be linked with preterm birth. Our findings highlight the importance of healing of the Cesarean scar in the womb and that the stage of labor and low position of the baby can impact how this happens.""

Dr Jyotsna Vohra, Director of Research, Programmes and Impact at Tommy's, the pregnancy and baby charity, said: ""Unplanned Cesarean births can be very stressful, especially when carried out in an emergency to make sure baby arrives safely. Women who have experienced this may already be feeling anxious going into their next pregnancy, and to be then told they're at increased risk of giving birth early will only add to the anxiety.

""This new research paves the way for better prediction and prevention of preterm birth following a previous Cesarean birth. We're working closely with healthcare professionals to make sure this research breakthrough translates to improvements in care for women and birthing people whose babies are most at risk of being born too soon.""

The number of women having Cesarean births has risen sharply in England in recent years to 42% (225,762, of which 99,783 were elective and 125,979 registered as emergency Cesareans) of all deliveries in 2023/24 compared with 26% (166,081 deliveries) in 2013/14.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","UCSF and Allen Institute create most detailed data-driven map of the mouse brain","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251007/UCSF-and-Allen-Institute-create-most-detailed-data-driven-map-of-the-mouse-brain.aspx","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 03:14:00 GMT","

In a powerful fusion of AI and neuroscience, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and Allen Institute designed an AI model that has created one of the most detailed maps of the mouse brain to date, featuring 1,300 regions/subregions. This new map includes previously uncharted subregions of the brain, opening new avenues for neuroscience exploration. The findings were published today in Nature Communications. They offer an unprecedented level of detail and advance our understanding of the brain by allowing researchers to link specific functions, behaviors, and disease states to smaller, more precise cellular regions-providing a roadmap for new hypotheses and experiments about the roles these areas play.

It's like going from a map showing only continents and countries to one showing states and cities. This new, detailed brain parcellation solely based on data, and not human expert annotation, reveals previously uncharted subregions of the mouse brain. And based on decades of neuroscience, new regions correspond to specialized brain functions to be discovered."" 

Bosiljka Tasic, Ph.D., director of molecular genetics at the Allen Institute and one of the study authors

At the heart of this breakthrough is CellTransformer, a powerful AI model that can automatically identify important subregions of the brain from massive spatial transcriptomics datasets. Spatial transcriptomics reveals where certain brain cell types are positioned in the brain but does not reveal regions of the brain based on their composition. Now, CellTransformer allows scientists to define brain regions and subdivisions based on calculations of shared cellular neighborhoods, much like sketching a city's borders based on the types of buildings within it. 

""Our model is built on the same powerful technology as AI tools like ChatGPT. Both are built on a 'transformer' framework which excels at understanding context,"" said Reza Abbasi-Asl, Ph.D., associate professor of neurology and bioengineering at UCSF and senior author of the study. ""While transformers are often applied to analyze the relationship between words in a sentence, we use CellTransformer to analyze the relationship between cells that are nearby in space. It learns to predict a cell's molecular features based on its local neighborhood, allowing it to build up a detailed map of the overall tissue organization."" 

This model successfully replicates known regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus; but more importantly, it can also discover previously uncatalogued, finer-grained subregions in poorly understood brain regions, such as the midbrain reticular nucleus, which plays a complex role in movement initiation and release. 

This new brain map depicts brain regions, versus cell types; and unlike previous brain maps, CellTransformer's is entirely data-driven, meaning its boundaries are defined by cellular and molecular data rather than human interpretation. With 1,300 regions and subregions, it also represents one of the most granular and complex data-driven brain maps of any animal to date. 

The Allen Institute's Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) served as the essential gold standard for validating CellTransformer's accuracy. ""By comparing the brain regions automatically identified by CellTransformer to the CCF, we were able to show that our data-driven method was identifying areas aligned with known expert-defined anatomical structures,"" said Alex Lee, a PhD candidate at UCSF and first author of the study. ""Seeing that our model produces results so similar to CCF, which is such a well-characterized and high-quality resource for the field, was reassuring. The high level of agreement with the CCF provided a critical benchmark, giving confidence that the new subregions discovered by CellTransformer may also be biologically meaningful. We are hoping to explore and validate the results with further computational and experimental studies."" 

The potential of this research to unlock critical insights reaches beyond neuroscience. CellTransformer's powerful AI capabilities are tissue agnostic: They can be used on other organ systems and tissues, including cancerous tissue, where large-scale spatial transcriptomics data is available to better understand the biology of health and disease and fuel the discovery of new treatments and therapies.

Exercise snacks-intentional short bursts of physical activity-may be an effective way of boosting the cardiorespiratory fitness of physically inactive adults, finds a synthesis of the available research, published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.

Adherence to exercise snacking throughout the day was high, the findings indicate, and this approach could counter perceived lack of time and low motivation-frequently cited barriers to fulfilling the recommended weekly quota of physical activity for health-say the researchers.

Globally, around a third of adults, and 80% of teens, fail to meet the recommended physical activity levels of 300 minutes/week of moderate, or 75–150 minutes/week of vigorous, intensity physical activity, note the researchers.

A growing body of evidence indicates that exercise snacks, such as stair climbing or weights, have the potential to improve health and counter the deleterious effects of prolonged sitting. But most of these studies have relied on quasi-experimental designs or qualitative analyses, they add. 

To fill this gap, the researchers set out to evaluate the effects of exercise snacks on cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular endurance, and cardiometabolic factors, such as blood fats and body fat distribution, to see if this might be a practical and scalable approach to curbing physical inactivity and its associated effects on health. 

They scoured research databases for relevant clinical trials published up to April 2025, and found 11 from Australia, Canada, China and the UK that were suitable for pooled data analysis. These involved a total of 414 sedentary or physically inactive adults, over two thirds of whom (69%) were women. 

Exercise snacks were defined as bursts of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity lasting 5 minutes or less, excluding warm-up, cool-down, and intermediate recovery periods, and done at least twice a day for between 3 and 7 days a week for 4 to 12 weeks. 

They mainly consisted of stair climbing, either as continuous bouts or at repeated intervals, for young and middle aged adults. Leg focused strength exercises and tai chi were the dominant forms among older adults.

Synthesis of the data showed that exercise snacking significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness in adults (moderate certainty of evidence), although the evidence in support of its impact on muscular endurance in older adults (69-74 year olds) was limited.

Nor was exercise snacking associated with any significant effects on leg strength or cardiometabolic factors, including body composition, blood pressure, and blood fat profiles.

But compliance was high, at 91%, as was the ability to stick with the programme (83%), highlighting the potential feasibility and acceptability of this approach in real world unsupervised settings, suggest the researchers.

They acknowledge various limitations to their findings, chief among which was the limited number of studies with limited sample sizes included in their data synthesis. The study design and methodology of the included studies also varied considerably. 

Nevertheless, they conclude: ""The time efficient nature of exercise snacks may help overcome common barriers to physical activity, such as perceived lack of time and low motivation. 

""Exercise snacks may enhance adherence to regular physical activity by providing short, flexible exercise bouts that are easier to integrate into daily routines.""

With such a broad portfolio of services and labs spread across the US and Europe, data integration was one of our biggest challenges. We needed a cloud-based platform to unify our global operations, support real-time data streaming, and ensure compliance with standards like GDPR and internal QA/QC protocols. It was critical to find a system that could bring everything together in a seamless and compliant way.

We were looking for a partner that could meet our need for a unified, cloud-based ecosystem that could handle genomics data and support integration across our services. DNAnexus stood out for its collaborative capabilities, real-time data handling, and robust compliance features. Since onboarding, we've started streaming data directly into the platform and running core processes like mapping, alignment, and data delivery, all in real-time. It's been a very positive experience so far.

Honestly, it's been smooth. One of our key goals was ensuring that our internal systems could communicate effectively and without glitches. We've seen seamless real-time data migration and successful alignment between our internal tools and the DNAnexus platform. It's enabled us to move quickly and confidently with broader adoption across our genomics operations.

Operating across continents means we must comply with GDPR in Europe and various quality and privacy standards in the US. DNAnexus gives us a secure data transfer and storage environment while enabling our QA/QC processes to function efficiently across global sites. That capability to maintain compliance without sacrificing speed or functionality was a must-have for us.

Absolutely! Their team has been incredibly patient, responsive, and aligned with our timelines and expectations. The collaboration has been a true partnership. They've taken the time to understand our goals and tailor their support accordingly.

Working with a team that's so committed to helping us succeed has been refreshing.

Cloud-based platforms are essential for scaling genomics. The sheer volume and complexity of the data we deal with require a flexible and integrated approach. Platforms like DNAnexus not only help streamline operations but also unlock collaboration between teams and regions. They're enabling faster innovation, better data insights, and, ultimately, better outcomes for researchers and patients.

Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymers (PLGAs) are biodegradable, biocompatible synthetic materials widely used across pharmaceutical applications. Derived from lactic and glycolic acids, these copolymers break down into non-toxic metabolites, making them particularly well-suited for drug delivery systems and resorbable implants.

One of PLGA's key advantages lies in the precise control over composition and microstructure during manufacturing, allowing their properties to be finely tuned for specific therapeutic needs. However, the broad diversity of PLGA-based materials also presents challenges in ensuring consistent quality. Variability in polymer structure can directly impact performance and safety, making reliable characterization essential.

Despite their established use in many approved drug products, PLGAs have only recently been included in major pharmacopeias, and even then, only a limited number of variants are covered.

The growing use of GLP-1 receptor agonists may affect the interpretation of oncological FDG PET-CT scans, new research presented today at the 38th Annual Congress of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine (EANM'25) has revealed.

GLP-1 receptor agonists are now widely prescribed for individuals with type 2 diabetes and weight loss, with a 700% increase in usage reported in the United States between 2019 and 2023. These medications alter glucose metabolism, gastric motility and sympathetic tone, which may lead to unique uptake patterns on PET-CT. Previous case reports have shown increased FDG uptake in skeletal muscle, myocardium and brown adipose tissue, findings that may be mistaken for malignancy or inflammatory disease.

Researchers from Alliance Medical Ltd. performed a retrospective case series review of oncologic FDG PET-CT scans in patients taking GLP-1 agonists. They observed several atypical patterns of tracer uptake that could be misinterpreted as pathology if a patient's medication history is not considered.

We noticed unusual uptake in one of our patients on a GLP-1 agonist, which prompted a wider review across our network. We found that these altered patterns are increasingly common, yet there is currently no national or international guidance in the UK addressing this emerging issue.""

Dr. Peter Strouhal, Lead Author, Medical Director at Alliance Medical Ltd.

Misinterpreting these uptake patterns can lead to unnecessary investigations, inappropriate cancer staging and delays in treatment, which may cause stress and uncertainty for patients. ""Recognizing the characteristic uptake associated with GLP-1 agonists helps avoid unnecessary anxiety and interventions, ensuring patients receive the right care, at the right time, without detours or doubt,"" Dr Strouhal added.

At present, the researchers do not recommend altering patient preparation or stopping GLP-1 agonists prior to FDG PET-CT scans. Instead, they advise that imaging teams carefully document patients' medication histories to inform interpretation while formal guidance is developed. Current UK guidelines do not address this issue, although Australian guidance suggests continuing treatment, fasting from midnight, scheduling morning scans and ensuring good glucose control.

The research group intends to extend their data collection across additional imaging centers to provide a stronger evidence base for future national guidance. They also aim to establish international collaborations so that patients everywhere benefit from consistent and reliable PET-CT interpretation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Depression during pregnancy raises risk of gestational diabetes","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251008/Depression-during-pregnancy-raises-risk-of-gestational-diabetes.aspx","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 10:35:00 GMT","

Researchers uncover a consistent global link between antenatal depression and gestational diabetes, highlighting how early emotional support and screening could protect both maternal and newborn health.

Study: The impact of maternal depression during pregnancy on the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: a meta-analysis. Image credit: Supagrit Ninkaesorn/Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in the Frontiers in Endocrinology, a group of researchers quantified the association between depression in pregnancy and the subsequent risk of gestational diabetes mellitus using a meta-analysis of observational studies.

About one in seven pregnancies faces gestational diabetes mellitus, yet the risk does not fall evenly across mothers. Depression in pregnancy is common and can alter biology through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, raising cortisol and inflammation, impairing insulin action. In addition, depression is often linked with lifestyle factors such as reduced physical activity, poorer diet, and disrupted sleep, which may further contribute to metabolic dysregulation during pregnancy.

Families feel the effects: more clinic visits, tighter budgets, and anxiety about delivery and infant health. Screening tools such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale flag women needing support. There are still uncertainties about how depression in pregnancy is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus; further research should close this gap.

The researchers systematically searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Wanfang from inception to June 12, 2025, for observational studies linking depression in pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus. Eligible designs were cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies enrolling pregnant women, with exposure defined as depression during pregnancy and outcome as incident gestational diabetes mellitus.

They independently screened records and extracted study and participant characteristics. Depression was measured using EPDS, SDS, HAD, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale-10 item version (CESD-10), or International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes.

Gestational diabetes diagnosis followed study-specific criteria, often confirmed with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Study quality was appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), with scores of six or more treated as high quality. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated via a random-effects model; heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and the I² statistic.

Subgroup analyses considered country, depression tool, and design; sensitivity analyses omitted influential studies; publication bias was tested with funnel plots and Egger's and Begg's tests. All analyses were conducted using STATA version 12.0, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05.

Eight studies met the inclusion criteria, covering the period 2013 to 2021 and totaling 125,451 pregnant women. The designs included five prospective cohort studies, one retrospective cohort study, and one case-control study, with participants drawn from the United States, Australia, and China.

Depression was assessed with standardized instruments like EPDS, SDS, HAD, and CESD-10 item version, or with ICD-9 diagnostic codes. Gestational diabetes mellitus was defined by study-level criteria and frequently verified by an oral glucose tolerance test. Most included studies were rated high quality on the NOS.

The pooled random-effects analysis showed that depression in pregnancy was associated with higher odds of gestational diabetes mellitus, with a summary OR of 1.37 and a 95% CI from 1.20 to 1.54. Between-study heterogeneity was low (I² = 9%), indicating consistency in direction and magnitude across settings.

Subgroup analyses supported accuracy: estimates were directionally similar when stratified by country, study design, and depression measure. Sensitivity analyses that excluded the largest study and the study with the widest confidence interval produced nearly identical results, confirming the stability of the association.

Publication bias appeared unlikely, as visual inspection of the funnel plot was symmetrical. Formal tests were negative, with Egger's test p = 0.509 and Begg's test p = 0.138. These checks suggest that a single influential study or selective reporting does not drive the association.

Descriptive data revealed important practical gaps. Most studies did not report whether participants received antidepressant treatment during pregnancy, limiting the ability to distinguish the effects of depression from potential medication-related metabolic effects. Covariate adjustment also varied across studies. Some cohorts controlled for age, body mass index, parity, smoking, and socioeconomic indicators, while others adjusted for fewer factors; despite this variability, the direction of the association was consistent.

The authors noted that previous meta-analyses had included fewer studies and lacked subgroup or sensitivity analyses, which limited earlier conclusions. By incorporating newer data and conducting these checks, the present analyses strengthened the evidence base for a reproducible link between antenatal depression and gestational diabetes.

Clinically, the meta-analytic signal indicates that depressive symptoms during pregnancy mark a group at elevated metabolic risk. While causation cannot be inferred from observational designs, the consistency of the OR across instruments and countries implies that routine mental-health assessment could help identify candidates for earlier glucose evaluation and timely lifestyle support. Early depression screening (for example, using the EPDS in the first trimester) might enable preventive counselling or earlier oral glucose tolerance testing for those at higher risk.

Overall, the analysis highlighted a consistent and reproducible link between depression during pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus, observed across multiple assessment tools and healthcare settings. These findings were stable across multiple sensitivity checks performed.

This meta-analysis indicates that depression in pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, with a summary OR of 1.37 and narrow confidence limits. Because most included data were observational, residual confounding cannot be excluded; however, the signal was consistent across countries, study designs, and depression measures, with low heterogeneity and no evident publication bias.

The authors recommend that prenatal care integrate validated mental-health screening alongside metabolic risk evaluation, as addressing psychological factors may help improve both mental and physical outcomes for mothers and infants. Integrating validated mental-health screening into routine prenatal care, earlier oral glucose tolerance testing, and supportive lifestyle counseling for those at risk may help improve maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Researchers from the University of Iowa found that babies fed lactose-free or hydrolyzed formulas gained weight faster in their first year, raising new questions about how modern formula compositions may shape lifelong health.

Study: Effects of Infant Formula Type on Early Childhood Growth Outcomes: A Retrospective Cohort Study. Image credit: New Africa/Shutterstock.com

With childhood obesity rates hitting 20% in the United States, American scientists are looking at its origin in infancy and before birth. A new study in Nutrients explores the effects of non-standard infant formulas on early childhood growth.

What the baby eats during the first three years of life shapes its metabolism. This is traceable to its gut microbiome development and the direction in which its metabolic pathways move in response to its feeding. These early nutritional factors help shape long-term health outcomes.

Breast milk is recommended for infant food until six months of age. However, less than a quarter of American infants (23%) are exclusively breastfed for this duration. While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Dietary Guidelines recommend that non-breastfed babies receive iron-fortified formula, no other specific guidelines have emerged. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifies that formula must contain minimum levels of 30 essential nutrients. Still, it does not specify the type and amounts of macronutrients (proteins, sugars, and fats) in the formula.

Most powdered infant formula sold today in big American retail outlets is non-standard infant formula. About 60% of it is lactose-free or lactose-reduced. The lactose is replaced with other sugars like maltodextrin (a glucose polymer) or sucrose (table sugar). This is surprising because of the relative rarity of lactose intolerance and is concerning because lactose promotes good gut bacteria like Bifidobacteria. These bacteria form metabolically essential, immunity-promoting short-chain fatty acids like butyric and propionic acid.

Previous research suggests that the rapid breakdown of sugars in non-standard formula to glucose may increase the blood sugar levels, reduce feelings of fullness, and habituate the baby to prefer sweet-tasting food. Such changes could also shift the gut microbiome and affect later metabolic regulation.

The protein in infant formula is often hydrolyzed for easier absorption. Hydrolyzed protein may also be absorbed faster than ordinary milk protein, potentially leading to faster weight gain. However, the study did not measure appetite or obesity outcomes, so these mechanisms remain speculative.

Despite the widespread availability and use of non-standard infant formula, little evidence exists showing how it affects the infant's growth and metabolism. The current study seeks to provide some evidence by comparing non-standard and standard formula use in full-term babies.

This was a retrospective cohort study, where the investigators used data on full-term babies who weighed more than 2,500 g at birth. Mothers were asked about the type of infant formula used, whether standard or non-standard, and whether the child was breastfed, at the two-month well-baby visits.

Growth was assessed using continuous growth scores at one and two years of age. The babies were not classified as obese or overweight because, at such young ages, there are no appropriate criteria for these conditions. The analysis of the feeding-growth relationship was adjusted for the mother's socioeconomic characteristics.

The study included 5,515 babies. At two months, about a third (35%) received only breast milk. Of the rest, 42% and 23% received standard vs. non-standard infant formula.

Breastfeeding mothers were more likely to be White, privately insured, and less likely to have obesity or anemia. At one year, their babies were more likely to be still receiving breast milk compared to cow's milk or formula in the formula-fed group.

At 12 months, babies fed non-standard formula had higher growth rates than those fed standard formula. This was true for weight for age and body mass index (BMI). While the weight for length also appeared to be higher in the non-standard formula group, the difference disappeared after adjusting for other factors.

The study found that, based on subgroup analysis, female infants on non-standard formula showed a greater increase in BMI z-scores at 12 months compared with males. Infants with Medicaid or private insurance had higher BMIs with the non-standard formula at 12 months. Differences varied by subgroup, with non-Hispanic and White infants showing somewhat higher BMI z-scores at 12 months with the non-standard formula.

At 24 months, non-standard formula-fed babies remained heavier for their age than standard formula-fed babies. Both groups of formula-fed babies had a higher growth trajectory than breastfed babies at 12 and 24 months.

As expected, babies on non-standard formula showed a significantly higher BMI than those on standard formula or breast milk. The authors note that this pattern of accelerated early growth could increase the risk of later metabolic problems, though this study did not directly assess obesity or metabolic outcomes.

However, the study collected feeding information only at the two-month visit, creating an important gap in understanding how feeding practices may have changed over time. Long-term follow-up research is needed to fill this gap. Again, given that the current FDA requirement is that approved formulas should support adequate infant growth for 15 weeks, such research is needed to support the long-term safety of non-standard formulas.

Infant formula affects infant growth differently from exclusive breastfeeding. Non-standard infant formula appears to increase early growth rates, particularly in the first year of life, compared to standard formula. Further work is important to understand how non-standard formula affects the risk of obesity and the long-term health outcomes in users.

Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD) principles call for a deeper, more systematic understanding of all factors that influence the performance of analytical procedures in quality control. By embedding science and risk management into the core of method development, AQbD promotes the creation of “living” procedures, where every variable is well-characterized, controlled, and continuously monitored.

While the holistic approach introduced by AQbD can be complex, it offers clear benefits: improved method robustness, greater quality assurance, and increased flexibility. Notably, it also introduces the concept of platform procedures, which can be adapted across multiple applications with minimal revalidation.

In this context, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) emerges as a powerful tool to support AQbD. Grounded in absolute physical principles, NMR simplifies the management of analytical procedures and fully leverages the platform concept.

This whitepaper explores how to design and implement such a platform for quantitative applications using Bruker's compact, cryogen-free benchtop NMR spectrometer, the Fourier 80.

It begins with key considerations for risk assessment in quantitative NMR (qNMR) procedures and then presents practical control and mitigation strategies. Real-world examples illustrate how to define a Method Operable Design Region (MODR) using the Fourier 80, offering a practical roadmap for labs seeking to adopt flexible, streamlined qNMR methods.

Calorie labeling, which became law in April 2022 in England, is associated with only a small (2%) average reduction in the energy content of food that is available away from home, finds research published in the open access journal BMJ Public Health.

And these changes are primarily due to swapping in slightly lower calorie items, rather than reformulating existing ones, with no changes observed in continuously available items. The impact on population health is likely to be ""moderate to limited,"" conclude the researchers.

Eating at restaurants, fast food outlets, and ordering takeaways, collectively known as out-of-home food outlets, is common and associated with poorer dietary quality, weight gain, and obesity, explain the researchers. 

Calorie labeling aims to try and counter this and improve public health by providing consumers with calorie information at the point of sale, they add.

In England calorie labeling regulations require large (at least 250 employees) food and non-alcoholic drink outlets to display kilocalories on their offerings.

The international evidence on how these policies affect what is offered is somewhat mixed, note the researchers. To strengthen the evidence base, they compared changes in the energy content of menu items before and after the introduction of calorie labeling, stratified by food group and food business (chain) type.

They used the MenuTracker database to find out what changes had been made to the average energy content (Kcal values) of new, removed, and continuously available food items, and to assess the proportions of menu items exceeding recommended energy intake (above 600 kcal) per meal.

MenuTracker collects the food item name and description, serving size, energy, macronutrients, fibre, salt, allergens, special dietary information and menu section (children's or sharing items, for example).

The researchers focused on data collected in September 2021 for 79 chains (before the introduction of the regulations) and September 2022 for 90 chains (after the regulations had come into force). The final analysis included 31,045 menu items from 78 chains in both time periods.

The chains were classified as: cafes and bakeries; Western fast food and takeaways; pubs, bars, and inns; restaurants; sports and entertainment venues; and Asian fast food.

And menu items were classified as appetisers and sides; baked goods; beverages; burgers; desserts; fried potatoes; mains; pizza; salads; sandwiches; soup; and toppings and ingredients.

A significant average reduction per item was observed for non-alcoholic and soft drinks of 36 kcal, equivalent to a drop of nearly 16.5% in energy content.

And the average energy content of burgers fell by 103 kcal (11% reduction), and by 30 kcal for mains (4% reduction). 

But, overall, only a small reduction of 9 kcal (2% reduction) in average energy content per item was observed after the regulations had come on stream. 

Analysis of chain type revealed significant average reductions per item in pubs, bars, and inns (a reduction of 52 kcal; 9%); restaurants (a reduction of 23 kcal; 5%); and sports and entertainment venues (a reduction of 49 kcal;13.5%).

But changes were driven primarily by the removal of higher (average 458) kcal items and the addition of lower (average 434) kcal new items. 

And there was no significant change in energy content for continuously available items, indicating limited evidence of reformulation, say the researchers.

Before the introduction of the regulations continuously available items had an average energy content of 437 kcal; afterwards they had an average energy content of 439 kcal. 

Removed items contained an average of 21 kcal more than continuously available items and 25 kcal more than new items.

As to the recommended 600 kcal limit per meal, 22% of items remained over this limit. The food groups with the most items over 600 kcal were burgers, mains, and pizzas, and the

chain types with the most items exceeding this limit were restaurants and pubs, bars and inns.

The researchers acknowledge various limitations to their findings, including that MenuTracker only includes menu information from chains that posted kcal information online before and after the policy. 

The calorie labeling regulations also allow kcal information to be within plus or minus 20% and permit several different methods for estimating energy content, they add.

""We found more evidence of menu change rather than reformulation, with items removed from menus being higher energy than continuous items. Thus, the impact of a calorie labeling policy on food may differ from other policies like the Soft Drinks Industry Levy, which created an economic incentive for, and was associated with, substantial reformulation,"" point out the researchers.

Reformulating drinks may be easier for manufacturers to do than reformulating foods, and previous research indicates that large outlets are reluctant to reduce portion sizes because of how customers might perceive this, they acknowledge. 

But they suggest: ""The small reduction in average kcal of items available on menus we found is likely to have modest to limited impact on population health.""

And for these ""to lead to meaningful population health improvements, consumers would need to shift purchases towards the lower calorie items,"" they add.

Even in later life, eating well pays off; researchers reveal that healthier diets can dramatically extend the lifespan of frail adults and cut their risk of early death.

Study: Combined Effects of Diet Quality Scores and Frailty on All-Cause Mortality and Life Expectancy in Middle-Aged and Older Adults. Image credit: PeopleImages/Shutterstock.com

Frailty is a known risk factor for premature death in the elderly, but its interrelationship with diet quality is poorly known. A recent paper in Nutrients examines the interaction of frailty and nutritional quality in lifespan and mortality after middle life.

The world's population is growing older and living longer. By 2050, the number of people over 60 is expected to double from the 2000 figures, and the population above 80 will increase fourfold. This emphasizes the need to ensure healthy aging. Frailty is a significant risk factor for disability and death. Frail people are more likely to fall, be hospitalized, suffer bone breaks, become disabled, develop multiple acute or chronic illnesses, and die earlier than expected.

The expected lifespan of a population is an accurate and actionable measure of its health. Physical activity and a healthy diet typically increase lifespan, while smoking and drinking reduce it.

Poor diet quality deprives the consumer of many nutrients at adequate levels and prevents the proper utilization of available resources. Many different dietary scores have been devised, but there are so many options with high variability that comparability is difficult. However, their combined use might yield the most useful results in framing dietary recommendations.

Since few researchers have looked at the interaction of frailty and diet quality, the current study addressed this gap, seeking to gather evidence that might help extend the years of healthy life in the aging population.

The study used UK Biobank data from 151,628 participants, chosen because they had undergone one or more dietary evaluations. Their frailty was assessed using two indices: frailty phenotype (FP) and frailty index (FI).

The FP used criteria like weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slow walking, and little physical activity. Those with three or more of these were frail, while the pre-frail had one or two criteria.

The FI included the number of present criteria divided by the total, with frailty increasing as the score went higher (≥0.24 or above means frail, while 0.12 to 0.24 meant pre-frail, with <0.12 being robust)

Diet quality was assigned using a variety of eating scores:

Diet quality scores were then classified into tertiles, from unhealthy to healthy. Frailty and diet quality were analyzed together after adjusting for deprivation, medical conditions, unhealthy habits, and a family history of cancer or cardiovascular disease.

The study period lasted a median of 12.2 years. Over this period, there were 8,231 deaths. The highest death rates were among the increasingly frail individuals. Similarly, those with the worst diets had the highest mortality.

People who were frail and had the poorest diets were much more likely to die than those who were robust and ate healthily. That is, frail individuals with a poor diet quality had about double the risk of death when assessed by the FI and nearly triple the risk when assessed by the FP, compared to non-frail individuals with a healthy diet.   

The risk increased steadily from a healthy to an unhealthy diet, but the magnitude was higher among the frail, especially when using the FP criteria. Conversely, at all frailty levels, better diet quality reduced the risk of death and increased expected lifespan in direct proportion to the health-promoting content of the diet.

Using 50 years as the cutoff, life expectancy in frail men (by the FI) with the lowest diet quality was reduced by ~1 to 3 years. The exact degree of reduction varied with the diet score used. For females, the reduction ranged from six months to 2.4 years. When the FP was used, the reductions in life expectancy among frail men and women ranged between 2.1 and 4.5 years, vs 1.6 to 5.1 years, respectively.

These findings are impressive as they embraced a spectrum of dietary assessments, which probably included various nutrients within multiple foods. Moreover, the effects held steady across both sexes and were independent of the effects of drinking, smoking, other medical conditions, medication use, and socioeconomic factors.

The findings were consistent with two different evaluations of frailty, though the FP had stronger associations with diet quality compared to the FI. The FP is based on physical function and directly reflects the effects of poor nutrition and the loss of physical strength. In contrast, using multiple other conditions in the FI tends to partly obscure the effect of frailty and diet.

Biologically, healthy diets are, at their core, the same. They supply an abundance of plant-based foods and adequate antioxidants, dietary fiber, and anti-inflammatory components while limiting free simple sugars and added salt.

Frailty may increase individual vulnerability to poor diet quality in multiple ways. Both are pro-inflammatory. An unhealthy diet is pro-oxidant, worsening oxidative stress and frailty. Impaired metabolism is common in frail people, resulting in high glucose levels and insulin resistance, exacerbated by high-fat diets rich in refined carbohydrates. Again, inadequate food intake by frail people leads to nutrient deficiency. The association of poor nutrition and frailty with weakened immunity and increased infection rate increases the risk of death.

The findings emphasize the universal benefit of a healthy diet even as physical frailty increases and show that the negative effects of frailty can be mitigated, but not necessarily reversed, through healthier dietary habits.

Importantly, the research underscores that it is never too late to adopt healthier dietary habits.”

However, there could be a two-way relationship between diet and frailty, and frail people should be encouraged to switch to a healthy diet. To achieve this, they may require help to overcome functional, logistical, or medical restrictions, which indicates the need for integrated strategies to detect frailty and provide care, as well as nutritional programs.

The authors also noted limitations of the research, including that dietary data came from self-reported 24-hour recalls, which may introduce reporting errors, and that the UK Biobank cohort is not fully representative of the general UK population, which could affect generalizability.

A healthier diet appears to reduce, rather than fully compensate for, the presence of frailty. This highlights the importance of improving diet quality to ensure better quality of life while aging. “Evidence suggests that it is never too late to adopt healthier dietary habits for significant health benefits.”

Whole genome sequencing offered to breast cancer patients is likely to identify unique genetic features that could either guide immediate treatment or help match patients to clinical trials for over 15,000 women a year, say scientists at the University of Cambridge.

In 2022, 2.3 million women were diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide and there were 670,000 related deaths. Despite significant progress in recent years, it remains challenging to accurately identify the best treatments for individual patients and to predict cases with poorer prognosis.

Whole genome sequencing is a powerful technique that involves analysing the DNA of both the patient and their tumour to look for genetic changes, or mutations. This provides information on the underlying cause of the tumour and what is driving it. It can also provide valuable information to guide treatment, for example by identifying vulnerabilities in the tumour's makeup or spotting signs that a patient might be resistant to a particular treatment.

Although the technology is rapidly becoming cheaper – Ultima Genomics has recently announced that it can sequence a human genome for US$100 – it is not widely used across the NHS. Offered through the NHS Genomic Medicine Service, it is currently available for a few adult cancers, rare cancers, paediatric cancers, and certain metastatic cancers.

It is becoming increasingly possible to use whole genome sequencing to inform cancer management, but it's arguably not being used to its full potential, and certainly not for some of the more common types of cancer.

Part of the reason why is because we lack the clinical studies to support its use, but it's also in part precisely because the information is so rich – in a sense, the information can be too overwhelming to make sense of.""

Professor Serena Nik-Zainal, Department of Genomic Medicine and Early Cancer Institute, University of Cambridge

To help address these challenges, Professor Nik-Zainal and colleagues used data from almost 2,500 women from across England housed within the National Genomic Research Library – one of the world's largest and most valuable data assets of its kind and run by Genomics England. The data from the 2,500 women came from their recruitment to the 100,000 Genomes Project and was linked to clinical and/or mortality records, tracking outcomes over five years. The researchers looked for genetic changes that cause or influence breast cancer, including problems in the way cells repair DNA.

The results of their study are published today in The Lancet Oncology.

The researchers found that 27% of breast cancer cases had genetic features that could help guide personalised treatment immediately, either with existing drugs or recruitment to prospective or current clinical trials. This equates to more than 15,000 women a year in the UK.

Among those features identified were: HRD (homology-directed repair deficiency), a DNA repair issue found in 12% of all breast cancers; unique mutations that could be targeted with specific drugs; signs of resistance to hormone therapy; and mutational patterns that suggest weaknesses in the cancer that treatments could exploit.

The team identified an additional 15% of cases that had features that could be useful for future research, such as problems with other DNA repair pathways. This would equate to more than 8,300 women a year.

The analysis also provided insights into prognosis. For example, in the most common subtype of breast cancer, known as ER+HER2- breast cancers, which account for approximately 70% of diagnoses, there were strong genetic indicators of how aggressive the cancer might be. For example, major structural DNA changes were linked to a much higher risk of death, as were APOBEC mutational signatures (a type of DNA damage pattern) and mutations in the cancer gene TP53. These genetic markers were more predictive than traditional measures like age of the patient, stage of their cancer, or tumour grade.

Using the results, the researchers created a framework to help doctors identify which patients need more aggressive treatment and which might safely have less treatment. It also suggested that around 7,500 women a year with low-grade tumours may benefit from more aggressive treatment.

Professor Nik-Zainal said: ""The UK is a genuine world-leader in terms of its ability to do whole genome sequencing in the NHS through the Genomic Medicine Service. Now that we have population-level evidence of how impactful whole-genome sequencing could be, we have the potential to make a difference to thousands of patients' lives every year, helping tailor their care more precisely, giving more treatment to those who need it and less to those who don't.""

As well as being used to tailor treatments to individual patients, whole genome sequencing data could help transform how we recruit for and run clinical trials, speeding up the development of much needed new treatments.Professor Nik-Zainal added: ""At the moment, we test patients for just a small number of genetic mutations and may invite them to join a clinical trial if the patient has a mutation that matches the trial's target. But if we have their entire genetic readout instead, we will no longer be restricted to single trials with a specific target. We could massively open up the potential for recruitment, to multiple clinical trials in parallel, making recruitment to clinical trials more efficient, ultimately getting the right therapies to the right patients much faster.""

Professor Nik-Zainal is an Honorary Fellow at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge, and an Honorary Consultant in Clinical Genetics at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH).

The study was largely funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR), Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Gray Foundation and Cancer Research UK, with additional support from the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre.

The University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust (ACT) are fundraising for a new hospital that will transform how we diagnose and treat cancer. Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital, set to be built on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, will bring together clinical excellence from Addenbrooke's Hospital and world-leading researchers at the University of Cambridge under one roof in a new NHS hospital. The new hospital will be home to the Precision Breast Cancer Institute, applying the latest genomic advances to tailor treatment for breast cancer patients, maximising treatment efficacy and minimising the risk of debilitating side effects.

GOAL ranks the top three soccer players produced by every state in the Midwest, including Beasley, Ream and Brian McBride

The world of soccer is so often focused on the glitz of one coast and the grittiness of the other. Meanwhile, so much of American soccer's top talent has come from the middle. Yes, the stars are in California and few can go toe-to-toe with the New York/New Jersey area as talent producers. As for the heart and soul of American soccer, though? That can be found in the Midwest.

Cities such as St. Louis, Chicago, Columbus and Kansas City have emerged as hotbeds for soccer culture over the last few decades, with a number of U.S. men's national team legends coming from the region. The list is impressive: DaMarcus Beasley, Tim Ream, Brian McBride, Taylor Twellman, Cobi Jones, Brad Freidel, Alexi Lalas and many more.

Some regions in the U.S. have deeper player pools than others, so who is the best of the best? Which state has been the most fertile ground for developing American soccer talent?

EXCLUSIVE: GOAL sat down with the USMNT midfielder to discuss fatherhood, World Cup ambitions and his incredible form for Lyon

AUSTIN, Texas -Tanner Tessmann is the U.S. men's national team's most in-form player, but in his view, it didn't start on the field. Parts of it did, sure. A tackle here, a goal there, a series of big wins with one of the biggest clubs in France. Those performances have continued to change the perception of him and his game.

But the the catalyst wasn't some magical flip of the switch on the training field, or even in the film room. For Tessmann, form begins at home. It begins with comfort and stability. It begins with happiness. It begins with faith. And, for this specific run, perhaps the most important of his career so far, it begins with fatherhood.

""Life's changed,"" Tessmann tells GOAL from the U.S. men's national team's hotel for the October camp, ""but it's all changed in a good way.""

In April, just weeks after the USMNT's wake-up-call losses in the CONCACAF Nation's League, Tessmann welcomed his son into the world. Life since, he says, has been constant series of changes and stresses, personally and professionally. He was left out of Mauricio Pochettino's Gold Cup squad this summer, freeing him up to do an American tour to introduce his son to the his family.

Summer was spent following news of out Lyon, as the club were saved, relegated, then saved again to keep their place in Ligue 1, ultimately allowing Tessmann to stay in France. Then, when September camp rolled around, Tessmann was again left out of the USMNT squad, adding fuel to a fire that had been building, internally, since the spring.

He's back now, and as a different version of himself. Fatherhood has changed him, but so has his play. He's been one of Lyon's best players, going from afterthought to an important piece. He's scored big goals and put in big performances, silencing many of the doubters that were questioning what he could offer on both sides of the ball.

On the USMNT front, he's in the process of making himself undeniable, and he's doing it just months before the World Cup. 

""You go into that moment just knowing that someone's got to make the difference,"" he says. ""Someone's got to make something happen. I think having that bit of confidence, that support, that life at home. It gives you that belief. I know that, yes, I can be the one that makes the difference and, when those moments come, I'm going to go for it.""

Tessmann is going for it now, and he's more confident than ever as he enters the most important stretch of his career.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Pochettino greets Pulisic during a game against Panama in Austin, Texas, last year Logan Riely/USSF

Hello! We're all about communication today. Mauricio Pochettino keeps it to a minimum. Mikel Arteta is taking his supersonic.

On the way:

🔇 Poch's USMNT silent treatment

👋 Four-time MLS winner retires

™️ ‘Cold Palmer'

I reached the conclusion a while back that Mauricio Pochettino's modus operandi — an intended consequence of what he says and what he does — is to have the USMNT treading on eggshells. Nobody knows where they stand, which, in a roundabout way, means everybody knows where they stand; no concessions, and no sacred cows.

History will judge the extent to which Pochettino's manner is shrewd, but as one of football's warmer characters historically, it cannot be by accident that he's transitioned into bad cop in the United States. Valid questions about the absence of Yunus Musah and Joe Scally from his latest roster were met with typically enigmatic quotes, summed up in plain English as: I pick the squad, and that's that.

When Christian Pulisic was on the receiving end of similar comments before and after this year's Concacaf Gold Cup, it caused a stir for the glaring reason that Pulisic was a player who might have been afforded special treatment by Poch. It was a surprise, to say the least, that as speculation about the strength of their relationship grew, the pair didn't make moves to chew the fat privately.

But we shouldn't have been shocked because, as I learned from reading this piece by Paul Tenorio and Henry Bushnell, Pochettino doesn't really speak to anybody outside of USMNT camps. He doesn't telegraph or explain his call-ups or keep in touch to any great extent. Squad picks are often transmitted via email. For weeks and months, he exists at arm's length.

Paul's insight got me thinking about whether that's a good or bad thing. Keeping a distance from his pros, for example, doesn't mean Poch isn't working hard. On the contrary, I'd be surprised if the job to date hasn't hurt his soul. And it's easily forgotten that when the sacking of Gregg Berhalter provoked the deepest introspection on the part of U.S. Soccer, a perceived flaw in the old regime was that life was too cuddly and cosy; all carrot, no stick.

Is Poch's communication strategy a savvy switch of tone, then? And will it pay off for him? Because far from softening it, he's doubling down.

When Pochettino spoke last week, he made a point that probably isn't stressed enough in international football: that players should intrinsically know if they've earned a call-up. You get tricky, borderline decisions, sure, but most omissions speak for themselves. Musah, for instance, has clocked up less than an hour in Serie A with Atalanta this season.

Pochettino's assistant, Jesus Perez, told us there's a reluctance on Poch's part to interfere with players while they're in the thick of club duty, but you wonder if this is more about a total reset of attitude within the USMNT: as if the entire dressing room is starting again. It's Ecuador and Australia in the days ahead — two meaningful friendlies against confirmed World Cup qualifiers — and Poch would love this to be year zero because his experience as head coach until now has been punishing and inept.

On reflection, there were two ways for Poch to handle his U.S. inheritance: to either tell his squad what they wanted to hear or to tell them what they didn't. Tougher love was probably the order of the day. It just can't keep yielding occasional results.

Professional athletes will often hear it said that they're a long time retired; that once their career is gone, it's gone. Better to outstay your welcome than give it all up too soon.

Except life in pro sport demands sacrifices, as Darlington Nagbe found out. The Columbus Crew midfielder is about to call it a day, aged 35, and having read this top Felipe Cardenas interview with him, he's a player I wish I'd followed more closely, and someone I was pleased to learn more about (albeit arriving very late to the party).

Nagbe is impressively decorated. He has four MLS Cups on his record, won with three different franchises, but he's quitting because he wants to devote more time to his family, the same reason he left the USMNT scene in 2018. International retirement limited him to 25 caps — fewer than he deserved — but he worried about missing his kids growing up. Nagbe has been blessed by his career. All the same, I like where his head's at. Some things you don't get back.

One of the most popular stories in TAFC last year concerned Mikel Arteta hiring a bunch of pickpockets to teach Arsenal's players to be alert at all times. Never one to sit still, he's gone a step further in his search for psychological balance by enlisting help from the Royal Air Force (RAF).

Arteta is of the view that fighter pilots are some of the world's most accomplished communicators. I get that some of his patter might induce an eye-roll, but Dan Sheldon spoke to a couple of RAF employees (including Justin Hughes, above) and in truth, what they said made sense: that in a high-pressure environment, keywords and signals can improve performance. There's an art to keeping your head.

Pickpockets and pilots haven't quite paid off for Arteta insofar as the Premier League title keeps eluding him, but he's plainly convinced by the quality of mindfulness, and Arsenal are back in the hunt again, top of the table after seven games. Their manager just needs his Top Gun ending.



(Selected games, times ET/UK)

UEFA Women's Champions League (all Paramount+/Disney+): Twente vs Chelsea, 12.45 pm/5.45pm; Manchester United vs Valerenga, Wolfsburg vs Paris Saint-Germain, both 3pm/8pm.

MLS: LAFC vs Toronto FC, 10.30pm/3.30am, MLS Season Pass.

Proof that players know the value of their own profiles comes from Cole Palmer. The Chelsea midfielder (not exactly scraping by on minimum wage) has enhanced his earning potential by trademarking the term ‘Cold Palmer'.

If he gets his way, he'll trademark his ‘shiver' celebration (above), too. What this means is that Palmer-themed mobile phone covers, Christmas crackers, bath salts and underwater vehicles — huh? — could be coming our way before long; all the things you've been missing from your lives.

ROME (AP) — After 17 years as the European Club Association, the network of hundreds of soccer teams is at peak influence over UEFA in shaping the Champions League – and what might come next for the marquee competition.

So it was time for a name change. From ECA to EFC.

The rebranded European Football Clubs meets in Rome this week at an annual assembly of officials whose collective power negotiating with FIFA and UEFA over elite competitions was never greater. 

The ECA was created in 2008 to bring more cooperation, democracy and money to storied teams after their decade of confrontation with international soccer bodies.

There is peace today — restored after the deep rift with UEFA four years ago when an ECA-led group of rebel clubs driven by Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus tried, and failed, to launch the breakaway European Super League. 

Good relations with European clubs and their chairman, now Nasser al-Khelaifi from Paris Saint-Germain, can seem more important to UEFA and its president, Aleksander Ceferin, than dealing with FIFA. Their contract is signed through 2033.

UEFA, and Ceferin personally, were burned by then-ECA leader Andrea Agnelli plotting the breakaway Super League that was intended for just 20 teams.

“Together with EFC,” Ceferin said Wednesday, “We will make sure that our club football is inclusive and that everybody has a chance to win their best competitions.”

Al-Khelaifi returned the praise.

“I admire the UEFA president because he has got values and courage,” said the clubs' leader, who also heads Champions League rights holder BeIN Media Group and is a member of Qatar's government.

It grew out of the G-14 group founded in 1998 by clubs that later formed the Super League core.

They were frustrated at being frozen out of decision-making by FIFA and UEFA who earned billions from the World Cup and European Championship where national teams got free use of club-employed players.

In 2005, G-14 helped directly challenge FIFA in legal action by Belgian club Charleroi, which lost Abdelmajid Oulmers to long-term injury playing with Morocco. It shaped as a test case of clubs absorbing all the risk of releasing players.

When Michel Platini became UEFA president in 2007 talks accelerated to replace G-14 with a broader-based group of clubs. The deal included clubs getting paid from FIFA and UEFA tournament income and ending legal cases.

UEFA and ECA leaderships paired Ballon d'Or winners with a shared World Cup history: Platini and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, then the Bayern Munich CEO. They steered through the Financial Fair Play monitoring of spiraling spending by clubs who played in UEFA competitions.

“We will cooperate in the future with UEFA, there is no doubt about that,” Rummenigge said in 2016, one year before handing over to Agnelli. 

UEFA's next president was Slovenian lawyer Ceferin who aligned with Agnelli and became godfather to one of his children. Agnelli was steering talks on the new, club-friendly Champions League format while plotting the Super League after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Persistent rumors fueled leverage over UEFA in regularly scheduled talks to amend Champions League entry rules and prize money formulas — usually favoring wealthy clubs and leagues.

The ECA in March 2009 dismissed Super League rumors “spread by three major European newspapers.” Years later, fresh speculation was dismissed as “a fever dream” by one Italian official.

But there were plans. By UEFA bringing clubs into the house, it had showed them the finances and insight to run their own version. 

The project failed within 48 hours amid a backlash from fans and governments. PSG had not joined the rebels and Al-Khelaifi, already seated on UEFA's executive committee, took over ECA to rebuild its credibility. 

The ECA origin story is getting money from FIFA. That was $40 million from 2010 World Cup revenue, paid per a daily rate to clubs globally whose players went to South Africa. 

FIFA will give $355 million from 2026 World Cup income and now will reward hundreds more clubs whose players were selected for all qualifying games.

ECA pushed FIFA to create an insurance fund paying some salary of players injured with national teams. FIFA has budgeted $36 million this year.

National teams no longer have one-game breaks in February and August. FIFA's match calendar has less long-haul travel for players with fewer international breaks.

Al-Khelaifi also played hardball with FIFA to drive up prize money guarantees for playing in the revamped, $2 billion Club World Cup this year.

Today's Champions League has 36 teams instead of 32, each playing eight games instead of six, and more against higher-profile opponents. The league phase now has 144 games instead of 96 in the old format shaped by UEFA.

This season's Champions League prize money fund is nearly 2.5 billion euros ($2.92 billion) compared to 583 million euros ($681 million) in ECA's debut season.

UEFA's annual payment toward ECA running costs increased 15-fold from 1.6 million euros ($1.87 million) in 2008 to 25 million euros ($29.2 million) last year as member services increase. 

Clubs have since 2017 had two seats on UEFA's executive committee. Today it is Al-Khelaifi and Miguel Ángel Gil from Atletico Madrid, back in the fold after joining the Super League.

A 2012 renewal of the ECA-UEFA working accord guaranteed “Referral Right” on all club football decisions.

That was used in 2016 — when UEFA had no president — to guarantee four Champions League group-stage entries to highest-ranked nations. That sweetheart deal for England, Spain, Germany and Italy led to lower-ranked nations getting the third-tier Conference League.

UEFA also gave ECA more influence in managing competitions which became a formal commercial joint venture, called UC3. That gave clubs even more say on decisions, including picking United States-based agency Relevent to sell future Champions League broadcast and sponsor deals through 2033.

ECA took no public position on multi-club ownership — investors having stakes in multiple teams — that is widely unpopular with fans and UEFA itself said poses threats to integrity in its competitions and the transfer market.

One MCO debacle involved Florida-based 777 Partners who even got one of its executives on the ECA board representing Standard Liege.

ECA widened its membership base from 250 clubs to around 800 since a rival group, the Union of European Clubs, launched to represent smaller clubs who feel frozen out.

How will the Champions League evolve or be replaced? And will UEFA or the clubs drive that change and organize the next version?

Scoreboard watching season has hit MLS, and interested parties can turn their full attention to the Los Angeles Football Club twice in five days.

Entering the latest FIFA international break, LAFC has three matches remaining on the league calendar, more than any other team. Postponements stemming from the FIFA Club World Cup and a horrendous natural disaster in Texas pushed matches from June and July, against Toronto FC and Austin FC, respectively, to the stretch run heading into the MLS Cup playoffs.

The lone MLS match on Wednesday features Toronto visiting BMO Stadium.

LAFC (16-7-8, 56 points) can surpass Minnesota for third place in the Western Conference standings with a sixth consecutive victory.

If Coach Steve Cherundolo's group then makes it seven in a row on Sunday at playoff-bound Austin, second place is the worst spot the Black & Gold could occupy before Decision Day. In case Vancouver drops points at Orlando on Saturday, LAFC might even hold the top seed when it visits Colorado on Oct. 18 for the regular-season finale.

“There's just a lot of math and scoreboard watching that goes on, but at the end of the day we know that it's about us,” forward Jeremy Ebobisse said Tuesday. “I also know personally that it's about momentum going into the playoffs and right now we have a ton of that.”

Since the start of August when Son Heung-min and Denis Bouanga joined forces in the LAFC attack, the duo's record-setting torrent of goals helped orchestrate a 6-1-2 tear that has the club looking like a top contender again.

But LAFC will be without Son and Bouanga for the next two games. The pair, who have combined to score the past 18 goals for LAFC, have joined their national teams, as have fellow forward Nathan Ordaz and midfielder Mathieu Choinière.

“It's a great opportunity for other guys who are hungry to get on the field, who have been itching to get on the field,” midfielder Mark Delgado said. “So, yeah, it's a great moment for guys to step in and show why they're here, show why they want to be here, and continue pushing this winning streak.”

Delgado, a 14-year MLS veteran, was among the players Cherundolo said he could count on. The midfielder's initial season with LAFC following a trade with the Galaxy, where he won the MLS Cup in 2024, has yielded a career-high nine assists and 12 goal contributions.

“I think I've kinda been given freedom,” said the 30-year-old native of Glendora. “That's the best way to put it. Steve believes in me. The coaching staff believes in me. I think that's the biggest key here.”

A mainstay with Toronto from 2015 to 2021, Delgado netted an MLS Cup and Supporters' Shield in Canada. Since his departure, his former club has struggled to find that level.

Lately, though, the Robin Fraser-led group has been a tough out, earning draws in eight straight matches (five against playoff teams) while conceding just a goal per game.

“You definitely gotta respect that,” Delgado said. “They've got a lot of grit.”

Eliminated from playoff contention on Sept. 13, Toronto (5-13-14, 29 points) last won at San Diego on July 16 – a shocking result that could ultimately cost the expansion side a conference title to LAFC's benefit.

Toronto will also sacrifice players to international duty Wednesday, but recent additions such as former LAFC midfielder Jose Cifuentes, a key contributor on the 2022 MLS Cup squad, and Djordje Mihailovic, a goal-scoring pest with Colorado prior to being traded in early August, are expected to play.

Immigration difficulties, mass deportation raids and climate issues have plagued the United States, the biggest of the three World Cup host countries, for most of 2025. With the first phase of ticket sales leaving fans astounded by the record-high prices, it raises the question: how much will fans really be able to enjoy the 2026 World Cup?

Since Donald Trump's return to power, the US has made entering the country a nightmare for many.

Unpredictable rejections and even detentions at the border made headlines early in the year, notably in March when German citizens were being detained by US immigration.

The previous two World Cups had a fast-track, temporary visa process, but the US has yet to offer such a program. The final tournament schedule won't be clear until the draw on December 5, leaving many fans facing a lengthy bureaucratic process before even knowing when, or if, their country will play.

For some, attending the tournament may already be legally impossible. At the start of the summer, Trump announced a new list of countries whose citizens are outright banned from traveling to the USA. An exception was defined for the players and staff from any sporting team taking part in the tournament, meaning the teams will be allowed in, but fans will be left sitting at home.

So far, the only nation from that list which has qualified for the World Cup is Iran. But local media in Brazil has speculated that their fans may also be barred from travel, as Trump has heavily sanctioned the South American country over the prosecution of former president and ideological ally Jair Bolsonaro. A World Cup without fans from Brazil, the only country to have qualified for every edition, is unimaginable.

As difficult as getting into the country may be, staying might be just as hard. Mass deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been carried out across the country for months now. The targets are usually large, liberal-voting cities such as Los Angelesand Chicago. Many of these cities will be host sites for the tournament next year.

During the summer's Club World Cup, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made its presence known. In a post on X, they stated their officers were ""suited and booted ready to provide security."" Despite quickly deleting the post, they still advised attendees to carry proof of legal status.

Though the tournament ultimately concluded without any major ICE-related incidents, the statements caused enough fear to keep many fans away. Should this continue into next year, many fans might be discouraged from traveling.

On top of these civil rights concerns, comes the financial impact on fans.

The most expensive 2026 final tickets are nearly four times higher than those in Qatar 2022 – from roughly $1,600 (€1,375) then to over $6,300 (€5,400) now.

Prices vary for the group stage and opening matches of each host nation. Matches played in Los Angeles and San Francisco, for example, are more expensive than those in Dallas and Philadelphia. But even with these disparities, group stage tickets, historically the cheapest of the tournament, are still about three times higher than the last edition.

Combined with ""variable-pricing"" schemes and resale portals with no price cap, simply getting a ticket could cost fans hundreds to thousands of dollars. Travel to the country and accommodation costs will make the trip even more untenable.

Along with the financial cost, there is also a large environmental one.

After the last World Cup took place in the small Gulf state of Qatar, this edition sees games taking place across the biggest three North American nations. This means teams and fans will have to rely primarily on air travel. The US will play its first game in Los Angeles, the second in Seattle, and the third again back in LA. That's nearly 2,000 miles traveled on the most pollutive form of transportation.

While car rentals and ridesharing might offer a possiblity for traveling fans, the increase in road traffic is expected to be so great it will reportedly contribute to making this World Cup the most polluting ever.

Public transportation options also remain a major concern. The AT&T Stadium near Dallas, for example, will host the most matches of any venue but cannot be reached by public transport.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has reassured the public that immigration issues will not be a concern.

""There is definitely a commitment of the government in the United States to make sure that the process is smooth, so fans from all over the world will be welcome,"" Infantino said during a press conference in August. He did not, however, detail how this process will work.

FIFA's media director Bryan Swanson defended the ticket pricing structure, saying it is crucial to have ""a ticketing model that reflects our responsibility to provide access to fans, while at the same time ensuring as much value as possible is retained for redistribution into the game around the world.""

When it comes to civil and human rights concerns, a group of 90 rights groups signed an open letter to FIFA asking them to address the growing abuses in the United States. No direct response was given.","{'href': 'https://uk.news.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo News UK'}","soccer"

La Liga

Xabi Alonso has taken a different approach to his predecessor Carlo Ancelotti in press conferences NurPhoto

There are plenty of positives for Real Madrid under Xabi Alonso going into this international break.

They are two points clear of Barcelona at the top of La Liga after winning all but one of their opening eight games. They are up and running in the Champions League with two wins from two and stars such as Kylian Mbappe, Arda Guler and Franco Mastantuono are shining.

Advertisement

The caveats? That sole defeat in their domestic league was a 5-2 thrashing by Atletico Madrid in the derby. And they have some big injury concerns before the first Clasico of the season on October 26, with both of their senior right-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dani Carvajal in a race against time to be fit for the game against Barca at the Bernabeu.

We asked you to pose your questions to our Real Madrid correspondents, Mario Cortegana and Guillermo Rai, about the campaign so far and much more besides — including Alonso and Carlo Ancelotti's contrasting communication styles, Antonio Rudiger's future and where the club stand on playing games abroad.



In my experience with Alonso, he is a coach who listens to your questions with great attention.

By contrast, my feeling with his predecessor Carlo Ancelotti was that he listened more actively only at the start, then started to think quickly about his answer and even cut you off if it was a topic he was not comfortable with — for example on issues related to the lack of opportunities he gave to young players.

But Ancelotti was a master at handling tense or uncomfortable situations. Alonso is comfortable communicating and has an intellectual background, with lots of cultural interests. But sometimes I think he can come across as if he is trying too hard to show he is in control of things and that everything is fine.

Another point is that Alonso likes to talk in depth about football. In just the few months in which he has been in charge, we have heard concepts about the game and touched on topics that were not previously broached in the press room at Madrid's Valdebebas training ground.

Advertisement

That said, my feeling is we have yet to see the real Alonso. We are now, as Ancelotti would say, in a honeymoon phase. But there will be criticism, some bad results and potentially more player drama to come…

Mario Cortegana

I am very curious to see how the situation with the centre-backs will develop in the coming year in terms of signings, renewals, exits and perhaps even some youngsters being promoted from the academy.

Rudiger's future remains open. A few months ago, reports elsewhere suggested Madrid were going to bypass their unwritten rule with players more than 30 years old by offering the German an extension longer than a year — but, to the best of my knowledge, this is not accurate. I also do not think it is accurate that he will leave as a free agent next summer, as has been reported recently.

The 32-year-old has not been able to play normally due to two injuries (first to his knee and then his left leg) and surgery. He has also not been helped by the club failing to sign a centre-back in the summer of 2024, and how much Ancelotti had to play him given the dearth of other options. Rudiger made a huge effort to help the team in a difficult campaign last term, even delaying necessary knee surgery and playing through the pain.

I do not think we have seen the last of Rudiger at a high level in this team. And that is why no decision has yet been taken by either the club or the player. Saudi Pro League sides have shown an interest in him and it is an attractive destination for the defender, but it is only October and nothing is clear yet.

Mario Cortegana

Both Guler and Bellingham are highly regarded by the coaching staff and club. Twenty-year-old Guler has shone this season, with three goals and four assists in 10 appearances, while Bellingham has just returned from shoulder surgery, featuring five times.

Advertisement

In principle, following the international break, the Englishman will have a more prominent role and take up attacking positions, just as Guler has been doing from the start of this season. But Alonso regularly uses a 4-4-2 system, which makes it possible for both of them to play together. It is worth remembering they also have to contend with another attacking midfielder in Franco Mastantuono, who has played 538 minutes so far and is seen as another hugely promising young player.

Alonso himself has said in several press conferences that there is a lot of competition for attacking positions. That is why it is not surprising that playing time is more evenly distributed and we see him rotating Guler and Mastantuono. But, if Madrid face a weaker opponent and Alonso's team suffer injuries, we may see the three attacking midfielders playing together.

Guillermo Rai

Hi Mychal! Thanks for your question — we will be publishing an article on Endrick's situation later this week to explain in depth what has been going on with the Brazilian this year.

But just to add a nuance to your question: it is not accurate to say Alonso has not given him a chance in 10 games. Endrick was only available against Getafe after returning from a relapse of the hamstring tendon injury in his right leg that he suffered in May, so in reality it would be five games — although that is still significant.

Sorry that we cannot provide more details at this point, but stay tuned!

Mario Cortegana

Sources involved in the proposed European Super League project — who, like all those cited in this article, asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships — say Perez continues to support it.

But the latest developments suggest there has been a rapprochement between the parties. Several meetings have taken place between executives such as UEFA general secretary Theodore Theodoridis and the co-founder of A22, the company promoting the Super League, Anas Laghrari.

At these meetings, A22 proposed a new format for the Champions League in which the top 18 teams (according to UEFA rankings) face each other in the first eight matchdays, to come into effect in 2027. UEFA's response so far has been that they do not plan to change their premier competition.

This week, UEFA reluctantly approved European matches being staged abroad — meaning Villarreal's ‘home' game against Barcelona in December is close to going ahead in Miami. Madrid have strongly opposed that idea publicly and privately, even publishing a statement against it in August. It forms part of a long-running battle between Madrid and La Liga under the leadership of Javier Tebas.

Madrid also have the support of Spain's High Sports Council (CSD, which forms part of the Spanish government). That body wants all domestic sports competitions to be held in Spain, along with as many international tournaments as possible (the country will co-host the 2030 World Cup with Portugal and Morocco, while the 2031 Ryder Cup will take place on the Costa Brava, near Barcelona. The CSD requested information this week from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) about the match in Miami and how it fits with the federation's regulations.

An exception was defined for the players and staff from any sporting team taking part in the tournament, meaning the teams will be allowed in, but fans will be left sitting at home.

So far, the only nation from that list which has qualified for the World Cup is Iran. But local media in Brazil has speculated that their fans may also be barred from travel, as Trump has heavily sanctioned the South American country over the prosecution of former president and ideological ally Jair Bolsonaro. A World Cup without fans from Brazil, the only country to have qualified for every edition, is unimaginable.

As difficult as getting into the country may be, staying might be just as hard. Mass deportation raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have been carried out across the country for months now. The targets are usually large, liberal-voting cities such as  Los Angelesand Chicago. Many of these cities will be host sites for the tournament next year.

During the summer's Club World Cup, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made its presence known. In a post on X, they stated their officers were ""suited and booted ready to provide security."" Despite quickly deleting the post, they still advised attendees to carry proof of legal status.

Though the tournament ultimately concluded without any major ICE-related incidents, the statements caused enough fear to keep many fans away. Should this continue into next year, many fans might be discouraged from traveling.

On top of these civil rights concerns, comes the financial impact on fans.

The most expensive 2026 final tickets are nearly four times higher than those in Qatar 2022 – from roughly $1,600 (€1,375) then to over $6,300 (€5,400) now.

Prices vary for the group stage and opening matches of each host nation. Matches played in Los Angeles and San Francisco, for example, are more expensive than those in Dallas and Philadelphia. But even with these disparities, group stage tickets, historically the cheapest of the tournament, are still about three times higher than the last edition.

Combined with ""variable-pricing"" schemes and resale portals with no price cap, simply getting a ticket could cost fans hundreds to thousands of dollars. Travel to the country and accommodation costs will make the trip even more untenable.

Along with the financial cost, there is also a large environmental one.

After the last World Cup took place in the small Gulf state of Qatar, this edition sees games taking place across the biggest three North American nations. This means teams and fans will have to rely primarily on air travel. The US will play its first game in Los Angeles, the second in Seattle, and the third again back in LA. That's nearly 2,000 miles traveled on the most pollutive form of transportation.

While car rentals and ridesharing might offer a possiblity for traveling fans, the increase in road traffic is expected to be so great it will reportedly contribute to making this World Cup the most polluting ever.

Public transportation options also remain a major concern. The AT&T Stadium near Dallas, for example, will host the most matches of any venue but cannot be reached by public transport.

FIFA President Gianni Infantino has reassured the public that immigration issues will not be a concern.

""There is definitely a commitment of the government in the United States to make sure that the process is smooth, so fans from all over the world will be welcome,"" Infantino said during a press conference in August. He did not, however, detail how this process will work.

FIFA's media director Bryan Swanson defended the ticket pricing structure, saying it is crucial to have ""a ticketing model that reflects our responsibility to provide access to fans, while at the same time ensuring as much value as possible is retained for redistribution into the game around the world.""

When it comes to civil and human rights concerns, a group of 90 rights groups signed an open letter to FIFA asking them to address the growing abuses in the United States. No direct response was given.","{'href': 'https://www.dw.com', 'title': 'DW'}","soccer"

Steve Nicol believes Mo Salah could be facing a crisis in confidence this season as his struggles continued vs Chelsea. (1:35)

Expect high tension and crushing heartbreak this international break as Africa's World Cup qualifying program reaches a climax with the final two matchdays of the group-stage campaign.

There's still so much up for grabs across the nine groups, with only two teams -- Morocco and Tunisia -- guaranteed to take their place among the elite in North America next year.

Here are the big storylines set to unravel during what should be a pulsating week of football across the continent.

Surely, the biggest story of the week will come if and when Cape Verde Islands secure their maiden qualification for a World Cup, which the minnows appear destined to complete across the next two matchdays.

Leading Group D on 19 points, four ahead of second-placed Cameroon, the islanders simply need one victory from their remaining fixtures to guarantee their place on the grandest stage.

This will be a remarkable feat, even in this era of the expanded 48-team tournament, given that Cape Verde, population of just over 500,000 people, will be the second-smallest World Cup qualifiers in history -- behind Iceland.

Cape Verde's rise to prominence has been outstanding; No. 70 in the FIFA World Rankings, the Sharks reached the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time only in 2013, and they have grown in prominence after tapping into the country's extensive diaspora.

With Libya away and tiny Eswatini at home during the October internationals, expect Cape Verde to prompt carnivalesque celebrations when the dust settles on their qualifying campaign.

Cameroon are Africa's most successful side in terms of World Cup qualification, having reached the tournament eight times, and given their wealth of talent they would have fancied their chances of progressing again when Group D was drawn.

But their prospects have been undermined by the chaotic managerial tenure of Belgian Marc Brys against a backdrop of the at-times bewildering presidency of Cameroon's football association chief Samuel Eto'o.

They were held away in Libya, Angola and Eswatini, before being defeated by Cape Verde in Praia in September, and they will be aware that the group leaders are unlikely to slip up at this late stage.

The Central Africans can still finish second in the group, and then could keep alive their hopes of advancing to the playoffs as one of the four best-placed runners-up, but even that would leave them up struggling to salvage their campaign.

""[We want to be] as high as possible [in the group],"" Brys told state television CRTV. ""So we'd like to be the best second-placed team to qualify, and we'll see afterwards... but to finish first [in the group] is not possible.""

It is rare to see such a defeatist attitude coming from the Cameroon camp, but it's hard to argue with his pessimism.

Africa World Cup Qualifying: Full Fixtures and Results

Complete Standings: Africa World Cup Standings

FIFA docked South Africa three points for fielding the suspended (and therefore ineligible) Teboho Mokoena in their 2-0 victory over Lesotho in March, taking Bafana Bafana from top of the group -- three points ahead of Benin -- to level with their nearest rivals on points but behind on goal difference.

The penalty hasn't destroyed South Africa's hopes, particularly considering Benin have to travel away to Nigeria for their final fixture, while Bafana face Zimbabwe in Durban and Rwanda in Mbombela. However, there must be an inquisition at South African Football Association as to how the bungle took place, jeopardising the team's prospects of reaching the World Cup.

Benin may yet prove to be the big winners as they seek a maiden qualification, but Nigeria appear to have left it too late to salvage their campaign.

A draw away in South Africa in September may have been a decent result, but it nevertheless left Éric Sékou Chelle's side three points off the group leaders and requiring a dramatic improvement having won only two of eight qualifiers.

Nigeria will be delighted to welcome back Galatasaray superstar Victor Osimhen, who suffered injury against Rwanda in matchday seven, thereby missing the 1-1 draw with Bafana.

Nigeria have failed to qualify only twice since 1990, and they have never missed consecutive editions since they were first present at the global showpiece.

Morocco have breezed through qualification, winning all seven of their matches, scoring 21 goals and conceding just two, in becoming the first African team to book a place at the competition.

Set to be the favourites for the Africa Cup of Nations on home soil later this year, and having become the first African side to reach the World Cup quarterfinals, at the tournament in Qatar, the Atlas Lions are surely the continent's best hope of another strong performance in North America next year.

Before that, they conclude their qualification campaign when hosting Congo in Rabat on Oct. 14, looking to maintain their 100% record.

No African team has ever reached the World Cup with a perfect record during qualification, but it must be acknowledged that Morocco have had to play fewer games this campaign due to the withdrawal of Eritrea.

Algeria's supporters watched during the 1990s and 2000s, as Zinedine Zidane, raised in Marseille by Algerian-born parents, amassed more than 100 appearances for France, winning the 1998 World Cup and the 2000 European Championship in the process.

Zinedine, one of football's greatest players, now will surely be watching Algeria as his son Luca is in line to debut for Algeria.

A France player up to under-20 level, Zidane jr. featured under his father at Real Madrid, and is now on the books of LaLiga 2 club Granada; the goalkeeper has kept one clean sheet in seven league outings this season.

The 27-year-old now has the opportunity to establish himself as the first choice with the Fennecs, for whom the likes of Alexis Guendouz, Oussama Benbot, Anthony Mandrea and Alexandre Oukidja have struggled to take command of the No. 1 shirt.

""To discuss who will be the No. 1 now would be premature,"" head coach Vladimir Petkovic said this month, seemingly opening the door to a Zidane debut against either Somalia or Uganda this week.

Victory in either game would be enough to guarantee the North Africans' place at the tournament.

Elsewhere, Egypt will qualify with two more points, which should be secured when they face Djibouti in Casablanca on Wednesday, while Senegal are in pole position to advance from Group B ahead of Congo DR.

Senegal won the showdown between the two group leaders 3-2 in Kinshasa last month, with Pape Matar Sarr scoring an 87th-minute winner, and they will be optimistic of easing into the tournament as they round out their campaign against South Sudan and Mauritania.

Gabon failed to beat Ivory Coast at home in September, meaning the reigning African champions occupy top spot in Group F with two games to play.

There's only one point between the two sides, but the Elephants -- facing Seychelles away and Kenya at home -- will be confident of taking maximum points to qualify ahead of the Gabonese, for whom Denis Bouanga is the top scorer among all teams in the qualifying campaign.

In Group I, Ghana should end a miserable year on a high with progression -- they are three points ahead of Madagascar -- although both the Barea and third-placed Comoros, one point behind, will fancy their chances of at least sneaking through to the playoffs.","{'href': 'https://africa.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

It has been nearly seven months since Manchester United revealed their plans to build an ambitious new 100,000-seater stadium on the same site as Old Trafford with a glitzy video presented by world-famous architect Norman Foster. ""Today marks the start of an incredibly exciting journey to the delivery of what will be the world's greatest football stadium,"" said an excited Sir Jim Ratcliffe in March.

That journey, however, has proved to be a slow one fraught with potholes and snags. The project already faces a race against time to meet the five-year deadline Foster and Ratcliffe boasted of, as the club do not currently own all the land they want to build on, said land is proving far more expensive than they had first thought, and they do not have planning permission or even a confirmed architect. 

The proposed stadium also threatens to be less flashy and ambitious than it looked at its unveiling, as the giant canopy encasing the ground, essentially the unique selling point of the whole project, is in danger of being canned.

It was always going to be interesting to see which way Frank Lampard would turn when his ill-advised, ill-fated second spell in interim charge of Chelsea came to a sorry end in May 2023. With his managerial reputation in tatters following his January sacking by Everton, would he throw himself at the next Premier League vacancy that cropped up, or would he take stock and aim to come back stronger? Two years on, he will be overjoyed that he pipped for the latter.

Having taken a much-needed 18-month break from coaching, Lampard wisely took the step back down to the Championship - where he had enjoyed a successful spell in charge of Derby County - in November 2024, returning to the dugout at Coventry City.

He was by no means a popular appointment at the CBS Arena, with the ownership accused of going for the flashy, big-name option when the club found itself in the kind of sticky situation that required experience and know-how. But in the 11 months since, Lampard has gone about demonstrating his pedigree at that level and restored his long-lost status as arguably one of the most exciting younger English coaches around.

With the October international break now upon us, Coventry sit at the summit of the Championship table; they have got there by playing an irresistible brand of attacking football that has blown their rivals out of the water in the opening weeks of the season, and suddenly they look like serious contenders for promotion after suffering play-off heartbreak last term.

 Felix Auger-Aliassime produced a clinical display in a high-stakes fourth-round showdown Wednesday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. 

 The 12th seed eased past Lorenzo Musetti 6-4, 6-2 to reach the quarter-finals at the Chinese ATP Masters 1000 event. Auger-Aliassime converted three of six points he earned in his 85-minute victory inside Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena, where he will on Friday take on Arthur Rinderknech in the last eight. 

Another chapter written 📚📷@felixtennis becomes the first Canadian to reach the final eight in Shanghai, a 60th career quarter-final for Felix@SH_RolexMasters| #RolexShanghaiMasters pic.twitter.com/4jeZGJ7vbQ

 [That was] 'inspired Felix' I guess,” said Auger-Aliassime, when asked to describe his performance. “I felt like I was playing fast, but I was seeing the game slow. It's weird when you get these kinds of nights. 

 “I've been trying to work my way there obviously for a while now, working on this type of game plan, but to execute it live on a match court at this stage against an opponent like this is a different story to practice. I'm very pleased, because to play like this means things are coming along nicely.” 

 Wednesday's encounter between eighth seed Musetti and Auger-Aliassime held big implications in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, with the eighth-placed Musetti having the opportunity to widen the gap between himself and 10th-placed Auger-Aliassime. Yet by sinking Musetti for his fifth win against a Top 10 opponent in 2025, the 10th-placed Auger-Aliassime has moved to within 530 points of his rival as both players vie for a Nitto ATP Finals spot. 

 Prior to Shanghai, Auger-Aliassime reached the Cincinnati quarter-finals and the US Open semi-finals. The Canadian brought similar form to his clash in China with Musetti, in which he fired 24 winners, including seven aces, to his opponent's 11. 

 The 25-year-old also saved all three break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and he has now held in 28 of 29 service games across his three matches in Shanghai so far. After avenging his defeats in his two previous meetings with Musetti (Paris 2024 Olympics, Miami 2025), Auger-Aliassime has levelled the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 4-4.

 Daniil Medvedev dug deep to avoid a repeat disappointment against Learner Tien on the hard courts of China with a dramatic Wednesday-night win at the Rolex Shanghai Masters. 

 The 29-year-old recovered from a bout of cramp late in the second set to overcome #NextGenATP American Tien 7-6(6), 6-7(1), 6-4 in an engrossing encounter at the ATP Masters 1000 event. Just eight days after Medvedev was forced to retire from the deciding set of the pair's semi-final in Beijing due to cramp, the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings was this time able to ward off his physical struggles and rouse a late charge to victory. 

Meddy's Moment! 👏@DaniilMedwed outlasts Tien (7-6 6-7 6-4) in an EPIC encounter to advance into the Shanghai quarter-finals@SH_RolexMasters | #RolexShanghaiMasterspic.twitter.com/Ah3jbLrNUs

 “I think the toughest part was that we played two times [before], and in my opinion he is an unbelievable player, because he doesn't have a great serve and serve is so important in tennis,"" said Medvedev. ""Without the serve, he is 19 years old and 30-something in the world and only going up. In my opinion he is such a good tennis player. 

 “He feels the game so well. There are so many guys right now that just hit strong with every ball they have, and they have an amazing serve which allows them to stay in the tennis match. He doesn't have it, and he manages to play so good without it. For me to beat him… I thought I was going to lose. I was cramping again and I'm just super happy to manage to do it.” 

 In a topsy-turvy two-hour, 53-minute encounter, Medvedev failed to serve out the first set at 5-4 before prevailing in a tie-break, and then carved out a 3-0 lead in the second. Yet Tien roared back and won the second set in a tie-break during which Medvedev was nearly completely immobilised due to the cramps in his right leg. 

 The 2019 Shanghai champion Medvedev appeared out of contention at that point, but his body loosened after the changeover between sets and he produced some typically robust tennis into the decider. Despite regularly chuntering to himself in a frustrated fashion throughout, Medvedev decisively broke serve in the ninth game before serving out to earn his first victory in three Lexus ATP Head2Head meetings with the 19-year-old Tien.

 All three of Medvedev and Tien's meetings have proven dramatic. At the Australian Open, Tien prevailed in a five-set thriller that ended just before 3 a.m. local time, while the pair's Beijing and Shanghai clashes have been dominated by Medvedev's battles with his body. 

 Now into his third Masters 1000 quarter-final of the season (Indian Wells, Madrid), Medvedev will next face seventh seed Alex de Minaur, who earlier defeated Nuno Borges 7-5, 6-2 to book his spot in the last eight.

Alex de Minaur recorded his 50th tour-level victory of the season on Wednesday at the Rolex Shanghai Masters, where he moved past Nuno Borges 7-5, 6-2 to reach his seventh ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final.

De Minaur is just the third man to hit the 50-win mark in 2025, joining Carlos Alcaraz (67) and Taylor Fritz (50), with the Australian earning a Tour-leading 37 victories on hard courts. Playing with confidence and controlled aggression against Borges, De Minaur struck 19 winners to just 10 unforced errors en route to a one-hour, 47-minute triumph in the pair's first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting.

De Minaur's previous best season in 2024 culminated in 47 wins and two titles, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. Having lifted the trophy at the ATP 500 event in Washington in August, the 26-year-old is chasing his second title of the year in Shanghai, where he will next meet Daniil Medvedev or #NextGenATP American Learner Tien.

""For me it just shows consistency and that is what I am most proud of,"" De Minaur said on earning 50 tour-level wins. ""Showing up every single week and it is an amazing number. I am hoping for many more to finish off the year and not stay at 50. It has been a successful trip to Asia so far. I told myself at the start of the week that it was all going to be a big mental effort to go out there and compete. I am happy to be in the quarter-finals and give myself another opportunity.""



De Minaur arrived in Shanghai off the back of a semi-final showing in Beijing and his latest run is further improving his Nitto ATP Finals qualification chances. The 10-time tour-level champion is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, 740 points clear of 10th-placed Felix Auger-Aliassime, who is the first player outside the Top 8 cut due to ninth-placed Jack Draper being sidelined for the rest of the year with injury.

De Minaur, who made his debut at the prestigious year-end event in 2024, would rise to fourth in the Live Race if he captures his maiden Masters 1000 title in Shanghai.

Earlier, Arthur Rinderknech backed up his win against World No. 3 Alexander Zverev by defeating Jiri Lehecka 6-3, 7-6(5) to reach his maiden Masters 1000 quarter-final. The Frenchman, who is up to No. 43 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, has joined his cousin Valentin Vacherot in the last eight. Following his win, Rinderknech wrote a message of support for qualifier Vacherot, who is the first Monegasque player to reach a tour-level quarter-final in history.

The family WhatsApp group for Arthur Rinderknech and Valentin Vacherot has been busy during the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Frenchman Rinderknech and Vacherot of Monaco are cousins and are both into the quarter-finals at an ATP Masters 1000 tournament for the first time.

On Wednesday, Rinderknech defeated his third seeded opponent in the tournament, taking out Jiri Lehecka 6-3, 7-5, joining his cousin in the quarter-finals. Vacherot beat Tallon Griekspoor in three sets on Tuesday night.

""Our family WhatsApp group is buzzing a lot the past few days,"" said Rinderknech, who signed the courtside camera lens 'I follow you Val' with a heart emoji after his latest win. ""I can't complain, it's great and it's reuniting the family together, at least online, having some fun. Everybody's watching each other. So it's really cool."" 

Vacherot's coach is half-brother Benjamin Balleret, who also played on the ATP Tour and reached a career-high No. 204 in the PIF ATP Rankings in June 2006. Balleret says there's a lot of excitement from both families back home.

""There are 20, 25 people in the WhatsApp group,"" said Balleret. ""Everybody loves tennis and the mother of Arthur played tennis. My mother played, our mother with Val was a tennis coach. Everybody loves tennis and follows and they supported me when I was playing, now [it is the same] for Val and Arthur. It is basically almost all now only about tennis and where the next holidays will be and how it will be.""

Rinderknech is 6-3 vs. Top 20 opponents since June, after going 0-16 from the start of the 2023 season up until June. He defeated 28th seed Alex Michelsen in the second round and third seed Alexander Zverev in the third round. It's the first time Rinderknech has registered multiple Top 20 wins in a tournament in his career.

""My serve was good today and I am really glad,” said Rinderknech, who will improve from No. 54 to No. 43 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, just one spot from his career-high of No. 42 on October 31, 2022. “I knew it was going to be important against a player like Jiri, because he's really good on serve as well. So the serve was going to be really important. I came out a bit on fire today and it was a good match and being able to close in two sets, that was important and really happy about it.”

World No. 204 Vacherot qualified and he is the first player from Monaco to advance to an ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final and the lowest-ranked quarter-finalist in tournament history (since 2009). He's also only the third qualifier to reach the quarter-finals in Shanghai, joining Matthew Ebden (2011) and Mischa Zverev (2016).

""He's playing good tennis this week and has been playing great tennis for few years now,” Rinderknech said on Vacherot. “He just battled a few injuries, but whenever he's playing he's always doing great, so just a matter of time for him. I'm really happy and glad that he's showing his best tennis this week.  I hope and I think that's only the beginning for him.""






Vacherot, who plays 10th seed Holger Rune on Thursday, reached a career-high No. 110 in June last year but a right shoulder injury sidelined him for the second half of last year.
""He couldn't serve or hit a forehand,"" said Balleret. ""We were almost scared at some point that he couldn't play tennis for even two years or something. We tried many things and he actually tried to play at the US Open qualies but he played one match, and in the second match he retired in the second set. So it was a tough moment.""
The 26-year-old Monaco native is playing in only his second tour-level event of the season after reaching the second round on home soil at the Rolex Monte Carlo Masters in April. That was also his first career main draw in an ATP Masters 1000 tournament. He is 22-16 on the ATP Challenger Tour with his best result a runner-up in Francavilla al Mare, Italy in May.
Vacherot has jumped from No. 204 to No. 130 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and with a win against Rune, he will join his cousin in the Top 100 for the first time at No. 92.
""I don't think I could realise what I was doing this whole week, and it kind of all just hit me when I just won that match,"" said Vacherot after his fourth round win. ""Generally I was happy this whole week, but not like through the roof. This one is unbelievable, so much emotions.  Just thinking of the tough times I had last year, even this year, and just to share that with my coach, brother, and my girlfriend, it's just unbelievable.  I'm having one of the best times of my life.""

Rinderknech and Vacherot were college teammates at Texas A&M University for two and a half years in 2016-17 and the first half of 2018. They were also doubles partners on occasion.
""I recruited him to College Station,"" said Rinderknech. ""I was there two years ahead of him, and we had two and a half years I think in common. It was a great time together and we spent so many days doing many things and having a lot of fun, so it was really cool to be together in the same team and same place for a few years.""
Now the former college teammates will be watching each other in Shanghai along with their families back home.

Three-time champion Aryna Sabalenka improved her perfect record at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open to 18-0 after coming from a set down to defeat Rebecca Sramkova.

Returning to action for the first time since claiming her fourth Grand Slam crown at the US Open, World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka needed a set to find her groove at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open. Once she did, though, she motored to a 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 win over Rebecca Sramkova in 1 hour and 58 minutes.

Wuhan: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Famously, Wuhan has long been one of Sabalenka's favored hunting grounds. She won her first WTA 1000 title here back in 2018, and has yet to lose a match at the tournament. The three-time champion extended her perfect record in Wuhan to 18-0 -- the longest such streak at a single event since Caroline Wozniacki won her first 20 matches at New Haven, including three titles, between 2008 and 2012.

Sramkova also came into the match with an unbeaten record in Wuhan -- albeit based on just a single match, her first-round defeat of Anna Kalinskaya. Twelve months ago, the Slovak was surging into the Top 50 after winning her first WTA title in Hua Hin and making a further two finals in Monastir and Jiujiang. This week marked her Wuhan debut.

Next, Sabalenka will resume her rivalry with Liudmila Samsonova in the third round. The No. 16 seed came from a set down to defeat Sofia Kenin for the first time in three meetings, advancing 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 in 1 hour and 56 minutes. Sabalenka owns a 3-2 head-to-head advantage over Samsonova, including straight-sets victories in their two most recent encounters, at Cincinnati 2024 and Indian Wells 2025.

How did Sramkova threaten the upset?

No. 66-ranked Sramkova wasted no time in asserting herself on the match. Three clean winners in the first game, including two spectacular returns, enabled her to break Sabalenka's serve immediately.

That set the tone for a first set in which Sramkova aimed to land the biggest blows first in every exchange, and largely succeeded. She tallied 15 winners in the set, including five aces and four returns. By contrast, Sabalenka managed just three winners off the ground.

How did Sabalenka turn the match around?

Though the top seed got a pair of solid service holds on the board to lead 2-1 in the second set, Sramkova was still coming up with the more impressive plays on offense. But as Sramkova was poised at 40-15 to level at 2-2, Sabalenka stepped up to the plate. She slammed consecutive winners on both game points, and snatched the first break of the set as Sramkova sent a forehand wide.

Sabalenka didn't relinquish this momentum for the rest of the match. She began to withstand Sramkova's first strike, and in longer high-octane exchanges she invariably found a higher level. Her winner tally rose to 24 across the second and third sets, including 20 off the ground.

The four-time major champion faced two potential turning points in the last two sets, and passed both tests with clutch tennis. At 4-2 in the second set and at 4-1 in the third, Sabalenka came through multi-deuce tussles in which she had to save four break points each time. Having lost both of the break points she faced in the opener, she saved all nine in the second and third sets.

""I have to say she played incredible tennis, especially in the first set,"" Sabalenka said in her on-court interview. ""Not much I could do. I knew that after that little break [since the US Open] it would not be easy to get back in my rhythm, but I'm really glad that in the second set I found my game, I stepped in and I think I played really great.""

Beijing finalist Linda Noskova is still going strong at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open, defeating Naomi Osaka in the second round to notch her 10th Top 20 win of 2025 in her first week as a Top 20 player herself.

Despite a gruelling breakthrough fortnight at the China Open, Linda Noskova is still going strong in the sweltering conditions of the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open. The 20-year-old Czech took down yet another big name in the second round on Wednesday, out-serving No. 11 seed Naomi Osaka 7-6(2), 6-3 in 1 hour and 28 minutes.

Wuhan: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Noskova has barely had a moment to breathe over the past week. On Saturday, she overcame Jessica Pegula from three match points down in a Beijing semifinal barnburner to reach her first WTA 1000 final. On Sunday, she lost in three hard-hitting sets to Amanda Anisimova. Two days later, she was back on court for her Wuhan first round, battling late into the evening to hold off Yulia Putintseva in a third-set tiebreak.

Less than 24 hours after that, Noskova powered to her 10th Top 20 win of 2025 over Osaka, in her first week as a Top 20 player (at No. 17) herself. She's now won seven of her last eight matches.

For Noskova, the key to keeping her run going has been finding the balance between building on Beijing and starting afresh.

""I try to be as humble as possible, because every tournament is different,"" she said after defeating Osaka. ""You hve to step on a new court almost every single day. So I tried to focus just on this tournament, and leave what happened last week behind.

""But at the same time I want to bring that confidence on court. So I have to take some percentage of it as well.""

The percentage Noskova has retained includes superb serving form. She expected the quality of her delivery to be crucial against fellow big server Osaka, and so it proved: there was just one break of serve in the whole match. It went to Noskova in the penultimate game, allowing her to close out the win with an emphatic hold to 15. She had previously saved all four break points she had faced in the contest.

The serve-dominated dynamic also caused Noskova to note her pride in another area of improvement.

""I'm getting better at tiebreaks, I think,"" she said. ""So it was great to have another one on the board for me.""

The numbers bear out Noskova's feeling. In 2024, she compiled a 12-8 record in tiebreaks. In 2025, she's 14-4 and counting, including two already this week in Wuhan.

She'll have the opportunity to make back-to-back WTA 1000 quarterfinals against another big server in No. 8 seed Elena Rybakina. The Kazakhstani player has won both of their previous meetings, at Roland Garros 2023 and Brisbane 2024, in straight sets.

Jessica Pegula was cruising to victory Wednesday before Hailey Baptiste embarked on a furious rally, saving six match points. But Pegula held on, converting match point No. 7 to win 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (6) in nearly three hours. Meanwhile, Coco Gauff defeated Moyuka Uchijima 6-1, 6-0 in 51 minutes to join Pegula in the third round.

Jessica Pegula and fellow American Hailey Baptiste met for the third time Wednesday at the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open, their first matchup in more than three years.

Wuhan: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Pegula entered seeking her third win in as many meetings with the 23-year-old Baptiste, who was aiming to break through for her first victory in the head-to-head series.

And while it took nearly three hours and seven match points, experience ultimately prevailed. The No. 6 seed held off Baptiste in a gripping three-set battle, winning 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (6) in 2 hours and 55 minutes to reach the third round in Wuhan for the second consecutive year.

Next up for Pegula is No. 9 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova, who defeated another American, Ann Li, in the second round.

“I don't really know what to say about that match,” Pegula said afterward. “It's been brutal. You know, I had match points, and then she started playing well. I think I just got a little tentative, and that's all it takes sometimes for someone to come back. So, I mean, I'm really proud of myself for how I held it together, because I think I easily could've just collapsed. But I held tough, so yeah, that was a wild ride.”

Considering how it ended, it makes the beginning of the match felt almost surreal.

Pegula came out firing in her first match since her heartbreaking semifinal loss to Linda Noskova in Beijing last week, looking sharp and focused on the road ahead.

She broke Baptiste in the opening game, jumping to a 0-40 lead before converting. Pegula then consolidated the break with a gritty hold, saving three break points and surviving four deuces to go up 2-0.

After extending her lead to 4-1, Baptiste clawed back by winning two straight games. But Pegula responded with a love hold to close out the first set in 50 minutes.

Momentum shifted in the second set, as Baptiste broke Pegula twice on her way to leads of 3-0 and 5-2. Though Pegula broke back to narrow the gap to 5-4 -- prompting visible frustration from Baptiste -- the younger American regrouped and converted her second set point after fending off five game points, sealing the set in 52 minutes.

With the heat rule coming into effect for the second straight day in Wuhan, both players declined the option of a 10-minute break between the second and third sets and chose to play on.

Pegula dominated for much of the decider, racing out to a 5-2 lead. Despite the wear and tear of recent matches -- many of the three-set variety -- she looked determined to rebound from a mistake-laden finish to the second set.

But the finish was anything but routine. Pegula squandered five match points as Baptiste mounted a last-ditch rally, leveling the set at 5-all. Pegula then earned a break point to regain control but couldn't convert, allowing Baptiste to surge ahead 6-5, suddenly a game away from victory.

In the end, Pegula held her nerve. She held serve convincingly to force a third-set tiebreak, then after dropping another match point, converted her seventh match point to secure the win after a 74-minute third set.

It was the ultimate definition of survive and advance.

The match marked Pegula's fifth consecutive three-setter, and yet none -- not even the Noskova loss -- matched the drama of this one.

She summed it up with a single word, delivered straight to the camera lens:

“Wow.”

Coco Gauff delivered a “wow” performance of her own Wednesday in Wuhan, albeit in much different fashion than Pegula's preceding marathon on Center Court.

Gauff defeated Moyuka Uchijima 6-1, 6-0 in just 51 minutes to advance to the Dongfeng · Voyah Wuhan Open third round for the second straight year, as she eyes a return to the semifinals.

“Today was a good match for me,” Gauff said in her on-court interview. “I played well, so yeah, I'm just super happy to be back here in Wuhan and moving on to the next round.”

It was a clinical showing from the World No. 3, who won 12 of 13 games and 55 of 77 points. But it was her serve that stood out the most.

Gauff missed just five first serves, finishing at 85% for the match, and dropped only six points on serve. She recorded zero double faults and faced no break points.

She also kept her unforced errors to eight and tallied 16 winners.

In the last three years, Gauff (18) has the most wins on Chinese soil at the WTA level, one more than Zheng Qinwen (17).

While on vacation in Greece following her US Open victory, Aryna Sabalenka spent some quality time with another pretty good tennis player: 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic.

After winning her second consecutive US Open title, Aryna Sabalenka went to her happy place, Greece, for some R&R.

And while she was there, she spent a bit of quality time with another pretty good tennis player: 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic.

Alongside their significant others, Georgios Frangulis and Jelena Djokovic, the foursome enjoyed dinner in Athens. And, naturally, they played some tennis.

A post shared by Aryna Sabalenka (@arynasabalenka)

""He was really competitive, and he was screaming,"" the World No. 1 said. ""But I won a lot of points against him, for the record. I hope he's gonna confirm that. But yeah, we went for dinner. We practiced a couple of times. I hope I was a great hitting partner. So far, he's winning in Shanghai. I guess it was a good one. I really hope he goes all the way. He's gonna win the tournament, and I'm gonna say it was all me.

""But yeah, we had a fun time in Greece. I love them, him and Jelena. He's always open to giving me advice. We had so much fun.""

Djokovic has been winning in Shanghai, and Sabalenka followed suit at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open. Playing in her first match since the US Open, the World No. 1 defeated Rebecca Sramkova 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 to improve to 18-0 all-time in Wuhan, where she is a three-time defending champion dating back to 2018. (The tournament wasn't held between 2020-23.)

Sabalenka arrived early for this tournament -- one of the perks of withdrawing from last week's China Open in Beijing -- and prepared herself for the conditions in Wuhan, where it's been brutally humid.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

""Honestly, I thought this year that the US Open was quite humid, but when I came here, I realized the US Open was not humid at all,"" Sabalenka told reporters in her post-match press conference. ""The humidity is insane, and conditions are incredibly tough. I did a great preparation in Greece, and I came here four or five days [early] to prepare for these conditions. ... I think I'm ready.""

Sabalenka will play 16th seed Liudmila Samsonova in the Round of 16.

I don't really know what to say about that match. It's been brutal. Jessica Pegula

After Baptiste fought off a break point to regain the lead, Pegula regrouped to send their decider into a tiebreak. While Baptiste came within two points of completing a stunning comeback, Pegula eventually wrapped up the battle on her seventh match point. What followed was a roar of delight—and perhaps relief—after Baptiste's forehand flew long to end the clash at two hours and 57 minutes.“I don't really know what to say about that match. It's been brutal,” Pegula reflected in her on-court interview. “I had match points, and then she started playing well. I think I just got a little tentative, and that's all it takes sometimes for someone to come back.“I'm really proud of myself for how I held it together, because I think I easily could've just collapsed. But I held tough, so yeah, that was a wild ride.”The emotion was understandable given Pegula's loss in Beijing to Linda Noskova four days earlier after holding three match points against the Czech.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

F1.com charts McLaren's journey from back of the grid to a double Teams' title success.

McLaren have experienced an extraordinary turnaround in their Formula 1 fortunes over the last few years, going from the rear of the field at the start of the 2023 season to earning back-to-back Teams' Championship titles in 2025. F1.com charts the journey with some of the milestone moments along the way…

On the eve of the 2023 campaign, the noises coming out of the McLaren camp were rather concerning. “We set some goals for development which we didn't hit,” CEO Zak Brown openly admitted. “We felt it was better to be honest about that.”

When cars hit the track in anger at the Bahrain Grand Prix, the team's worst fears were realised. Newcomer Oscar Piastri was knocked out in Q1 and Lando Norris in Q2. On race day it got even worse, with Piastri retiring amid technical problems and Norris encountering grave issues of his own to finish last via six pit stops.

While there were signs of more pace on the high-speed streets of Jeddah next time out, McLaren also left Saudi Arabia empty-handed and found themselves holding a lowly ninth in the Constructors' standings – ahead of only AlphaTauri (now Racing Bulls).

Just a few days later, McLaren announced an overhaul of their technical department, with experienced engineer James Key departing the Woking-based team and his Technical Director position being split into three specialised roles going forward.

According to McLaren, evaluations under new Team Principal Andrea Stella – who had replaced Andreas Seidl over the winter – began several months beforehand, in response to them falling from third in the standings in 2020 to fourth in 2021 and fifth in 2022.

“This new structure provides clarity and effectiveness within the team's technical department and puts us in a strong position to maximise performance, including optimising the new infrastructure upgrades we have coming in 2023,” declared Stella.

That optimisation appeared to pay off pretty quickly in the form of an upgrade package applied to Norris' car at the Austrian Grand Prix, where the Briton qualified fourth for the main race and third for the Sprint, and eventually crossed the line in P4 on Sunday.

It marked a huge step forward for the team, following further point-less weekends in Miami, Spain and Canada, and prompted Brown to declare that McLaren were “back in the game” for the remainder of the season – “a lot of credit” going to Stella in the process.

McLaren took things to the next level at the subsequent British Grand Prix, where Piastri got his hands on the range of developments Norris ran in Austria and both drivers – living up to their striking chrome liveries – featured in the front-running battle throughout the weekend.

Indeed, Norris and Piastri emerged as Red Bull rival Max Verstappen's nearest challenger to qualify second and third around the sweeps of Silverstone, with the former keeping P2 in the race and the latter looking set to join him on the podium until an ill-timed Safety Car.

McLaren would achieve that double podium a couple of months later, though, with Norris and Piastri coming home second and third – behind a dominant Verstappen – in the Japanese Grand Prix, marking the squad's best result since their 1-2 at Monza during the 2021 season.

A sweltering weekend in Qatar brought the victory McLaren had been craving, Piastri mastering the Sprint Shootout to secure top spot and keeping Verstappen at bay in the Sprint to take the chequered flag first – then backing all of that up with a fine P2 in the Grand Prix itself.

October also marked a significant off-track development when McLaren's new in-house wind tunnel went live, a move Stella noted came with significant “practical” and “financial” benefits after years of travelling to Cologne, Germany to use Toyota's set up.

Eight months after they sat second to last in the Constructors' standings, the aforementioned technical reshuffles and potent upgrades saw McLaren rise to a much more respectable position, culminating in them snatching fourth from Aston Martin in the final stages of the season.

As part of their March 2023 announcement, McLaren revealed that David Sanchez – having spent a decade at Ferrari – would be returning to the team as Technical Director, Car Concept and Performance, with respected engineer Rob Marshall signed from Red Bull shortly after that.

“The addition of a high-end and skilled individual like Rob will further consolidate our ability to establish the highest technical standards at McLaren and be in condition to design winning F1 cars,” said Stella, ahead of both men starting work on January 1, 2024.

As it transpired, Sanchez only lasted a few months in his role, with an early-April press release from McLaren explaining that after “a number of discussions” over job responsibilities, the Frenchman had vacated his position amid updates across the department.

Following Sanchez's exit, Marshall assumed the role of Chief Designer, Neil Houldey moved over to become Technical Director of Engineering, while Peter Prodromou continued in his role as Technical Director of Aerodynamics – all aimed at “further strengthening and evolving the technical model”.

McLaren enjoyed a much stronger start to the 2024 season and, almost a year on from that sensational 2023 turnaround being initiated, they unleashed another effective package at the Miami Grand Prix to go from occasional challengers to consistent front-runners.

While the Safety Car played its part in Florida, Norris brilliantly absorbed the pressure from Verstappen across the second half of the race to score his maiden F1 victory and give McLaren their first win since Daniel Ricciardo's Italian Grand Prix triumph in 2021.

McLaren went on a run of five successive P2 results with Norris and Piastri after that Miami triumph, adding another podium finish on home soil at Silverstone, but it was during the mid-summer Hungarian Grand Prix weekend that they hit the heights of a 1-2 finish.

It was not without controversy, given that pole-sitter Norris had lost out to Piastri at the start and undercut his team mate in the pits, then took a long time to obey his engineer's instruction to swap positions, but the fact remained that McLaren filled the top two positions.

Norris faced plenty of questions from the media over his handling of the situation, and a scruffy race in Belgium only added fuel to the fire, but he bounced back in style at the Dutch Grand Prix with a stunning hat-trick of pole position, fastest lap and the race win.

Exploiting further McLaren upgrades to finish more than 20 seconds clear of home hero Verstappen, who struggled with his Red Bull all weekend, it was here that talk of not only challenging for the Constructors' Championship – but also the drivers' crown – took off.

Both McLaren drivers were on the podium again at Monza, albeit with some further drama around their so-called ‘papaya rules', before Piastri pulled off an overtaking and defensive masterclass to beat Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in Azerbaijan and earn a second Grand Prix win.

McLaren's latest points haul, combined with car balance struggles at Red Bull that were not only impacting Sergio Perez, but also Verstappen, meant Brown and Stella's team moved into the lead of the Constructors' Championship for the first time in more than a decade.

McLaren were 20 points clear of Red Bull in the Teams' Championship after the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, with Ferrari 31 points further back in third position – setting up a seven-round showdown across the final sequence of flyaway races.

Old rivals Ferrari put on a late-season charge to keep them honest until the last round in Abu Dhabi, where a dominant pole-to-victory run from Norris was enough to seal the deal and give McLaren their first Teams' title since 1998.

Norris and McLaren continued where they left off in 2024 when the 2025 campaign got under way via an impressive wet-weather victory in Australia, and things got even better for the team at the subsequent Chinese Grand Prix weekend.

With Piastri bouncing back from his late spin on home soil and Norris bagging another podium in second, McLaren earned their 50th 1-2 finish as an F1 constructor – a run that was started by Denny Hulme and founder Bruce McLaren back in 1968.

McLaren continued to rack up the wins and podiums as 2025 progressed, building a significant lead in the Teams' Championship standings over Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari, and there would be another momentous moment over the summer.

After losing out to Leclerc and Piastri during Qualifying in Hungary, Norris cleared the pair on race day to secure McLaren's 200th Grand Prix victory – albeit generating plenty of paddock chatter given that he made one pit stop to his team mate's two.

Underlining just how strong their MCL39 package has been, and the consistency of Piastri and Norris as a driver pairing, McLaren had a chance to wrap up the 2025 Teams' Championship at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, with a whopping seven races still to go.

A rare off-weekend for all involved meant the situation moved on to Singapore, where Norris and Piastri's P3-P4 return – via their clash on the first lap – confirmed McLaren as back-to-back champions with double the points of nearest rivals Mercedes.

Now it remains to be seen if McLaren can go one step further and win both titles in the same season for the first time since 1998, with Piastri 22 points clear of Norris in the Drivers' Championship as Red Bull's Verstappen closes in…

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

The Singapore Grand Prix has long been more than a night race – and this year the paddock fashion matched the spectacle.

There's always a distinctive flair at the Singapore Grand Prix. With the city's growing reputation in fashion and design, the Marina Bay Circuit's paddock set the stage for outfits that matched the spectacle of the night race.

Since joining the calendar in 2008 – and this year also joined by F1 ACADEMY – Singapore has become one of Formula 1's most glamorous stops. The night lights, the skyline, and the tropical heat make it not just a challenge for the drivers but also the perfect backdrop for bold style statements.

From fans to special guests, no one misses the chance to turn the paddock into a runway. This weekend featured looks from polished designer ensembles to effortless streetwear, and the fashion at the Singapore Grand Prix proved once again why Singapore holds a unique place in the Formula 1 lifestyle scene.

Media day is always a moment to spot fashion among the drivers, and this time the unpredictable weather in Singapore highlighted one of the season's key trends: elevated athleisure.

Blurring the line between fitness wear and streetwear, the trend appeared in Lando Norris' vintage rugby polo and Liam Lawson's muted grey set. Yuki Tsunoda has his paddock looks dialled in, his accessories the star of the show as ever. Others stayed classic with the ever-reliable white t-shirt, worn by Lance Stroll and Esteban Ocon. Meanwhile, Fernando Alonso gave the classic style a modern twist with a short-sleeved beige polo and cream chinos.

Keeping it classy, Mercedes boss Toto Wolff defied the heat by donning a beige blazer – what humidity?

Drivers weren't the only ones embracing the blend of performance and style. Red Bull opened its garage to the South Korean boy band ENHYPEN. As Prada ambassadors, the band has served as a bridge between K-pop and the global fashion industry and they brought streetwear energy to the garage, with a mix of double denim, cargo trousers, and racing jackets.

Although team kit was the leading choice for Friday, a special mention goes to Red Bull's collaboration with Castore and Hypebeast. We know how much Verstappen loves a team kit, so this collection seems the perfect fit for him and his fashion-forward team mate, Tsunoda.

The three-piece capsule reinterprets the traditional pieces of Red Bull's uniform. Designed for night races, it features a digital night-camo pattern with built-in reflective material that catches the lights of Singapore and Las Vegas, where the team will wear the limited edition threads.

The paddock guests exhibited pure elegance, with various drivers' partners' fashion taking the spotlight throughout much of the weekend. Charles Leclerc's partner, Alexandra Saint Mleux, chose a satin midi dress embroidered with Asian motifs, while Alex Albon's partner and professional golfer Lily Muni He, stood out in a two-layer orange mini dress by Samuel Gui Yang. Both accessorised with heels and designer bags from Dior and Bottega Veneta. Other VIPs like JJ Lin also kept to an elegant dress code, with many opting for Louis Vuitton iconic pieces.

Saturday's high tension ahead of Qualifying kept most drivers in team kit. Paddock guests brought their style to the track, with lace, leather, and suede standing out. Model Rebecca Donaldson, Carlos Sainz's partner, wore a total chocolate-brown look, featuring a knit dress and a matching suede bag. Lily Muni He made a statement with a two-piece outfit – a contrast black lace top over a shimmery skirt.

Alexandra Saint Mleux continued her homage to Asian influences with a mini kimono-inspired dress by Sau Lee while Alicia Stent-Torriani (partner of Ollie Bearman) and actress and model Magui Corceiro (partner of Lando Norris) brought a coordinated touch to the paddock with contrasting black-and-white looks. Their styling carried an effortless elegance that moved seamlessly from day to night – versatile choices ideally suited to the occasion.

VIP guests from Singapore's creative scene – such as actors Zhang Ze Tong and Sheryl Ang – leaned towards streetwear, spotlighting the leather jacket as a global fashion staple fresh from Milan and Paris SS26 Fashion Weeks, as seen in Saint Laurent by Anthony Vacarello, Bottega by Louise Trotte or the new Versace by Dario Vitale.

In one of the most perfect laps of his career, George Russell took a surprise pole position and followed it up with victory in Singapore, while McLaren sealed the Teams' title.

Supporting Russell was his partner, Carmen Montero Mundt, who elevated Sunday fashion alongside other partners, such as Alexandra Saint-Mleux and Rebecca Donaldson. Carmen's geometric-pattern two-piece brought sharp sophistication, Alexandra and Lily revisited a kimono silhouette from earlier in the weekend, and Rebecca went for a staple total black look. In the McLaren box, Magui Corceiro went for a practical yet stylish utility jumpsuit.

Some may say menswear can usually be a little understated, but stars David Corenswet and Romeo Beckham turned the starting grid into a red carpet, mastering colour-block looks.

However, the main focus of race day was on accessories. Designer bags set the tone in the paddock, with several nods to Asian fashion culture – with Alexandra Saint-Mleux's beaded fan evening bag emerging as the standout accessory of the day.

Rebecca Donaldson also added a playful detail to her outfit with the “Sparkles” unicorn charm, a fan favourite that began as a sticker on Carlos Sainz's helmet and has since become official Williams merchandise by popular demand!

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

Despite missing out on victory in Singapore, Laurent Mekies was delighted with Red Bull and Max Verstappen's performance.

Red Bull Team Principal Laurent Mekies admits that ""being able to fight for the win"" during the Singapore Grand Prix ""means a lot"" after Max Verstappen finished second in Sunday's race.

The four-time and reigning World Champion entered the race in Singapore having claimed two wins on the bounce after Red Bull found extra performance from its RB21.

While Verstappen was unable to win at Singapore – still the only venue on the current F1 calendar where he has yet to stand on the top step – the Dutchman pushed winner George Russell throughout at a track where Red Bull has struggled the last few seasons.

""Being able to fight for the win here, it means a lot,"" said Mekies about the team's performance. ""After Monza, Baku, it was very different. You never know until you are coming.

""We've been able to be in the right rhythms from Friday. We were in the right rhythm in Qualifying. It was very, very close to call, and we were in the right rhythm in the race.

""If you look, we finished a few seconds away from George. This is good news. It means that what we have unlocked is not only low downforce specific.

""We will not change our approach. We'll continue to take it race by race. We'll continue to take the learnings.""

Red Bull's increased performance in the last three Grands Prix has crucially come on very different circuits, with Monza and Baku requiring a low downforce set-up while Singapore required a higher downforce configuration.

Despite missing out on a hat-trick of victories, Verstappen outscored Drivers' Championship leader Oscar Piastri and McLaren team mate Lando Norris for the third consecutive race, and now sits 63 and 41 points behind respectively with six Grands Prix and three Sprints remaining.

""I think everybody has been working extremely hard in Milton Keynes, from race one to now, and never giving up on trying to unlock the potential of that car. It is fair to say that the progress in the last few weeks have been quite spectacular,"" added Mekies.

""And it's credit to everyone, again, back at home, that have never given up. It's credit to Max, that has been, with his sensitivity, pushing us to explore different avenues. And finally, we found an avenue that unlocked a bit of performance.

""There is no single silver bullet. So, there have been a good flow of updates. There have been different ways to run the car.""

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

Ferrari could only come away with P6 and P8 from Singapore as they lacked the pace of the front runners.

Ferrari Team Principal Fred Vasseur admits that ""we didn't extract the best from the car"" during the Singapore Grand Prix on what was a ""mega frustrating"" weekend for the Scuderia.

Drivers Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton were only able to come away with P6 and P8 at the Marina Bay Street Circuit, the latter having suffered severe brake problems in the final laps and given a post-race penalty for cutting several corners due to the issue.

Vasseur admitted that both drivers were struggling with brake overheating from as early as Lap 2 in the 62-lap race, and that as a result their performance took a hit.

""Very early in the race we asked Charles to do a lift and coast,"" he said. ""It's not just a matter of doing a lift and coast when you're losing a little bit at the end of the straight. It's also to find the right braking point.

""In all the races that we were a bit more, a bit less, a bit more, a bit less, a bit more on the rear, a bit more on the front. You had to change the brake balance. At the end, you lose probably more on the reference for you when you are driving the car than on the pure potential.""

As at previous races this year, both Ferrari drivers had shown promising pace in Friday practice before an underwhelming Qualifying performance left them on the backfoot, with Hamilton P6 and Leclerc P7 on the grid in Singapore.

""What is mega frustrating is that the last two weekends we came in... Baku and then Singapore. At the beginning of the weekend, the pace was there,"" said Vasseur.

""We didn't extract the best from the car, I think, honestly. We are doing 29.7s in Q1 yesterday and 29.7s in Q3. We are struggling at the end of all the races not to be at the back foot.

""For the team, it's mega frustrating. The team and drivers are for all of us, because we are not pushing [because of the brakes]. At the end of the day, we are putting so much effort to be there, that when you have to do all the races on the backfoot, it's not good.""

Hamilton was able to gain the fastest lap of the race in the closing stages having made a second pit stop for fresh soft tyres and was chasing Antonelli down for P5 before his major brake problems.

""It's a fake fastest lap for me. We are not in the same situation. What I can say is that when he was pushing, the pace was there,"" added Vasseur.

""The gap with the cars in front of him was coherent with the delta that you have on the tyres. But nothing more than this. It's also frustrating for us, because we had the feeling that when we did three laps in a row without saving, that the pace was not bad.""

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

After both Williams were disqualified in Qualifying, the team left Singapore with just a single point.

Williams' Carlos Sainz believes ""we need to keep getting better"" after a mixed weekend in Singapore, with team mate Alex Albon suggesting ""what could have gone wrong went wrong"".

Off the back of a podium finish for the first time in more than a decade at the previous round in Baku, Williams was hopeful of another strong performance at the Marina Bay Street Circuit last Sunday.

But both Sainz and Albon missed out on reaching Q3 and were then disqualified from Qualifying due to technical breaches on their Williams cars, specifically around the uppermost rear wing element.

As a result, Sainz lined up P18 for the race and after a late second pit stop for Pirelli's soft tyre, surged back through the order to take the final point on offer in 10th.

""We've all done mistakes this weekend. I didn't do a good job in Qualifying, we changed too many things from FP3 to Qualifying and I was a bit lost,"" said Sainz.

""Doesn't matter because we were disqualified but we're making mistakes as a team still which is what this year is there for.

""I think in a clean, normal weekend, P7, P8 was on the cards. We finished P10 so was not a big drama and our rivals didn't get a lot of points so we managed to salvage the weekend a bit.

""At the same time, we need to keep getting better. Today, we executed a perfect race, I think we were the only car of the field to move forward with a midfield car, to go through 18th to 10th, when you see how little position variation there's been today I think it's definitely a good day.""

Albon, meanwhile, could only salvage P14 having started from the pit lane with suspension modifications in an attempt to learn more about the Williams package for the remainder of the season.

""Pit lane start, cruising around for a little bit, tried to get past one of the Alpines at the start but inevitably didn't really have the pace to do it, had to wait for them to box,"" he said.

""Tried to hold on and go long but didn't really have the tyres, that was pretty much it. We came out in blue flags, so when we did have fresh tyres we couldn't even use it because we were stuck behind, I think it was Oscar [Piastri].

""Then I had to wait for Oscar to catch the cars in front. It was basically what could have gone wrong went wrong. It was okay, we learnt something. I think I tired a lot of things with the set-up and it didn't work but it was good to cross it off actually.""

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

The new interview series – starring Amelia Dimoldenberg – is created and produced by Dimz Inc. and will be distributed via Amelia's YouTube channel.

Formula 1 and writer, host, producer and creator of Chicken Shop Date, Amelia Dimoldenberg, are set to launch a four-part YouTube original series called Passenger Princess, where internet sensation Amelia learns to drive with the help of the ultimate instructors – Formula 1 drivers.

Produced in collaboration with Amelia's production company, Dimz Inc., each episode will blend Amelia's signature humour with the fast-paced world of Formula 1. During the season, George Russell, Oscar Piastri, Ollie Bearman and Carlos Sainz will act as her trusted guides to show her the ropes, as she embarks on the pursuit of a driving licence.

Following the success of Drive to Survive and F1 The Movie, this is the latest example of Formula 1's original content strategy to deeply embed the sport in popular culture and reach new fans outside of traditional race weekends.

With over 820 million fans worldwide, of which 43% are under 35 years old and 42% are female (up from 37% in 2018), the collaboration will bring the drama and excitement of Formula 1 to Amelia's avid fanbase of 3.15 million followers across all social media channels, including Chicken Shop Date.

The partnership marks the continued expansion of Dimz Inc. in entertainment and branded spaces, as Passenger Princess joins a slate of popular series including Amelia's Cooking Show and Who Cares?, a socio-political vox-pop program, as well as various special Red Carpet reports, hosted by Amelia.

“My dream has always been to tell stories and work with great collaborators, so I'm proud to be working with such an iconic and recognised brand as F1 on this latest original series,"" Dimoldenberg said.

""Although I don't know how to drive. I'm excited to put my well-established passenger – and interviewing – skills to good use.”

The show was filmed at the 2025 Belgian Grand Prix and will be hosted on Amelia's YouTube channel. More details about each programme, including the tasks Amelia will be set, will be shared ahead of each one being released.

“Amelia has one of the most distinctive and entertaining voices in culture today and we love the quality, originality, and global content she produces, so we're thrilled to be putting her in the driving seat on a Formula 1 track and offering some help from a few good drivers we know!” said Ian Holmes, Chief Media Rights and Broadcasting Officer of Formula 1.

“This original series is another way for F1 to entice a new audience into the exciting world of racing.”

Emily Prazer, Chief Commercial Officer of Formula 1, added: “This collaboration with Dimz Inc. marks the latest partnership from Formula 1 to engage with its rapidly growing demographic of young fans.

“Passenger Princess will combine Amelia's wit and charm with the drama and excitement of Formula 1 at one of the sport's most iconic circuits. We can't wait for fans to see it.”

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson give their views on how the Singapore Grand Prix panned out for Racing Bulls.

The Singapore Grand prix did not go to plan for Racing Bulls, who had both cars finish outside the points despite at times showing enough pace to mix with the top teams in practice and Qualifying. Isack Hadjar was forced to nurse an engine issue on his way to a P11 finish, while Liam Lawson finished down in 15th.

Hadjar had the best chance to score for the team at Marina Bay, the rookie starting in the top 10 and running ninth in the early stages. But the team radioed to say his car was suffering an issue just before the first round of pit stops.

The Frenchman dropped two places before pitting for fresh tyres, but the problem remained and he dropped down the order. As the rest pitted, somehow Hadjar found himself back in the top 10 – only to get picked off by a freshly shod Carlos Sainz late in the race.

“[It] was not a good race. We had an issue I think just before pitting. And from there was just a very, very long race,” he explained.

“I couldn't do anything, I was just hoping for the others not to catch up too quickly but they did and we got impacted a lot by the blue flags, we lost a lot there. And Carlos [Sainz] pitted before the blue flags so he benefited from that, but we should have done better.”

Team Principal Alan Permane said after the race that the issue with Hadjar's powertrain was costing him 0.5s a lap, so just to make the finish was impressive – let alone hang onto the coattails of the top 10. Hadjar was asked how it felt in the car once the issue became apparent.

“Really not good, you feel powerless in the corners, on the straights we were pretty much there. It's not nice but I know it is not my fault, nothing I could have done. I gave my all and even like this we finished P11 so not that bad.”

It is first time Racing Bulls have failed to score with either car since the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, but Lawson believed more was possible from his race. He opted for a very long first stint in the hopes of a Safety Car but dived into the pits when it became apparent one was not likely to materialise.

He was running ahead of Sainz when he pitted two laps before the Spaniard and yet finished five places lower than the Williams man – leaving him baffled as to how Sainz pulled off such a result.

“We just went very, very long, [and] stayed out most of the race on that set of mediums. Honestly, I don't really know, I need to have a look what happened because Carlos was behind me and he ended up finishing 10th so I have no idea what happened,” Lawson explained.

“For me, I came out behind the train [of cars], and he came out in front of the train so I need to have a look why. It's frustrating but the damage was mostly done yesterday from me. Something to reflect on for sure going forward.”

With two crashes marring his weekend, Lawson could be forgiven for being relieved to come out of the race with his car in one piece, especially after coming perilously close to Yuki Tsunoda through the first few corners at the start. But the Kiwi racer was searingly honest about what was possible out there.

“Had we started higher up the grid, we could've potentially ended up in the points with our pace, but a tough Quali meant it was going to be tricky from the outset,” he concluded.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

The Alpine drivers Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto reflect on the Singapore Grand Prix.

Pierre Gasly was frank in his assessment of how the Singapore Grand Prix went for Alpine after the Frenchman finished near the back of the pack in 19th place. With Franco Colapinto only 16th, this was the fifth race weekend in a row Alpine have not managed to score with either car.

The team expected to struggle in Monza and Baku given their lack of straight line speed, but hoped the Marina Bay Street Circuit might play slightly more to their strengths.

But it was not to be, with Gasly's evening made doubly difficult by a pit lane start. That in itself came about after he was forced to park up in a runoff area in Qualifying, with reliability gremlins also hampering the French team.

“Today was always going to be difficult especially with the pit lane start. I have not been feeling too comfortable in the car recently so we changed set-up and changed floor to try and understand some things further, which should benefit us for the future,” Gasly said.

“We knew the race would be complicated and it was nice to have a few battles out there even if it was not for the points paying positions. I know the team is working exceptionally hard at the moment and we all know we are nowhere near where we should be right now.”

Alpine have scored in four races courtesy of Gasly, while Franco Colapinto has a best finish of P11 since taking over from Jack Doohan after Miami. It leaves the team rooted to the bottom of the pile in the Constructors' Championship, but Gasly believes better days could be coming for Alpine.

“I am confident we can do better in Austin next time out compared to the last few races where the circuit characteristics have not suited our package – especially with the lack of grip and bumps that are common on street circuits,” he added.

Colapinto might have finished a few places ahead of his team mate, but points never looked likely for the Argentine racer. Nonetheless, he made up places off the line after gambling on the soft tyres for the start and fought hard, but things were always likely to be tricky in a race where all 20 cars made it to the flag.

“It was a long race with lots of close battles out there, which was fun but, ultimately, we didn't have the pace and lost some places towards the end on older tyres,” he said. “I managed to get a good launch off the line and made up places through the opening sequence of corners.

“We were running quite well in the midfield pack on the softs at the time and knowing how difficult it is to overtake at this track, we pitted early trying to undercut and use track position to make up places.

“We tried our best to manage the tyres but with a lot of degradation and having to also move offline for blue flags, it made it difficult to hold off the cars on fresher tyres in the closing laps. It was not what we wanted but we just have to keep pushing and better results will come.”

Colapinto remains the only active driver yet to score this season, while Alpine are now 26 points behind Haas in the Teams' Championship.

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

The F1 Nation team look back on all the biggest news and topics from the Singapore Grand Prix weekend.

F1 correspondent Lawrence Barretto and Australian motor racing journalist Greg Rust join Tom Clarkson in the Marina Bay paddock to reflect on the Singapore Grand Prix in the latest episode of F1 Nation.

McLaren have become World Champions for the second year in a row, but the big talking point was the opening lap contact between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. Will that incident change how the Drivers' Championship battle plays out in the final six races, especially now that the team have wrapped up the Constructors' title?

George Russell converted a stunning pole into his second win of the season with a dominant performance from lights out. But as his wait for a new contract with Mercedes continues, why does Lawrence think Russell is in a similar situation to the one Carlos Sainz found himself in at Ferrari?

Behind George was Max Verstappen in P2. It's his fourth podium in a row and, given Red Bull's previous struggles in Singapore, does this result confirm they've finally turned a corner with their car?

And if Max does significantly close the gap in the title fight this year, will McLaren favour one of their drivers over the other to ensure they win a first Drivers' Championship since 2008?

Also on the agenda, the guys discuss another frustrating weekend for Ferrari, while celebrating impressive points finishes from Sainz, Fernando Alonso and Ollie Bearman.

A calculation of screen time shows that the 'Aftersun' Oscar nominee appears in considerably less of the film than his costar, Jessie Buckley, who will be campaigning for best actress.


							By 

	Scott Feinberg


Executive Editor of Awards


	For his critically acclaimed portrayal of playwright William Shakespeare in Chloé Zhao's fall film fest darling Hamnet, Paul Mescal will be promoted this awards season for best supporting actor — as opposed to best actor — honors, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.


	There has been widespread speculation about which path would be pursued by Mescal — a best actor Oscar nominee in 2023 for 2022's Aftersun — and his backers, including Hamnet distributor Focus Features. But a decision has only just been solidified.

					Luca Marinelli, Felix van Groeningen, Charlotte Vandermeersch Re-Team for 'Let Love In'		
			









	While Hamnet is a film about the love and loss experienced by William and Agnes Shakespeare, the fact of the matter is that Agnes — played by Jessie Buckley, a frontrunner for the best actress Oscar — is actually featured in quite a bit more of the film than her famous husband: Mescal appears in 44 minutes and 57 seconds (or 36 percent of the full runtime), whereas Buckley appears in 63 minutes and 49 seconds (or 51 percent of the full runtime).

	











	In other words, it's not a stretch to argue that Mescal's performance is, in fact, supporting Buckley's. And besides, it's sort of all right there in the film's plot: part of Agnes' frustration with William, as expressed in the film, is that he is away in London for large chunks of time while she is back at home without him dealing with challenges related to their children.


	While there is no reason to believe this factored into the Mescal decision, it is nevertheless the case that the 29-year-old is the clear lead of another awards hopeful, Mubi's The History of Sound, so having him go supporting for Hamnet also serves to keep him from splitting the votes of his own fans.

	











Hamnet had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival, where it was the talk of the fest. It then screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the People's Choice Award, which is often a harbinger of Oscar success. It next plays at several regional film festivals en route to Focus releasing it in select theaters on Nov. 27 and then wide on Dec. 12.

	Three celebrities left the competition ahead of Disney Night, leaving Secret Lives of Mormon Wives stars Jen Affleck and Whitney Leavitt, Olympian Jordan Chiles, social media star Alix Earle, The Traitors season three winner (and Zac Efron's brother) Dylan Efron, actresses Danielle Fishel and Elaine Hendrix, Pentatonix's Scott Hoying, conservationist (and son of Steve Irwin) Robert Irwin, comedian-actor Andy Richter and Baldwin in the show's cast, before she was eliminated.


	Efron kicked off the night with a quickstep to “Life Is a Highway” from Cars. While he didn't take part in a dance set to a song from High School Musical, which his brother notably starred in, Hoying's salsa was set to “Bop to the Top” from the movie's iconic soundtrack. 


	A seemingly common theme arose during Disney Night, with competitors promising heart-touching dances during next week's Dedication Night if they made it through Tuesday's live show. Efron kicked this trend off after Julianne Hough pointed out that he didn't have a High School Musical-themed dance, to which he replied, “I have something special for next week if I'm still here,” teasing a potential routine dedicated to Zac. 

	











	Baldwin similarly told Hough she'd be hitting the ballroom floor with her husband, Alec Baldwin, next week if she wasn't eliminated during Disney Night.


	As for the top-scoring performers of the night, Earle earned her first trio of eights, with a total score of 24/30 for her Maleficent-themed Viennese waltz. Chiles also scored a 24/30, tying her score from last week's TikTok Night, for her quickstep to “Special Spice” from Disneyland's Tiana's Bayou Adventure ride.


	It was Leavitt who, once again, stunned the judges, earning the first nine of the season from Carrie Ann Inaba. Bruno Tonioli and Derek Hough both sung additional praise of Leavitt and her partner Mark Ballas, with the latter judge proudly proclaiming, “Get these two on Broadway, stat!”


	Notably, Leavitt has remained the top-placing celebrity each week since the season 34 premiere. Disney Night marked the first time a singular couple pulled ahead as the sole top of the leaderboard, with Leavitt and Ballas receiving the highest score for four consecutive weeks.


	Last week, Fifth Harmony's Lauren Jauregui was eliminated during TikTok night alongside her professional dance partner Brandon Armstrong. When asked how she felt about the results, she replied, “Pissed.”


	See the full list of scores for week four of DWTS season 34 (aka Disney night) below.


	Dylan Efron and Daniella Karagach: 23/30Danielle Fishel and Pasha Pashkov: 21/30Scott Hoying and Rylee Arnold: 21/30Alix Earle and Val Chmerkovskiy: 24/30Hilaria Baldwin and Gleb Savchenko: 23/30 (ELIMINATED) Andy Richter and Emma Slater: 18/30Robert Irwin and Witney Carson: 22/30Elaine Hendrix and Alan Bersten: 24/30Whitney Leavitt and Mark Ballas: 25/30Jordan Chiles and Ezra Sosa: 24/30Jen Affleck and Jan Ravnik: 23/30

	











	Season 34 of DWTS airs and streams simultaneously on ABC and Disney+ on Tuesdays, with new episodes available to stream on Wednesdays on Hulu.

The veteran comedy superstar “doesn't give a f***” what anyone thinks of his recent trip to Saudi Arabia: “If it affects my career, I've been to LAX enough in my life, I'll f***ing sit home for a little bit.”


							By 

	Chris Gardner



	Conan O'Brien and the crew from his SiriusXM podcast took over Hollywood's Fonda Theatre on Sunday night for a special live recording of Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend. After an introductory segment featuring co-hosts Sona Movsesian and Matt Gourley, the Fonda's lights dimmed as O'Brien readied to reveal his surprise guest — Bill Burr.


	“Hi, I'm Bill Burr and I feel wonderful about being Conan O'Brien's friend,” said the veteran actor-comedian from a podium to rousing applause from the capacity crowd, which included The Hollywood Reporter. But he wasn't exactly feeling wonderful about the week he'd had. “It's been fucking fantastic,” he quipped after taking a seat. “Jesus Christ.”

					Lesbian Stand-Up Comedian Jessica Kirson Expresses ""Sincere Regret"" for Riyadh Comedy Festival Performance		
			









	O'Brien was quick to note that his longtime friend and frequent guest had “been in the news” that week, an observation that likely did not come as a surprise to anyone in the room. Burr was among the 50 or so high-profile comedians who traveled to Saudi Arabia for the Riyadh Comedy Festival. Taking place from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9, the event welcomed a who's who to the country for stand-up sets, a roster that included Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Whitney Cummings, Andrew Schulz, Aziz Ansari, Jim Jefferies, Jo Koy, Sebastian Maniscalco, Mark Normand, Tom Segura, Bobby Lee, Jeff Ross and more.

	











	It caused a firestorm of controversy as word spread of its lineup, leading people like Marc Maron, David Cross and Atsuko Okatsuka to speak out against it, given the kingdom's history of oppression and human rights abuses. Burr was quick to counter the criticism on his podcast — the episode dropped Sept. 30 as the online heat was still boiling — by saying what a great experience it was for him to travel to Saudi Arabia and perform in both Bahrain and Riyadh.


	“The royals loved the show. Everyone was happy. The people that were doing the festival were thrilled. The comedians that I've been talking to are saying, ‘Dude, you can feel [the audience] wanted it. They want to see real stand-up comedy.' It was a mind-blowing experience. Definitely top three experiences I've had. I think it's going to lead to a lot of positive things,” he said. 


	Burr's tone had changed by Sunday night as he unleashed on his critics with a barrage of expletives, slamming the online outrage as being stirred up and inflamed by bots and reiterating that the festival itself was a sign of forward progress for the Middle East. 


 













	“The general consensus is, ‘How dare you go to that place and make those oppressed people laugh, you fucking piece of shit. I can't believe you went to that place. I can't find it on a map, and this bot said I was upset about it so now I am,'” Burr said in recapping the outrage. “It's one thing to wear clothes made by sweatshop labor. It's quite another to go to the factory and make 'em laugh. I can't believe how much anger I had about this issue after it went viral.”


	To that, O'Brien joked, “So, you're here to apologize.” Spoiler alert: He did not apologize. If anything, he delivered a warning that recent events in the United States have indicated “we're moving towards them.” “Jesus Christ, we're fucking grabbing moms and dads and sticking 'em in a van for making illegally made fucking tacos to go to Alligator Alcatraz,” Burr said of the ICE raids. “It's fucking insane. It's insane. And someday they're gonna be out of brown people to put in those vans, they're still gonna have the vans, so you shouldn't be feeling comfortable about it, thinking that you're not gonna be in it.”


	He continued by noting that he was one of the comedians who got “the most amount of shit” about his appearance from other comedians whom he declined to name. “All of these sanctimonious cunts out there … who don't really sincerely give a shit,” he said. “If you actually give a fuck about those people and how they're living over there, there's gonna have to be these types of things to pull them in. And I will tell you, the Cheesecake Factory in Riyadh, it's incredible. It's right next to Pizza Hut and KFC, and if you want a pair of Timberlands, it's across the street next to the Marriott, catty-corner to the fucking Hilton.”

	











	Though he didn't mention her by name, Burr gave a nice shout-out to fellow comedian Jessica Kirson, who was on the Riyadh Comedy Festival bill. “Openly gay, went over there and just did her fucking act. And she was in the middle of her act and two of the diplomats got up and she said to them, ‘What, are you guys going to go get on Grindr?'” Burr detailed. “Dude, 33 years of comedy, that's the biggest balls of anyone I've ever seen.” But then she received backlash from “hardcore psycho gays,” Burr said, adding, “Fucking lunatics, man.” After the outrage, Kirson apologized in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter and revealed she would be donating her fee to a human rights organization.


	Burr said he had “no fucking idea” the festival would inspire such controversy from people that aren't able to locate Saudi Arabia on a map. “One time I did Abu Dhabi and somebody [texted me], ‘Oh, you're going over there to get that blood money, right?' And I go, ‘Hey, just for the record, I'm also doing London, England, on that tour, which is arguably the bloodiest fucking money out there,'” he said.


	He stated that he doesn't “give a fuck what all these phony fucking people are saying,” nor does he care if his appearance negatively impacts his career. “I really don't give a fuck, Conan, and if it affects my career, I've been to LAX enough in my life, I'll fucking sit home for a little bit. I will actually tell you LAX is slightly sadder than Saudi Arabia.”


	But he did say that while the outrage was exploding, he never heard from his agent. “I've been going through this bullshit the whole week. My agent never even called me. He's been under his fucking desk,” he joked. “He heard me on the podcast, saying what I said here, that I had a good time and it was a positive thing so he thought that was the mindset that I was in through the week.”

	











	He was in contact with his tour manager, who shared with him some of the feedback he was getting. “One of my favorite things is this scumbag club owner texted my tour manager because he heard I was over there [in Saudi Arabia]. He goes, ‘Bring back a burka and a sweatshirt in size oppression.' That was his joke. So I wrote back to him, ‘Why don't you concentrate on not ripping off comedians? You fucking piece of shit.' And he never wrote back,” Burr said.


	In closing, Burr said that events like the Riyadh Comedy Festival “have to happen” in order to push progress forward. “It was necessary. It felt right afterward,” he said. “I vibed with them and they were funny. Fuck, they were funny fucking people. I don't know what to tell you. I had a good time.” And he had a good friend in O'Brien. “I love doing the podcast, man, and I appreciate you having me on, especially during all of this bullshit. You are a real friend, dude.”


	The live episode is out now for SiriusXM Podcasts+ subscribers and will be available widely on Oct. 15.

The country star also said he posted a snippet of the same song ""three months ago"" without any fanfare.

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	After inspiring countless headlines over the past few days, Zach Bryan is looking to change the narrative around the polarizing song snippet he posted to social media over the weekend.


	On Tuesday (Oct. 7), Bryan posted two Instagram Stories explaining that the song — particularly his lyrics about police (“cocky motherf—ers, aren't they?”) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE is gonna come bust down your door”) — had been “misconstrued” and that listeners need to hear the complete song to “understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle.”

	











	He also said he wrote the song “months ago” and even posted a snippet of it three months ago, without any fanfare.


	Beginning the message with “pls f—n read this” and “On the ‘new' song,” Bryan wrote in part: “This shows you how divisive a narrative can be when shoved down our throats through social media. This song is about how much I love this country and everyone in it more than anything. When you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle. Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back.”




	Since the snippet was posted, Bryan's lyrics have been denounced by the White House, with spokesperson Abigail Jackson releasing this song-title-filled statement: “While Zach Bryan wants to Open the Gates to criminal illegal aliens and has Condemned heroic ICE officers, Something in the Orange tells me a majority of Americans disagree with him and support President Trump's great American Revival. Godspeed, Zach!” Tricia McLaughlin — the assistant secretary of public affairs to the Department of Homeland Security — told Billboard that Bryan should “stick to ‘Pink Skies,' dude,” referring to the artist's Billboard Hot 100 top 10 hit.


	In his Tuesday post, Bryan reiterated that his song isn't anti-American, writing: “I served this country, I love this country and the song itself is about all of us coming out of this divided space. I wasn't speaking as a politician or some greater-than-thou a–hole, just a 29 year old man who is just as confused as everyone else. To see how much sh– it stirred up makes me not only embarrassed but kind of scared. Left wing or right wing we're all one bird and American. To be clear I'm on neither of these radical sides.”

pls f—n read this


On the “new” song:


I wrote this song months ago. I posted this song three months ago as a snippet. This shows you how divisive a narrative can be when shoved down our throats through social media. This song is about how much I love this country and everyone in it more than anything. When you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle. Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back.












I served this country, I love this country and the song itself is about all of us coming out of this divided space. I wasn't speaking as a politician or some greater-than-thou a–hole, just a 29 year old man who is just as confused as everyone else. To see how much sh– it stirred up makes me not only embarrassed but kind of scared. Left wing or right wing we're all one bird and American. To be clear I'm on neither of these radical sides. To all those disappointed in me on either side of whatever you believe in just know I'm trying my best too and we all say things that are misconstrued sometimes.


Everyone have a great day and I love each and every one of ya!!!


The last few months of my life I've been scrutinized by more people than I ever thought possible. I feel like I've tried my hardest in so many ways and it's so hard to see where my bearings even are anymore. Been falling off a cliff while trying to grow wings at the same time.


I am SO proud to have served in a country where we can all speak freely and converse amongst each other without getting doxxed or accosted on the internet or worse; the violence and heartbreak we've faced in the last few months!


God speed ol sons I'm out!

The Life of a Showgirl surpasses a major 10-year-old consumption record held by Adele, and continues to near the modern-era single-week album sales record.


													By
												

	Keith Caulfield



Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl has now earned 3.5 million equivalent album units in the United States, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate, since the album's release on Oct. 3. Of that sum, traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) equal 3.2 million copies, with the remaining 300,000 powered by streaming activity of the songs on the album.

	











	Luminate's current tracking week began on Friday, Oct. 3, and ends on Thursday, Oct. 9.


	With 3.2 million copies sold, The Life of a Showgirl continues to near the record for the largest sales week for an album in the modern era (since 1991, when Luminate began electronically tracking music purchases). The modern-era single-week sales record is held by the opening week of Adele's 25, when it debuted with 3.378 million copies sold in 2015.


	However, as The Life of a Showgirl has earned 3.5 million equivalent album units, the album has now secured a new record for the largest week, by equivalent album units, for an album, since the Billboard 200 chart began ranking the week's most popular albums by equivalent album units in Dec. 2014. The previous record was held by the debut week of Adele's 25, which bowed with 3.482 million units on the Dec. 12, 2015 chart (mostly powered by the 3.378 million individual purchases of the album, with the remaining sum driven by track purchases and streaming).

	











Equivalent Album Units Explained: Each equivalent album unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. (None of the tracks from The Life of a Showgirl are available to purchase individually, so the album does not have any track sales contributing to its total thus far.)


	The Billboard 200 transitioned from a pure album sales-based ranking to a multi-metric, units-based ranking, with the Dec. 13, 2014-dated chart. From that point forward, albums were ranked on the Billboard 200 by equivalent album units earned — meaning that in addition to album purchases counting towards an album's chart placement, streams of songs from an album, as well as track purchases, would also contribute towards an album's position on the weekly chart.


	While the Billboard 200 has incorporated streams and track purchases since Dec. 2014, Billboard continues to publish weekly album sales-only charts, including the overall Top Album Sales chart (which ranks both current and older/catalog titles), and Top Current Album Sales.


	Luminate's sales, streaming and airplay data powers Billboard's charts. All numbers cited in this story are for the U.S. only.


Life of a Showgirl's first-week numbers (equivalent album units, total traditional album sales and streaming figures) are expected to be announced by Billboard on Sunday, Oct. 12, along with its assumed large debut on the multi-metric Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Oct. 18).


For all chart news, follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram. 












PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 7): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl has reached 3 million in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases), across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. On the album's first day of release (Oct. 3), it cleared 2.7 million sold. After Showgirl's first day, it captured the second-largest sales week for an album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele's 25, which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015.


Showgirl has earned over 3.2 million equivalent album units in the U.S. With 3.2 million equivalent album units earned, Showgirl already has the second-largest week, by equivalent album units, for any album since the Billboard 200 began ranking the week's most popular albums by equivalent album units with the Dec. 13, 2014-dated chart. The largest week, by equivalent album units, for any album, in that span of time, was registered by the debut week of Adele's 25, which launched with 3.482 million units on the Dec. 12, 2015 chart.


Showgirl got a mid-week boost with the release of four new CD variants of the album, exclusively sold through Swift's official webstore. Available for a limited time, each CD had alternate cover art, the album's 12 songs, plus two unique bonus tracks for each CD (alternate versions of songs from the album). These four CDs join 23 previously available physical versions of the album (across vinyl, CD and cassette) and two digital download editions (a standard wide version, and iTunes-exclusive version with a bonus video). Also helping Showgirl was a restock of a previously available deluxe CD boxed set, sold through Swift's store, containing a branded cardigan sweater and a copy of the CD.

	











	Swift herself has been on the promotional trail, chatting up the album on radio programs and sitting down for an interview on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (Oct. 6). Her film Taylor Swift: The Official Release Party of a Showgirl barnstormed movie theaters over the Oct. 3-5 weekend, coming in atop the box office at U.S. and Canada movie theaters.


	As for Showgirl's streaming start – its 12 songs generated over 300 million on-demand official streams in its first two days in the U.S. (Oct. 3-4). Swift holds the record for the largest streaming week for an album, when The Tortured Poets Department debuted with 891.37 million on-demand official streams for the 31 songs on its deluxe edition in 2024.


	The most-streamed song on Showgirl in its first two days is “The Fate of Ophelia,” with more than 48 million official on-demand steams. That number could grow significantly following the song's official music video premiere on YouTube on Sunday, Oct. 5.


	If The Life of a Showgirl debuts atop the Billboard 200, it will mark Swift's 15th No. 1 album, lifting her past Drake and JAY-Z for the most No. 1 albums among soloists, and becoming the sole act with the second-most No. 1s. She is currently tied with Drake and JAY-Z with 14 No. 1s each, and only The Beatles, with 19 No. 1s, have more, dating to when the chart began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in 1956.


	All 14 of Swift's full-length studio albums and re-recorded projects from 2008's Fearless (her second album) through 2024's The Tortured Poets Department have debuted at No. 1.


PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 4): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl album is off to a sparkling start in the United States. On its first day of release, Oct. 3, the set sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. That marks Swift's biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The only larger sales week in that span of time was registered by the opening frame of Adele's 25, which sold 3.378 million copies in its first week in 2015.

	











Showgirl also stuns with a new modern-era record (1991-present) for the most copies of a vinyl album sold in a single week, having already sold 1.2 million copies on wax. That breaks the single-week record, set by Swift in 2024, when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department, sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week.


	Further news of first-week building sales and streaming activity for the album, as provided by Luminate, will be reported in the coming days.


The Life of a Showgirl was announced on Aug. 12, and Swift's official webstore began taking preorders for the album soon after. The set was issued as a widely available streaming edition and in three widely available versions to purchase across all participating retailers (a standard CD, vinyl and digital download album). There is a plethora of further variants of the album to purchase, with more details on the assorted versions later in this story.


Sales Story: The 2.7 million-sales number registered for Showgirl is inclusive of both over-the-counter and download purchases of the album made on Oct. 3, in addition to what is assumed to be a large number of pre-orders of the physical album through Internet retailers (such as Swift's webstore, Amazon, Target, etc.) shipped to customers for arrival on release day, as well as pre-orders of the digital download album that were redeemed on release day (via the iTunes Store and other similar sellers).


	After one day on sale, The Life of a Showgirl is the top-selling album of 2025 in the U.S., surpassing the 520,000 sold of The Weeknd's Hurry Up Tomorrow, through the week ending Sept. 25.


The Life of a Showgirl's sales are bolstered by its availability across 23 different physical configurations: 12 CDs, eight vinyl LPs, two deluxe CD boxed sets containing branded clothing and a CD, and a cassette. Four of the physical editions were exclusively sold by Target stores in the U.S. (three CDs and one vinyl), while two (a standard CD and vinyl) were available to purchase at all participating retailers.

	











	Of the remaining 17 physical iterations, all were exclusively sold via Swift's webstore, and most were sold for limited windows of time since the preorder launched in August. Her store carried the two deluxe CD boxed sets (one contains a branded cardigan sweater and a CD, the other contains a branded crewneck and a CD); four signed CDs; four deluxe CDs in premium packaging containing a collectible charm and photo cards; six vinyl LPs; and the cassette.


	On the digital download side, there is a standard digital download available to purchase through all download sellers, as well as an iTunes Store-exclusive version that comes with a short bonus video. (Of note, none of the tracks from the album are available to purchase individually.)


	To compare, Swift's last studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, had 19 different physical iterations available in its first week (nine CDs, six vinyl LPs and four cassettes) and two digital download versions (the standard 16-song album, and the surprise deluxe 31-song Anthology edition).


Vinyl Victory: Collectively, the eight vinyl LPs for Showgirl combined to sell 1.2 million copies on the album's first day of release — immediately breaking the modern-era record for the most vinyl copies of an album sold in a single week. Swift herself previously held the record with 859,000 copies of Poets sold in its first week.


Million-Sellers Club: Even though we're only one day down into the tracking week, The Life of a Showgirl sashays into the single-week million-sellers club. With 2.7 million already sold, Showgirl has the second-largest sales week of the modern era (1991-present). It stands behind only the opening week of Adele's 25, which bowed with 3.378 million sold in 2015.

	











Showgirl is the eighth Swift album to have sold at least 1 million copies in a single week, following the debuts of Poets, 1989 (Taylor's Version), Midnights, reputation, the original 1989, Red and Speak Now. She is the only act with eight different albums to each sell at least 1 million copies in a single week in the modern era. In total, there have been 27 instances — by 25 different albums — in which an album sold at least 1 million copies in a week in the modern era. One of those albums, Adele's 25 sold more than 1 million in three separate weeks.

News of Spotify's agreement with BMG is the latest in a string of deals between the streaming service and large music companies.


													By
												

	Kristin Robinson


Senior Writer


	BMG and Spotify have announced the signing of a new direct licensing agreement. Specifically, this multi-year deal encompasses BMG's publishing side of the business, and the new agreement with Spotify is said to “deliver greater value to songwriters and their teams,” according to a press release. 


	This is the latest in a series of new deals struck between Spotify and top music companies. Already this year, new Spotify agreements have been struck with Sony Music, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, Kobalt and Merlin — most of which have improved songwriter remuneration on the streaming platform.


	It's a notable part of the pacts, given Spotify has had strained relations with music publishers since the spring of 2024. That March, the streaming service started paying less premium royalties to songwriters and publishers in the U.S., leading to a reduction of $230 million in royalties in the first year, according to the National Music Publishers' Association. The service was able to cut royalties because it argued that by adding audiobooks into its premium service, it now qualified all premium subscriptions as “bundles.” In the U.S. this allows services to split the mechanical royalty pool between the types of content within the bundle — in this case, songs and books.


	In a press release about BMG and Spotify's new agreement, it reads: “It's a practical step toward a more flexible licensing model that better serves both publishers and their artists, ensuring BMG songwriters benefit more directly in the growth of streaming.”


	“At Spotify, we believe the future of music depends on stronger collaboration across the industry,” says Alex Norström, co-president and chief business officer at Spotify. “Our partnership with BMG advances that vision with renewed support for songwriters through a licensing model that will enhance how music is enjoyed on our platform.”


Thomas Coesfeld, CEO of BMG, says of the deal: “Working directly with Spotify helps us reinforce our mission to ensure songwriters are fairly represented and rewarded for their work. We're pleased to agree on a progressive licensing model that reflects the real-world use of music across digital platforms and are excited to take our partnership to the next level as we continue to redefine what a modern music company can be. We applaud their momentum and support their position on developing new AI protections. While we support the use of AI to enhance human creativity, these policies align with BMG's philosophy and will help ensure that fair remuneration and protection of artists' works remain non-negotiable.”

Hopefully this brings the campy 80s vibe of the movie.
Just saw Death Becomes Her this weekend and it was a perfect movie to stage adaption, totally got the assignment, and was funny as hell.

Music is phenomenal but the production is very $$$   Won't recoup Broadway but should have nice touring life

International TV Co-Editor


	Jimmy Kimmel's return to late-night was seismic for television, but YouTube is claiming a chunk of the glory.


	During a presentation today at MIA Market in Rome, YouTube's Head of Business Strategy and Operations, EMEA, Luca Forlin, said the linear TV viewing uptick generated by the return of Jimmy Kimmel Live! to ABC was dwarfed by numbers generated on the Google-owned platform.


	“It was a huge moment, and he had a huge audience spike, but even that audience spike on linear paled in comparison to what YouTube gained in terms of audience,” he added.

	Kimmel returned to the airwaves on Tuesday, September 23 after Disney his ABC show was pulled over comments he made on the killing of right-wing campaigner Charlie Kirk. ABC affiliate Nexstar and Sinclair both boycotted the show, but ultimately returned it to their stations.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The post-suspension show became ABC's second-most watched episode ever, drawing 6.5 million live+same day viewers. By Deadline's count today, the YouTube version of the episode, ‘Jimmy Kimmel is back!' had accrued 22 million viewers in the two weeks since the broadcast, with other related videos adding significant amounts more.


	“That multiplier effect – 4x, 5x, 6, 10x – is what we observe day-in, day-out on live streaming and live events,” said Forlin.


	For context, Forlin used the Kimmel example to show how television brands can use YouTube to build bigger audiences. He was primarily was in town to appeal to Italian producers and creatives to begin experimenting with YouTube, whether through monetizing their existing content or developing directly for the platform. In a bid to highlight the opportunity, he pointed to top YouTuber MrBeast's online version of Squid Game.


	“Netflix had announced after six months that about 400 million people had viewed the series,” said Forlin. “MrBeast replicated with his own Squid Game, and it took only a few weeks to reach 400 million viewers. That's the speed and scale that YouTube operates at, and it's there for you.

					By Katie Campione 

TV Reporter


Kim Kardashian and Sarah Paulson seem to be going head-to-head in Ryan Murphy‘s upcoming legal drama All's Fair, which is set to debut next month.


	Disney revealed Wednesday that the series will premiere on November 4. Along with the premiere date, a new trailer also introduces audiences to a group of highly skilled, tenacious female divorce attorneys who have left their male-dominated firm to open their own powerhouse practice, all of them dead set on helping women best their husbands in messy divorces. 


	Seemingly among them are Kardashian and Paulson's characters, whose drama appears to be extending beyond the courtroom and into their own ranks when Paulson takes on Kardashian's husband as her client.

	Watch the full trailer above. All's Fair is set to launch with three episodes streaming on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+ for bundle subscribers in the US and on Disney+ internationally. New episodes will stream weekly on Thursdays.

All's Fair is produced by 20th Television in association with Ryan Murphy Television. The series is written and executive produced by Ryan Murphy, who also directs. Other executive producers include Jon Robin Baitz, Joe Baken, Jamie Pachino, Lyn Greene and Richard Levine. 


	Series stars Kardashian, Close, Watts, Nash-Betts and Paulson also executive produce, as do Kris Jenner, Alexis Martin Woodall, Eric Kovtun, Scott Robertson and Nissa Diederich. Anthony Hemingway executive produces and directs as well.

EXCLUSIVE: Taylor Swift is a fan of Prime Video's The Girlfriend, and she's not alone. The series has now topped the 25M viewer mark on the streamer, Deadline can reveal.


	The psychological thriller is based on Michelle Frances' novel of the same name and stars Robin Wright, Olivia Cooke and Laurie Davidson. It dropped on streaming on Sept 10, with Prime Video launching it across its worldwide footprint.


	Deadline has seen the stats and as well as notching over 25M individual viewers globally, the drama has quickly become the number-one new scripted series on Prime Video in the UK.

	Superstar Taylor Swift gave the series a plug on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon this week, which can only help the numbers, but it was already faring well. Globally, it now ranks in the top ten Prime Video series released this year.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Per the synopsis, the six-part limited series follows Laura (Wright), a woman who seemingly has it all; a glittering career, a loving husband, and her precious son, Daniel (Davidson). Her perfect life begins to unravel when Daniel brings home Cherry (Cooke), a girlfriend who changes everything. After a tense introduction, Laura becomes convinced Cherry is hiding something.


	Is she a social climber or is Laura imagining it? As 25M-plus viewers have thus far discovered, the truth is a matter of perspective in the show.


	Wright shared a first clip from the series as she was honored at the Monte Carlo TV Festival back in June. The Girlfriend was created by Naomi Sheldon and produced by Imaginarium Productions and Amazon MGM Studios. Jonathan Cavendish and Caroline Norris serve as producers. Wright, Will Tennant, Phil Robertson, John Zois, Dave Clarke, Gabbie Asher, and Michelle Frances are executive producers.


	Prime Video does not routinely break out viewing figures, although we have previously broken stories about the worldwide success of The Culpables franchise, another of its international hits.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Rock's everyman gets an everymovie with the generic Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere","https://www.avclub.com/springsteen-deliver-me-from-nowhere-review","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Bruce Springsteen is more American than apple pie. He wears black leather, blue denim, and lumberjack plaid. He likes a simply dressed hot dog. He waits a few dates before he goes in for the first kiss. In his humble New Jersey homeland, he hangs out in autoshops with his mechanic buddies, drives a Mustang that rides the blue-collar-meets-white-collar line he occupies, and stops calling back when things get serious, no matter how much money he has. 

Scott Cooper's biopic Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere meets the heartland rocker ( Jeremy Allen White, who acts and sounds more like a melting pot of the most recent biopic superstars than an era-defining artist) at the turn of the 1980s as he steps back from the burgeoning success that's come with his first five albums, the last of which (The River) earned him his first #1 charting position at home and abroad, setting his sixth album up for suffocating expectations. At first, Bruce is back and forth between constructing Nebraska in his living room on a 4-track and dreaming up Born In The U.S.A. in the hallowed halls of Power Station's Studio A. Yo-yoing between stripped-down folk and the quintessential American rock ‘n' roll that defines his music in recording sessions that couldn't be more disparate in sound, studio, personnel, and charting potential, Bruce eventually pauses on Born, much to the studio executives' displeasure, to pursue the brooding, early-Dylan-esque folk pouring darkly out of him in Nebraska. 

In between sessions and dates with Faye (Odessa Young), a single mother working as a waitress, Bruce looks back on his life in Walk Hard-like childhood flashbacks drowning in clichés—the kind of flashbacks that had already reached tired trope status in 2007. Sincerely screamed lines like, “I just want to get back to what happened in the bedroom!”—lines more worthy of Dewey Cox and Darlene Madison's innuendo-laden “Let's Duet” than a serious drama—land with an awkwardness that infects Cooper's whole screenplay. One would think the writer and director behind a fictionally based music biopic as searing as Crazy Heart could find a compelling note for an icon as lauded and cinematically untapped as Springsteen. Alas, Bad Blake comes across as more real than Bruce.

In its tender, tough, black-and-white flashback sentimentality, Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere channels recent awards-season hopefuls like Maestro and Oppenheimer. But Cooper can't find the flow between the film's aesthetics, which play like someone haphazardly stitched Walk The Line and Belfast together and declined to watch it before distribution. He can't find curiosities or singularities in his subjects.

Sure, Bruce's dad might've fit neatly into the “abusive alcoholic father” trope, to an extent, but there's an overt sense that he's been re-developed and retrofitted for unmistakable mass recognizability. Whatever might've made Bruce's father, or childhood, worth hearing about is erased and replaced with stories and characteristics (or the lack thereof) too empty to conjure believable memories, scenarios, or conversations, so gray and vague they could apply to any and everyone.

Paul Walter Hauser plays the all-too-trusting, happy-to-be-there guitar technician, who helps imbue Nebraska with its definitive brash tape echoes and notably unproduced sound, like an SNL bit. Jeremy Strong turns in his first dud performance of the decade as Bruce's manager and co-producer Jon Landau. The corny narrow-mindedness of the big-budget music biopic flood that Bohemian Rhapsody unleashed seven years ago is insurmountable for anyone in the cast or crew.

With so little to grab onto or take interest in, the two-hour film feels like four, each stale beat an audible groan of predictability that only occasionally comes up for air when White busts out the pipes. His Springsteen impression, especially on stage, is impressive enough to momentarily distract from the surrounding scenes. But then the screenplay bends over backwards to explain what it all means in lyric-interpreting, eyeroll-inducing monologues between Landau and his wife before bed.

“They declared me unfit to live, said into that great void my soul'd be hurled / They wanted to know why I did what I did / Well, sir, I guess there's just a meanness in this world.” In folk tradition, Bruce tells the tale of another that he understands himself vicariously through—in this case, Badlands inspiration Charles Starkweather, who either kidnapped or romanced a 13-year-old girl and took her on a joyride kill spree from Nebraska to Wyoming.

But Bruce doesn't ever tap into the bad-boy cool of cold criminals, or the edgy risk of a maverick artist on the brink of his most celebrated work, or anything in between. Instead, Cooper entirely defines Springsteen as an everyman. That quality is part of what makes Springsteen so popular, so essential, so all-American. But it's not enough for a film to ride on, especially when it confuses the universal for the broadly formulaic. Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere is a slog, confused about the artist at its heart and stuck on unconvincing ideas about his art.

To steal a phrase from Flavortown Mayor Guy Fieri, this story is gangster. Appearing on 60 Minutes on Sunday night, Guy Fieri explained how 24,000 bottles of Santo Tequila, the brand owned by Fieri and “I Can't Drive 55” rocker Sammy Hagar, were stolen in an intricate cargo heist. As Fieri puts it, if it can happen to them, it can happen to anyone.

The heist went down like this: After being distilled and bottled in Guadalajara, Mexico, the tequila was shipped to Laredo, Texas, where it was split into two trucks, which would transport the agave-based alcohol to the Santo warehouse in Lansdale, Pennsylvania. However, because everything is done on these newfangled computers nowadays, with tequila companies outsourcing shipment to logistics companies, and logistics companies outsourcing to trucking companies, and trucking companies outsourcing to other trucking companies, a worm found its way in the bottle. Ultimately, the trucking company hired two other trucking companies, which turned out to be fake. The fake company sent GPS tracking and a video to Santo of a broken-down truck, along with a message stating that it had a severe water pump issue and that delivery would be delayed, but the bottles never arrived.

The whole story has a somewhat happy ending, with 11,000 bottles of Guy Fieri and Sammy Hagar tequila making it to the shelves. However, what happened to the rest is left to mystery. Somewhere, the proprietor of a fake trucking company is getting very drunk.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Taylor Swift hopes fans will like her new album one day","https://www.avclub.com/taylor-swift-responds-showgirl-criticism","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 05:09:00 GMT","

Despite what you may have heard, Taylor Swift is not “art police.” She's just a regular billionaire who released eight versions of a single album that no one seems to like that much. That album, The Life Of A Showgirl, isn't receiving the rapturous reception her music typically garners. Coupled with the experience of paying money to watch lyric videos in a movie theater, the album has broken whatever spell she had over fans and critics, as the singer is receiving some of the harshest reviews of her career.

But Swift isn't letting it get to her. Appearing on Apple Music's The Zane Lowe Interview, an interview show where Lowe laps celebrities with praise as artists get as real as their media training allows, Swift offered a rebuke to those criticizing the album: Thanks for the free promo, dude. “The rule of show business is if it's the first week of my album release and you are saying either my name or my album title, you're helping,” Swift said. It doesn't matter if you're mocking Swift's phallic imagery or trying to figure out how to “girl-boss too close to the sun,” Swift “welcome[s] the chaos.” As someone with “a lot of respect for people's subjective opinions on art,” Swift maintains that she isn't the “art police” and that “everybody is allowed to feel exactly how they want” about the record.

Still, she hopes that people will come to like the album eventually. In the past, it has taken her fans some time to get on board with whatever new era Swift finds herself in. She loves that growth and hopes it will one day apply to this one as well. “What I often love seeing my fans say is, ‘I used to be someone who didn't relate to Reputation. And now that I've been through some other things in my life, that's my favorite album.' Or, ‘I used to be a Fearless girlie, now I'm obsessed with Evermore.' We're doing this thing for keeps,” Swift said. “I have such an eye on legacy when I'm making my music. I know what I made. I know I adore it, and I know that on the theme of what the Showgirl is, all of this is part of it.” Once more of her fans meet the Super Bowl-winning superstar of their dreams, they'll get Life Of A Showgirl.

California is turning down the volume on streamers. Yesterday, in an effort to get streaming services to shut off that godforsaken racket, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed bill SB 576 into law, restricting streamers from airing commercials that are louder than the program being watched. Essentially, the bill, co-sponsored by Senator Thomas Umberg, applies the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act (CALM) of 2010 to streaming services.

“We heard Californians loud and clear, and what's clear is that they don't want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program,” Newsom said in a statement. “By signing SB 576, California is dialing down this inconvenience across streaming platforms, which had previously not been subject to commercial volume regulations passed by Congress in 2010.”

The bill arrives several years after streamers, such as Netflix, entered the advertising game. Now that streamers have exited the austerity phase of their chokehold on subscribers—banning password sharing and affordable subscription plans—many users who like to scroll through dinner have opted for ad-supported tiers. In May, Netflix reported that its ad-based options had 94 million monthly active users, many of whom are likely experiencing hearing loss and have no idea why.

Loud commercials are one of the few bipartisan issues left in American politics. Though the White House and Newsom have spent the year in a shitposting race to the bottom, they have found common ground in disenfranchising and endangering LGBTQ+ people and making life even more unbearable for the unhoused. Now they can break bread over eardrum-bursting Skyrizi ads. Earlier this year, the Trump FCC began investigating the high-volume advertisements. In recent years, TV networks have sidestepped CALM regulations by increasing the volume on shows, thus allowing for louder commercials. It's been a self-destructive cycle. Non-commercial content got louder and therefore less coherent, leading to an increase in viewers watching with subtitles. But at least those Nugenix commercials arrive with crystal clarity.

Senator Umberg also released a statement, dedicating the bill to “baby Samantha and every exhausted parent who's finally gotten a baby to sleep, only to have a blaring streaming ad undo all that hard work.” We salute you, baby Samantha. Enjoy your rest.

Bob Ross painted approximately 30,000 paintings in his time. Many of which were painted on camera in a single 30-minute broadcast on his beloved PBS series, The Joy Of Painting. Per AP, 30 of those priceless works, which, in Mr. Ross' opinion, anyone could make, are being sold at auction to benefit public television and radio stations financially devastated by federal budget cuts. Over the summer, at the behest of President Trump, who finds public broadcasting too woke or whatever, Congress eliminated $1.1 billion in previously allocated funds for public broadcasting. Shortly after, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund PBS, NPR, and approximately 1,500 local radio and television stations, announced it was closing, thus leaving the burden of financing the stations squarely on viewers like you.

Ross' paintings will be auctioned off online and in numerous cities around the world, including Boston, London, Los Angeles, and New York, starting in November. All profits will help stations cover licensing fees for shows distributed by American Public Television, because shouldn't every household have access to Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood and This Old House?

Ross made it his life's mission to make art accessible to everyone, teaching countless viewers, stoned and otherwise, how to paint beautiful fields, snowy mountaintops, idyllic ponds, and, yes, happy trees in less than 30 minutes. But all that dried Prussian blue and dark sienna has become quite valuable in the years following Ross' death in 1995. In August, Bonhams auction house in LA sold two Ross originals for upwards of $95,000. According to Bonhams, the entire collection is estimated to be worth $850,000 to $1.4 million.

Dwayne Johnson recently addressed the disappointing box office performance of “The Smashing Machine” by focusing on the personal impact the film had on his life and career.

The A24 drama, which premiered on October 3, opened to $5.9 million domestically from 3,345 venues. It marked the lowest opening weekend of Johnson's career. The results fell significantly below projections of $8 million to $15 million, according to Variety.

Despite the underwhelming commercial reception, Johnson took to Instagram on Monday, October 6. He expressed gratitude and reflected on what the experience meant to him personally.

“From deep in my grateful bones, thank you to everyone who has watched ‘The Smashing Machine,'” Johnson wrote in his Instagram post. “In our storytelling world, you can't control box office results — but what I realized you can control is your performance, and your commitment to completely disappear and go elsewhere. And I will always run to that opportunity.”

The actor specifically thanked director Benny Safdie for believing in him for the role. “It was my honor to transform in this role for my director, Benny Safdie. Thank you brother for believing in me,” Johnson stated.

He concluded his message by highlighting the personal significance of the project. “Truth is this film has changed my life. With deep gratitude, respect and radical empathy, DJ,” he wrote.

In “The Smashing Machine,” Johnson portrays Mark Kerr, a two-time UFC heavyweight champion whose career spanned from 1997 to 2009. The film chronicles Kerr's professional highs and lows in mixed martial arts, including his struggles with substance abuse. Emily Blunt co-stars as Kerr's wife, Dawn Staples. The story tracks their turbulent relationship amid the fighter's rise and fall in the sport.

A post shared by Dwayne Johnson (@therock)

While the film struggled commercially, it received significant critical recognition. “The Smashing Machine” premiered at the Venice Film Festival to widespread acclaim, with Safdie winning the festival's best director prize. Even critics who gave less favorable reviews to the overall film praised Johnson's dramatic performance. Many frequently mentioned him as a potential Oscar contender for best actor.

The film currently holds a 73% critic rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 235 verified critical reviews. It also maintains a 77% approval rating on the platform's audience-generated popcornmeter, averaged across 250 user-submitted reviews.

The poor box office performance is a significant financial setback for A24. The studio spent $50 million on production and additional millions on promotional efforts, including festival appearances at Venice and Toronto. According to Deadline, the film could lose between $10 million and $15 million.

Johnson had previously opened up about his initial fears regarding the role. In August, he described the experience as “very real,” explaining to Variety: “I had not experienced that in a very, very, very long time, where I was really scared and thinking, ‘I don't know if I can do this. Can I do this?' I realized that maybe these opportunities weren't coming my way because I was too scared to explore this stuff.”

The actor also discussed breaking away from the action roles that have defined much of his career. “The three of us have talked for a very long time about, when you're in Hollywood – as we all know, it had become about box office. And you chase the box office, and the box office can be very loud, and it can become very resounding, and it can push you into a category and a corner. This is your lane and this is what you do and this is what Hollywood wants you to do,” Johnson explained.

“The Smashing Machine” landed in third place during its opening weekend. It fell behind Leonardo DiCaprio's “One Battle After Another,” which earned $11 million in its second weekend, and Taylor Swift's “The Official Release Party of a Showgirl” movie, which topped the box office with $33 million.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Jack Osbourne Tearfully Gives Vulnerable Update on Mom Sharon's Grief After Ozzy's Passing","https://entertainmentnow.com/music/jack-osbourne-update-sharon-after-ozzy/","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:28:06 GMT","

Jack Osbourne is opening up about how his mom, Sharon Osbourne, is coping in the months following the death of her husband, Ozzy Osbourne. During a deeply emotional appearance on Good Morning America on October 6, the 39-year-old became tearful as he shared that Sharon is still learning to navigate life after losing her partner of more than 40 years.

“You know, when people have been asking me that question, I say, ‘She's OK, but she's not OK,'” Jack said. “I know she feels the love, and that has been such a level that none of us could ever really… You know, every child sits there and kind of has this thought about one day that parents won't be there, and what will that be like. We just didn't think of it. It was a different weight to it.”

Ozzy died on July 22 at age 76, just 17 days after performing his farewell Back to the Beginning concert in Birmingham, England, alongside his Black Sabbath bandmates. Speaking to GMA's Chris Connelly, Jack recalled the emotions he felt watching that final show.

“I was with my brother, and we both were just crying,” he said. “Not because we were sad for him, but because we knew it was his last time.”

Reflecting on the bittersweet moment, Jack added, “In hindsight, it kind of was a living wake if you think about it.”

A post shared by Sharon Osbourne (@sharonosbourne)

Sharon, 72, was front and center at the July 5 charity show, which she helped organize for Ozzy. Since his death, she's kept a low profile, appearing in public only a handful of times. 

On July 30, she was seen stepping from the funeral procession to lay flowers at the Black Sabbath Bridge and Bench in Birmingham, where fans gathered to pay tribute to the rock legend.

A post shared by Sharon Osbourne (@sharonosbourne)

She remained silent on social media until September 12, when she shared a video from a day out with her daughter, Kelly Osbourne. In her caption, she thanked fans for their “overwhelming love and support” that carried her through “many nights.”

Though Sharon continues to grieve deeply, Jack said the outpouring of compassion has helped his mother begin to heal. “She's not OK, but she feels the love,” he repeated, acknowledging the immense support their family has received from around the world.

In her September post, Sharon admitted she is still “finding her footing” after losing her husband. “I love you all, and I thank you deeply for the otherworldly amount of love you continue to send my way,” she wrote.

As the Osbourne family continues to navigate their grief, their strength, unity, and connection to fans remain a touching reminder of the love that defined Ozzy's legacy.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Dolly Parton's Sister Gives Health Update After Asking for Prayers","https://entertainmentnow.com/the-voice/dolly-parton-sister-health-update-prayers/","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 02:08:40 GMT","

Dolly Parton‘s sister initially asked fans for their prayers for the country singer, which had many very concerned about her health. Freida Parton posted a new message about her sister that has fans breathing a sigh of relief. Learn the latest about the former “The Voice” guest mentor's health, with an update from her rep.

A post shared by Dolly Parton (@dollyparton)

On October 7, Freida posted a message on Facebook asking for prayers for her sister.

“Last night, I was up all night praying for my sister, Dolly. Many of you know she hasn't been feeling her best lately,” Freida wrote. “I truly believe in the power of prayer, and I have been lead to ask all of the world that loves her to be prayer warriors and pray with me.”

Freida added, “She's strong, she's loved, and with all the prayers being lifted for her, I know in my heart she's going to be just fine. Godspeed, my sissy Dolly. We all love you!”

Fans were understandably concerned by Freida's message and, later in the day, she shared another Facebook post to let everyone know that Dolly is doing okay.

“I want to clear something up. I didn't mean to scare anyone or make it sound so serious when asking for prayers for Dolly,” Freida wrote. “She's been a little under the weather, and I simply asked for prayers because I believe so strongly in the power of prayer.”

She added, “It was nothing more than a little sister asking for prayers for her big sister. Thank you all for lifting her up. Your love truly makes a difference.”

Fans flooded the comments section to share their relief and offer up their prayers. “Your love for your sister is truly heartwarming. Dolly is lucky to have you looking out for her,” one person wrote.

Another fan noted, “So glad you cleared that up. She's the queen and my dream is to meet her someday. God is good and he's got her for all the good shes done in this world. Y'all are good people around here.”

“Thanks Freida … definitely understand! We all have Dolly in our prayers!” another follower shared.

Update: On October 7, Dolly's rep, Olly Rowland, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the singer is fine. “It's just the kidney stones, and the procedure she needs to resolve those. It looks like her sister posted, and it got quite a bit blown out of proportion, weirdly,” Rowland shared. 

According to the paper, Dolly plans to record a video on October 8 from her home in Nashville.

A post shared by Dolly Parton (@dollyparton)

On September 28, Parton took to Instagram to tell her fans she needed to postpone her upcoming concerts.

“I want the fans and public to hear directly from me that, unfortunately, I will need to postpone my upcoming Las Vegas concerts,” she wrote.

The singer continued, “As many of you know, I have been dealing with some health challenges, and my doctors tell me that I must have a few procedures.”

“As I joked with them, it must be time for my 100,000-mile check-up, although it's not the usual trip to see my plastic surgeon!” Parton noted.

“In all seriousness, given this, I am not going to be able to rehearse and put together the show that I want you to see, and the show that you deserve to see,” the singer stated. “You pay good money to see me perform, and I want to be at my best for you.”

She continued, “While I'll still be able to work on all of my projects from here in Nashville, I just need a little time to get show ready, as they say. And don't worry about me quittin' the business because God hasn't said anything about stopping yet.”

The country star added, “But, I believe He is telling me to slow down right now so I can be ready for more big adventures with all of you. I love you and thank you for understanding.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Amal Clooney Chops Off Her Locks for New ‘Bubble' Look: PHOTOS","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/amal-clooney-hair-transformation-photos/","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:29:37 GMT","

Amal Clooney is welcoming fall with a stunning new look that perfectly blends elegance and confidence. The 47-year-old human rights lawyer debuted her shorter hairstyle while speaking at an event on Monday, October 6, marking a chic departure from her signature waist-length locks. 

Her glossy brunette hair now features soft caramel highlights, parted to the side and cut to her chest, giving her a fresh, sophisticated glow.

A post shared by Dimitris Giannetos (@dimitrishair)

Hairstylist Dimitris Giannetos shared the transformation on Instagram, proudly writing, “AMAL CLOONEY ❤️ ‘The bubble blowout' and a new chop for Amal Clooney!” 

Fans couldn't get enough of her updated style, flooding the comments with admiration. “She's breathtaking! True beauty inside and out,” one user gushed, while another wrote, “Absolutely stunning — the length is perfect!”

Giannetos later told Vogue that he cut between six and eight inches of Clooney's hair, marking a bold change for the star. “Amal has never had a haircut like this before,” he said. He described the new look as a “power cut,” explaining that it's cut bluntly at the décolletage with long, face-framing pieces. “It's sophisticated and modern,” he added.

A post shared by Dimitris Giannetos (@dimitrishair)

The stylist advised that anyone looking to recreate the look should ask for a clean, structured cut that hits at the collarbone, paired with subtle highlights for warmth and dimension.

Clooney styled her new cut with a sleek black V-neck top featuring short sleeves, button details, and a peplum waist, paired with dark trousers. Her makeup was equally polished, with dewy skin, softly blushed cheeks, pink lips, and defined eyes accented by long lashes and well-groomed brows.

The effortlessly chic look quickly became a social media favorite, with fans praising her as “timeless” and “the definition of elegance.”

A post shared by Demi Moore (@demimoore)

Giannetos, who's worked with some of Hollywood's biggest names, is no stranger to helping stars reinvent their looks. He previously teamed up with Clooney ahead of the 2025 Albies Awards, when he refreshed her signature brunette with a “toasted almond” glaze and subtle face-framing highlights.

The celebrity stylist also made waves recently for giving Demi Moore a bold new fringe.

Moore unveiled her look on Instagram, writing, “Bangs — now and then. Thank you, @gucci, for letting me bring back the fringe for the first time since the ‘Striptease' days!” The 62-year-old actress wore her long, wavy hair loose, channeling her iconic 1990s style from the film “Striptease.”

As for Clooney, her chic new “power cut” is a reminder that true elegance never fades — it just keeps evolving.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Taylor Swift Offers an Update on Her Dad Following His Major Surgery","https://entertainmentnow.com/taylor-swift/taylor-swift-update-dad-major-surgery/","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 02:02:38 GMT","

Taylor Swift has updated fans on the condition of her dad, Scott Swift, following his quintuple bypass surgery that took place four months ago, per People. Offering the update during an interview for SiriusXM's “The Morning Mashup” on Monday, October 6, Taylor said, “By his own according of it, he's actually at 150% now.”

“He's actually got too much energy,” she revealed. She then added, “He's doing amazing.”

She also noted that her family spent the summer months “getting him back to his old self.”

Taylor's dad, Scott, is doing well these days, and that's in part to the medical staff who took care of him, according to Taylor. During her interview for SiriusXM's “The Morning Mashup,” she explained, “He had amazing medical care and help and doctors and nurses who I am going to be forever grateful for.” 

Beyond that, the superstar singer said that going through something like this “recontextualizes what matters to you.”

“It reminds me how lucky I am that he pulled through,” Taylor said.

Once you're aware of what is involved in a quintuple bypass surgery, you'll realize that Taylor's dad went through quite a physical ordeal.

“Quintuple bypass surgery is a complex procedure done to treat people with five severely blocked major arteries that feed the heart,” according to VeryWell Health. “Blood vessels are removed from another part of the body and transplanted onto each affected heart vessel to reroute blood flow around the blockages.”

VeryWell Health continues: “This surgery — also called quintuple coronary artery bypass graft surgery — improves blood supply to the heart, reducing pain, shortness of breath, and possibly the risk of cardiac-related death.”

Fortunately, you can take preventative measures before surgery becomes necessary. It was thanks to a cardiac stress test that Scott's condition was detected by doctors, Taylor said during her appearance on fiancé Travis Kelce's “New Heights” podcast (via People) on August 13.

“So, he's been telling all his friends, ‘You need to get the stress test because that's what's actually preventative.' If you can find that earlier, you don't have to have a bypass surgery,” Taylor explained. “You can sort out those blockages with stents and things that are a lot less invasive.”

There's a new “Girls” in town, as HBO has dropped the official trailer for its upcoming series, “I Love LA.” Like that Lena Dunham series but with a decidedly more hedonistic spin given this first footage, the series centers on a friend group navigating relationships, career, success, and party-going. It comes from comedian turned creator/star Rachel Sennott, best known onscreen for her performances in “Bottoms” and “Shiva Baby.” The new series also draws comparisons to Issa Rae's Los Angeles-set “Insecure.”

The logline — “an ambitious friend group navigates life and love in LA” — tells us little, but based on the trailer, Sennott is bringing her vocal-fried, Gen Z signature stamp to the eight-episode first season. Set to premiere November 2 on HBO and HBO Max, the series also stars Odessa A'zion (poised to break out big with a role in Josh Safdie's upcoming “Marty Supreme“), Jordan Firstman, True Whitaker, and Josh Hutcherson. In the “I Love LA” trailer, Sennott's working a dead-end office job, up for a promotion that gets botched, and has a wild friend group wriggling their way through their own personal and professional struggles.

Guest stars on the series (and we get a glimpse of a few of them here) include Leighton Meester, Moses Ingram, Lauren Holt, Elijah Wood, Quenlin Blackwell, Josh Brener, Tim Baltz, Froy Gutierrez, and Colin Woodell. There's no promise of a Season 2 yet, though “I Love LA” isn't billed as a limited series.

 










Emma Barrie, Aida Rodgers, Max Silvestri, and Lorene Scafaria also executive produce, with episodic directors on the series including Sennott herself, plus Lorene Scafaria, Bill Benz, and Kevin Bray.

Sennott earned a 2024 Best Screenplay nomination at the Film Independent Spirit Awards for the lesbian high school comedy “Bottoms,” co-written and directed by “Shiva Baby” filmmaker Emma Seligman. “I Love LA” isn't exactly Sennott's HBO debut, as she had a supporting role as Lily-Rose Depp's assistant and BFF in the critically derided one-off series “The Idol.” She also recently starred in Sony's 2024 film “Saturday Night” as “SNL” writer Rosie Shuster.

You couldn't write “After the Hunt” screenwriter Nora Garrett‘s story and expect anyone to believe it. Consider the timeline: She wrote her first script in 2022, sold it to Imagine Entertainment in January 2023, saw director Luca Guadagnino sign on to direct just three months later, followed by the addition of major cast members like Julia Roberts, and the project went into production by June 2023. In August 2025, it premiered at Venice. In September, it opened the New York Film Festival. And, later this week, it will hit theaters.

Before all that? Garrett paid her dues, first as a trained actress, then as a personal assistant to all manner of big stars (Rosamund Pike and Natasha Lyonne, to name a few), and then as a data analyst training AI for Meta (no, she is not a fan of AI, full stop). All those experiences helped inform Garrett's script, which follows Roberts as Yale philosophy professor Alma Imhoff, whose entire life is upended (just before she's set to make tenure!) when a favorite student (Maggie, played by Ayo Edibiri) accuses a fellow professor and Alma's BFF (Hank, played by Andrew Garfield) of a horrific act. To say Alma is caught in the middle doesn't cover the half of it.

Ahead, Garrett takes IndieWire through her winding (and very humbling) career path, including film bro worries and Natasha Lyonne's film school, what happens when your entire life changes in a snap, and why she's so fixated on liars.

 










(One thing we don't discuss here? The film's ending. Come back on Friday afternoon for a longer dissection of that with Garrett, including spoilers.)

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: For your first produced screenplay, it feels like you've been a little bit spoiled by the experience.

Nora Garrett: [Laughs] I think “spoiled” sums up pretty much every element of this experience. Our producer, Allan Mandelbaum, kept turning to me, and he kept saying, “Don't get used to this. This isn't how it always is. This is a very rarefied experience.”

Your resume is very interesting. You also act, you were a personal assistant for a long time to a lot of big-name stars, you worked for Meta. How do you look back on those years now?

Obviously, I spent a lot of those years being very frustrated. I think the gap between my ambition and my circumstances was so wide, and it felt sometimes like it was only widening. Now, obviously, it's much easier to look back and be so grateful for all of those experiences, because not only do I think that they much better prepared me for this moment, but also I think that it's really important to have the opportunity to live and collect experiences before attempting to write about them.

 










I was a dancer for a really long time, and that was my first entree into performing. I loved it so much. I was a classical ballerina, but then I transitioned into acting. As a kid, I was reading all the time. I was a voracious reader, a huge nerd. The Scholastic Book Fair in the library was my idea of a good time, you know what I'm saying?

That was the best.

The best! Luckily, my mother was very encouraging with that. She told me that no matter what, we could always go out and buy a book. [Reading] really my first entree into writing. And then I was always writing, too. As soon as I could get a composition notebook, I was always writing little stories.

I grew up not necessarily watching a lot of movies, and if I did, they were very old movies or musicals. Or “Legally Blonde,” “Charlie's Angels,” “Liar Liar,” “The Big Green,” which I still think are canon. Then I went to college, and I was reading a lot of plays. But it wasn't until post-collegially that I really started watching films, and interacting with films, and really loving films.

I dated someone in college who, we didn't have this verbiage at the time, but was very much a film bro. He was with a bunch of film bros, and they all were in the acting program, but wanted to be screenwriters. I felt like, “Oh, that's who becomes a screenwriter. I don't belong in this world, because I can't quote ‘American Werewolf in London' and ‘American Psycho.' I'm not going to belong here.”

 










But I really credit Natasha Lyonne, who I worked for for a brief period of time, who was like, “If you want to work in this industry, you have to speak the same language as other people, and that's film. Especially because you're a young woman, people are going to discount you right off the bat. But if you can speak their language, you have a better shot.” She gave me a list of films to watch. That was her film school. That was really when I started getting really inspired by genre, and the idea of how facile and creative this particular art form is.

Your initial dreams were around acting, and you attended NYU as part of its prestigious Tisch Drama program. What were your expectations when you first went to college?

I had an outsized amount of completely unearned confidence. I felt like, “I'm going to be an actor immediately, and I'm going to be very successful.” And then, of course, that did not happen. I had no understanding of the amount of grit and perseverance that being in this industry takes, especially as an actor. I don't think I was trying to be so naive willfully, but I had gotten into college, I was in Tisch, and I felt like I was a part of a cohort where we were all going to just be successful immediately post-graduation.

When that didn't happen, and then continued to not happen for years and years and years, there is a reckoning. For a very long time, so much of my identity was tied up in the notion of becoming an actor and being an actor. Again, it's one of those things where I look back on it, I'm so grateful for it. But in the time, it was very painful. Bradley Whitford has a good quote about this, that to be an actor, you have to have this feeling of seeing someone on a huge screen, and thinking to yourself, “Oh, I can do that.” And that type of almost delusional ambition, when met with the realities of the industry … it was a huge, humbling journey.

 










When you started writing this script, you were working for Meta and helping train some of their artificial intelligence models. What can you even tell me about that experience?

I will try, without breaking my NDA, which I am sure is still active. I was on the cusp of throwing in the towel. I was exhausted. I had not had health insurance for a very long time. I'm in my almost-mid-30s, and I was watching my friends have a lot of good disposable income and creating their lives and reaching a professional echelon where they were feeling very confident and very settled in what they were doing. I just felt like, “What am I doing here?”

I had gone back to work at a counter service restaurant, because I was really adamant about not wanting to be an assistant again, because I felt I had reached my ceiling there. Then I learned, going back to restaurant work is very different at 32 than it is at 26. I was like, “You know what? I just need to get a job where I can have a certain amount of income, and I'm in a corporate superstructure, so hopefully I can enter into an echelon where I'm just not in so much debt, and living hand to mouth as a 30-something. Where I can go to the doctor without being terrified!”

I got recruited by Meta on LinkedIn because of a job that I had done for a nonprofit, editing some of their scripts and writing some of their scripts. It's funny because I'm staunchly anti-AI. I know the genie can't go back into the bottle, but it's not for me. I don't want to use it; I don't like how mechanized it's making human beings.

 










But I was so relieved to get the job. Technically, the title is Data Analyst. It was definitely the worst ratio of pay to hours spent that I've ever had in my entire life. I think sometimes people hear Meta and they think, A, “women in STEM,” [that's] not me. But B, they're like, “You must have been earning a good amount of money.” I was not. It was definitely something where I felt like, “Oh, I've never been in something this corporate, and it is so not for me.” So, I was feeling very lost. And then everything started happening with this film.

You told me that the first spark for “After the Hunt” was not a real-world situation or a news story, but the character of Alma. What was it about her that first came to you?

I remember very specifically getting the idea for the character of Alma, and I also had a Google Doc of just ideas where I felt like, OK, anything that came to mind, I would just write it down. I still do that. I remember writing this idea down, and it was about academia, and it was the professor sort-of triangle with the student.

Right after sparking to this idea, I joined a class run by another writer named Tim Neenan. It was instrumental to me, because I'd taken a lot of ad hoc screenwriting courses, playwriting courses, pilot writing courses, but this was the first one that really gave me a bite-sized structure that allowed me to feel like I was grabbing onto something in the kind of larger mandate of, “Write a screenplay.” The goal of the class was to have a completed first draft in 12 weeks. It was really quick. We had to come to the [first] class with an idea, and I remember going back to my idea book and choosing this one.

 










I think that, based on the conversation we've had in this interview, it should come as no surprise that I felt like I was on the outskirts of a certain amount of success for a long time. I felt so stymied. I felt like I had so much I wanted to do, and so much I wanted to say, and so much I wanted to create, and nowhere to put it.

I got very fascinated with people who had a certain amount of success, and what that looks like. I listened to a podcast from “This American Life,” it's called “Liars.” The upshot of [this episode] is an anthropologist got obsessed with a college swim team. Everybody ate the same, trained the same, slept the same, had the same technique, but some of those people would win races and some would not.

So this person got very fascinated by considering, “If all the conditions are the same, what's happening internally?” And they discovered that the people who were the best at winning races are the people who are the best at lying to themselves. People who are the most successful in the sociological construct that we've settled on, are people who are very good at obfuscating their own interiority from themselves. But my personal perspective is, eventually your interiority catches up to you. Eventually, whatever you're obfuscating or pushing down, it has to somehow come out.

 










There's literally no way to get away from it, because you can't get away from yourself.

Exactly. That certainly is my experience. I was fascinated by trying to live in this person who had successfully done that, because it felt so foreign to me. And then having the experience of, “Oh, God. I'm right there, and now all of a sudden everything that has been fueling me to this point, is now the very thing hampering me.”

You've mentioned that your cousin went to Stanford and gave you sort of a peek behind the curtain with the heavy Ivy League stuff.

Parker, the best! She's getting her master's in philosophy. She would give me a lot of insight into what type of lectures she was invited to. We didn't talk too much about classroom structure, but I did vet her a lot of being like, “Does this feel believable? Does this language feel robust enough? Does this sound like something that a professor in your cohort would talk about?”

Some of the language is so willfully opaque that I had to pull back from that a little bit, just because people have to understand. I always wanted there to be a certain sense of humor about it, as much as these characters are talking in a way that is so heady. I hope that there was kind of a sense alongside it for the audience, that they were in on the kind of joke of how highfalutin all of this language was.

 










It sounds as if you sold your script fairly quickly, and then Luca came on board. What was that like for you, as someone who had obviously been wanting this and hoping for this for so long, and then it finally happens?

My father has a really wonderful phrase: “It's an overnight success, 10 years in the making.” Which is really what it felt like. This experience is so rare, and so much of it is because of who Luca is in the industry, and what his attachment means. So much borne out of his genius and his reputation and his body of work. I feel very, very lucky and very conscious of that. Luca also does like to move very quickly, and specifically with this film, he understood that it's kind of like a time capsule. It is so much about a social moment, that I don't think he wanted there to be any attrition for the potency of it. 

[Before I sold the script], I didn't have an agent, I didn't have a manager. I asked a friend to introduce me to a manager. I thought, best case scenario, the script would become a spec that I would use as an example of my writing, and then I would get hopefully a manager, hopefully some jobs. Because it's the exact opposite of what everyone tells you to write, it's an adult psychological drama, it's very heady. There's a lot of people talking. There's not a lot of action sequences. It can feel very play-like. And it's about a subject that most people don't want to talk about or touch.

 










But then the woman who became my manager, Sydney Blanke, was very smart about who she sent the script out to. Allan Mandelbaum had just come out of doing “Fair Play,” and was then at Imagine. I had a meeting with a couple of interested producers, but Allan and the rest of the team at Imagine were always the ones who I felt like had just a real creative understanding, and also a really good idea of how to approach getting it made. Part of that was making a list of directors.

This whole time, I'm working at Meta. I don't have a car. I'm borrowing friends' cars to go to meetings at Imagine. I have my work phone on me to make sure I'm not missing things. I'm just stressed. As soon as we made a list of directors and Luca was right at the top of the list, I was like, “There's no way. There's no way.” I can't even put my head there, because to hope would be insane.

He came on in March, and we were in prep by June. It just all happened so fast. Being an assistant for so long, I had seen so many projects have really great attachments, and fall apart at the 11th hour, at the 9th hour, at the 12th hour. The whole time, I just kept telling myself not to get too excited, not to let myself get ahead of myself. But finally, once we were on set, I started to feel like it was actually going to go off.

 










I still remember receiving the group text between Allan and my manager Sydney and I, where he said that Luca was interested. Then, there were a couple of actresses interested. And then suddenly the language was, “Julia is attaching.” I am telling my family this. Everyone is asking, “Well, what does attaching mean?” And I'm realizing, I don't know. It's such a nebulous term, and it feels so fragile. That was one of those things where I just felt like I couldn't allow myself to get excited, until deals were closed.

What was the day where you felt like, “Maybe we're actually making this movie?”

When we started rehearsals, I was like, “OK, no one's bowing out yet. I think that we're all on board.” This is crass, but I think it's a Tom Hardy quote where he said something like, “It's not real until you take a shit in the trailer.” I just kept telling myself that. Once we were in the production offices, and I started seeing how many different departments were bringing all of their creativity to bear on it, I felt like, “OK, people are actually here, working on this.” It isn't about me anymore, if it was ever about me. It's really a communal experience now, and it's going to happen.

One of the best films to emerge out of the 2025 Sundance Film Festival was Clint Bentley's ruminative and tragic Pacific Northwest odyssey “Train Dreams.” For his second feature, “Jockey” director Bentley adapts a Denis Johnson novella with “Sing Sing” director Greg Kwedar as co-writer; both were nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars earlier this year for that prison-set drama.

In “Train Dreams,” for which distributor Netflix has just released the official trailer, Australian actor/filmmaker Joel Edgerton makes the case for his first Best Actor Oscar nomination. He stars as Robert Grainier, an introspective logger and railroad worker whose life shapes and reshapes alongside the changes to the industry and landscape of early-20th-century America. Oscar nominee Felicity Jones co-stars as his wife, and the mother of his child, Gladys, with “Jockey” star Clifton Collins Jr., William H. Macy, and Kerry Condon also making scene-stealing turns as others who touch Robert's life.

“I love movies that allow you to learn new things and get physical, and I feel good being on set in nature,” Edgerton told IndieWire at Sundance of the production's immersive qualities. “I was really drawn to this for those other reasons as well. And there's certain skills, and you want to make sure that you're doing things just so, and along the way, we have to really take care because we were talking about logging, and we obviously don't want to just go in cavalier and start presuming we could chop down a bunch of trees.”

As I wrote in my review for IndieWire out of Sundance, “Robert goes from day laborer to Spokane railroad logger, perennially tested by a nature that seems to have more control over human destiny than people themselves do. Co-written by Bentley with Greg Kwedar (the primary creative team behind ‘Sing Sing'), ‘Train Dreams' thrives on its philosophical inquiries into the earthly randomness of events that make up a life. The effect — amplified by skillful craftsmanship and a fondness for detail in even the most out-of-focus corners of a shot — leaves you winded.”

“Train Dreams” arrives in theaters on November 7 and streams on Netflix November 21. Watch the trailer below. It's one of Netflix's prime awards contenders this season, along with Kathryn Bigelow's “A House of Dynamite,” Richard Linklater's “Nouvelle Vague,” and Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein.”

Earlier this year, an LGBTQ+ film festival in Arizona was forced to shut down after the administration issued executive orders gutting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Funding disappeared overnight. A cultural home that had taken years to build vanished in an instant.

I couldn't shake the image of an entire community cut off from a space that affirmed their lives and their stories.

At NewFest — the country's largest LGBTQ+ film festival, which I've had the honor of leading for the past six years — we decided that silence wasn't an option. So we launched the Arizona Queer Film Access Initiative, offering free virtual access to our full lineup for Arizona residents.

If their screens were going dark, we would find a way to turn them back on.

This year, our campaign for the 37th Annual New York LGBTQ+ Film Festival is simple: Queer film is an act of rebellion. I don't mean that as a slogan. I mean it literally.

In a moment when lawmakers are dictating what stories can be told in classrooms, libraries, and theaters — when drag performers are being criminalized and trans people are treated as abstractions on debate stages while facing real violence in hospitals, bathrooms and streets — the very act of making, presenting or even watching queer cinema becomes defiant.

 










Hollywood loves a rainbow when it trends well. But the winds have shifted. DEI pledges have been quietly retired. Queer greenlights and marketing support — especially for anything that isn't glossy, cis, or easily sellable — have stalled.

What's happening in Arizona is not an anomaly. It's a warning.

And this is why queer film festivals matter — not as showcases, but as infrastructure. As front lines.

NewFest isn't just a week of red carpets, and this year's edition kicks off in a moment when community matters more than ever. Beyond the films and the stars, it's also Dyke Nyte, where hundreds of queer women and nonbinary people flood a theater and howl at a dyke comedy at midnight. It's our T4T Mixer, where trans filmmakers don't have to explain themselves before they speak — and where two trans elders can slow-dance like they own the joint. That kind of joy isn't frivolous; it's refusal. It's proof that we're still here, still laughing, still loving, no matter who's trying to legislate us out of existence.

And festivals don't just wait for finished films to arrive — we actively support the creative community to help make them. For nearly 40 years, through programs like our Black Filmmakers Initiative and New Voices Filmmaker Grant, NewFest has been putting money, mentorship, and visibility directly into the hands of emerging queer and trans creators. And we're not alone. Other queer festivals have launched equally impactful programs — from Frameline's Completion Fund to Inside Out's RE:Focus Fund. If the industry is serious about wanting “new voices,” I can tell you exactly where they're coming from: right here.

 










If you want proof, look at Elegance Bratton. He screened his very first short at NewFest. Six years later, his debut feature “The Inspection” was produced and released by A24. That didn't happen in spite of queer film festivals; it happened because of them.

So here's my ask of the industry: If you believe that queer and trans lives are more than market trends — if you believe that censorship, erasure, and manufactured fear are not neutral business conditions — then now is the moment to decide which side of the screen you're on.

Don't just release films. Stand with them. Prioritize showing your queer films at queer festivals as part of your festival and release strategy, not as an afterthought, but as a core pipeline decision. Fund festivals before they disappear. Put your names, your dollars, your reputations behind the stories that are being targeted. Queer audiences reward the partners who show up, and we don't forget the ones who go silent when it matters.

Because the blackout is spreading. And the question isn't whether queer film is political.

It's whether we, as an industry, have the courage to keep the projector running, and to keep showing up for queer stories, and for the people who need them.

David Hatkoff is the Executive Director of NewFest, the country's largest LGBTQ+ film and media organization. The 37th Annual New York LGBTQ+ Film Festival runs October 9 – 21, 2025.

As IndieWire's David Ehrlich alluded to in his rave A- review of Park Chan-wook's “No Other Choice” when it made its lauded premiere at the 2025 Venice Film Festival, this is a movie about slaying the competition. Literally. And now the “No Other Choice” trailer is here. Watch it below.

The film stars Lee Byung-hun as a middle-aged man who suddenly loses the job he's held for several decades. With the job market looking especially bleak, he embarks on a radical course: Murdering the fellow applicants for the role on which he's set his cap. A whirlwind of bloody shenanigans ensue, all with Park's singular blend of the bloody and the humorous, in what Ehrlich called one of the South Korean auteur's most mainstream-accessible movies yet. As a result, IndieWire's Awards Editor Marcus Jones think “No Other Choice” may have real legs for Park in the forthcoming Oscar race.

Ehrlich wrote that it's the “rare film that feels sympathetic toward its protagonist without ever rooting for him, and Lee's elastic performance as Man-su — clumsy, pathetic, cucked by osmosis, and still only a hair worse than we are — is key to the balancing act of Park's tragicomic tone. Easy to roll your eyes at from the opening scene and increasingly pigheaded in all of the ones that follow, Man-su starts off a long way from likable and tumbles much lower in our estimation from there. But the high-wire nature of the movie's plot requires us to appreciate the credibility of Man-su's conviction without necessarily sharing it ourselves (there's a terrific scene where an oblivious Man-su lectures one of the men he wants to kill with all of the same perspective we've been screaming at him in our heads), and no one on Earth can match Park's signature ability to make characters more endearing as they stumble toward the void.”

 










“Miri's final decision to [redacted] is as easy to rebuke as Man-su's initial decision to become a serial killer, but — to the immense credit of a slaphappy movie with a surprisingly powerful sting — it's also just as difficult to dismiss outright. She holds onto the only choice that all of this madness has left her with, and as the world around her surrenders its last measure of agency to the demands of an apathetically efficient future (shoutout to AI!), Miri's refusal to abandon what's left of her own almost feels like its own fucked up kind of heroic act. Capitalism won't ever care about you, but people will always be full of surprises.” 

Neon will open “No Other Choice” in select theaters on Christmas Day with a wide expansion in January.

October 8, 2025

During a 2008 interview, Prodigy of Mobb Deep was asked whether he feared death. Mortality nipped at P's heels on every verse he rapped, and few could better elicit the chill that settles into your bones when life-or-death stakes loom over everything you do. Naturally, his answer reflected that steely resolve, forced onto him by the battlefields of Queensbridge: “Every day I wake up like, ‘This might be my last day, and I'm not scared of it.' I'm never scared to bite my tongue about something, or to come out and speak about something. Like, I ain't scared of death. What you gonna do to me?”

Nine years later, at age 42, he passed away in a tragic, oddly banal way: While on tour with bandmate Havoc in Las Vegas, he was hospitalized with complications from his lifelong struggle with sickle cell anemia; there, he choked while eating unsupervised and died. (His family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit with the hospital.)

Havoc spent years grieving the loss of his bandmate and brother-in-arms and juggled how, and whether, to pay musical tribute to him. “You wanna do something to send your comrade off with a 21-gun salute…because he deserves that,” he recently said during an appearance on the Bootleg Kev podcast. With help from longtime affiliate the Alchemist, Havoc put together Infinite, Mobb Deep's ninth album and the latest in Mass Appeal's Legend Has It series. It's the first posthumous release of the bunch, which inevitably brings its own complications. But Infinite is as seamless as projects like this get. For better and for worse, it plays like an album the duo might've released after 2014's largely forgettable double LP The Infamous Mobb Deep, an update to the pair's trademark sinister sound with a few nagging modern flourishes.

On paper, every dial imaginable has been set back. Outside of a stray COVID mention and a dumb Havoc bar about getting canceled for joking about someone's chromosomes, references are either era-specific (“Taj Mahal” is named for the formerly Trump-owned casino) or universal enough to not matter. Instead of the stable of producers behind Infamous, Havoc handles 11 of the album's 15 beats, with Alchemist embracing his grimy Murda Muzik and Infamy roots on the other four.

The best Havoc beats from Mobb Deep's prime took familiar sounds and bent them into menacing shapes. Here, tracks like “The M. The O. The B. The B.” and “Mr. Magik” mix that menace with the muted drum patterns he used on Kanye's The Life of Pablo, giving the low-end even more depth. Alchemist, for his part, falls back on the style that made him famous—all gutter drums and echoing samples. The glitzy fuzz of “Taj Mahal,” in particular, sounds like it was pulled off a lesser-known Street Sweepers mixtape, while “Score Points” and “My Era” wouldn't sound out of place on his collaborative albums with Prodigy.

Prodigy has no half-way appearances, either; he has at least one verse on every song, and does the hooks for a chunk of them. P's delivery is as curt and chilling as ever (“RIP, you can't son me/My pop's dead,” he deadpans on “My Era”), even when his writing treads well-worn ground. There were seams to tighten and holes to fill, but Havoc and Alchemist handle his vocals with care. Most importantly, Havoc and Prodigy's chemistry remains intact. Neither has ever been a particularly showy writer or lyrical gymnast—their respective appeal comes from their pugilist directness and the way their personalities stayed burrowed deep in the cement of LeFrak City, no matter how high their stars ascended. In this sense, “Mr. Magik” gets the closest to vintage Mobb Deep, particularly when the two trade the mic every few bars to go in on their enemies while dodging CIA agents and laying up with mistresses. The same could be said for the shuffling “Easy Bruh,” anchored by a drumbreak, faint keys, sirens, and the tightest Prodigy raps on the whole album (“Niggas mad? Put a cape on 'em/Now they super mad” got a good laugh out of me). At its best, Infinite feels effortless in a way Mobb Deep hasn't for years, the pair comfortable in their older, wearier skin.

Things veer off course when the arrangements get too ambitious or trend-chasey. Some of the guests throughout are no-brainers, like unofficial third member Big Noyd bruising through “The M. The O. The B. The B.” in all his mid-range nasal glory, or longtime foils Ghostface and Raekwon showing up to color in the margins over some fire beat switches on “Clear Black Nights.” But the Clipse's addition to “Look at Me” feels like a fashionable feature more than a genuine connection, and Nas, another longtime collaborator, stops in to give his friends the same assembly-line Mass Appeal mandated verses he's been using on his recent albums. “Down For You,” a love song that turns Samuel Barber's classical arrangement ""Adagio for Strings” into a head-knocking groove, is a solid addition to the Mobb Deep love canon. But it's less effective when it shows up again near the album's end, with new verses and the Jorja Smith hook swapped out for one by H.E.R. I kinda get it, the beat's hard—but hard enough to entertain Nas talking about keeping a goomar like Tony Soprano with a straight face? It's one of only a handful of moments that feel shoehorned in just to fill up space, but their rarity makes them more egregious.

Many a recent posthumous rap release, especially in the last decade, has been marred by uncomfortable conversations about agency and exploitation. Thankfully, Infinite doesn't contain any of the unresolved interpersonal beef tainting much of Gang Starr's One of The Best Yet, and it isn't the poorly stitched-together rap Frankenstein that was DMX's Exodus. It doesn't scan as Havoc and company robbing the grave for a quick cash grab, and it genuinely warms the heart to hear him and Prodigy go back and forth again, even if it's hard not to wince a bit hearing Prodigy constantly mulling over his mortality: predicting his death while “staring up at the cosmos” on “Pour The Henny” and ducking enemies, both real and imagined, even while he's running up slot machines in Atlantic City. Still, most of these unearthed and reconstructed songs feel like retreads of the duo's greatest hits. There are no moments in the same area code of The Infamous or Hell on Earth. But Infinite is a decent stab at giving one of the greatest rap duos of all time one last trip around the block.

The indie rock outtakes EP is an underappreciated and endangered art form. For a prolific auteur bent on creating a cultlike fanbase, it's essential to the sort of world-building that breeds obsession. What would the Guided by Voices discography be without its slight montages of moth-eaten ephemera; Belle and Sebastian without their early hot streak of loosies? While the streaming era has made it easy to tack bonus tracks onto a “deluxe” release or pad a record with a skippable song that might not fit into its intended vision, Joseph Stevens' lounge-pop project Peel Dream Magazine recognizes the importance of the curated yet fleeting drop. The band has followed each of its four albums with a corresponding collection of leftovers, providing glimpses of Stevens' lush, Stereolab-indebted songwriting in its weirdest, rawest form. Taurus comes on the heels of 2024's Rose Main Reading Room, Peel Dream's most explicit embrace of minimalist composition, showing the breadth of styles Stevens can extract from his arsenal of choral arrangements and goopy Moog patches.

Peel Dream records often present like a thrifted fit check. Stevens isn't shy about making his influences clear, and his best compositions pair sonic references that thread between eras and genres, tracing decades of re-appropriation. On Pad, a track like “Hiding Out” could deploy a banjo riff that reveals connective tissue between the Beach Boys' “Cabinessence” and Sufjan's Illinois while shrinking each touchstone's thematic scope to a quiet, navel-gazing walk. Beneath the layers of pastiche in Peel Dream's work is an intense, searching introspection. When he name-drops locations along the way, it's a street view, not a drone shot.

The outtakes on Taurus don't collage as well as the material that made it on Rose Main Reading Room, each one gesturing more clearly to a single source. Opener “Venus in Nadir” is a cute, whispery nod to Yo La Tengo; “Taurus” displays some of Stevens' most explicit Sufjan worship yet; and as usual, there's plenty of Stereolab's motorik hypnosis on “Seek and Destroy.” But the simpler makeup of this songwriting also works to its advantage. Taurus' stabs at straightforward pop are some of Peel Dream's catchiest songs yet. “Venus in Nadir” follows a tight verse-jam-verse structure that emphasizes the intricacy of Stevens' arranging. With each listen, I anticipate the stretches when his voice drops out to make room for the cute tilt-a-whirl synth melody, which is backed by more harmonic elements every time it appears. In a less skilled composer's hands, the song would be cloyingly twee, but Stevens has the skill to go all in on a charm offensive while remaining tasteful.

The unfinished demo “Take It” is further proof that Stevens' songcraft shines in its most understated forms. Scattering over gentle electric keys and fingerpicked guitar, it's an impressionist take on Bacharach that stands alone as a semi-instrumental opus, warm and inviting. This ambient quality can make Taurus feel like an aural lava lamp or a curvy piece of mid-century modern accent furniture. But at its best, it's more evidence that Peel Dream Magazine can make their scraps as enticing as the main course.

About a minute into Beware Beware Beware (More Lullabies), Quelle Chris' new instrumental release, a distorted, inhuman voice emerges, repeating “Body after body after body” in a glassy-eyed timbre. Quelle deploys it again in the title track, this time taking a full minute to shift it from a muffled, druggy drone to an anxious squeak. At first, the voice sounds like a euphoria-numbed reveler bragging about their nonstop party lifestyle, the bodies like the writhing mass at the end of Society; as the pitch rises, the phrase reads more like a shock response to the fields of destruction that fill every screen. It's unnerving. The beat roiling beneath is a trance-inducing Dr. John ritual, a circular rhythm of toms and handclaps that wrap around an ominous, ascending bassline. We're locked in a doom loop, Quelle seems to say, living dopamine hit to dopamine hit.

Beware Beware Beware is a sequel to 2016's similarly dark beat tape, Lullabies for the Broken Brain. Both are showcases for Quelle's idiosyncratic production style, in which loping drum patterns and jagged samples combine into unintuitive grooves. Lullabies was an interior record, ruminating on internal spirals of loneliness; Beware is more outwardly focused. It's a reaction to the shredding of the social contract that's accelerated in recent years, a baggy-eyed document of what it's like to live through collapse. Song titles like “What They Truly Fear Is What We Fear to Be” and “Be Afraid of Everything Trust No One” get the point across, and despite the warm tape saturation that blankets all 12 songs, Beware feels more like a crisis than a comfort.

The white-knuckle energy makes for a captivating listen. Taking cues from 2022's DEATHFAME, his last solo rap record, Quelle burrows deeper into that album's caked-on grit. Everything is hazy and backlit, as if experienced during a dissociative state. If you let your eyes glaze over, you'll be swept away by the uncoiling Ethio-jazz of “Camouflage Cameras” and the smoky, broken beat cantor of “AI Hearts fka Walk Close to Me aka I Need Somebody.” The grooves lead all over the stylistic map: The processed vocals echoing through “Good Earth” carry shades of vaporwave; the disjointed chops and distant drums of “Again My Friend” recall the warped psychedelia of Dilla's Donuts; “Money vs Passion” could pass for a brief interlude on one of Lonnie Liston Smith's cosmic excursions.

In his savvy sound design, Quelle mirrors a fractured world. The drums on “We Raise Hell Behind Those We Love” sound like remote detonations, and the ticking hi-hats are placed near the fore of the mix—a time bomb that's constantly moving closer. “Everyone's a Winner in America” paints a hair-raising audio portrait of the United States: a barrage of sirens, atonal screeches, blasts of noise that mimic car crashes or gunshots, and a smarmy, acid-dipped voice repeating the hard R. But despite its bleak atmosphere, Beware is a hopeful (even if only slightly) protest record at heart. It instructs you not to look away, because being able to recognize the devastation allows you to imagine what comes after. Even its anti-streaming distribution method—released as a limited cassette and digital download on Cavalier's website—asks you to think outside the current paradigm, to understand that nothing we're living through is inevitable. Quelle is as beaten down as the rest of us, but refuses to become numb to it all. In the final seconds of the title track, a computer-generated monotone, sputtering and dying, offers a Terminator 2 thumbs up: “Thank You. Stay strong. Never give up.”

Pearson of the 'Tennessee Three' Has Had It With 'Mediocrity' -- So He's Running for Congress","https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/justin-j-pearson-tennessee-three-congress-1235442633/","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 13:45:00 GMT","


							By 

	Nikki McCann Ramirez



	In April 2023, moments after being reinstated to his office in the Tennessee legislature after Republicans booted him in retaliation for his gun control activism, Justin J. Pearson told reporters that despite their best efforts: “You can't expel hope. You can't expel our fight.” 


	Two years later, Pearson is looking to leave the Tennessee House on his own terms, announcing Wednesday that he's challenging longtime Democratic incumbent Steve Cohen for his seat in the U.S. House, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District. 


	“This is my home and I have always wanted to serve this community,” Pearson tells Rolling Stone. “Now is our moment in time to fight for the change that we want to see, and fight for the future that we know we deserve.” 


	“[Cohen] has been at it for 20 years, and still one in three children in this district are living below the poverty line,” he adds. “One in five people are living underneath the poverty line. I want to have the opportunity to fight for our families, for our community, for our values in Congress. It's important to have voices that not only send press releases and letters, but organize a resistance against the authoritarianism that we're seeing, and also elevate the voices of [their] people and communities.”  

	











	Pearson, only 30 years old, has spent half of his life in politics. At the age of 15 he appeared before the Memphis-Shelby County Schools Board to lobby for textbooks at his public high school. His university career was defined by a focus on education reform and public policy. After running a Memphis-area environmental advocacy group that successfully thwarted the construction of the Byhalia Pipeline — a planned crude oil pipeline that would have ripped through and displaced low-income black communities in the Memphis area — Pearson became one of the youngest lawmakers ever sworn into the Tennessee legislature at age 28. 

	











	In April 2023, he and fellow Democratic Reps. Justin Jones and Gloria Johnson were thrust into the national spotlight when Republicans attempted to expel the so-called “Tennessee Three” from the legislature. The push to remove Pearson, Jones, and Johnson from their seats was retaliation for the trio's leadership of anti-gun violence protests at the state Capitol in the wake of a deadly mass shooting at the Covenant School in Nashville. Republicans claimed that the three lawmakers had violated Chamber rules — a transgression which typically provokes little more than a formal reprimand. Johnson managed to barely survive the vote to expel her from the chamber. Pearson and Jones did not, but were reinstated to their seats shortly after via votes by their respective city councils.

	Pearson says his experience in the legislature taught him a lot about “where power resides” and how it is “misused and abused” at the state level “to stymie and stifle any progress on economic justice and opportunity, criminal legal reforms, environmental and climate justice.” 


	In Pearson's view, making a bid for an office in D.C. isn't about having outgrown his local seat, but about strengthening the connection the underrepresented in his community have to the nation's halls of power. 


	“I am still a resident of District Nine as much as I am the representative of it,” he says. “I'm going to be a community congressman who stays engaged in local politics, local decisions, and local efforts that are quite literally changing and impacting the trajectory of people's lives and their health. I show up to city council, county commission, school board, [Memphis Light, Gas and Water] board meetings because I am a representative, but also a constituent, and I have a responsibility to serve this constituency in every way possible, not just from inside a building.”

	“A lot of people in Congress are pretending as though they're not constituents of places that they're supposedly representing, and that is harmful to the body politic,” he adds, pointing to Cohen, who is 76, as a longtime offender. “Cohen sent out a letter saying he held two town halls this year. I've held a dozen. What makes you think we should be celebrating mediocrity? We should be expecting more from the people who are leading us and leading this country. We have to expect more.”


	Pearson will be entering the race as one of a slate of young, progressive candidates looking to primary long-term Democratic incumbents unaccustomed to having to work for reelection, and at a moment where voters are begging the party to break with its tired and ineffectual strategies. Polling this summer showed that Democrats in the U.S. House have a record-low approval rating as they struggle to counter the Trump administration.

	











	“Democrats are the opposition party, and that's a title we need to hold with a level of seriousness, because the opposition party has a responsibility of holding the people in power even more accountable for their actions or inaction,” Pearson says. “There's not been any check and balance against this executive authoritarian regime of Donald Trump. Congress as a whole has failed to do his constitutional responsibility.” 


	“Things are not normal. They're not returning to normal” he adds. “There is no playbook that we are using from the past that could work in the present, and so we've got to stand up. We have to fight back, and we have to speak up for our communities. And that's what representation does, it organizes power in the places where congressional folks are from.” 


	The authoritarian tactics of Trump's administration have made their way to Pearson's own community. The president has been targeting prominent Democratic cities — and cities with large populations of Black and Latino residents — as staging grounds for his shock-and-awe, militarized crackdowns. The president has targeted Memphis as the next city to unleash federal forces into, following incursions in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.  Crime in Memphis recently hit a 25-year low, according to local authorities.


	“We don't want them here,” Pearson says. “We need federal investment into Memphis and into District Nine. We don't need military occupation. If they really want to do something, they would work on poverty eradication.” 


	“That they are continuing to use [crime] as a reason for overreach into local government and taking over law enforcement in our communities, but there is no conversation about crime without a conversation about poverty,” he adds. 


	Pearson will enter the race with the backing of several prominent progressive groups, who are filling out their rosters of candidates with little over a year until the 2026 midterms. Usamah Andrabi, communications director at Justice Democrats — which has already endorsed Pearson — tells Rolling Stone that he “embodies the sort of leadership that we are looking to transform the Democratic Party with, and that Democratic voters are demanding to see more of in the halls of power.” 


	There is “often a gap between our current Democratic representatives and the people who vote for them. There is no connection. There is no rooted community for so many of these leaders, and they don't bring the demands, voices and needs of the people to the halls of power. I think Justin has shown exactly how you can do that at all times.” Andrabi adds, noting that there are so many “base Democratic voters who are ready to see a new generation of leadership come into the Democratic Party.” 

	











	Other groups, including Leaders We Deserve, the progressive organization founded by Parkland survivor and gun control activist David Hogg, have also endorsed Pearson and pledged $1 million in spending on behalf of his campaign. “Justin J. Pearson has repeatedly shown the kind of backbone needed to confront powerful special interests, from big oil to the gun lobby,” Leaders We Deserve President and Co-Founder David Hogg said in a statement provided to Rolling Stone. “Memphis deserves a next-generation leader like Justin — a tested fighter who will deliver opportunity, affordability, safety, and justice to his constituents.”

	Pearson is, like any candidate with any modicum of self awareness, a little nervous — but he's confident in his vision.


	“We're going to do what we've always done,” he says. “We're going to have a people centered campaign. We're going to hire folks locally to help us knock on doors and reach voters. We're going to invest a significant amount of any of the money that we raise into people right here in district nine to help us to win this race. I believe in the people first.

Sabrina Carpenter's four-song set at her Grand Ole Opry debut included the words or phrases “motherfucker,” “well, fuck,” and “fuck my life,” but fans at the 100-year-old country-music radio show didn't have to clutch their pearls. As Carpenter admitted, they were getting the Opry edits.


	“You're so wholesome here in Nashville,” she said during her sold-out set. “That's why I'm doing all the clean versions.”


	But those mostly PG versions of the pop star's hits like “Please Please Please,” “Go-Go Juice,” and “Manchild” still cut like a knife. Carpenter, eye-catching in a glittery fringe dress, couldn't help but exude a certain edginess onstage at the Opry House, even if the 26-year-old left out some of her favorite swear words. At times, she walked right up to the line, teasing those F bombs with a coy glance before changing the line to something family-friendly, like “the others” in “Please Please Please.”


	For her performance of “Slim Pickins,” however, off last year's Short n' Sweet, she went all in, delivering the line “all the douchebags in my phone” with gusto. Carpenter now surely holds the distinction of being the only artist to ever sing the word “douchebag” in the Opry circle.

	Introduced by Sheryl Crow, Carpenter was clearly thrilled to be on country music's most famous stage. She talked at length about listening to Patsy Cline and Dolly Parton growing up in Pennsylvania, where she often encountered cows in the middle of the road, and nodded to the country influences on her latest album, Man's Best Friend. It was a record, she said, put together with “a pedal steel, a banjo, and a dream.”

	











	Carpenter's appearance at the Opry is part of the institution's Opry 100 campaign, a centennial celebration that has booked artists like Ringo Starr, James Taylor, and Shinedown alongside Opry regulars like Vince Gill, Pam Tillis, and Riders in the Sky. Carpenter's show also included performances by Marcus King with Jamey Johnson, Ernest, and Kaitlin Butts.

	The singing voices behind Huntr/x, the fictional K-pop girl group in the wildly popular, animated Netflix film KPop Demon Hunters, took The Tonight Show stage on Tuesday night for Ejae, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami's first live performance together.


	The trio sang their hit single, “Golden,” and also joined host Jimmy Fallon on the couch for an interview. The vibrant performance kicked off with an animated intro before the trio took the stage to showcase the soaring track. 


	In the animated musical fantasy film, Ejae, Nuna, and Rei Ami sing for the roles of Rumi, Mira, and Zoey, respectively. (Arden Cho, May Hong, and Ji-young Yoo voice the character's spoken lines.) The movie follows the K-pop sensation as they moonlight as the mystical destroyers of an invisible demon realm and are soon faced with their biggest battle yet when rival band Saja Boys turn out to be demons intent on stealing Huntr/x fans.


	During their interview with Fallon, the singers reflected on the phenomenon of the film and their recent appearance on Saturday Night Live, calling the opportunity “so insane.” They also shared how amazing it's been to get emotional responses from both viewers and themselves. 

	











	“This movie has affected all us so much on an emotional level,” Nuna told Fallon. “I'm emotionally constipated, so I take a very, very long time to process my emotions. But I guess I was due for a cry the day of the premiere because literally five minutes into the film I'm, like, bawling my eyes out. And it's weird because the thing that got me was seeing kimbap, which is a Korean food, it's like a Korean rice roll, animated onscreen.”

	











	Following its premiere, KPop Demon Hunters skyrocketed to take the title of the Netflix's most-watched animated film ever. Meanwhile, its soundtrack reached Number One on the Billboard 200, while “Golden” has enjoyed eight weeks at Number One on the Billboard Hot 100. The album features a high-energy score composed by Marcelo Zarvos and K-pop tracks produced by the likes of Teddy Park, Lindgren, Stephen Kirk, and Ian Eisendrath.

	Ejae and Mark Sonnenblick, two of the songwriters among the impressive roster of collaborators, spoke to Rolling Stone in August about why the soundtrack has resonated with fans. “I don't know if Mark knows this, but when I wrote ‘Golden,' I was going through a hard time. I actually cried singing the demo, because it resonated with me so much,” said Ejae, the singing voice of Rumi, who opened up about her own experience in the K-pop world. “Maybe that's why ‘Golden' is ‘going up up up.' Because everyone's going through a hard time. And they want to feel hope.”


	This past summer, Netflix confirmed plans to submit “Golden” for consideration in the Best Original Song category at the 98th Academy Awards.

	Going into Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl, part of the thrill was that it seemed like we were going to get Reputation-style anthems. She'd reunited with Max Martin for the first time since that excellent 2017 LP — and the showgirl themes opened up plenty of possibilities. Thematically, a revenge-fueled song or two would make sense on a project centered on performance and public scrutiny — a “showgirl” is, after all, always on display. But did Swift need to punch down to fulfill the concept?


	One of the album's most talked-about songs is “Actually Romantic,” a clapback many people believe is about Charli XCX. Swift opens the track with an incisive line: “I heard you call me ‘Boring Barbie' when the coke's got you brave.” Many immediately assumed it was aimed at Charli — a swing at Brat's drug references, played for shock value to underscore how Charli (or really, the “cool girls” she represents) might see Swift. The “coke” line goes after an image Charli owns up to and, frankly, celebrates. It sets up the tension between them (the polished pop star and the chaotic party girl), but it lands more “holier-than-thou” than it does clever.

	











	Swift has said the song is about someone who had a “one-sided, adversarial relationship with” her. But how adversarial did things seem with Charli? Let's go back to Brat.

	On “Sympathy Is a Knife,” Charli's mind spirals as she thinks about a peer who is so untouchable that she feels like she will never compare. “I'm embarrassed to have it, but need the sympathy/ ‘Cause I couldn't even be her if I tried,” she sings. In many ways, the song plays less like a diss and more as Charli confronting her own insecurity and the fear she'll never reach that top echelon of pop stardom because they're “so opposite” from the Swift-like figure in the song. What makes it land is that it's a vulnerable self-portrait drawn from comparing herself to a woman who, for years, has embodied pop perfection.

	“Sympathy” doesn't exactly antagonize Swift, though. Charli does admit she doesn't “wanna see her backstage at my boyfriend's show” and sings about how she hopes Swift and Matty Healy break up (they eventually did) — but she follows it with a lyric that encapsulates the entire point of the song: “I couldn't even be her if I tried.”


	Charli put it succinctly in an interview with Vulture: “That song is about me and my feelings and my anxiety and the way my brain creates narratives and stories in my head when I feel insecure… Sometimes I'd look onstage and be like,' Oh my God … I'm never going to play these rooms, ever.' That made me feel jealous,” she explained. In that same interview, Swift was quoted praising Charli too: “Her writing is surreal and inventive, always. She just takes a song to places you wouldn't expect it to go, and she's been doing it consistently for over a decade,” Swift said.


	In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Charli also shared that part of the song was rooted in her self-perception early in her career, when she “desperately wanted to be blonde” like Britney Spears but couldn't escape Spears being, as she put it, “the opposite of who I was.” That explanation further drove in “Sympathy Is a Knife” as a song that touches on how her racialized identity as an Indian-British woman in the industry affected her self-image. Rather than a jab at Swift, Charli is attempting to face her own insecurities.  


	With any celebrity friendship or feud, there's always more than meets the eye. As listeners, no one has the full context of Swift and Charli's dynamic. What we do know: Charli opened for Taylor on the Reputation tour in 2018, they both dated members of the 1975 at around the same time, and their paths have likely crossed more often than people realize. So if Swift really does live “rent-free” in Charli's head, as she suggests in “Actually Romantic,” that's something we may never fully get to understand. But as listeners, hearing “Actually Romantic” as such a pointed response to “Sympathy” just felt unnecessary.

	There's, admittedly, some fun in pop-star rivalries. But “Actually Romantic” lacks a sense of fun and mystery. Swift casts herself as misunderstood, which is hard to believe, given just how celebrated she's been in recent years as she's become a cultural icon.  The song, instead, reads as a reflection of Swift's desire to be universally liked. It takes a sing-songy, almost teasing tone, as if she's trying to brush off Charli with a smirk: “You think I'm tacky, baby/Stop talking dirty to me,” she sings, aiming for playful but landing more defensive. Swift wants to sound unbothered, even though every lyric suggests the opposite. “Like a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse, that's how much it hurts,” in particular, feels like a cheap, belittling shot. And then there's the line, “I mind my business, God's my witness that I don't provoke it / It's kind of making me wet,” which hints that, deep down, Swift might enjoy Charli's perception that she's unreachable, reinforcing the very dynamic Charli laid out on “Sympathy.”

	After all, Swift is the same artist who once sang, “I'm a mirrorball / I can change everything about me to fit in,” admitting her instinct to adapt to criticism just to be loved. The stronger move would've been to frame the track around the pressures of being the woman on top, and the weight of other women measuring themselves against her. There's also the compelling approach of Charli's “work it out on the remix” when she brought Lorde on “Girl, So Confusing.” The pair of musicians chose to be honest about their feelings about each other, transforming comparison into camaraderie, rather than misguided conflict. “Girl, So Confusing” became one of the most refreshing, celebrated music moments of the year, and Swift could've taken a page from that playbook instead of crashing out for the sake of a sassy song.


	As Charli told The Guardian while promoting Brat, it's an “unrealistic expectation of women” for everyone to get along. “Relationships between women are super-complex and multi-layered. You can like someone and dislike them at the same time,” she said. It's not bad advice.

	The right-wing information sphere on social media is shaped by large, often anonymous influencer accounts that are then amplified to even wider audiences by prominent conservatives. Two such accounts are Defiant L's and Resist the Mainstream, both offering takes on American politics, often alleging corruption and election fraud by Democrats, to a combined over 2 million followers. Republican lawmakers like Mike Lee, Nancy Mace, Andy Biggs, Eli Crane, and Dan Crenshaw, along with major political figures like Elon Musk, share the accounts' posts on X, some claiming that “illegals” or undocumented immigrants are fraudulently voting in American elections. 


	The owner and operator of both accounts, however, is not only a man who has by his own admission never stepped foot in the United States but has donated over $3,000 in an American election. Donating to American political campaigns as a foreign national is a federal crime, according to the Federal Election Commission. 

	











Rumen Naumovski donated to Ron Watkins' congressional campaign in Arizona in 2022 while living in Macedonia as a Macedonian national, according to FEC documents listing his name and a Florida media company that he owns, along with a review of his own statements detailing his attempts to immigrate to America. He runs Defiant L's and Resist the Mainstream via that same Florida company, according to court documents and his statements, and someone with knowledge of his company.


	Watkins later returned the donations, and Naumovski has said he was unaware he was prohibited from donating.

	











	Defiant L's and Resist the Mainstream are two major players in the right-wing influencer space on X and cover American politics almost exclusively. Defiant L's in particular enjoys a major reach on the platform thanks to elected officials and Musk, who called Defiant L's “one of the best accounts on X” last year.


	South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace has shared multiple posts from the account, and even replied to Defiant L's last month, on a post about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar that asked, “What's the first thought that comes to mind when you see Ilhan Omar?” “Censure,” Mace replied. Utah Sen. Mike Lee often shares Defiant L's posts, and in March tagged FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino in one reshare. Lee also interacts with Resist the Mainstream, at least five times this year based on a review by Rolling Stone.

	Naumovski has been managing Defiant L's via a Florida company since 2023, according to a source with knowledge of the account. Naumovski wrote this year that “Defiant L's” is “one of our accounts” in an opinion piece for The Daily Wire. He uses that same Florida company to run Resist the Mainstream's website and accounts, according to court documents. The two accounts are listed as “affiliates” of each other on X, a paid feature that allows a business to link more than one account with verified affiliate badges.


	A year before obtaining Defiant L's, Naumovski donated $3,127 in two donations to so-called “QAnon candidate” Ron Watkins' congressional primary race in Arizona. Naumovski was reported at the time as being Watkins' largest single donor that quarter — but that was years before it became known that Naumovski wasn't just of Macedonian origin, but has never had residential status in the U.S., or even been to the U.S., according to his Daily Wire op-ed. 


	“I run a growing media company with 11 American employees. I've invested over $145,000 in the U.S. economy. I pay American corporate taxes. Yet I've never set foot in the United States — and government bureaucrats seem determined to keep it that way,” Naumovski wrote in February.

	He explained that he attempted to get a tourist visa in 2018 but was rejected, and then his reapplication was approved in 2021. But Naumovski said he refused to show proof of Covid vaccination as required in 2021: “As a healthy young person, I hesitated. Friends here offered an easy solution — fake vaccination cards cost less than $50 in Macedonia. But I refused to begin my American journey with a lie. How long could waiting honestly really take?” He then tried for an E-2 business visa, but was rejected after repeated interviews by embassy staff, he claims in the piece, and to this day has never even been to the U.S.

	











	In a podcast interview in October 2022, a few months after he donated to Watkins, he explained he was currently running his media company that he started in his bedroom in his parents' home from “my own apartment in Macedonia.”


	“Foreign nationals are categorically barred from spending money in our elections, whether it's directly, via PACs or even SuperPACs,” Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform at the Campaign Legal Center and former counsel at the FEC, tells Rolling Stone. Ghosh says that foreign donation schemes often happen via straw donors, or fake names, which are also prohibited, and that a foreign national donating under their own name is rare.


Filings from a 2024 copyright lawsuit brought by a photojournalist who alleged Resist the Mainstream repeatedly stole his work show that Naumovski claims 100 percent ownership of the Florida company that operates the two X accounts, Raww Digital LLC. The two Watkins donations both list the St. Petersburg, Florida, registered agent's office where Raww Digital Inc. is located and Raww Digital LLC as Naumovski's employer. The company was first registered in 2021, with Naumovski as sole owner with an address in Veles, North Macedonia. A month later, an amendment with a new principal address was filed, at the registered agent's office in St. Petersburg.


	Watkins is often speculated to be a source for the writings of “Q” — the mysterious figure fueling QAnon conspiracies for years. Watkins has long denied being “Q.” Watkins lost the Arizona Republican primary to Eli Crane, who has himself since amplified Naumovski's content at least seven times. After Naumovski donated to Watkins, Watkins boosted Resist the Mainstream's Telegram channel a week later, according to a screenshot obtained by Media Matters.


	There is no indication of wrongdoing by Watkins or that he was aware of Naumovski's location at the time. Watkins refunded Naumovski's two donations in April 2022, as campaign finance law requires if a candidate unknowingly receives a donation from a foreign national. The FEC sent Watkins a letter in March 2022, a month after Naumovski's donations, asking for more information about donors, after the campaign submitted a report with incomplete donor information.


	Naumovski told Rolling Stone he was unaware that it was illegal to donate to an American campaign without a green card. He posted a statement in April 2022 on his Telegram channel about the incident: “Yesterday I learned I made a mistake. I gave an online contribution to a U.S. political campaign, not realizing that was forbidden to me as someone who had a U.S. visa, but not a green card. Within minutes of learning that I contacted the campaign, which is immediately refunding my payment. I love America and would never intentionally violate any measure. Live and learn!”

	











	Watkins told Rolling Stone in an email that he does not recall Naumovski's donations. “My 2022 Arizona campaign was very busy and ended more than three years ago. According to the FEC guidelines, federal campaign records have a three year retention period. It has been more than three years since the campaign ended, the three year retention period for campaign records has passed, and I do not personally remember details about specific donations. As far as I know there was no FEC investigation into this specific issue that you are alleging.”


	The Media Matters 2023 review found that Watkins was only one of several QAnon-linked influencers to share Resist the Mainstream's content, and the content appeared nearly identical. Some X users have alleged that they were approached by Naumovski to post his content for payment.


	Naumovski did not respond to follow-up questions from Rolling Stone about whether he offered Watkins or other influencers payments to promote his company's content, nor did he respond to questions about how he learned his donations were illegal. 


	A major booster of Naumovski's career is former Fox News executive Ken LaCorte. LaCorte admitted to The New York Times in 2019 that he hired Macedonian teenagers from Veles, Naumovski's Macedonian hometown, to write for several conservative content sites he ran beginning in 2017. Veles is known as the “home to a collection of writers who churned out disinformation during the 2016 presidential election in the United States,” the Times reported.


	LaCorte has also written about Naumovski's struggles to emigrate. ”I met Rumen when I was running a startup, and I needed help with social media. When we first spoke on Zoom, I was surprised to learn he was still a teenager, living in Macedonia, a country I couldn't find without a good map, working out of a bedroom covered in L.A. Lakers posters. Since then, I've been both a friend and an adviser, helping him build his business and encouraging him through the U.S. immigration system,” he wrote on his Substack in February, a few days after Naumovski himself admitted he's never been to the U.S.


	“If he had simply walked across the border illegally, he would have received a work permit within months. He could have easily gamed the system — faked paperwork, overstayed a tourist visa, or ‘lost' his passport. But because he played by the rules, he's been stuck in limbo for years,” LaCorte wrote.

	











	Naumovski has enjoyed connections with other Republican activists, such as Roger Stone, who endorsed him in 2023 on X: “I highly recommend that you follow @RumenNaumovski, the founder of Resist the Mainstream on Twitter. He's a great guy! He was born outside the US but he loves America and he's working hard to bring trusted news to everyday people.”


	Before this year's revelations, Naumovski himself repeated a similarly vague biography: “I was born overseas but have devoted my life to spreading the virtues of American freedom,” he wrote on X.

	The issue of foreign interests influencing American politics through anonymous X influencer accounts is an ongoing one. Last year, federal prosecutors alleged that the conservative media company Tenet, which pays a network of major right-wing influencers like Benny Johnson and Tim Pool, was secretly being paid by Russian state operatives to disseminate propaganda to a large American audience. Johnson, Pool, and other Tenet content creators maintain they were unaware of the alleged Russian influence campaign and were victims of deceptions.


	Interfering in American elections financially, however, is still one of the campaign finance violations that's taken seriously and prosecuted, Ghosh says. “This is one of our bedrock campaign finance laws, to keep American elections working toward the goals of American public welfare, and not the opposite.”

UNITED STATES & CANADA – A new study has revealed the most active UFO sighting hot spots across North America, identifying where unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) reports are most frequent — and it seems Washington and Alberta are leading the pack, according to data from the National UFO Reporting Center.

The analysis, released by Casino.ca during World Space Week, combined official reporting data with digital media coverage to determine which U.S. states and Canadian provinces have recorded the most UFO sightings per capita since 1974.

The results showed a clear pattern — states with active volcanoes also tend to have more UFO activity.

Meanwhile, the least likely states to spot a UFO were clustered in the South:

In Canada, the province of Alberta emerged as the country's top UFO capital, with one sighting per 568 people.

It was followed by:

However, when it comes to total sightings, Ontario took the lead with 22,860 recorded encounters, far surpassing other provinces. British Columbia, despite ranking third per capita, has logged 7,927 sightings — which researchers noted may be linked to the province's volcanic geography.

By contrast, Newfoundland and Labrador was the least likely province to experience UFO activity, with just one sighting per 7,451 residents.

Researchers and UFO enthusiasts have long noticed that UFO reports cluster near active volcanoes and deep-water regions, leading some to speculate that these areas may act as hiding places or “bases” for unexplained aerial craft.

While the study doesn't claim to prove extraterrestrial activity, it highlights an undeniable trend: the Pacific Northwest remains the epicenter of UFO sightings across North America.

FLORIDA – A molecular biologist is stirring up global curiosity after claiming to have discovered what could be “alien genes” embedded in human DNA, suggesting that extraterrestrial influences may have shaped parts of humanity's genetic makeup.

Dr. Max Rempel, founder and chief executive of the DNA Resonance Research Foundation, analyzed genetic data from 581 complete families in the 1,000 Genomes Project and found 11 families with “large sequences” of DNA that didn't match either parent.

According to Dr. Rempel, the unusual findings could not be explained by known human gene-editing technologies like CRISPR.

“Humanity may be undergoing genetic transformation,” he told the Daily Mail. “If confirmed, it could be possible to detect which humans carry alien DNA — essentially identifying hybrids.”

In total, his study identified 348 non-parental variants that he says can't be explained by normal heredity or modern genetic manipulation. The research, however, has not been peer-reviewed and remains highly speculative.

Dr. Rempel also analyzed 23andMe data from people who claimed they had been abducted by aliens, and found similar unexplained DNA markers in some of those samples.

However, he cautioned that public DNA databases often contain older data from cultured cells, which can show genomic changes unrelated to extraterrestrial causes.

“We cannot treat these results as proof,” he emphasized, noting that more advanced sequencing such as NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing) or WGS (Whole-Genome Sequencing) would be required for verification.

Dr. Rempel theorized that, if confirmed, alien DNA could eventually explain unusual human abilities, including telepathy or heightened perception. He believes these sequences might represent genetic modifications introduced in ancient or recent history.

Author Nigel Watson, who has written extensively on UFO encounters, told the Daily Mail that verifying such claims would be “as world-shattering as recovering a flying saucer.”

“Should human genetics prove to be influenced by extraterrestrials,” Dr. Rempel added, “we'll need to consider how much alien hybridization is healthy for the planet — and which alien races we might give priority.”

For now, Dr. Rempel says his team needs larger, verified DNA datasets and ethical approval to continue analyzing families who claim extraterrestrial contact.

“Getting that DNA data takes time,” he said, noting that he won't have “conclusive evidence” until the next phase of sequencing is complete.

The idea that humanity is not special on a cosmic scale has dominated science for centuries. However, a new study challenges this principle and offers an unexpected answer to the question of why we have not yet found brothers in mind. 

Since the time of Nicolaus Copernicus, who removed the Earth from the center of the Universe, science has consistently “downgraded” our role. It turns out that the Sun is just one of billions of stars in the galaxy, and our galaxy is one of billions of similar ones. This trend gave rise to the Copernican Revolution: Earth and humanity do not occupy a privileged place, and life is supposed to be a common phenomenon in space. This logic has focused astrobiologists' attention on red dwarfs — the most common stars around which rocky planets located in “habitable zones” are most often found.

Columbia University professor David Kipping decided to test whether we really are typical. He drew attention to two key facts:

Kipping conducted a Bayesian analysis to assess the probability of our existence. The result is impressive: the odds of us being a typical phenomenon are 1 in 1,600. This is compelling evidence in favor of the uniqueness of humanity.

The analysis points to a possible solution: stars with a mass less than 0.34 solar masses (which is two-thirds of all stars in the Universe, including red dwarfs) are 95% unlikely to give rise to intelligent life.

This is bad news for missions aimed at finding life around red dwarfs such as Proxima b. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of life on such planets, priorities have to change.

Future research, such as the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), should focus on finding Earth-like planets around stars similar to our Sun. As Kipping concludes, although red dwarfs remain interesting objects, G-type stars should be the primary target in our hope of finding extraterrestrial civilizations.

Earlier, we reported on where extraterrestrial life could find a home in the Solar System.

Supernatural ended in 2020 after 15 seasons and just as many years, but love for and interest in the show endures, even all these years later. In fact, despite the 20-year gap between Supernatural's debut and the present day, Supernatural conventions, hosted by Creation Entertainment, continue to draw major crowds.

At one such convention, ""Creation's The Road So Far... The Road Ahead"" in Philadelphia this past weekend, ScreenRant's Liz Declan sat down with multiple stars of the show, including Castiel actor Misha Collins, Bobby Singer actor Jim Beaver, Chuck/God actor Rob Benedict, and Jody Mills actor Kim Rhodes.

Throughout those conversations, the Supernatural cast members discussed several of the show's biggest and, in some cases, most controversial moments, story arcs they would have liked to see, how they felt about changes made to their characters, and much more.

Several Supernatural actors shared their thoughts on their characters' deaths/departures from the show, including some mixed feelings about what those stories entailed.

Jim Beaver spoke about Bobby's controversial death in season 7, episode 10, ""Death's Door,"" which was crushing to many fans. After sustaining a gunshot wound to the head, Bobby is left fighting for his life in the hospital while experiencing a series of memories from throughout his life.

The episode is beautifully shot, written, and acted, but it was still quite a blow to see this beloved character, who had been a true father to Dean and Sam, go. Beaver shared similar sentiments:

""Dramatically, what happened with Bobby in season 7 was gorgeous stuff to play, and it had a huge impact on the audience, and I loved it. I thought it was terrific writing. I thought it was a really interesting thing to do to the boys, to take away this major resource. As an actor, I didn't like it. I mean, I liked the script, but I didn't like dying, and at first, I didn't even realize how semi-permanent it was going to be. I thought, 'Oh, I'll be dead for an episode, and then I'll be back.' That was not. I didn't like that. I did get a lot of really wonderful other acting opportunities because I was suddenly available, but I would have preferred to stick around. I just really loved playing Bobby.""

Beaver also shared his perspective on the season 12 introduction of the alternate universe Bobby. Although it was delightful to see Beaver portraying Bobby again, it wasn't the Bobby that fans or the brothers knew and loved. Instead, this Bobby had no connection to Sam and Dean at all.

Beaver reflected on how different that experience was:

""When he did come back with some permanence as the alternate universe version, I was happy to be back on set with all my friends and playing fun stuff, but that Bobby wasn't as much fun to play because he had no relationship with the boys, and the relationship between Bobby and the boys was, for me, the core of what I was doing there in the first place.""

However, Beaver also pointed out that the issue was in part a matter of how much time we got with this new version of Bobby, which wasn't actually all that much. Along with a joke about how, for some reason, people believed 15 seasons was enough, he said:

""So, it was a little off-putting to play like I didn't really know them or didn't really care about them, because I wasn't really sure what was left other than just some grouch. Although, I think if the show had stayed on longer, there are more interesting things that could have happened with that guy, and maybe we could have seen a new relationship develop.""

Even as his AU self, Bobby remained a beloved character (and Beaver's portrayal was much more than just a grouch), but Beaver's overall comments reflect a desire to have seen more of the original Bobby, from seasons 1 through 7—something many fans have voiced as well.

Other character departures were impacted by forces beyond the writers', or anyone else's, control. This most obviously includes the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on the Supernatural finale, which saw the death of Dean Winchester before the show's send-off.

While Dean dying wouldn't have changed had COVID not happened, the finale that was planned pre-COVID would have seen the return of numerous characters and therefore a very different ending. Misha Collins explained:

“Plans had been made for the last episode of Supernatural, which was to take place in Dean's version of Heaven, which was a Roadhouse bar, and Sam was going to die, and he was going to come to find Dean's version of Heaven and go into this Roadhouse bar, and we would see all of these sort of fan-favorite cast members, and crew members from Supernatural actually, peppered in as extras filling out this Roadhouse. It was going to be a big venue, so we would see lots of the actors and lots of the characters from the series from over the years hanging out at this bar. Castiel was going to be sitting at the bar, Dean was going to come talk to Castiel, and there was going to be a sort of closure and button on their arc, and the band Kansas was booked to be on stage playing 'Carry On My Wayward Son.' It was going to be kind of an epic scene.""

In addition to how thrilling it would have been to see so many fan-favorite faces and get an on-screen rendition of ""Carry on My Wayward Son,"" this original ending would have meant a very different departure for Castiel. Ultimately, Cas didn't appear in the finale at all.

Instead, Castiel's final appearance is in season 15, episode 18, ""Despair,"" when he is claimed by the Empty. Although we eventually get confirmation that Jack has saved Castiel from this fate, we never get a Dean and Castiel reunion or see Castiel on screen again. Regarding that change and his feelings about Castiel's alternate ending, Collins shared:

""COVID hit, and there were all of these restrictions on how many people were allowed to be in a scene at all, and also, it was a two-week quarantine for any actors that were coming into Canada, so they'd have to stay in a hotel room for two weeks, which would have been prohibitive. If you're going to bring 30 or 40 actors up and put them up for two weeks each, it's prohibitively expensive, so they had to jettison that entire script and come up with a totally new end[ing], which was two brothers outside on a bridge. Very different. COVID safety protocols were in play at that point, so yeah, it was very different, and I would have loved to have seen the original ending.”

Like Castiel, Kim Rhodes' character, Sheriff Jody Mills, also appeared on Supernatural through season 15, although Jody had a less ceremonious exit from the show. In fact, Rhodes expressed that she'd been somewhat frustrated with the nature of Jody's final episode:

""At the end, her last episode, there was a whole explanation where she shouldn't go [on an investigation] because what if she gets hurt, that would make Claire sad. ...The idea that, oh, Claire would be sad, didn't sit right with me. Ultimately, I did it, because that's what they wanted me to do, but I did have a couple discussions with the director and was kind of like, 'Um, could she maybe just not roll over quite so fast?'""

Rhodes specifically highlighted the gendered implications of this narrative decision:

""I feel like 'the feels' is often given as an excuse for a woman not to do something, and I don't like to see that. Like, give me a concrete reason; Jody is a concrete person, and this is something we have all agreed is dangerous, and yet we are going to do it to the best of our capability. So, to all of a sudden be like, 'Oh, yeah, sad is a good reason to not,' I was grumpy about that.""

Rhodes' point is well-taken, particularly because this did feel a bit incongruent with the Jody audiences had become so familiar with. On the more positive side, Jody survived the show, and it feels safe to assume that she continues to fight the good fight, even after her final appearance.

As mentioned, Castiel's final appearance on Supernatural is in the episode ""Despair."" This episode, especially the scene in which Dean and Castiel say goodbye, remains one of the most controversial parts of the entire show. In ""Despair,"" Castiel allows himself to be taken by the Empty, but not before telling Dean he loves him (something Dean does not say in return).

This moment sparked intense debate for numerous reasons, although the most notable is tensions surrounding whether this declaration of love by Castiel was romantic. The fanbase continues to be divided on this, although Misha Collins addressed that question head on.

Collins explained:

""I knew that I felt like it was an important, meaningful moment of representation and acknowledgment of homosexuality and this love between Cas and Dean, and I knew that going into the scene, and I was happy that we did it. After the scene fans were not happy with different aspects of it, and there was blowback about not getting adequate acknowledgment or recognition from Dean to what Cas had said and things like that. There was some frustrating stuff to navigate there in the aftermath, but I actually was, personally, really proud of having done that and glad that we did it. And, on balance, I think it's all quite good.""

Regarding the idea that some fans still believe this was not a romantic declaration of love from Castiel, Collins said, ""I think that is inaccurate."" He added, ""I know, because I was playing Castiel. So, I can provide the definitive answer.""

John Winchester's behavior as a father is one of the most discussed aspects of Supernatural to this day, and because Bobby was essentially Sam and Dean's adoptive father (he even says he adopted two boys at one point), he is often compared with John in a way that heavily favors Bobby.

Specifically, many perceive John Winchester's parenting as neglectful at best, particularly given that he would leave the boys alone when they were young to go out on hunts. By contrast, Supernatural reveals sweeter and sweeter moments between Sam, Dean, and Bobby over the years, including a scene in which Bobby tosses a ball with young Dean.

Because of that, there's plenty of discourse within the fanbase about Bobby being the better father to the boys. When asked what he thought Bobby really felt about John, particularly considering they had been friends, Beaver shared:

""I think he admired him as a hunter, and they were friends, but sometimes your friends just really piss you off, and sometimes they do it consistently enough that you lose respect for them, and I think Bobby was able to see things in the boys, in their needs, in their upbringing, that somebody needed to look out for. And, being as single-minded and as easily distracted by the hunting work as John was, somebody had to step up because otherwise these kids would, you know, if there hadn't been Bobby, what would have happened to these kids?""

Beaver also shared that, in the end, Bobby was proud of his role in Sam and Dean's lives:

""I think Bobby thinks deep down inside, with all his guilt and shame about all kinds of things, I think he thinks he did a good job with them and that they're good strong men in part because of him.""

This is certainly a sentiment that many fans share, and episodes like ""Death's Door"" reinforce just how much Bobby really did love Sam and Dean, even when he tried to maintain a tough exterior.

There were several Supernatural spin-off shows pitched over the years, although none saw nearly the success the original series did. One such show was the spin-off series Wayward Sisters, which would have starred several of Supernatural's most significant female characters, including Jody, Claire, and Donna, and focused on their life hunting together as a found family.

Supernatural even featured a backdoor pilot episode for this spin-off, also titled ""Wayward Sisters,"" which laid the groundwork for the dynamic these characters would have and established what the tone and focus of the show would be. In many ways, it was a new take on the classic Supernatural story. Sadly, however, the show never got off the ground.

Speaking about the CW's decision not to pick up Wayward Sisters and what her feelings are about it now, Kim Rhodes said:

""You know, we podiumed, right? Nobody, I would think, asks someone who won a silver at the Olympics, 'Gosh, didn't you dream of the gold?' Yeah, but we podiumed, and the spin-off was created because of the fans, so the way I look at it now is that the concept and the community was given back to the fans... We get to go where we want to go now, and we are still a tight community.""

However, Rhodes also shared that she disagreed with the decision:

""Do I think it was a smart decision on the CW's part? I don't. I still think that it was a bad idea that they didn't pick us up. Do I think we have maintained a presence and a connection with Wayward longer than the show probably would have stayed on the air? Yes, we have.""

It's true that Rhodes, and other Wayward Sisters castmates like Briana Buckmaster, who played Donna, maintain a strong bond with the fanbase. That's especially clear during the conventions, at which Rhodes and Buckmaster co-host events like ""PJ Party,"" which Rhodes described as being all about community.

Rob Benedict's Supernatural character, Chuck, undergoes a massive evolution, initially introduced as a bit of an awkward author who is accidentally writing the story of Sam and Dean's life, then revealed to be a prophet, and, eventually, confirmed to be God himself.

Far from a benevolent father, though, this version of God saw Benedict in the role of the show's ultimate villain in season 15. Regarding that major plot twist and his feelings about the change to his character, Benedict explained:

""When I first read the last episode of season 14 when I go bad, I was just bummed. I was like, 'Why am I acting weird?' People may not know this, but I get the script like five days before we shoot. I don't know what's going on. No one says, 'Hey, this is the plan, by the way.' And then I read that episode, I was like, 'What is going on?' And then later, they're like, 'Oh, you're the big bad of the final season.' ...So, that was a big adjustment. I remember thinking, 'Fans are going to hate me,' which is true.""

Now, though, Benedict's perspective on this character choice is largely positive:

""Ultimately, I think it's kind of brilliant and I got used to fans saying, 'We hated you in the final season.' Like, yeah, you were supposed to. But the idea that Sam and Dean, their biggest enemy of all, the final chapter in the video game, is to take on God himself. If you can beat that one, then you win, you know? So, I thought that was kind of cool.""

Misha Collins had his own arc as God, which likewise saw Castiel transform into a villain, although he didn't see himself as such. On the contrary, Castiel believed that he was going to save everyone by acquiring more and more power and filling the role of the absent God who had seemingly abandoned humans and angels alike.

As with Rob Benedict's Chuck, this was a massive change to Castiel as a character. Yet, Collins felt enthusiastic from the get-go:

""I was excited about it. I mean, that felt really cool, and it was fun to do. It was one of the arcs that I kind of wish we had gotten to play with for longer, and I think is a great example of the adage, 'Absolute power corrupts absolutely.' I think Cas went into that thinking, 'I'm going to do good with this,' and he did not.""

Castiel is frankly lovable in all his iterations, although Collins is far from alone in specifically loving the Castiel God arc, which is affectionately referred to as 'Godstiel' by much of the fanbase.

Misha Collins and Rob Benedict ended up loving their villain twists, but there were certain character arcs and narrative choices that weren't as popular for Supernatural's stars.

Benedict shared that he would have loved to see more from the season 11 arc with the Darkness, also called Amara, who was not only God's sister but also effectively the inverse of God/God's light. The Darkness as an antagonist, along with this duality, was fascinating, and Benedict expressed that more could have been done with the story:

""At the end of season 11, after this big, huge buildup of Chuck and God and the Darkness, I wish there had been a little bit more to that reconciliation. It happened super quick.""

However, Benedict also understood the rationale behind that choice, saying, ""At the end of the day, it's a series about Sam and Dean, so it worked out the way that it needed to work out for that show.""

Misha Collins likewise identified some plots he liked less than others for his character. Pertaining to the many different versions of Castiel that Collins played over the years, he said:

""Crazy Cas I could have done without. I didn't want to do more of that. I didn't want to do more Nazi Cas, and, you know, there were some that I was happy to leave behind after a short period, but God Cas, human Cas, and Lucifer Cas were all things that I could have done more of because I had fun with all of them.""

Regarding why 'Crazy Cas,' who had suffered as a result of taking on Sam's trauma from Lucifer's cage, specifically wasn't his favorite, Collins explained:

""It just felt like the character never really landed, and it always felt, like, untrue. Sometimes, there were things for me as an actor on Supernatural where scripts would come in, and I would be like, I can't do this and have it feel honest to the character. A lot of the fish out of water stuff, where Castiel was just like not understanding that reference, but we were seven seasons in, and Castiel had been around humans for years and years and years at that point. It was like, he's really still not understanding? Some of the writing I felt didn't really always evolve with the characters, and it felt hard to play those things, and honestly, crazy Cas was one of those things.""

Along with Benedict and Collins, Jim Beaver also had certain arcs he would have liked to see explored in more detail. Specifically, Beaver discussed the multiple potential romances for Bobby—including Jody Mills, Mary Winchester, and Ellen Harvelle, among others—none of which played out long-term on the show. Beaver said:

""I would have liked to have seen what happened with that little bit of spark that happened between Bobby and Sheriff Mills because I think Bobby and Jody were a really interesting mix in terms of personality, and I think it would have been real fun to explore what a romance was like in the midst of hunting.""

While the cast of Supernatural therefore expressed a range of opinions on character choices, story arcs, and how the show ended, one thing is clear: these actors care about their characters and this show just as deeply as many in the fanbase do.

Jensen Ackles poked fun at Amazon Prime Video's The Summer I Turned Pretty during the SPN Philly Con. He attended the annual convention along with his former co-star, Jared Padalecki.

During a fan interaction at the SPN Philly Con on Sunday, October 5, 2025, Jensen Ackles asked one of the fans, “What show are you binging right now?” The Boys actor jokingly added, “If you say The Summer I Turned Pretty, I'm gonna kick you out of this place,” prompting laughter and applause from the audience.

A post shared by Yara – Jensen Stan (@idjit.jensen2.0)

The fan responded by saying, “I don't know what that is.” Ackles, who was surprised by the answer, said, “You don't know what that is? I could hug you [right now].”

The fan further added, “I'm actually making my mom watch Supernatural right now.” Both Ackles and Padalecki appreciated it and said, “Alright, mom. Well done. Thank you.”

The two Supernatural stars attended the SPN Philly Con to celebrate the show's 20th anniversary, which was held between October 3 and October 5, 2025. Also known as Creation Philadelphia, it is an annual convention focused on the popular dark fantasy TV show, Supernatural.

Creation Entertainment organizes the event every year. It brings together many of the show's stars, including Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and others. The event features activities, such as Q&A panels, photo sessions, autograph sessions, and concerts.

Brown Bag it, Baby

The Seattle Mariners fan who caught Cal Raleigh's 61st home run of the season must have dreamt of it happening a week prior.

Raleigh belted his first home run of the postseason in the ninth inning to give the Mariners an 8-1 lead over the Detroit Tigers in Game 3 of the ALDS. The two-run shot went into Seattle's bullpen in left-center field at Comerica Park in Detroit, Mich.

In a section full of Tigers fans, a Mariners fan was fortunate enough to get the ball on a bounce. He fittingly wore a shirt that said “DUMP 61 HERE,” which had the FS1 broadcast downright giddy.

Not only did the fan have the perfect shirt on for the occasion. He also had a wardrobe change ready just in case. After securing Raleigh's 61st home run ball, the fan changed to a shirt that read “DUMP 62 HERE.”



🤣 The ""Dump Here"" @Mariners fan that caught Cal Raleigh's home run ball REALLY came prepared! pic.twitter.com/ZeZVKmjYRc

The fan named Jameson was even able to meet the “Big Dumper” after the game and got a signed bat to mark the occasion.



DUMP HERE 🤝 pic.twitter.com/Zy8E19UocN

The Mariners held on for an 8-4 victory to take a 2-1 lead in the ALDS against the Tigers.

Jameson's efforts are a reminder to prepare for every day like your dreams are about to come true, or at the very least, have a shirt ready to celebrate the occasion.

Henry CarnellNovember+December 2025 Issue



Scientists once predicted meat-making machines on every kitchen counter, but so far cultured meat—grown from the cells of an animal in a lab or factory—has only been seen at a handful of high-end restaurants. There are entirely practical reasons the stuff has yet to make its debut at McDonald's, but also bizarre, conspiratorial ones; some states have already banned it for reasons that include “global elites” and “bugs.”

First imagined in 19th-century science fiction, cultured meat became a reality in the early 2000s when NASA grew fish tissue in a liquid serum. The first peer-reviewed paper on the topic, in 2005, predicted that cultured meat could address consumer concerns over “nutrition-­related diseases, foodborne illnesses, resource use and pollution,” and the ethical implications of raising animals for meat.

The years that followed brought a mini-boom of research boosted by powerful investors like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. But the technology was pricey and the environmental gains didn't pan out. While early ­analyses­ predicted that emissions from meat production could be reduced by up to 96 percent, those estimates were downgraded over the years; one paper even argued the environmental impact of lab-grown beef could be greater than that of cattle.

In 2022, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene asserted that the government was “surveilling” Americans with meat grown in petri dishes

Farmers didn't take lab-grown meat seriously until about 10 years ago, when farmed animal protein was on the outs because of its association with climate change and heart disease. “Meatless Mondays” were in their Oprah-boosted heyday, plant-based burgers like Impossible and Beyond were exploding in popularity, and the agricultural giant Tyson Foods had invested in lab-grown meat startups and launched its own plant-based products. By 2019, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) was lobbying states to pass laws limiting the use of terms like “hot dogs” and “burgers” to the marketing of farmed animal products. You'd have to say veggie “tubes” or “pucks.” (Tofurky sued, and the restrictions were deemed unconstitutional, except when the meat-related words were being used deceptively.)

The next year, Singapore became the first country to approve cultured meat for consumption. The United States followed in 2023, and two companies (including one backed by Gates) brought to market lab-grown chicken products, which are as yet too expensive for most consumers.

In the interim, right-wing trendsetters were busy spreading conspiracy theories about lab-grown meat. In 2022, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene asserted that the government was “surveilling” Americans with meat grown in petri dishes, and that the deep state would “zap” those who ate a real burger. Though widely mocked, Greene was tapping into a growing political movement that had begun the year before, with influencers going viral for promoting “real”—often raw—meat. The most famous one, Liver King, touted a meat-heavy “ancestral lifestyle” on TikTok that included eating raw organs and questionable “natural” supplements. He later admitted he was also ingesting copious amounts of steroids, but the trend stuck. Proponents, including doctors-turned-influencers, highlighted supposed benefits of animal meat—including increased testosterone and sperm count—and derided people who preferred plant-based options as “soy boys.”

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who brags of his “caveman”-style carnivore diet, drummed up concern about lab-grown meat when he served as chair of the anti-vaccine nonprofit Children's Health Defense, calling it a ­“catastrophe-in-the-making” and, weirdly, “the death knell to Thomas Jefferson's vision of a democracy.” Soon white supremacists were posting that Gates and other supposed shadowy “globalists” were pushing the government to replace traditional meat with stuff made from bugs. Tucker Carlson seized upon this particular bit of lunacy, devoting an episode of his show to it and declaring, “Eating insects is repulsive and un-American.” One of his guests said the push for bugs was “because they want these farmers' land.”

This was red meat for the MAGA base. In May 2024, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the first statewide lab-meat ban. “Florida is fighting back against the global elite's plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish or bugs to achieve their authoritarian goals,” he proclaimed. Earlier this year, in the lead-up to ­Nebraska's ban, a state senator warned that cultivated meat would “socially engineer” people away from farmed meat, while Gov. Jim ­Pillen declared it the result of “crazy far-left ideology.”

Despite such rants, the cattle ­industry seems less concerned now than it was a few years ago. The NCBA has reversed course and come out against the state bans, some of which have failed. Trump's FDA recently approved a cultured salmon product from the Bezos-backed company Wildtype.

What's behind the about-face? Politics might be part of it. Fourth-generation Nebraska rancher Dan Morgan recently told the Associated Press that banning meat alternatives seems antithetical to free-­market innovation. “It sounds like a bunch of right-wing Republicans echoing a bunch of left-wing Democrats,” he quipped.

What's more, the whole idea of lab-grown meat appears to give folks the ick: In one 2022 survey, people deemed it “equally or more healthy, but more disgusting than conventional meat products.” As long as prices are high and consumers are weirded out, conventional producers have little to worry about. As the Cattlemen's director of government affairs put it last year, “We're not afraid of competing with these products in the marketplace.”

Packed with exclusive investigations, analysis, and features

GB News' new US-focused show is providing a regular platform for conspiracy theories – as well as the claim that the UK needs to be ‘saved' by Donald Trump's America.

The Late Show Live launched on 22 September, broadcasting in the US, as well as on the UK channel and on YouTube. 

Speaking at the American party to mark the launch of GB News in the US last month, its co-owner Sir Paul Marshall told the audience of ‘Make America Great Again' allies and supporters: “We need you to come and save us. To rescue us… You are making America great again.”

The right-wing millionaire added: “We need to make Britain great again… We need as many as possible of you… to appear on our channel, to tell the story of what you're doing to turn your country around.” Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage, a GB News presenter, was the headline speaker at the party. 

The new US show appears to be fulfilling Paul Marshall's wishes. 

Hosted by Bev Turner and Ben Leo live from the United States, The Late Show Live is also being shown – along with other GB News output – on Donald Trump's streaming platform Truth+ as well as other pro-Trump networks.

Content from the inaugural US show – which also aired in the UK – included frequent praise for Trump and his MAGA backers by the GB News hosts and guests – and vice versa, praise for GB News by MAGA figures. 

The US launch raises questions about the media and political discourse GB News hopes to frame around the UK, from the perspective of American politics, and the extent to which such a project aims to help Farage's party, which is leading UK polls. 

Both Turner and Leo have rejected man-made climate change, espoused anti-vaccine views, and appeared to cast doubt on the Coronavirus pandemic being real. 

Turner's heavily pro-Trump commentary has previously included her saying “I think we've got such amazingly exciting times ahead” under the President, and on another occasion, “where Trump goes, hopefully the UK will follow”.

Leo also has also praised Trump, called the climate crisis a “climate scam”, and frequently uses far-right tropes about a so-called immigrant “invasion”. 

He has previously referred to pro-immigration politicians as “traitors” and said of the US President: “I think President Trump, in decades to come, will be remembered as one of the greatest US presidents in living history. He has shifted the Overton window on everything from mass deportations, from the trans debate, take your pick… I think his face should be carved into Mount Rushmore.”

The first programme featured an exclusive interview with senior Trump advisor, former Fox News anchor and 2020 election result-denier Kari Lake, who – along with host Ben Leo – repeatedly castigated the UK on issues such as immigration, free speech, and the BBC licence fee, while calling for Reform UK's Leader Nigel Farage to become the next prime minister. 

Subsequent shows cemented GB News' apparent Trumpian worldview.

On its second airing on 23 September, Turner backed Donald Trump's announcement urging pregnant women to stop taking Tylenol – the name for Paracetamol in the US – claiming, without firm evidence, that it caused autism. 

She said: “I just find it astonishing when Wes Streeting comes out as our Health Secretary the morning after and just says this is wrong as though he has evidence… I imagine he hasn't even read their report by the time he went on breakfast telly this morning.”

And she put forward claims that doctors would recommend Paracetamol on the basis that they do not like Donald Trump.

“The trouble is, if people go into the doctors and the doctors hate Donald Trump and they say ‘I'm pregnant, should I take Paracetamol?' The doctors are going to say, yeah, take Paracetamol, don't listen to that Donald Trump”, she claimed.

“Social media is literally awash with people, pregnant women today on TikTok. I mean, it blows my mind, necking Tylenol just to say, you take this Donald Trump as they put Tylenol down their gullet with their pregnant bump. 

She added: “What's wrong with those women? They [have] completely lost their mind. They are that politically enraged by Donald Trump that they would risk the health of their baby rather than listen to people who have their best interests at heart.”

Claims that migration organisations are controlled by ‘Zionist-type people' remain online despite growing complaints

That same night, right-wing American guest and commentator Stephen Kent drew a comparison between diverse London with “Pakistan or India”. 

“The idea that Britain should be British and that, when you go to London, it should feel like the storybooks and the history books that you were promised is not a controversial idea”, he said. “You're not going to London to visit Pakistan or India”.

GB News' Neil Oliver also made an appearance, who has platformed antisemitic conspiracy theories on his YouTube show. His output has largely disappeared from TV broadcasts but he remains a GB News host online, where content is largely un-regulated by Ofcom. 

Kent described climate advocacy as having “religious fundamentalist energy”, suggesting it meant “we need to cleanse the Earth of human beings”.

In the third show, host Bev Turner challenged a guest, Mally Smith, who had said of Trump's attack on Tylenol: “We also should have scepticism if we're taking medical advice from one guy who told us to inject bleach during Covid, which would be President Trump.”

Turner spoke in Trump's defence, saying: “Just to clarify, he was talking about hydroxychloroquine, which, let's face it, sounds like a bleach, which was a medication which we now know did well on Covid.”

Smith replied: “He did not. He actually said we should inject bleach.”

In April 2020, President Trump said at a press conference, as the first wave of the Coronavirus was taking hold in the US: “I see the disinfectant where it knocks it [Covid] out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning? So it'd be interesting to check that.”

On the show's fourth airing, Turner agreed with bringing back the death penalty in the UK, stating that “Britain could lead the way, frankly, in Europe, in bringing it back. And it would dramatically cut crime, I guarantee it”.

She asked a guest: “President Trump's Attorney General, Pam Bondi, has announced that she's seeking to apply the death penalty across the whole of the United States. But with Britain's crime rocketing, is it time to do the same, bring back the death penalty as the ultimate deterrent?”

She also suggested that Charlie Kirk's alleged killer should be killed “by firing squad”. 

There was a flurry of Ofcom complaints after a series of offensive remarks by presenters on the right-wing channel

Turner called the ‘Unite the Kingdom' protest rally in London on 13 September, organised by far-right convicted criminal Stephen Yaxley-Lennon (‘Tommy Robinson') as a “celebration, I would say, of Britishness on the streets of London”. 

The Metropolitan Police described the event as “a very challenging day that saw disorder, violence directed at officers, and 26 officers injured”. There were dozens of arrests for offences including affray, violent disorder, assaults, and criminal damage.

In another segment, right-wing British-Indian activist Aman Bhogal said that the UK Government's plans for digital IDs presented “a very, very slippery socialist slope to full-blooded communism” and that “Starmer might as well rename the country the People's Republic of North London”.

The programmes so far have also seen frequent claims from hosts Turner and Leo that the Prime Minister should replicate Trump's border policy, with Turner declaring to a guest that “we” – either GB News or the UK – “are here to be saved!”

On the programme's fifth airing, host Ben Leo claimed that “there's some streets [in the UK] where they don't speak English at all. I went to one in Leicester the other week.” It is not clear whether he spoke to every single resident on these unspecified streets. 

According to the latest 2021 Census data, more than 91% (52.6 million) of residents in Britain, aged three years and over, had English (and English or Welsh in Wales) as a main language. A further 7.1% (4.1 million) were proficient in English but did not speak it as their main language.

Guest Raheem Kassam also branded the UK civil service's “quote unquote, deep state” as “nefarious” and “entrenched”.

Ben Leo delivered a flurry of extreme comments on the sixth night of the show. 

On Antifa (antifascist activists) being classed by Trump's administration as “domestic terrorists”, he said that “we should do the same in the UK”.

On US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) making light of deportations, he said: “As a Brit who has 50,000 illegal migrants flooding the Channel since Labour took to power, I quite enjoyed that.”

He praised Trump's military deployments to Democrat cities, adding: “I love them. I love seeing the National Guard on the streets of DC. They make me feel safe… I salute them.”

And he suggested bringing in the military against asylum seekers in the UK: “President Trump sends in the military to defend immigration officials in Portland, in Oregon. He's literally sent in the big guns, the army's there, and they're protecting the ICE agents against the lunatics from Antifa. Do we need to do the same thing in the UK?”

On the show's seventh night, Leo cast doubt on Trump's convictions, the pandemic, what he called the “green scam”, and US election results. 

Commenting on the UK Government's plans for digital IDs, he suggested that it was a form of social control, claiming, without evidence, that it could be used to monitor how much meat people eat. 

“Maybe they'd say… you've had too many steaks this year… Your carbon footprint is doing harm to the nation… You are eating chickpeas and gruel for the next six months until your social credit score is big enough”, he claimed.

Leo added: “Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I don't care.” 

The GB News anchor also referred to the Coronavirus as a “so-called pandemic”. 

Commenting on the 2020 US Presidential Election which President Joe Biden won, Leo gave a nod to Donald Trump's debunked claims of election fraud, saying: “Wasn't it interesting that 20 million less [sic] people voted in the election last year than the 2020 election?… Where did 20 million votes go?” The answer is that many Democrats stayed at home. 

In another segment, he said that he was “pro-gun”, adding a usual (and much parodied) pro-gun trope: “I argue guns don't kill people. People kill people.”

While he conceded that it may be preferable to have no guns, he added: “At a time when criminals, bad people, bad hombres, have access to all sorts of weapons, the only sane response can be is: you need to make sure you're armed yourself.”

GB News is broadcast in the UK on streaming channels regulated by broadcast regulator Ofcom, including this new US show which airs on UK television from midnight until 2am every night.  

Asked about the various comments on GB News' US show, as documented in this article, an Ofcom spokesperson told Byline Times: “Our broadcasting rules apply only to content that airs on Ofcom-licensed channels. We enforce these rules fairly and proportionately, acting independently and impartially at all times.” However, this comment came before Byline Times learnt that the show was also broadcast on the channel's UK station.  

“Ofcom has an ongoing duty to be satisfied, as the independent UK broadcasting regulator, that broadcast licensees remain fit and proper to hold their licences. We keep all licensees under review.”

For Richard Wilson, co-founder of Stop Funding Hate campaign group, GB News' “relentless promotion” of Donald Trump's Government “makes a mockery of the channel's claim to be a champion of free speech”.

“Just at the moment that Trump is stepping up his attacks on freedom of expression in the United States, this toxic channel is doubling-down on its effort to ingratiate itself with the MAGA movement – and import the Trump playbook to Britain,” he added.

Polls indicate that around 70% of Brits now have a negative view of America's President – with Wilson saying this shows “how out of touch GB News is with the UK public”.

11 MPs have been paid over £500,000 by the channel over the past year, with £200,000 going to just two Reform Party MPs

The channel's US launch event on 4 September provides insight on its American love-affair.

Politico reported that the US launch party of GB News' new Washington DC bureau featured “many of the Trump administration's biggest hitters” at a private members' club. 

The outlet added that the White House threw its “full weight” behind the launch, “offering up as speakers both Trump's Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick” and that “almost a dozen members of Trump's Cabinet were in attendance as speakers discussed a budding transatlantic alliance that could help propel Farage into Downing Street”. 

Perhaps most tellingly, GB News co-owner Sir Paul Marshall – who also owns the Spectator magazine and the UnHerd site — told the crowd: “You are an inspiration. The United States has an incredibly important role to play in the future of Britain. You provide us with hope. You provide us with inspiration. We want to shine a light on what's happening here.”

Marshall was reportedly “close to tears” as he quoted Churchill, branding Trump and his supporters “the new world” which would replace the “old” one. 

“We need you to come and save us”, Politico reported. “To rescue us… You are making America great again. We need to make Britain great again… We need as many as possible of you… to appear on our channel, to tell the story of what you're doing to turn your country around”.

GB News did not respond to Byline Times' request for comment.

Correction: This article initially stated that the US show was not regulated by Ofcom. The show is broadcast on GB News' UK channel from midnight every night. 

While most the rest of the media seems to happy to give the handful of Reform MPs undue prominence, Byline Times is committed to tracking the activities of Nigel Farage's party when actually in power

The Asador Aupa restaurant in Spain serves the world's most expensive and exclusive burger. It costs $11,000 and can only be experienced by those invited by the restaurant.

Burgers have gotten considerably more expensive in recent years, but they remain among the most affordable food items on restaurant menus. There are a few exceptions, though, the most notable of which recently claimed the title of ‘the world's most expensive burger'. Thought up by the chefs at Asador Aupa, a Basque cuisine eatery located in Cabrera del Mar, Catalonia, this exclusive treat reportedly took eight years of research and experimentation to develop, and its exact ingredients remain a secret. All we know is that the burger's heart-stopping €9,450 ($11,000) price tag isn't linked to gimmicky and meaningless ingredients like edible gold, but to quality ingredients, a unique dining experience, and exclusivity.



Asador Aupa was founded by Bosco Jiménez, better known as BdeVikingo, a Spanish chef and gastronomic influencer known for his love of the Basque cuisine. His concept for the world's most expensive burger was simple – “luxury shouldn't be noisy, it should be unattainable.” Few people can afford to pay $11,000 for a burger, but even having obscene amounts of money isn't enough. To try the world's most expensive burger, you have to be invited by Asador Aupa. 

“This experience is by invitation only. It's not on the menu. Reservations are not possible. Only those selected to experience it are allowed,” the restaurant's website states. “If you think you should be on the list, you can request it and the request will be processed.”



Only those who meet all the requirements are invited to try the world's most exclusive burger, but here's the kicker: no one knows what the requirements are. However, if you do get selected by Asador Aupa, you will be invited to a private room of the restaurant, seated at a table with a few other lucky patrons, and served a delicacy cooked with the “three best meats in the world”, “the most exclusive cheese in Europe”, and a special sauce prepared with a luxury spirit. 

Is the world's most expensive burger worth the €9,450 ($11,000) asking price? According to its creators, “definitely”, but it's hard to say with no ingredients list to analyze. Then there is the fact that you could buy a small car with that money. It makes Golden Boy, the previous world's most expensive burger, seem cheap by comparison.

Elon Musk and X Corp have reached a settlement in a lawsuit by four former top executives at Twitter, including former CEO Parag Agrawal, who claim they were not paid $128 million in promised severance pay after Musk acquired the social media company and fired them.

The terms of the settlement, which was first announced in a filing in San Francisco federal court last week, were not disclosed. A federal judge on October 1 pushed back filing deadlines and a hearing in the case so the settlement can be finalized. X in August agreed to settle a separate lawsuit by rank-and-file Twitter employees who lost their jobs during mass layoffs and claimed they were owed $500 million in unpaid severance. The cases are among a series of legal challenges that Musk, the world's richest person, has faced after he acquired Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, cut more than half of its workforce and renamed it X.

X and lawyers for the former Twitter executives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The plaintiffs are Agrawal; Ned Segal, Twitter's former chief financial officer; Vijaya Gadde, its former chief legal officer; and Sean Edgett, its former general counsel. The former executives say that Musk falsely accused them of misconduct and forced them out of Twitter after they sued him for attempting to renege on his offer to purchase the company.

Musk then denied the executives severance pay they had been promised for years before he acquired Twitter, according to the lawsuit. The plaintiffs say they each are owed one year's salary and hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of stock options.

Musk and X have denied wrongdoing and said the executives were fired over their performance.

Interestingly, it was US President Theodore Roosevelt who helped popularize these tales. He famously called piranhas “the most ferocious fish in the world,” which cemented their fearsome reputation. However, piranhas are not as violent as Roosevelt's account, Hollywood movies, and adventure novels portray them.
  Far from being ruthless killers, piranhas typically feed on worms, insects, small fish, and plants, helping maintain healthy river ecosystems. However, during the dry season, when water levels are low and food is scarce, they

“Piranhas” may make great material for horror and adventure stories, but in reality, they rarely attack humans. While people fear piranhas, it is often humans who pose a greater threat to them through overfishing, pollution, and habitat disruption.
  In many parts of the Amazon, piranhas have long been a common food source and are often grilled or cooked in soup. Their razor-sharp, triangular teeth are also used by locals to make tools for cutting and carving.

The good news for the party, in both respects, is that the battle for the seat is being fought by Roy Cooper.

Not only has the former governor never lost an election in his almost 40-year political career, but his campaign recently revealed it had broken fundraising records for a Senate race.

Just weeks after he formally began his run before the 2026 mid-terms, Mr Cooper has raised more than $14.5m: the largest ever single-quarter haul for a Senate seat challenger.

There is a reason why Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, lobbied for the 68-year-old to return to the political fray after his second term as governor expired last year.

Michael Whatley, the Republican challenger, has been decisively out-raised thus far, and some believe the GOP's only chance to hang onto North Carolina is to saturate the state in outside money.

But barring the intervention of Elon Musk or another big-money Republican donor, the race is Mr Cooper's to lose.

North Carolina Senate races have been shattering records for decades, with some $25m being spent in the bitterly-fought 1984 contest between Jim Hunt and Jesse Helms.

By the time Thom Tillis, who announced earlier this year he would not contest the 2026 midterms after drawing the ire of Donald Trump, won the seat in 2014 and 2020, hundreds of millions of dollars were being thrown at the seat.

Now, a member of Mr Cooper's campaign quoted in Politico believes it could be the first $1bn Senate contest.

The reasons for that are twofold according to R Bruce Thompson, a North Carolina fundraiser who served on Hillary Clinton's finance committee for her presidential run nine years ago.

First, North Carolina is a politically-divided state where contests are closely fought between Republicans and Democrats and often turn on tiny margins.

And second, winning the state opens the door to controlling the Senate.

“These elections become nationalised because of the fact that there is so much riding on them,” Mr Thompson told The Telegraph.

Currently, Republicans have 53 seats in the Senate. Democrats, who have 45 senators plus two independents who caucus with them, would have to flip four seats in next year's mid-terms for a majority.

The electoral battlefield does not look favourable for the Democrats in 2026, but some see a narrow path to winning back the Senate – if they get North Carolina.

The party has had a torrid time since Mr Trump won the presidential election in November, while Republicans won the Senate and kept hold of the House of Representatives. But they have been buoyed by Mr Cooper's campaign launch.

In many ways, the former governor, who began his political career while Ronald Reagan was still in the White House, is a political throwback.

As American politics has become increasingly vicious and personal, he has largely steered clear of the political street-fighting. His genial, soft-spoken demeanour belies his political durability and survival skills.

Carter Wrenn, a veteran Republican operative in the state, sees politicians like Mr Cooper as a dying breed.

“In politics today, you see a lot of strutting, a lot of posturing, a lot of boisterousness, a lot of trying to get attention on social media,” he said.

“Roy Cooper has none of that. He grew up in a small town and he's sort of quiet, got a sense of humour. He's nice to people he doesn't get along with, doesn't agree with, and that's not something you see a lot in politics anymore.”

Mr Cooper is one of the old-school Democrats, Mr Wrenn said: middle of the road, polite, and the opposite of a political showman like Gavin Newsom, the California governor.

When he announced his Senate run in July, Mr Cooper steered clear of personal attacks.

Mr Trump and Mr Whatley did not get mentioned by name, while the lone reference to Republicans was for his work reaching across the aisle as governor to expand Medicaid, the health insurance programme for low-income Americans.

The key message was affordability: reviving the middle-class dream for Americans, stopping mounting federal debt, and blocking attacks on Medicaid and Medicare.

“I never really wanted to go to Washington,” he said. But the odds are Mr Cooper will go to Washington after all.

Of the more than $14.5m he has raised to date, some 90 per cent has come from donations of $100 or less, which his campaign manager says reflects a “massive groundswell of support”.

Mr Whatley, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who in his time has drummed up hundreds of millions of dollars for candidates, brought in less than half than his rival: $5.8m.

Mr Cooper, whom polling shows has a healthy lead in the contest and high name recognition, has conspicuously avoided naming Mr Whatley, a former backroom fixer who is much less well-known. Occasionally, he refers to him as a “DC insider”.

“Any fundraising on a national level for the Republicans really just rode off the coattails of Trump. That's not hard money to raise,” Mr Thompson said of the former RNC boss.

“When you're running against somebody who has the kind of name recognition and approval that Roy Cooper does, you have to raise a lot. You've got to spend a lot of money to cut into that.”

Mr Whatley's only hope, Mr Thompson believes, is outside money. Super Political Action Committees (Pacs) can spend unlimited amounts on advertising and are much less tightly regulated than direct contributions to candidates.

“Just one billionaire can have an outsized impact on the democratic process,” he said.

The biggest billionaire of them all is Mr Musk, who spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to back Mr Trump and other Republican candidates in last year's elections.

The Tesla boss, who is projected to become the world's first trillionaire, has recently said he intends to take a step back from politics as his relationship with the president spectacularly, and publicly, fell apart.

But even if the richest man in the world has gone quiet, he has not yet abandoned the Republicans, and will be warily watched by Democrats ahead of the mid-terms.

Filings to the Federal Election Commission from June show he gave $5m apiece to the Republican's Senate Leadership Fund, the Congressional Leadership Fund, and the Trump-supporting Maga Inc Super Pac.

Three days later, he gave $27m to America PAC, which he founded last year. Exactly who directs its day-to-day operations is unclear, but it could be used to support specific Republican candidates.

Political strategists who spoke to The Telegraph expect the North Carolina race to morph into a “brutal” war of attrition. But so far, Mr Cooper's popularity is intact.

“You don't see a lot of figures in politics these days who are popular,” Mr Wrenn said.

“Republicans, if you ask them, ‘Do you like him or dislike him?', most of them are going to say, ‘Oh, I dislike him.' But some are going to say they like him, and Democrats like him.

“Independent voters like him… and they're the ones that really matter in terms of who wins.”

The good news for the Democrats is that, for the first time in what feels like a political age, they finally have what looks like a winning formula.

The bad news is that it takes a popular former governor and hundreds of millions of dollars to get there. Winning another Senate seat, let alone winning enough to take back the Senate, will be more of a challenge.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker responded by saying that Trump is ""on the path to full-blown authoritarianism.""

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

On Wednesday morning, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that he wanted two of his Democratic political rivals to be imprisoned.

Trump has been at odds with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, both of whom have opposed the president's plan to increase Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Chicago and deploy the National Guard there.

The city of Chicago and the state of Illinois have filed a lawsuit to block the deployment of the National Guard. Although a federal judge refused to take immediate action, a hearing on the matter is scheduled for Thursday, with a decision likely to come later this week or early next. 

Trump suggested in his post that the mayor and the governor should be punished for not cooperating with his plan to militarize the nation's third-largest city.

“Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers! Governor Pritzker also!” Trump wrote.

The statement is indicative of Trump's growing authoritarian zeal since reentering the White House. He has, for example, said he is considering invoking the Insurrection Act to send U.S. military troops to Democratic-run cities across the country. His administration has also (perhaps illegally) used government resources — including workers' emails and federal websites — to blame Democrats for the current government shutdown. 

Trump has relentlessly attacked Democrats in general, sharing a meme last week, for instance, that referred to the Democratic party as the party of “hate, evil and Satan.” He has also threatened to use military force to quell protests of his policies, describing protesters as “terrorists” and people with leftist views as “the enemy from within.”

Both Pritzker and Johnson have responded to Trump's post.

“This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested,” Johnson wrote on X. “I'm not going anywhere.”

“I will not back down,” Pritzker said in his response. “Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?”

According to independent monitors, Trump's descent into authoritarianism has indeed escalated in recent months. Protect Democracy, a nonprofit that describes itself as an “anti-authoritarianism group,” surveys around 1,000 scholars daily on their views regarding freedom levels in several countries, including the U.S. According to their most recent calculation, the U.S. is currently at a 3.3 rating on a scale of 5, placing the country at a “severe threat” status.

The threat of authoritarianism has more than doubled since March, an examination of Protect Democracy's scoring on Wednesday showed. 

New polling of U.S. voters shows that most side with Pritzker, Johnson and other leaders opposed to Trump's militarization of large cities. According to an Economist/YouGov poll published this week, only 37 percent of Americans are in favor of Trump deploying the military to U.S. cities, while 52 percent are opposed.

            Israel assesses that Hamas may not be able to find and return all the remaining dead hostages in Gaza, according to three Israeli sources, a fact that may complicate efforts to reach a deal to end the war.
    


            Sources say the Israeli government is aware that Hamas may not know the location of, or is unable to retrieve, the remains of some of the 28 remaining deceased hostages. According to one source, the number is between seven and nine, another source put it between 10 and 15.
    


            One of the sources said the assessments are based on Israeli intelligence reports, as well as messaging from Hamas and mediators in recurring rounds of negotiations. The reason for the difference in the two assessments was not clear.
    


            There are 20 hostages who are believed to be alive, with grave concerns for the well-being of two of them.
    


            During the latest negotiations for a hostage and ceasefire deal in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt, Israel has demanded the return of all the hostages – both living and dead – as a condition for ending the war.
    


            The three Israeli sources say Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet have known for months that Hamas does not know the whereabouts of some of the deceased hostages and may therefore be unable to meet that demand.  CNN has asked the Israeli government for comment.
    


            The United States has also known about the issue for some time, with negotiators in the Biden administration aware that some hostages were held by factions in Gaza over which Hamas does not exert full control.
    


            Barbara Leaf, Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern Affairs under President Joe Biden, told CNN: “It's been the case from the outset that they (Hamas) have not had control over all of the hostages.” Leaf said recovering the remains of some of the dead hostages could be difficult. “It's far more likely they can recover all of the living hostages,” she said.
    


            It is unclear how this uncertainty could affect the current round of crucial talks in Egypt. One Israeli source said that Israel's official position is that Hamas is responsible for all the deceased hostages and the Israeli government expects all of them to be returned. The source said that Hamas might use the uncertainty over its ability to return all the dead hostages to draw out the implementation of any ceasefire arrangements, and to insist that it would not return all remaining hostages until Israel agrees to a full military withdrawal from Gaza.
    


            Another Israeli source expressed concern that Netanyahu might use the uncertainty as a pretext to derail talks. Critics of the Israeli prime minister, including opposition leaders and families of hostages, have repeatedly accused him of deliberately undermining negotiations to end the war, alleging he imposes new conditions for political reasons, particularly when agreements appear close.
    


            However, other sources say that given the heavy American and regional pressure to secure a deal, Netanyahu is more likely to use the issue as leverage over the final details of an agreement, rather than torpedoing the entire framework under US President Donald Trump's 20-point proposal.
    


            The uncertainty about deceased hostages is particularly sensitive in Israeli society, as it resonates with previous unresolved cases of missing soldiers. Lieutenant Hadar Goldin was killed and his body taken by Hamas during the seven-week war in Gaza in 2014. His body has never been handed over, and is now counted among the 48 living and dead hostages Israel demands be returned. Goldin's family has campaigned for years for his return, citing Israel's commitment to the principle of leaving no-one behind in conflict.
    


            Ron Arad, an Israeli Air Force navigator, was captured when his jet was shot down over Lebanon in 1986. Nearly four decades later, his unresolved disappearance remains one of Israel's most painful symbols.
    


            One of Netanyahu's closest confidants, Natan Eshel, wrote a message to a group of journalists last week, referring to the Gaza negotiations and saying “there will be some Ron Arads” – an indication that senior figures in the Israeli political establishment believe that some hostages' bodies will never be returned.

            A 30-year-old protester was taking part in a gathering against Myanmar's ruling junta on a festival day in the central region of Sagaing on Monday when he heard the distinctive noise of fan blades cutting through the air.
    


            Minutes later, explosives were dropped by a motorised paraglider, also known as a paramotor.
    


            “I was thrown away,” said the protester, asking not to be named for fear of retribution from the junta.
    


            “Initially, I thought the whole lower part of my body had been severed. I touched it and I realized the legs are still there.”
    


            At least 20 people were killed in the attack by the junta, according to the eyewitness, Amnesty International, the shadow National Unity Government and an armed resistance group in the area.
    


            It is also the latest instance of Myanmar's well-armed military using paramotors as part of its widening range of aerial weaponry, including aircraft and drones, deployed in an expanding civil war.
    


            A spokesperson for Myanmar's junta did not respond to calls seeking comment. The military has previously rejected accusations that it targets civilians.
    


            The Southeast Asian nation has been gripped by protests and a nationwide armed rebellion since 2021 following the military's ouster of an elected civilian government.
    


            The attack at Sagaing's Chaung-U township took place just before 8 p.m. local time (9:30 a.m. ET) on Monday as local residents gathered in a field, said the eyewitness and a spokesman for a local anti-junta armed resistance group.
    


            “The military has used paramotors to bomb this area approximately six times before this latest incident,” Ko Thant, an information officer for the Chaung-U Township People's Defence Force, told Reuters.
    


            The junta's first recorded use of paramotors, which can seat up to three soldiers to drop bombs or fire at targets, was in December 2024 and they have since been deployed more widely, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.
    


            The military also used paramotors to carry out attacks in parts of Myanmar hit by a deadly earthquake in March, the United Nations said in April.
    


This military junta is rebranding itself to hold elections. But a UN probe has found evidence of intensifying atrocities



            “Paramotors are typically deployed in areas of mixed control or where resistance groups have minimal equipment, such as lacking access to the 7.62 cartridges and weapons required to shoot them down,” ACLED Senior Analyst Su Mon said in a July report.
    


            In some areas, rebels have claimed to have shot down a junta paramotor, according to a statement issued by the Burma Revolution Rangers group in April.
    


            With frontlines stretching from the northern Kachin hills to the western coastal state of Rakhine, the junta is increasingly relying on aerial power, with 1,134 airstrikes between January and May, far higher than corresponding figures of 197 and 640 in 2023 and 2024, according to ACLED.
    


            In the aftermath of the strike in Chaung-U township, the 30-year-old protester said he crawled into a nearby ditch and hid there until his friends pulled him out.
    


            “This is mass murder,” he said, referring to the junta's attack. “They are committing it openly.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:rt.com","Cristiano Ronaldo becomes football's first billionaire","https://www.rt.com/news/626088-cristiano-ronaldo-football-billionaire/","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:46:00 GMT","

Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first footballer to join the ranks of billionaires, according to Bloomberg's calculations.

The agency reported on Wednesday that the 40-year-old athlete has made it into the Bloomberg Billionaires Index after his net worth climbed to $1.4 billion.

Ronaldo's wealth rose dramatically after he signed a new two-year contract with Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr, reportedly worth more than $400 million, it said.

Over his career, the Portuguese star has played for some of Europe's top clubs – including Manchester United and Real Madrid – winning the UEFA Champions League five times along with dozens of other titles. He has also received the Ballon d'Or, awarded to the world's best footballer, on five occasions.

Ronaldo's unexpected move to Al-Nassr in 2023 earned him around $200 million annually and allowed him to overtake his longtime rival, Argentina's Lionel Messi, in earnings.

Besides his football salary, Ronaldo – nicknamed CR7 – derives much of his wealth from lucrative endorsement deals with brands such as Nike and Armani, Bloomberg noted. The outlet added that he also owns an extensive real-estate portfolio.

In late August, Forbes reported that retired Swiss tennis star Roger Federer had become the seventh athlete in history to surpass the billion-dollar mark, joining basketball players Michael Jordan and LeBron James, golfer Tiger Woods, boxing champ Floyd Mayweather, and others.

Czechia's populist ANO (Yes) party, which won a landslide victory in the recent parliamentary elections, softened its rhetoric on the country's ammunition initiative for Ukraine, local media reported on Oct. 7.

""The ammunition initiative was a good idea in principle... We will discuss it and demand greater transparency and a reassessment, possibly transferring it under NATO,"" said ANO leader Andrej Babis, according to Novinky.cz news outlet.

Back in July, the billionaire ex-prime minister told Reuters that if his party returns to power, it would cancel the initiative that has funneled hundreds of thousands of critically important artillery rounds to Ukraine amid Russian aggression.

The ANO leadership later suggested that the scheme could be overseen by NATO instead. The Czech Defense Ministry has dismissed the proposal, explaining that arms deliveries are a responsibility of individual countries, not the alliance as a whole.

""We're not talking about stopping the initiative, but about a thorough review. We need transparency,"" said Lubomir Metnar, an ANO lawmaker who served as defense minister in Babis's past government and might reportedly return to the position.

ANO won the Oct. 3-4 election with 34.5%, ousting the center-right coalition government that has provided steadfast support to Ukraine since the outbreak of the full-scale war in 2022.

Under the outgoing government, Czechia has supplied Kyiv with tanks, multiple-launch rocket systems, helicopters, and other equipment, and hosted hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees.

In 2024, the Central European NATO member launched an initiative to alleviate Ukraine's shell shortages, allowing Western countries to quickly purchase rounds for Kyiv on global markets.

Czechia said it supplied 1.5 million shells under the initiative last year and plans to provide up to 1.8 million more by the end of 2025.

The Motorists for Themselves and Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD), two fringe right-wing parties leading government negotiations with ANO, have differing views on the initiative.

While the Motorists said they did not oppose continuing the scheme, the far-right SPD called for an end to Czechia's military aid to Ukraine, describing it as an ""escalation of the conflict.""

ANO has previously criticized the outgoing government's support for Kyiv and Ukrainian refugees. 

After his election win, Babis insisted that Ukraine is ""not ready"" to join the EU. He also said that Czechia supports Ukraine, but should limit the funds it provides to Kyiv in order to prioritize the needs of Czech citizens.

Israeli and Hamas officials are set to hold talks at the Red Sea city of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.The Associated Press

The most promising effort yet to end the war in Gaza was bolstered as senior figures from Israel and the United States joined the negotiations on Wednesday after Hamas handed over its lists of hostages and Palestinian prisoners to be freed in a swap. 

With U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point plan appearing closer than any previous bid to halt the war, delegations were upgrading their presence at the indirect talks, launched on Monday in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. 

Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff and Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, arrived and began participation in the talks, Israeli and Palestinian sources said.

Also joining the discussions was the prime minister of longstanding mediator Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, according to Egyptian sources.

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including ceasefire talks, famine and the Israeli ground offensive.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the mediated negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas had made “a lot of headway” and that a ceasefire would be declared if they reached a positive outcome. Trump also expressed optimism about progress toward a deal on Tuesday, and European, Arab and other states will meet in Paris on Thursday to discuss Gaza's post-war transition, with Washington likely to be represented, diplomatic sources said. 

But crucial details are yet to be spelled out, including the timing, a post-war administration for the Gaza Strip and the fate of Hamas. Gaza authorities say more than 67,000 people have been killed and much of the enclave has been flattened since Israel began its military response to the Hamas attack two years ago. Around 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage back to Gaza, according to Israeli officials, with 20 of the 48 hostages still held believed to be alive.

Hamas said it had handed over its lists of hostages and Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged in a swap, and was optimistic about the talks so far.

The list of Palestinians Hamas wants freed is expected to include some of the most prominent prisoners ever jailed by Israel, whose release had been off limits in previous ceasefires.

Hamas said on Tuesday it wants to reach a deal to end the war in Gaza based on a plan proposed by U.S President Donald Trump, but it still has a set of demands.

Reuters

According to a Palestinian source close to the talks, the list includes Marwan al-Barghouti, a leader of the Fatah movement, and Ahmed Saadat, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Both are serving multiple life sentences for involvement in attacks that killed Israelis.

Hamas says the indirect negotiations were focused so far on three issues: halting the conflict, withdrawing Israeli forces from Gaza and the swap deal.

Across Canada, Oct. 7 anniversary marked by mourning and protest

The group has so far refused to discuss Israel's demand that Hamas give up its arms, which the Palestinian source said Hamas would reject as long as Israeli troops occupy Palestinian land.

Two sources familiar with the talks confirmed that sticking points included the mechanism for the Israeli withdrawal, with Hamas seeking a clear timeline linked to the release of hostages and guarantees of a complete withdrawal by Israeli forces.

Within Gaza, Israel has dialled down its military campaign at Trump's behest, but it has not halted strikes altogether. The Israeli military said its forces had killed several militants in Gaza City, Gaza's main urban hub, who it said were on their way to attack Israeli soldiers. Gaza medical authorities reported eight people killed in Israeli strikes in the last 24 hours, the lowest toll for weeks. Daily death tolls had been around 10 times as high over the past month as Israeli forces advance on Gaza City.

“We hope from God that a ceasefire would take place as soon as possible, because people can't bear the suffering anymore,” said Jehad al-Shagnobi, whose house was destroyed in the Sabra district of Gaza City. Another participant in the talks was Turkish spymaster Ibrahim Kalin, Egyptian sources said. This pointed to a growing role for Turkey, a NATO member with close contacts with Hamas. President Tayyip Erdogan said Trump had asked Turkey to help persuade Hamas to accept the deal.

Opinion: An Israel-Hamas deal makes sense for both sides – but huge obstacles remain

Trump's plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza's post-war administration. Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen.

There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007.

Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries. It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza.

Global outrage has mounted against Israel's assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a U.N. inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel calls its actions self-defence after the 2023 Hamas attack.

It's been two years since Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel, plunging the region into war. Here are the key statistics from the conflict.

As the government shutdown approaches its eighth day, senators are weighing in on the White House's new threats to refuse to back pay furloughed federal workers, increasing the pressure on Democrats to find a way out of the shutdown.

On Oct. 7, The Epoch Times confirmed that the White House Office of Management and the Budget (OMB) has drafted a legal memorandum which calls into question whether “non-essential” federal employees who are furloughed and do not work during the shutdown are entitled to back pay.","{'href': 'https://www.theepochtimes.com', 'title': 'theepochtimes.com'}","world"

            President Donald Trump is barreling forward with his administration's heavy-handed efforts across the United States, in rather ominous and drastic ways.
    


            In recent days alone, his administration has tried to skirt a Trump-nominated judge's ruling against his use of the National Guard in Portland, Oregon. He's attacked Democrats in speeches to military leaders and troops, even pitting generals and admirals against the blue side. He's pressed forward with a Guard deployment to Chicago that the mayor and Illinois's governor have rejected – and even said Wednesday that the mayor and governor should be “in jail.” And he's now floating invoking the Insurrection Act, which hasn't been used in decades and would give him more freedom in deploying the military domestically.
    


            All of this despite no evidence of an actual insurrection or really even extraordinary levels of crime or violence in the cities at issue. The Trump-nominated judge said over the weekend that the record showed the Portland protests “were not significantly violent.”
    


            We seem to be reaching an inflection point, where Trump charges ahead despite the courts, despite the facts on the ground, and despite longstanding norms that guard against the politicization of the military.
    


            But in this moment, it's also worth emphasizing: He's charging forward despite public opinion, too.
    


            While many wagered at the start that Americans really just wanted to stomp out crime and didn't care about the details, the public has  actually taken a pretty dim view of Trump's gambit.
    


            And if anything, their skepticism appears to be growing.
    


            A few polls of late drive that home.
    


            The first thing to note is that Americans seem to oppose Trump's use of the Guard by sightly widening margins.
    


            A CBS News-YouGov poll this weekend showed they opposed Trump's decision to deploy the Guard to US cities, 58%-42%. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed they disapproved of Trump's use of the Guard and federal law enforcement to reduce crime, 55%-42%. And NPR-Ipsos polling in recent weeks showed fewer than 4 in 10 Americans supported Trump's decisions to deploy the Guard to Washington, DC, and Memphis, Tennessee.
    


            These numbers are significant because early polling suggested Americans were more evenly split on Trump's initial deployment of the military to Los Angeles over the summer.
    


            Those early polls also suggested Americans were broadly open to the concept of using the Guard to help police combat crime, at least as long as local officials didn't object. (An August AP-NORC poll showed Americans said 55%-37% that it was acceptable for the military and National Guard to support local police.)
    


            But the new data suggest Americans are now broadly opposed to using the Guard at all, irrespective of local input.
    


            The second point is that, to the extent this was succeeding, you'd expect Americans to be warming to Trump's handling of crime. That's the justification for all of this, after all.
    


            But that's not what has happened.
    


            A new Reuters-Ipsos poll released Wednesday showed Trump's approval rating on crime going from 43% last month to 41% now. A Washington Post-Ipsos poll conducted in mid-September showed Americans disapproved of him on crime 54%-44%.
    


            A New York Times-Siena College poll showed a more even split, but with some warning signs: Independents disapproved 51%-42%, and even 15% of Trump voters didn't like his handling of crime.
    


            These are unusual numbers for Trump, for whom getting tough on crime has long been a calling card.
    


            And that brings us to perhaps the most underappreciated aspect of all of this. It's not just that Americans seem to view this as a waste of time or resources; they also seem to object to it on principle.
    


            This was an issue driven home by the Trump-appointed judge, Karin Immergut, over the weekend. She said that the Trump administration's arguments “risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power — to the detriment of this nation.”
    


            That's actually something that Americans seem concerned about, even at this early juncture and even as they've been quite worried about crime.
    


            The New York Times-Siena College poll asked perhaps the best question on this. It surveyed  whether Americans were more worried about whether crime would “spiral out of control in big cities” if the Guard weren't deployed, or whether they were more concerned about Trump using the Guard to “intimidate his political opponents.”
    


            That latter option might seem rather conspiratorial to Trump supporters. But Americans chose it by a significant margin, 51%-42%.
    


            Similarly, the new Reuters-Ipsos poll showed Americans generally align with the idea that the military should be used only in extraordinary circumstances. In fact, they said 58%-25% that a president should only deploy it to deal with “external threats.”
    


            Trump, by contrast, is very much seeking to use it against supposed internal threats – what he labels the “enemy from within.”
    


            In a speech to the generals and admirals last week, he repeatedly returned to the idea that this was an enemy akin to a foreign threat. “No different than a foreign enemy,” he said at one point.
    


            None of these overall margins against Trump's use of the Guard are overwhelming. And Trump has solid support in his base, which is usually what he cares about most.
    


            But as he pushes toward the scenario that some of his most prominent top military leaders once feared – the militarization of the homeland – it's worth emphasizing that he's apparently doing these drastic things against Americans' will.

            Nine months after a raging inferno decimated the Los Angeles area, claiming the lives of a dozen people and burning down thousands of homes and businesses, officials have arrested a suspect in Florida on suspicion of arson.
    


            Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, is facing a federal charge of destruction of property by means of fire, according to Bill Essayli, the acting US attorney for Southern California.
    


            Authorities painted a picture of a man singularly focused on a city going up in flames at a news conference Wednesday, saying the suspect repeatedly watched a rap video which included “objects being lit on fire” in the days before allegedly setting the fire.
    


            The suspect also allegedly prompted ChatGPT to generate a “dystopian painting showing in part a burning forest and a crowd fleeing from it,” in the months before the fire started, according to Bill Essayli, the acting US attorney for Southern California.
    


            The suspect, who worked as an Uber driver and lived in the Pacific Palisades at the time, is under arrest on suspicion of arson in connection with the Palisades Fire and is expected to make his first appearance in federal court in Orlando on Wednesday.
    


            CNN has contacted Rinderknecht's attorney for comment but did not immediately hear back.
    


            “As the world watched in horror as the Palisades fire burned, victims perished in the smoke and flames. Homes where cherished family memories and belongings were turned to rubble and ash. The iconic Pacific Coast Highway along Malibu looked like a war zone,” Essayli said.
    


            “Thousands of people were forced to evacuate. The homes and businesses cannot be rebuilt. This arrest, we hope, will provide a measure of justice to all those who were impacted.”
    


Suspect charged in connection with deadly Palisades Fire



            The suspect was working as an Uber driver and dropped off a passenger on New Year's Eve before walking up a nearby trail where he took some iPhone videos of the view and listened to the rap song, before allegedly starting a fire 12 minutes into the new year, officials said.
    


            “It took the defendant several tries to contact 911 to report the fire,” Essayli said. “He fled the scene in his car, but turned around after passing fire engines driving in the opposite direction to fight the fire.”
    


            The blaze the suspect allegedly started was called the Lachman Fire, and it grew to eight acres before firefighters were able to knock it down, according to alerts from the Los Angeles Fire Department, which noted a team would work to ensure no flare-ups occurred.
    


            The Palisades Fire, which began the morning of January 7, has been determined to be a “holdover” fire, according to the federal criminal complaint, meaning it started from the remnants of an earlier blaze – likely the Lachman Fire in this case.
    


            The proximity of the two fires had prompted questions as to whether winds could have rekindled smoldering debris left from New Year's Eve fireworks to trigger the Palisades Fire, as reported by the San Francisco Chronicle and the Washington Post.
    


            LAFD had suppressed the Lachman Fire on January 1, the complaint says, but it “continued to smolder and burn underground” unnoticed.
    


            “The investigation into the Palisades Fire of January 2025 was lengthy, complex and, as I mentioned, extremely thorough,” Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell said at a news conference on Wednesday.
    


            The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives determined the fire “was ignited with an open flame,” Essayli said.
    


            Essayli declined to speak to Rinderknecht's motive.
    


            “Part of the lengthy time that it took to go over the thousands of acres that were burned is we literally had agents with our partners on their hands and knees crawling through fire debris,” said ATF Special Agent in Charge Kenny Cooper.
    


            “This action was deliberate, intended to cause devastating harm to the City of Los Angeles. This arrest is a critical step toward ensuring accountability, justice, and healing for our city,” Interim LAFD Chief Ronnie Villanueva said in a statement following the announcement of Rinderknecht's arrest. “Although the flames have been extinguished, the impact of these fires will linger for years to come.”
    


            California Attorney General Rob Bonta told CNN earlier this year there were “some indications that arson is a possibility that we have to be open to.”
    


            Fifteen members of the ATF's National Response Team headed up the investigation into the fire's “cause and origins,” ATF deputy assistant director Tim Jones previously told CNN.
    


            The Palisades wildfire is the ninth deadliest wildfire in state history, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
    


LA County response to deadly fires slowed by lack of resources, outdated alert process, report says



            The deadly inferno in Los Angeles is the third-most destructive wildfire in Southern California history, destroying thousands of homes and businesses and burning more than 23,000 acres.
    


            “Our heroic firefighters fought the blaze valiantly with no rest,” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement. “Each day that families are displaced is a day too long and as we are working tirelessly to bring Angelenos home, we are also working towards closure and towards justice – and today is a step forward in that process.”
    


            The fire was anticipated to be among the costliest wildfires in the history of the United States, a climate expert predicted.
    


            “While we cannot undo the damage and destruction that was done, we hope his arrest and the charges against him bring some measure of justice to the victims of this horrific tragedy,” Essayli said in a social media post.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Most members of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate setting committee supported further reductions to its key interest rate this year, according to minutes from last month's meeting released Wednesday.

A majority of Fed officials felt that the risk unemployment would rise had worsened since their previous meeting in July, while the risk of rising inflation “had either diminished or not increased,” the minutes said. As a result, the central bank decided at its Sept. 16-17 meeting to reduce its key rate by a quarter-point to about 4.1%, its first cut this year.

Rate cuts by the Fed can gradually lower borrowing costs for things like mortgages, auto loans, and business loans, encouraging more spending and hiring.

Still, the minutes underscored the deep division on the 19-person committee between those who feel that the Fed's short-term rate is too high and weighing on the economy, and those who point to persistent inflation that remains above the central bank's 2% target as evidence that the Fed needs to be cautious about reducing rates. 

Only one official formally dissented from the quarter-point cut: Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Donald Trump and was approved by the Senate just hours before the meeting began. He supported a larger, half-point cut instead. 

But the minutes noted that “a few” policymakers said they could have supported keeping rates unchanged, or said that “there was merit” in such a step. 




The differences help explain Chair Jerome Powell's statements during the news conference that followed the meeting: “There are no risk-free paths now. It's not incredibly obvious what to do.”

Miran said in remarks Tuesday that he thinks inflation will steadily decline back toward the Fed's 2% target, despite Trump's tariffs, and as a result he doesn't think the Fed's rate needs to be nearly as high as it is. Rental costs are steadily declining and will bring down inflation, he said, while tariff revenue will reduce the government's budget deficit and reduce longer-term interest rates, which gives the Fed more room to cut.

Yet many other Fed officials remain concerned about stubbornly high inflation, the minutes showed. Jeffrey Schmid, president of the Federal Reserve's Kansas City branch, said in a speech Monday that “inflation is too high” and argued that the Fed should keep rates high enough to cool demand and prevent inflation from worsening.

And Austan Goolsbee, president of the Fed's Chicago branch, said in an interview Friday with The Associated Press that he supported a cautious approach toward more cuts, and wanted to see evidence that inflation would cool further. 

“I am a little uneasy with front loading rate cuts, presuming that those upticks in inflation will just go away,” he said.

The minutes provide insight into how the Fed's policymakers were thinking last month about inflation, interest rates, and hiring. Since then, however, the federal government shutdown has cut off the flow of economic data that the Fed relies on to inform its decisions. The September jobs report wasn't issued as scheduled last Friday, and if the shutdown continues, it could also delay the release of the inflation report set for next Wednesday.

Mary E. Brunkow, Fred Ramsdell and Shimon Sakaguchi won the Nobel Prize in medicine on Monday for their discoveries concerning peripheral immune tolerance. An Associated Press photographer, Lindsey Wasson, helped give her the news early Monday morning.

Three scientists have won the Nobel Prize in physics for research on the strange behavior of subatomic particles called quantum tunneling. The results are just starting to appear in advanced technology and could pave the way for the development of supercharged computing.

BERLIN (AP) — For some Nobel Prize winners this year, the news came with a knock at the door before dawn. For others, it was a long-awaited phone call honoring a discovery made decades ago.

One of the medicine prize winners, meanwhile, was on vacation in Yellowstone National Park without cellular service. It would be hours before he found out.

The Nobel Prizes are considered among the world's most prestigious honors for achievements in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature, economics and peace. The winners join the pantheon of Nobel laureates, from Albert Einstein to Mother Teresa.

Sometimes, the award is anticipated. Potential winners plan tentative news conferences or, in the western U.S., wait up all night for the news.

While some prizes might feature household names — such as 2009 peace prize winner then-U.S. President Barack Obama or 2016 literature laureate and singer-songwriter Bob Dylan — the natural science categories typically go to people whose names the general public doesn't know, for decades-old research.

Five of this year's nine science winners were in the U.S. when the news broke. Some were fast asleep. 

Two winners in Japan, seven hours ahead of Stockholm, were awake and working when the call came from a Swedish number. One thought it was a telemarketer.

Wednesday's chemistry prize was the first time this year that the Nobel committee reached all three winners ahead of the formal announcement. 

Here's how some of this year's winners found out:




When Associated Press photographer Lindsey Wasson knocked on the door of Mary E. Brunkow's Seattle home around 4 a.m. local time Monday, it was the scientist's dog who woke up first. Zelda's barking roused Brunkow's husband, Ross Colquhoun.

“I don't think he really knew what I was there for,” Wasson said. “And I said, ‘You know, sir, I think your wife just won the Nobel Prize.'”

Wasson's photographs captured Colquhoun waking up Brunkow and telling her the life-changing news: She was among three winners sharing the 2025 medicine prize.

“Don't be ridiculous,” she told her husband.

But it was true. The trio had, in research dating back two decades, uncovered a key pathway the body uses to keep the immune system in check, called peripheral immune tolerance. Experts called the findings critical to understanding autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

The following day, AP photographers Mark J. Terrill and Damian Dovarganes headed to Santa Barbara, California, to find physicist John Martinis before the sun rose. His wife, Jean, answered the door and told them to come back later: Martinis needed to sleep.

“For many years, we would stay up on the night the physics award was announced,” she told the photographers. “At some point we just decided, that's nuts. We'll figure it out if it's happening, but let's just get our sleep.”

She added, laughing: “I was trying to think how I can introduce this. Like, ‘Do you think you should plan a trip to Sweden?”

She finally woke her husband up just before 6 a.m. local time (1300 GMT), telling him only that the AP wanted an interview.

“I kind of knew that the Nobel Prize announcements was this week, so I kind of put two and two together,” Martinis said later. “I opened my computer and looked under the Nobel Prize 2025 and saw my picture along with Michel Devoret and John Clarke. So I was kind of in shock.”

The trio won the physics prize for their research on the weird world of subatomic quantum tunneling that advances the power of everyday digital communications and computing.

Martinis will get that trip to Sweden. The Dec. 10 award ceremony is in Stockholm.

Everyone but Fred Ramsdell seemed to know he had just won the Nobel Prize in medicine.

Ramsdell was away on a backpacking trip Monday, driving through Yellowstone National Park with his wife and two dogs, Larkin and Megan. He kept his cellphone in airplane mode as he often does on family trips. 

As they drove through a small town hours later, his wife started screaming as notifications flooded her phone. She told him he'd just won the Nobel Prize in medicine alongside Brunkow and Shimon Sakaguchi.

“I said, ‘No, I didn't,'” Ramsdell told the AP in an interview the following day from his car. “She said, ‘Yes, you did. I have 200 text messages that say you won the Nobel Prize.'”

Later Monday, Ramsdell drove to a Montana hotel to connect to Wi-Fi and call friends and colleagues. He didn't speak with the Nobel committee to get their congratulations until midnight.

He said he was stunned and awed to receive the recognition. But he has no plans to change his phone habits, which he says are important for work-life balance.

The Nobel Committee calls the winners shortly before the formal announcement is made. Some ignore the Swedish number — like Brunkow, who assumed the pre-dawn call was spam.

When his phone rang Wednesday, chemistry winner Susumu Kitagawa was skeptical. He said he answered “rather bluntly, thinking it must be yet one of those telemarketing calls I'm getting a lot recently.”

The Nobel announcements continue with the literature prize Thursday. Will that winner pick up the phone?

Sen Tim Kaine, D-Va., tells reporters he stands behind Jay Jones amid violent text messages unearthed last week.

FIRST ON FOX: The largest individual donor to Jay Jones' flailing attorney general campaign in Virginia is a billionaire heiress who has backed a variety of left-wing candidates and causes along with a recent massive donation backing socialist NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani.

Elizabeth ""Liz"" Simons, the daughter of the late billionaire hedge fund manager James ""Jim"" Simons, donated a total of $750,000 to Jones' campaign over the past few months in four separate payments, campaign finance records show. 

The elder Simons founded the successful hedge fund Renaissance Technologies and built up a personal fortune worth $31.4 billion over the course of his lifetime while donating billions of that money to charity.

The donations from his daughter are likely to face increased scrutiny after Jones was the subject of a National Review report on Friday that exposed text messages he sent fantasizing about shooting a Republican colleague, former Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert, in the head and suggesting his wife should have to watch his young ""fascist"" children die.

The texts compared Gilbert to mass murderers Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, adding that if he was given two bullets, he would use both against the GOP lawmaker to shoot him in the head.

The report has prompted Republicans in Virginia and across the country to call for Jones to drop out of the race, but as of Wednesday afternoon, he is still in the race as Democrats who endorsed him rally around his candidacy.

Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, who condemned the texts, said he is ""still a supporter"" of his campaign.

Fox News Digital reported on Tuesday that Mark Warner, the other Democratic senator in Virginia, also criticized Jones' ""appalling"" texts and said his behavior was ""inconsistent with the person I've known,"" but stopped short of calling for him to drop out of the race. His office did not respond to a request for comment on the $25,000 donation to Jones' campaign.

Jones has since apologized, calling the remarks ""embarrassing and shameful,"" and said he had reached out personally to Gilbert and his family.

In August, Simons gave $250,000 to a super PAC aligned with Mamdani and has been a prolific donor to a variety of Democratic campaigns and causes. 

FEC records reviewed by Fox News Digital show that she has given millions of dollars to the Senate Majority PAC, which has close ties to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the House Majority PAC, a fundraising operation aligned with House Democratic leadership. She also gave over $800,000 to a PAC that supported Kamala Harris' failed presidential campaign.

Simons, who joined her husband in forming the Heising-Simons Foundation in 2007 to bankroll left-wing environmentalist, education, and social policy causes, has recently made donations to Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff's campaign, over $100,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and over $40,000 to the Democratic National Committee.

Her family foundation is also a member of at least two gun control advocacy organizations, including Fund for a Safer Future and Hope and Heal Fund, which are both controlled by the New Venture Fund, according to the Capital Research Center's InfluenceWatch.

Fox News Digital reached out to Simons for comment, but did not receive a response by press time.

Hakeem Jeffries slammed President Trump's behavior as ""unhinged"" and ""unreasonable"" amid the ongoing government shutdown, when pressed on the president's meme video depicting the House Minority leader in a sombrero. 

A moderate House Democrat is splitting from his party leader on a compromise to extend enhanced ObamaCare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of this year.

The subsidies have been a key demand for Democrats in exchange for their support for legislation to end the government shutdown.

Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., is among the House Democrats backing a bipartisan bill aimed at extending those tax credits for one year.

But House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., called a one-year extension a ""laughable proposition"" in comments to reporters on Tuesday. 

Suozzi, who also backs a permanent extension, said both sides need to begin negotiating at some point, even without a perfect solution.

""A one-year extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits is not acceptable. It's a nonstarter,"" Jeffries said, referring to ObamaCare.

""What world are these MAGA extremists living in right now to think that Democrats are going to go along with a one-year extension from a group of people, meaning the Republicans, who just permanently extended massive tax breaks for their billionaire donors?""

But it's not just Republicans pushing that bill — the legislation has 11 total Democrat co-sponsors out of 25 total supporters.

Suozzi told Fox News Digital in response to Jeffries' rejection: ""Republicans and Democrats both need to step up to the negotiating table.""

""This bill isn't perfect — I'd prefer a permanent extension, and I'd gladly settle for a multi-year one — but right now, our priority must be stopping the massive health insurance premium hikes set to hit mailboxes in less than a month,"" Suozzi said.

""We can't afford to remain in a stalemate, each side waiting for the other to blink.""

A spokesman for Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, another co-sponsor of the bill, pointed Fox News Digital to comments the Democrat made on his Substack days before the shutdown.

""Our bipartisan bill would extend the credits by one year. Our coalition already includes 12 House Republicans — an essential bloc of support for passing a bill in the GOP-controlled House. And Senate Republicans are already interested in a deal, too,"" Golden wrote in those comments.

""As we negotiate, I see two sides who genuinely want to get to ‘yes,' which gives me hope that we can avert price spikes and coverage losses in January. A government shutdown only jeopardizes that work.""

Golden was the lone House Democrat to vote for the GOP-led bill to avert a government shutdown last month.

The bill, called a continuing resolution (CR), would keep federal funding levels roughly flat through Nov. 21, while including added spending for national officials' security amid the heightened political threat environment.

But Democrats, furious at being sidelined in federal funding talks, have largely said they'll reject any deal that does not include an extension of the expiring ObamaCare subsidies.

Suozzi and several other Democrats supporting the one-year extension are also co-sponsors on legislation that would permanently extend the enhanced ObamaCare subsidies.

The office of Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., pointed out to Fox News Digital that he was also a co-sponsor of that bill but refused to comment on the one-year bill or Jeffries' dismissal of it.

But that bill is likely a nonstarter for GOP leaders in Congress, who say that some reform is needed to the system if those healthcare credits are to be extended.

Fox News Digital reached out to the remaining eight co-sponsors of the one-year extension bill but did not receive a response to Jeffries' comments by press time.

FOX Business' Cheryl Casone joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the Trump administration weighing withholding back pay as the government remains closed and key strategies for retirement. 

Senate Democrats blocked Republicans' bid to reopen the government for a sixth time on Wednesday as pressure and threats from the White House increased.

It's been ""Groundhog Day"" in the Senate for eight days — but unlike the 1993 Bill Murray comedy, there's been little, if any, forward progress among the cast of senators. Talks are still ongoing, but those have yet to take the leap to full-blown negotiations to end the government shutdown. 

The night before the vote Wednesday morning, a bipartisan group of lawmakers met to discuss the shutdown, and a way out, over Thai food in Washington.

SENATE STALLS ON SHUTDOWN VOTE AMID WARNING FURLOUGHED WORKERS MAY LOSE PAY

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said the group's goal was to find a way to reopen the government and keep it open, rather than repeat the same cycle when funding runs out again Nov. 21.

""We're not working on a solution to reopen the government. We're not negotiating. We have a clean CR they've got to accept,"" Mullin said. ""Our whole goal is, how do we avoid, if we do reopen it, how do we avoid shutdown.""

Congressional Republicans are adamant that the best path forward is to pass their continuing resolution (CR), which would keep the government open until Nov. 21, add millions to bolster member security and include a fix to Washington, D.C.'s budget that was overlooked by the House earlier this year.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., intends to keep putting the same bill on the floor and hopes that fractures form within the Democratic caucus' unified front. So far, however, only three Senate Democratic caucus members have split from the larger group: Sens. John Fetterman, D-Pa., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Angus King, I-Maine.

But Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have made the fight to reopen the government about healthcare, specifically through the blunt instrument of expiring tax credits under Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

""Nothing's changed,"" Thune said. ""We all understand, you know what they want to do, and we're not averse, as I've said repeatedly, to have that conversation. At some point, they have to take ‘yes' for an answer.""

SENATE REPUBLICANS CONFIRM MORE THAN 100 TRUMP NOMINEES AS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN CONTINUES

While the credits don't expire until the end of the year, Democrats argue that come the start of open enrollment on Nov. 1, Americans who rely on the subsidies will see a sharp increase in their premium costs unless Congress acts.

""We believe that the pressure that the American people are putting on the Republicans, which are already seeing signs of cracking, are going to get them to come to the table, and we can negotiate a good deal for the American people,"" Schumer said.

But their ask isn't totally one-dimensional, either. Their counter-proposal to the GOP's CR laid out in sharper terms that they want a permanent extension to the Obamacare subsidies, to see guardrails put on President Donald Trump's ability to claw back funding through the rescissions and impoundments process, along with a full repeal of the ""big, beautiful bill's"" healthcare title and the return of canceled funding for NPR and PBS.

""Listen, this is a unique moment, a unique moment where we can demand that we're only going to vote for a budget that helps our people and stops the lawlessness,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said. ""I want the ACA subsidies restored, but I also would be a sucker to vote for a budget that allows Trump to continue to get away with this level of corruption and allows him to just cancel the spending in the bill for states like Connecticut.""

Lingering in the background are the threats from the administration led by Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought. He has already withheld nearly $30 billion in infrastructure funding for blue cities and states, and through a pair of memos, ordered agency layoffs and suggested furloughed workers may not receive back pay.

The latter move runs counter to a law signed by President Donald Trump guaranteeing back pay for furloughed workers after the 2019 shutdown, the longest in U.S. history.

While firings were thought to be around the corner, Trump appeared to give some breathing room on the issue on Tuesday.

""I'll be able to tell you that in four or five days,"" Trump told reporters. ""If this keeps going on, it'll be substantial, and a lot of those jobs will never come back, but you're going to have a lot closer to a balanced budget.""

Still, Senate Democrats remained unfazed by the threats, particularly the latest of workers going without back pay.

""I'm not sure Trump's floating it,"" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said. ""He's got underlings who were floating submarining one of Donald Trump's accomplishments. It was Donald Trump that made that guarantee when he signed the bill in January 2019, and now he's got functionaries in OMB suggesting they may go back on what he promised. I hope he takes pride in his work.""

The 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts discuss the latest on the feud between Gov. JB Pritzker and the Trump administration over the presence of federal troops amid the illegal immigration crackdown. 

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker accused President Donald Trump of being a ""man who's suffering dementia"" in their escalating feud over National Guard deployment in his state — despite the Democrat once backing former President Joe Biden's mental fitness. 

Texas National Guard troops arrived in Illinois on Tuesday to protect federal personnel and property amid anti-immigration protests, the Pentagon confirmed. A Pentagon official said 200 guardsmen were mobilized for an initial 60-day period. 

""This is a man who's suffering dementia,"" Pritzker said Tuesday about Trump, according to The Chicago Tribune. ""This is a man who has something stuck in his head. He can't get it out of his head. He doesn't read. He doesn't know anything that's up to date. It's just something in the recesses of his brain that is effectuating to have him call out these cities."" 

""And then, unfortunately, he has the power of the military, the power of the federal government to do his bidding, and that's what he's doing,"" Pritzker reportedly added.

The sharp criticism comes after Pritzker defended Biden following the release of a report from Special Counsel Robert Hur in February 2024 that described the former president as a ""sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.""  

""I smell a rat,"" Pritzker was quoted as telling reporters the day after Hur's report was made public. 

""It was extremely unfair for a Trump appointee, originally to the Department of Justice, to offer his own opinions about the mental acuity or age of the President of the United States,"" Pritzker added, according to Politico. 

Pritzker further defended Biden's fitness to serve. 

""I've been with the President of the United States many times, he is on the ball,"" Pritzker said at a press conference in February 2024, according to WLS-TV. ""The man knows more than most of us have forgotten. He knows so much more because he's been in government for a number of years and has served in important positions.""

Biden later dropped his re-election bid in July after a disastrous debate performance against Trump. Biden's own party quietly ceded to concerns over his fitness, mental competency and overall strength as a candidate as fallout from the debate overtook conversation on the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill.

At a time Pritzker was being floated as potentially joining the Democratic ticket and was holding speaking engagements in battleground states, the Illinois governor released a statement on Biden's decision to withdraw from the race. 

""President Joe Biden has dedicated his life in service to this nation, and its citizens are all the better for it. His is a storied political career culminating in one of the most accomplished and effective presidencies of our lifetime,"" Pritzker said at the time. He praised Biden as having ""restored dignity to the Oval Office, bringing the statesmanship and honor that have been the hallmarks of his years of service, back to the White House."" 

He also attacked Trump, adding, ""We must not ignore the threat posed by Donald Trump's potential return to the White House,"" according to WMAQ-TV. Trump went on to win the November election. 

PRITZKER SUES TRUMP TO BLOCK NATIONAL GUARD ACTION IN ILLINOIS 

An X account affiliated with the Trump White House on Tuesday called Pritzker ""one SICK scumbag,"" sharing a clip of his recent interview with WGN. 

""What I know is, in the early days of Nazi regime, they started slowly but surely taking away people's rights. And what we are seeing now is the very same thing. They have gone into cities now with the military,"" Pritzker said in the clip posted on X by the White House Rapid Response team. ""Think about that — in your lifetime have you ever seen anything like that? Where the President of the United States is sending military or troops dressed as military — ICE and CBP — in camouflage, with automatic weapons, into our major cities? It's wrong.""

The White House Rapid Response team said Pritzker ""calls President Trump a Nazi — fomenting more deranged violence from his Radical Left lunatic supporters."" 

Trump on Wednesday said on Truth Social that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson should be jailed for not defending ICE agents. The White House provided Fox News Digital with a statement elaborating on the president's post, noting that 30 people were shot, five of whom died, in Chicago last week alone, yet ""these Trump-Deranged buffoons would rather allow the violence to continue and attack the President for wanting to help make their city safe again."" 

The White House did not immediately address Pritzker's specific ""dementia"" comment about Trump.

Fox News Digital also reached out to Pritzker's office for comment but did not immediately hear back.

Fox News correspondent Steve Harrigan reports from Moscow on Russia's violations of NATO airspace on 'Fox News Sunday.'

It's time to take on Russia's ""hybrid warfare"" by openly acknowledging the threat and deterring future provocation, European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday. 

The president of the European Commission highlighted that in just the last two weeks, Russian drones and warplanes have violated the airspace of six European nations, scrambling jets, grounding commercial flights and posing a direct threat to EU citizens.

""One incident may be a mistake. Two incidents a coincidence,"" von der Leyen said while speaking to the EU's parliament. ""But three, five, 10 – this is a deliberate and targeted gray zone campaign against Europe, and Europe must respond.""

NATO ALLIES CLASH AFTER RUSSIAN JETS BREACH AIRSPACE, TESTING ALLIANCE RESOLVE

The EU chief said these aerial threats are just the latest in a string of kinetic and non-kinetic Russian attacks that have targeted undersea cables, airports, logistics hubs and elections across the continent using direct force as well as cyber-based aggression.

""These incidents are calculated to linger in the twilight of deniability,"" von der Leyen said. ""This is not random harassment. It is a coherent and escalating campaign to unsettle our citizens, test our resolve, divide our union and weaken our support for Ukraine, and it is time to call it by its name. 

""This is hybrid warfare, and we have to take it very serious,"" she said.

Von der Leyen said much has already been set in motion to better take on Russia's growing aggression, including the mobilization of nearly $930 billion in defense expenditures through 2030 – which she said is the largest ""surge of defense spending in the history of the Union.""

But the EU chief said more needs to be done, including promoting a ""new mindset"" when it comes to EU security among the public.

TRUMP 'DRAMATICALLY' CHANGES TUNE ON UKRAINE BUT EXPERTS CAUTION PUTIN IS STILL WAITING FOR ACTION

""Tackling Russia's hybrid war is not only about traditional defense, it is about software for drones. It is about spare parts for pipelines. It is about rapid cyber response teams, and it is about public information campaigns to spread awareness,"" she said. ""We must be ready to leave our comfort zone.""

Nations like Germany are already taking new action to counter Russia's gray zone tactics, and on Wednesday German lawmakers paved the way for local police forces to be granted permission to shoot down drones. 

The plan, championed by German Chancellor Frederick Merz on Wednesday, still needs to be approved by the nation's parliament, but comes less than a week after planes were grounded at the Munich airport over nearby drone sightings.

""Drone incidents threaten our security,"" Merz said in a post on X. ""We will not permit that. We are strengthening the Federal Police's powers so that drones can be detected and countered more quickly in the future.""

Local reporting earlier this week also noted that laser systems have been installed to better locate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) sightings after several incidents involving drones disrupted airports across Europe in recent months.

Police arrested a New Jersey man in Washington, D.C., on Sunday who was accused of stashing over 200 “fully functional” grenades in his tent. 

Louis Geri, who appeared to be homeless, was apprehended outside St. Matthew's Cathedral in Northwest Washington hours before an annual Red Mass ceremony marking the start of the Supreme Court's fall term, according to authorities. Police said they discovered the destructive devices inside his tent, backpack, and pockets as they cleared the space outside the church early Sunday morning. 

Geri was also found with documents showing animosity toward Jews, Catholics, Supreme Court members, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to records. 

Geri planned to use modified bottle rockets to detonate them from a distance, according to documents seen by ABC 7. Police said he threatened to kill them and detonate the grenades as they attempted to clear the area around the cathedral over the weekend. 

“You might want to stay back and call the federales, I have explosives,” Geri told officers when he was asked to leave the area, according to court records.

“Do you want me to throw one out? I'll test one out in the street. I have a hundred plus of them,” the suspect said. “If you just step back, I'll throw one in the street, no one will get hurt, there will be a hole in the street. … If you just step back, I'll take out that tree. No one will get hurt, there will just be a hole where that tree used to be.”

“Several of your people are going to die from one of these,” Geri told police as they warned him he would be removed. 

GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN SEEPS INTO NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR'S CONTEST WITH HUDSON TUNNEL PROJECT STALLED

The FBI is reviewing the items found on Geri, who has been charged with possession of a destructive device and false report of a weapon of mass destruction. He is being held in jail without bond. 

The incident is the latest of targeted threats against religious institutions, including shootings at a Catholic church in Minneapolis and a Mormon church in Michigan. Three were killed at Minnesota's Annunciation Church in August. Four died after a gunman targeted the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc last month.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Independent Angus King sticks with Republicans in sixth failed shutdown vote","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3842136/senate-sixth-government-funding-vote-fails-king/","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:26:00 GMT","

Sen. Angus King (I-ME) voted with Republicans on Wednesday for the continuing resolution to reopen the government, denying Democrats a symbolic win on the eighth day of the shutdown.

King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, had been wavering on his vote, expressing frustration with Republicans' refusal to negotiate with Democrats over expiring Obamacare subsidies.

But he returned to the rationale that first led him to side with the GOP, warning that a shutdown ceded too much authority to President Donald Trump as he threatens mass layoffs and the cancellation of projects in blue states.

White House budget director Russ Vought fanned those concerns on Tuesday with a draft memo that argued furloughed workers were not entitled to back pay.

“The power that the president and OMB and Vought and Miller are exercising under the shutdown is a real threat to our country,” King told reporters ahead of the vote, referring to White House policy adviser Stephen Miller.

“I would very much like to get this ACA thing resolved. I think that's important,” King continued. “I think the Republicans should step up and help us do that. But in the end, we got to get this shutdown over with because I think the worst is yet to come.”

His vote leaves Democrats no closer to extracting healthcare concessions, chief among them the extension of Obamacare tax credits that expire at the end of the year.

In a 54-45 vote, King and two Democrats voted for a “clean” GOP bill that keeps the government operating through Nov. 21, the same number who previously supported the proposal on the Senate floor.

The vote lent bipartisan support to the measure, with Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) and John Fetterman (D-PA) joining King, but fell short of the 60 needed to overcome the filibuster.

A Democrat-led funding proposal that extends the Obamacare subsidies and rolls back Medicaid changes in Trump's tax law also failed in a separate vote held minutes earlier.

Wednesday marks the sixth time the Senate has voted on the GOP funding measure, which passed the House last month largely along party lines.

Republicans hoped the repeated votes would exert pressure on retiring or centrist members seen as willing to break with Democratic leadership, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has managed to keep his caucus largely in lockstep.

Democrats are asking for a permanent extension of the subsidies but have so far been unable to get a GOP commitment that they will be extended at all. The Republican position is that talks can happen once the government reopens, though there are informal, rank-and-file conversations occurring to end the impasse.

Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK), an adviser to Senate GOP leadership, met with a bipartisan group of lawmakers on Tuesday night to discuss the shutdown, telling reporters the talks are a “directive” from the president.

“Our position as Republicans hasn't changed of a clean CR, it's what happens next,” Mullin said. “What's the point of reopening for five weeks now, and we shut back down the 21st?”

Separately, Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME), the chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, has been speaking with colleagues about a “discussion draft” that supports negotiating an extension of the Obamacare subsidies once the government is reopened.

There are several other Democrats whom Republicans view as swayable, but the actions of Vought, the White House budget chief, have deepened Democratic opposition to ending the shutdown.

“It would be a lot easier to resolve the situation if Russ Vought would stop talking,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) said Tuesday after the budget office floated draft guidance to bar furloughed employees from back pay.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former FBI Director James Comey will be arraigned on two felony counts in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on Wednesday. News reports indicate that he is charged with obstruction and lying to Congress about a scheme to leak information to the press about an FBI investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton‘s use of a computer server to store government documents illegally. To the surprise of many, the charges against Comey aren't related to anything he did to President Donald Trump.

I certainly don't know if Comey is guilty of the crimes with which he has been charged. As a defense attorney, I always stand by the fundamental American legal principle that every criminal defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt before an impartial judge or jury of his peers.

COMEY WON'T APPEAR BEFORE HOUSE OVERSIGHT, DENIES KNOWLEDGE OF EPSTEIN FILES

But the rhetoric from the liberal media and Comey's defenders is dripping with irony. Legacy media has gone so far as to cheer and applaud career prosecutors for nailing manifestos to their office walls, declaring the end of impartial justice and the collapse of the American legal system.

The pearl clutching is so tight that these fired prosecutors should be thankful that blood pressure medicine is covered under their new COBRA health plan.“Selective prosecution,” they scream out on MSNBC.“Comey Indictment Shows Danger of Subservient Prosecutors,” writes liberal Joyce Vance.“Trump's Threat to Justice: Comey and the Politics of Prosecution,” writes former prosecutor James Zirin.They call the indictment a stain on the judicial system. I call their analysis selective amnesia. Just 16 months ago, I sat in an old, cold New York City courtroom alongside now-Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and now-Judge Emil Bove to defend Trump, then the presumptive Republican nominee, in a criminal prosecution brought by a partisan elected Democrat district attorney.

One of the district attorney's lead lawyers on the prosecution team had been handpicked from the top ranks of the Biden Justice Department. The jury of Trump's peers was a pool of citizens who had voted over 90% for Joe Biden in the 2020 election. And the judge's daughter literally worked for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's political opponent. 

It's funny, I don't recall seeing many manifestos posted to office doors or hearing much from the media and establishment then about “selective prosecution” and the collapse of the judicial system.

When we moved for dismissal of the criminal charges against Trump on the grounds of selective and vindictive prosecution, our arguments were ridiculed as frivolous and laughed at by the D.C. establishment. Back then, the rhetoric of the day was “Nobody is above the law,” “Justice is coming to Trump,” and the always famous “Lock him up!”

While serving as one of Trump's defense attorneys, I watched numerous judges refuse and prosecutors openly mock our selective prosecution argument, time and time again. Here's a timeline: 

But now, when James Comey's attorneys and the so-called “legal experts” make similar claims, the legacy press treats it as not only credible, but compelling. It's not.

GRAND JURY INDICTS FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY

What criminal charge does Comey face? A criminal charge that has nothing to do with Trump. Who is the likely federal judge overseeing the case? A gentleman who was appointed by Biden. What kind of jury pool will he face? A group of people who will likely be 50% Republican and 50% Democratic. Who is his defense attorney? A former senior U.S. attorney and former partner at America's top law firm, Skadden.

The liberal media and the anti-Trump legal establishment aren't fooling anyone. Their proxy outrage over the Comey indictment is a mere symptom of their continued disdain for the duly elected 45th and 47th president.

The co-directors of the new PBS series describe how they made a documentary about a war distant in time and shrouded in myth.

Listen to more stories on hark

On June 24, 1778, a total solar eclipse covered a wide swath of North America—from the Pacific Coast of Mexico to Virginia's Eastern Shore. The eclipse occurred just a few days before the Battle of Monmouth, when George Washington's Continental Army engaged General Sir Henry Clinton's British Army—a standoff that nevertheless allowed the Patriots to claim a much-needed victory. The British, meanwhile, continued their retreat from Philadelphia to New York City. We wanted to depict this eclipse for our series The American Revolution, and in this we had a stroke of luck: There would be a total solar eclipse across much of North America on April 8, 2024.

Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.

Filming the eclipse would be technically complicated, and if we were hampered by clouds or anything else—if we failed to get the shot—there could be no second take. (The next such eclipse in the United States will occur in 2044.) Our crew headed north from New York City, armed with four cameras. Three would be pointed at the sky and the fourth at the sun's reflection on water. The exposure was going to change wildly in the course of the eclipse, and totality would last only a few minutes. We had intended to film in western New York, in what had been Seneca Country in 1778. But changing weather forecasts pushed us to consider other locations, and we ended up far to the east, in the Adirondacks. Somehow, everything worked out, and the footage we got is some of the most stunning camerawork in the series.

Challenging though it was, filming the eclipse was in one sense easy: We knew when and where it was going to happen, and we knew the effect would be powerful. Endeavoring to make a 12-hour documentary on a subject that predates the invention of photography, and whose sources are written in an 18th-century vernacular, was in other respects a daunting mission. For our series on World War II and the Vietnam War, we could talk with living witnesses and access archival footage. We had tens of thousands of photographs from the Civil War. The American Revolution had none of those elements.

Our subject was also complicated by the myths that enveloped it. Generations of Americans have wrestled with the meaning and reality of the American Revolution, our national origin story. Even in 1783, John Adams knew how hard it would be to tell that story. “It would require the whole of the longest Life,” he warned a French historian, “to assemble from all the Nations and Parts of the Globe” all of the documentary materials needed “to form a compleat History of the American War, because it is nearly the History of Mankind for the whole Epocha of it.” The French historian never wrote the book.

As the historian Maya Jasanoff points out in the film, coming to terms with the Revolutionary War is an almost impossible task. The stakes are so high, the events so complex, the mythology so entrenched, “that it has made the way that Americans think about this period very unreal and detached.”

The challenges of making the documentary, by contrast, were quite concrete. We tried to capture the lives of the millions of people the Revolution affected—to make the uncertainties of their time palpable and vivid, even though we all know the outcome, and to represent faithfully the circumstances in which so many people chose to fight for and against the Revolution. This work led us to new perspectives on the fundamental questions about the founding: What is the role of government? What responsibilities come with the privilege of citizenship? What would I be willing to risk in the service of my country and my principles? What am I willing to die for?

By January 2024, Philadelphia had gone almost two years without an inch of snow on a single day. For many people, this was a welcome relief. For our team, it was a big problem. The Pennsylvania State House (now Independence Hall) was the Patriot seat of government for much of the war, and Congress stayed in session there through several winters. We had already filmed winter scenes in Deerfield, Massachusetts; Valley Forge, Pennsylvania; and Ticonderoga, New York, among other locales. But the winters of the Revolution were notoriously harsh, and the film wouldn't be complete without more snow.

With a major winter storm expected to hit the East Coast from the Chesapeake Bay to the Canadian border on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and the following Tuesday, we quickly mobilized. There was an obstacle: Historic sites would be closed for the long weekend, and their staff hard to reach. We had to plan everything overnight, get permits ironed out, and send four camera crews in four different directions: to Providence, Rhode Island; Charlestown, New Hampshire; Tivoli, New York; and Philadelphia.

We came back with beautiful footage—and a realization. The East Coast's ever-changing, unpredictable climate was at times our most unanticipated and vexing adversary in bringing the story of the Revolution to life. Even with all the benefits of modern weather forecasting, along with plowed roads and airport deicing, we were still at its mercy. That constant challenge made what Washington and the American soldiers faced during their war all the more remarkable to consider. Weather guided the course of the Revolution far more than it guided our production.

Eliot A. Cohen: The secret of George Washington's revolutionary success

“Turns of weather that we know are coming for weeks on end hit the people of the 18th century completely by surprise,” the writer Nathaniel Philbrick explains. “They're not just fighting each other. In a profound way, they are fighting the American climate and geography and topography.”

Weather became an unexpected and unheralded character in deciding battle after battle: What an American private called an “outrageous” storm contributed to the Continental Army's doomed assault on Quebec City in 1775; what the historian Rick Atkinson describes as a “providential fog” saved Washington's army by allowing it to escape to Manhattan after the disastrous Battle of Long Island in 1776.

Weather was not the only unpredictable natural force at play. From 1775 to 1783, far more people succumbed to disease than died in combat. Typhus, typhoid, dysentery, and, worst of all, smallpox—that “dread disease of humanity,” as the historian Colin G. Calloway calls it—incubated in fetid army camps before spreading across the continent. Even people far from the battlefield—on the Pacific Coast, in Spanish Mexico, and in the Caribbean—suffered from the war through famine or epidemic. Few in North America were untouched by the Revolution.

The process of filmmaking brought an intimate understanding of geography as well as weather. Archival maps are works of art, and we use many in the film. They told us where troops were positioned and what commanders were thinking as they drew up their plans; they also staggered us with their beauty. Those maps marked how battles played out and where campaigns went wrong. They recorded patterns of settlement and made wildly speculative claims to western lands. But we had to be careful about how we used them, because those maps reflected their makers' point of view. Sometimes cartographers were working with bad information, and sometimes they intentionally misrepresented reality. “Maps at the time show the colonies extending well into the interior,” the scholar Maggie Blackhawk points out. “They're aspirational, in many ways. They're an argument rather than a conclusion.”

To account for discrepancies in the cartographic record, we created more than 100 new maps for the series and spent years ensuring their accuracy. The challenges were many; far more than borders have been altered since 1775. Dams have redirected waterways, and rivers have changed course all on their own. Kaskaskia, Illinois, for instance, today lies on the western side of the Mississippi River, the opposite bank from where it stood when George Rogers Clark claimed it for the United States, in 1778. Coastal cities have spent the centuries reclaiming land by filling in marshes. A bird's-eye view of 21st-century Boston does not much resemble one from the Revolutionary period, when the Back Bay was still a bay. Major arteries on the modern map, such as the Erie Canal, hadn't yet been dug, so we had to erase them.

Though we expected to have little to go on when recharting 18th-century eastern North America, old maps and other documentation gave us hundreds of places where people lived in 1775. But amassing those data from various sources and plotting them accurately on our new maps was a much bigger undertaking than we had imagined. North America changed rapidly in the second half of the 18th century as more people arrived from Europe or were taken forcibly from Africa and the settler population pushed farther into Indian Country. We hired the geographer Charles E. Frye, who scanned data from hundreds of archival maps and placed them over modern maps based on satellite imagery, correcting for changes in topography and hydrography, as well as the imprecision of the original mapmakers. Our resulting maps show North America as it was. The 13 colonies have no drawn western borders, reflecting ongoing boundary disputes and a moving line of settlement. Native nations across the continent, and especially those that shared a frontier with the early United States, are prominently marked, while Cherokee, Shawnee, Delaware, and Haudenosaunee towns have as visible a place as many settler towns in Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Quebec.

Lindsay Chervinsky: The ‘dirty and nasty people' who became Americans

At the time of the Revolution, “70–80 percent of the continent is still controlled by Indigenous people—politically, economically, and militarily,” the historian Michael Witgen notes. “It's not a separate place. It's not this timeless space where Native people are sort of existing in harmony with nature and that they have no interest in the outside world. Native people want the good stuff that Europeans are bringing. Europeans want the wealth that they can get from Native people. Native powers are as important to the global market economy as a place like Virginia or a place like New York.”

“The small scale of our maps deceived us,” a Londoner wrote as the war entered its third year, “and, as the word ‘America' takes up no more room than the word ‘Yorkshire,' we seem to think the territories they represent are much of the same bigness, though Charleston is as far from Boston as London from Venice.” The Londoner drew an unwelcome conclusion: “We have undertaken a war against farmers and farmhouses, scattered through a wild waste of continent.”

Armies carried their destruction across the former colonies, over the mountains to Cherokee and Haudenosaunee lands, onto the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, south along the Gulf Coast, into Florida, and north to Canada. After France and later Spain and the Netherlands entered the war with Great Britain, navies brought it to the West Indies, Western Europe, the Mediterranean, even India.

The American Revolution was a world war fought in the age of sail. Thousands of miles separated its theaters of action, and coordinating campaigns at that distance proved a nightmare. The post roads and sea lanes, typical avenues of communication in peacetime, were under constant threat during the war. Many letters were intercepted or lost. Even unimpeded transmissions could carry orders only as fast as the fastest horse or the quickest ship. It took weeks at best for the British high command in London to get news from North America, and their orders heading west, unaided by the Gulf Stream, took even longer. In 1775, people in England didn't even know there was a war until 40 days after “the shot heard round the world.”

In 1781, American and French armies had to walk hundreds of miles in the heat of summer to get from Westchester County, New York, to Yorktown, Virginia. “It's hot and humid, and, as the French write, ‘infested by mosquitos,' ” the historian Iris de Rode observes. “They have to create bridges. They have to get obstacles out of the way. And we're not talking just about men marching. We have a lot of animals behind them. In order to not walk in the middle of the day, they start in the middle of the night. So it's pitch-dark. You're walking on little paths, probably quite muddy. And you just walk.”

The North American landscape itself became a star of the series. We filmed for 165 days at more than 150 locations in and outside the original 13 colonies, in every season, at every time of day, and from every vantage. We often reduce the East Coast to the I-95 corridor and easily dismiss its natural beauty—particularly within the megalopolis of asphalt, concrete, and steel between the Potomac and Merrimack Rivers. It's undeniable that we have paved over much of our past, but there's still grandeur to see, and we tried to capture as much of it as we could with our cameras. Filming pine trees on Maine's seacoast and palmettos off Charleston left us with stark reminders of North America's botanical diversity as well as its vastness.

The true protagonists of our series are, of course, the people who experienced the war, and we devoted much of our research to understanding the texture of their lives. There are oil-on-canvas portraits from the period, but they depict only a very small subset of society, people who had the time to sit for a painting and the means to pay for one. Because so few portraits were made, we can't know what most people looked like. But there's no shortage of first-person testimony from the Revolution. Even if someone's likeness died with them, their writing may have survived. Several times throughout the series, we put handwriting on the screen as evidence that these lesser-known characters had been alive too.

We pored over papers at historical societies, combed through old newspapers, exhausted museum catalogs. We got involved with online ancestry forums, stalked auction houses, cold-called collectors. Some of the portraits in our film are in private hands and haven't been on public display in decades, including understandably rare portraits of Benedict Arnold, a figure shunned by postwar American artists.

The central question was this: How could we understand the experiences of people who lived through our founding—not from our own perspective, but from theirs? “War in itself, however distant, is indeed terrible,” 16-year-old Betsy Ambler, of Yorktown, wrote when the British army invaded Virginia in 1781. “But when brought to our very doors—when those we most love are personally engaged in it, when our friends and neighbors are exposed to its ravages, when we know assuredly that without sacrificing many dear to us as our own lives, our country must remain subject to British tyrany—the reflection is indeed overwhelming.” We wanted the film to bring the audience closer to the reality of how North America felt and looked and sounded to the men, women, and children who waged and witnessed this war. These were real people, with real hopes and fears not so different from our own.

The commitment of reenactors and historical interpreters to this project was crucial. Their period-perfect, handsewn clothes are just the start. They have spent countless hours researching the lives of the people they give over their weekends to portraying. We were with reenactors on the battlefield, with blacksmiths at their forge, with weavers at their loom—anywhere our cameras could capture the scale of the war effort required to win independence. We worked with several reenactor groups throughout production, but the Jersey Greys most of all. They agreed to drill for us at night in a snowstorm, to march through deep mud, and to build what they believe to be the largest redoubt in North America, which gave us insight into how much work went into being a soldier.

Thousands of civilians followed armies during the Revolution. The soldiers were willing to cook food or mend clothes, but laundry, we learned, was mostly women's work. And clean clothes were a necessity, given the ever-present threat of disease. We filmed reenactors washing bloody garments, which is one of the very first shots in the first episode, and we return to that imagery at a key point in the series. “Imagine what a battlefield looks like after a battle,” the historian Kathleen DuVal says. “It has a lot of bodies. It has a lot of blood and gore. And it was the job of women to go in and take care of those bodies, to clean them up, to identify them, if they could, to see over the burial of bodies. Part of the work of war is dealing with death.”

The bloody civil war at the heart of the Revolutionary story was far beyond what we had previously appreciated. “The United States came out of violence,” Maya Jasanoff observes. Those seven words ought to be self-evident; a war is a war, after all. And yet, welcoming that idea can shock the system because our popular conception of the American Revolution is so often encased in bloodless, gallant myth. The real Revolution was a savage civil war: eight years of uncertainty, brutality, and terror that tore communities apart and left tremendous loss in their aftermath. That doesn't in any way diminish its inspiring outcome; it only underscores how much people were willing to sacrifice to create the United States.

One of the most astonishing aspects of the Revolutionary War, the historian Christopher L. Brown says, “is that you had such different places come together as one nation. I'm not sure there is a state, anywhere in the world, in the late 18th century, that has as wide variety of people who inhabit it.” And so, the nation “ends up cohering, not around culture, not around religion, not around ancient history. It was coming together around a set of purposes and ideals for one common cause.”

When the Revolution began, many American rebels had no intention of breaking with the British empire. They still wanted Parliament to leave them alone, to treat them with the same “salutary neglect” that had allowed previous generations of American colonists to flourish. Most of them still wanted to remain subjects of the British King. War would change that. To win, the Patriots would have to unite the colonies, declare American independence, promise more political participation to grow their coalition, secure French support, and ultimately create a government strong enough to function without jeopardizing individual rights and liberties. None of that was on the table from the start. The United States that emerged from the war was a nation no one could have imagined before the shooting began in April 1775.

The war changed how Americans thought about themselves, their connections with one another, and their relationship to their government. Understanding that—understanding the circumstances under which the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights were created—only reinforces the vitality of those founding documents.

By the end of the American Revolution, Betsy Ambler had lived for years as a refugee and lost her hometown forever. “The War,” she later remembered, “tho' it was to involve my immediate family in poverty and perplexity of every kind was in the end to lay the foundation of independence and prosperity for my Country, and what sacrifice would not an American, a Virginian, at the earliest age have made for so desirable an end?”

The American Revolution will air on PBS beginning November 16, 2025. This article appears in the November 2025 print edition with the headline “How Do You Film the Revolution?”

If you're a utility customer in the US, you've likely seen your rates go up this year.

Residents in at least 41 states and Washington, D.C., are experiencing increased electric and natural gas bills now or will see increases in 2026, according to a new report from the Center for American Progress.

Costs are rising largely due to the AI data center development boom and the resulting strain it has placed on the country's aging electric grid.

The good news is that, depending on which state you live in and your electricity provider, you might be able to lower your bill through energy conservation. The bad news is that simple steps such as unplugging devices and turning off the lights when exiting a room are ultimately no match for the pace of rising rates.

Data centers accounted for 4.4% of electricity consumption in the US in 2023, according to a report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. That amount is expected to triple by 2028.

Utilities across the country are predicting an additional 60 gigawatts of new demand from data centers by the end of the decade. That's enough electricity to power six major cities.

Major utilities are planning multibillion-dollar infrastructure projects to meet the enormous demand expected to come from AI. Existing regulations will allow much of those costs to be recovered from a utility's entire customer base.

In August, regulators in Louisiana approved Entergy's plans to spend $5 billion on three new natural gas plants needed to serve a massive Meta data center in the state. Consumer advocacy groups opposed the plan, arguing that average ratepayers would ultimately bear the cost for one of the world's largest companies. Similar battles are unfolding before utility regulators in states across the country.

""It's really creating tremendous stress for a huge segment of the population that struggles to pay those bills,"" said David Conn, head of business development and policy at Exceleron, an energy management software company.

If you've ever reviewed your energy bill, you may have noticed that many line items factor into a monthly total. While the amount of energy you use is supposed to be the largest part of the bill, utilities often tack on charges and service fees that don't have anything to do with individual consumption. Data centers are driving up the price of those additional charges, as well as the cost of electricity, making the energy you do consume more costly.

The bottom line: If you're a customer of a utility that also serves data centers, your bill is probably going to rise no matter how much energy you use.

""It's one of those things where consumers are fighting against an 800-pound gorilla, and that's a challenge,"" said Larry Paulhus, head of electric consulting at RINA North America.

Experts say that despite rising costs, there are steps consumers can take to make energy bills more manageable.

Arbor is part of an emerging class of new startups aiming to help.

Utility customers who live in one of the 14 states with a deregulated energy market can use Arbor's free app to find a different energy provider. Switching providers could shave 10% to 20% off monthly utility bills, said Owen Quinlan, Arbor's head of data.

Exceleron is another one. The company offers prepay programs for 75 utilities, including major providers like Georgia Power and Salt River Project in Arizona.

Prepay programs allow utility customers to pay their bills in advance, making them eligible for refunds later on if they consume less energy than they originally paid for. With Exceleron's software, customers can track how their daily energy consumption affects their bills, and adjust habits accordingly to lower the amount of their monthly bill.

It is difficult to know exactly how much money programs like these can save customers. There are many line items on an electric bill — such as costs for new transmission lines — that are out of an individual customer's control.

Reducing a home's energy consumption by 10% likely won't equate to a 10% lower bill, said Exceleron's Conn.

""It's probably going to be less than that, but every little bit helps,"" he said.

Natural gas prices are also on the rise right now, according to the US Energy Information Administration.

Curbing reliance on gas fuel can help lower energy bills in the long term, said Cooper Marcus, founder of QuitCarbon, who advises homeowners on energy management.

Replacing a gas boiler with an electric heat pump and installing solar panels on a home's roof can lead to significant long-term savings.

""These are not things that people do at once overnight, but that's okay,"" said Marcus. ""Homes last for decades. Our investment horizons should be decades.""

For people struggling to manage higher rates now, long-term solutions don't offer much relief.

""It's really understandable that people want some control over their expenses, and there are things that people can do to bring down those bills. It's just not realistic for so many people,"" said Sylvie Ashford, an analyst at The Utility Reform Network.

Ashford noted that in California, where TURN is based, 40% of the population are renters who can't install solar panels to reduce costs.

TURN is lobbying for utilities in the state to have spending caps tied to inflation, among other initiatives aimed at lowering consumer electricity bills.

""Legislators are paying attention, and a lot of them are reporting that the number one issue their constituents call them about is their rising utility bills,"" she said.

Federal authorities announced Wednesday that they have arrested and charged a Florida man with maliciously starting the deadly Palisades Fire, one of the most destructive blazes in Los Angeles history.

Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, is charged with destruction of property by means of fire, according to a release from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, which is prosecuting him.

Right after allegedly igniting the inferno early New Year's Day, Rinderknecht ""listened to a rap song, which has a music video that includes things being lit on fire,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office said.

""Rinderknecht listened to the song repeatedly in the prior days,"" the office said.

Rinderknecht, who previously lived in Pacific Palisades, California, was arrested on Tuesday in Florida.

The Melbourne resident is expected to appear in federal court in Orlando, Florida, later Wednesday.

The Palisades Fire in early January burned thousands of homes and killed 12 people as flames spread rapidly in heavy winds up to 100 miles per hour.

If Rinderknecht is convicted, he could face a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison and a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years.

Authorities said that witness statements, video surveillance, cellphone data, and analysis of fire dynamics and patterns at the scene showed that Rinderknecht maliciously set the Lachman Fire just after midnight on January 1 on land owned by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, an organization that received federal funding.

A week later, the same fire – which by then had become known as the Palisades Fire – burned federal property.

""The complaint alleges that a single person's recklessness caused one of the worst fires Los Angeles has ever seen, resulting in death and widespread destruction in Pacific Palisades,"" Acting L.A. U.S Attorney Bill Essayli said in a statement.

""While we cannot bring back what victims lost, we hope this criminal case brings some measure of justice to those affected by this horrific tragedy,"" Essayli said.

In a post on X, Essayli said evidence was found from Rinderknecht's digital devices that showed ""an image he generated on ChatGPT depicting a burning city.""

The destructive fire started on the evening of Dec. 31, when Rinderknecht had been working a shift as an Uber driver.

According to the release, two passengers he drove in separate rides later told law enforcement that they recalled Rinderknecht as ""agitated and angry.""

After Rinderknecht dropped off a passenger in the area, he drove to Skulls Rock trailhead, where he parked his car and tried to get in touch with a former friend, authorities said. He then walked up the trail and used his iPhone to take videos.

Shortly after midnight on Jan. 1, environmental sensing platforms indicated the Lachman Fire had started. In the following minutes, Rinderknecht called 911 several times, but since he was out of cellphone range was unable to get through, according to the release.

By the time he connected with 911 and reported the fired, he had arrived at the end of the hiking trail, the release said. A resident had already reported the fire at that point.

""Rinderknecht then fled in his car, passing fire engines driving in the opposite direction,"" the release said.

Authorities said he then turned around and sped up to follow the fire engines to the scene, where he recorded more videos of the scene from his phone.

Law enforcement interviewed Rinderknecht on Jan. 24.

He allegedly lied about where he had been when he first saw the Lachman Fire, claiming ""he was near the bottom of a hiking trail when he first saw the fire and called 911.""

""But geolocation data from his iPhone carrier showed that he was standing in a clearing 30 feet from the fire as it rapidly grew,"" according to the news release.

In this article

CoreWeave shares rose as much as 8% Wednesday as the artificial intelligence cloud provider announced new tools to help programmers develop AI agents.

With the new serverless reinforcement learning service, there's no need to worry about adding or removing computing power, because it happens automatically.

Tests indicated that when developers use CoreWeave's new service, they can train models faster with 40% lower costs in comparison with running Nvidia H100 graphics processing units locally, ""with no impact on model quality,"" according to a statement.

Reinforcement learning is a decades-old approach that involves evolving systems through trial and error to improve outcomes over time.

The launch comes five months after CoreWeave paid $1 billion to acquire Weights and Biases, a startup targeting developers with software for training and evaluating AI models. The deal is an effort to complement CoreWeave's existing business of renting out Nvidia graphics processing units to companies that need infrastructure to operate models.

Companies have been rushing to secure GPUs to implement AI projects. In the cloud, CoreWeave competes with leading providers such as Amazon Web Services, although some companies will want to keep GPUs in their own data centers.

Demand has been ramping. 

Two weeks ago, CoreWeave said OpenAI agreed to expand a multi-year deal by up to $6.5 billion, and last week, the cloud company said Meta committed to spending $14.2 billion.

In July, it announced plans to buy data center infrastructure provider Core Scientific, a longtime partner, for $9 billion. Some Core Scientific shareholders are seeking a more favorable deal and are recommending that it be voted down in its current state. A revision to the acquisition offer does not appear likely.

""Really, under no circumstances will we readdress the bid that we put out,"" Mike Intrator, CoreWeave's co-founder and CEO, told Bloomberg on Tuesday.

New Jersey-based CoreWeave went public on Nasdaq in March.

WATCH: CoreWeave is an at scale AI pure play with accelerating revenue growth, says Evercore ISI's Daryanani

Gold topped $4,000 for first time ever earlier this week.

The growing aversion to large reserve currencies, including the dollar, has been propelling the record rallies in gold and Bitcoin — and the trend will go on, according to Eurizon SLJ Capital Limited.

Gold topped $4,000 for first time ever earlier this week and Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high over the weekend, suggesting the rallies are driven by “a common factor,” strategists at Eurizon wrote Wednesday. Reserve currency issuers at central banks have been “printing money like mad,” pushing investors to look for alternatives, they said.

Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to capture investor interest, while the broader altcoin market struggles to keep pace, creating a divergence that experts believe is a result of the markets maturing. 

While major assets like Ethereum, XRP, and Solana have notched double-digit year-to-date gains, the performance across the rest of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization has been lackluster. 

With the exception of BNB, which has reached multiple record highs this year, other tokens like Chainlink, Cardano, Sui, and Dogecoin have seen performance ranging from single-digit gains to double-digit losses for the year, according to CoinGecko data.

The percentage of coins trading above their 200-day moving average, often a barometer for an asset's bullish or bearish slant, has fallen to approximately 55%, a notable decline from this year's peak of 78% recorded on September 13, according to data from MacroMicro. 

“Capital naturally prefers assets with high liquidity, clear narratives, and strong certainty,” Jeffrey Ding, chief analyst at HashKey Group, told Decrypt. 

He explained that a structurally divided market is inevitable under current macroeconomic conditions, with capital favoring top assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, driven primarily by institutional flows via ETFs and corporate treasuries.

Ding explained that many altcoins are being left behind because they have failed to connect with new market narratives, citing examples of AI, RWA, and decentralized exchange narratives that have failed to gain traction.

""The market is losing patience with high-valuation, low-circulating-supply tokens lacking clear use cases,” he added.

“It's a sign that the industry is maturing,” Peter Chung, Head of Research at Presto Research, told Decrypt. “Market participants have learned over the years how to evaluate projects based on their merits and differentiate winners from losers.”

He attributes this shift to the changing composition of market participants. 

“With increasing institutional participation, the days of retail investors aping in and out of particular sectors just based on 'vibes' are mostly behind us,” Chung explained. 

“The retail investors are, of course, still there doing their things, but their overall impact on the market is much less, and is overwhelmed by the institutional flow, which is much larger and disciplined.”

Chung noted that while retail-driven rallies still occur in specific niches—citing ZCash as a recent example—these are now ""pockets of strength"" rather than market-wide trends.

Zcash, a privacy coin, has rallied 140% in the past two weeks to $134, per CoinGecko data, yet it remains 95.9% below its all-time high of $3,191. The token's rise comes after it received endorsements from multiple prominent investors in both crypto and traditional finance, Decrypt previously reported.

Looking ahead, Ding expects a change, but not a return to a broad-based altcoin boom.

""The current stagnation does not mean altcoins will be absent this cycle—rather, they may awaken when Bitcoin and Ethereum enter a consolidation phase,"" he said. 

However, Ding emphasized that any rally will be ""highly selective,"" favoring tokens ""anchored to real-world utility and value creation, not mere storytelling.""

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin extended its retreat from record highs on Tuesday, triggering a liquidation event that wiped out nearly $500 million in leveraged long positions and underscoring the volatile underpinnings of the recent rally.

At time of publication, Bitcoin's price is down 1.2% over the past 24 hours and nearly 3% from its $126,080 record high set on Monday, according to CoinGecko data. Ethereum's losses outpaced those of Bitcoin, with ETH trading down 4.6% on the day, at $4,492.

The market correction forced the closure of over $635 million in total leveraged crypto positions across exchanges in the past day, of which $489 million were long positions. Ethereum longs bore the brunt of the downturn, at $142 million, surpassing Bitcoin's $114 million in long liquidations, per CoinGlass data.

Ryan Lee, chief analyst at universal exchange Bitget, told Decrypt that the sell-off is due to a confluence of factors, including profit-taking after a 10% rally over the last two weeks.

“Gold's rebound this week has likely added to Bitcoin's short-term pressure,” Lee said, explaining that some macro-focused capital is rotating into the precious metal. He pointed to ""muddy macro signals"" and a stronger dollar as creating a risk-off environment.

The U.S. dollar index (DXY), which measures the greenback's strength against a basket of currencies, reached an intraday peak of 98.989 on Wednesday, up significantly from a September 17 low of 96.218, per TradingView data.

Bitcoin Cools but Analysts Remain Upbeat. Why?

Lee views the drop as a healthy correction rather than a trend reversal, with another 3% to 4% drop before prices stabilize and attempt a breakout above $126,000. Sustained bullish momentum beyond the current record high could push Bitcoin to the $132,000 to $135,000 range, he suggested, a forecast contingent on improving market sentiment and sustained ETF inflows.

On prediction market Myriad, launched by Decrypt's parent company DASTAN, user sentiment has remained steadily optimistic over the past few days, with predictors placing a 57% chance on Bitcoin pumping to $140,000 rather than dropping to $110,000.

Despite the short-term pressure, the long-term drivers for Bitcoin remain intact, as previously reported by Decrypt.

Analysts point to a persistent ""debasement trade"" fueled by rising fiscal deficits and a search for assets immune to government mismanagement, which continues to support the bullish narrative for crypto's flagship asset.

Why Altcoins Are Dragging Their Feet as Bitcoin, Ethereum Soar

Echoing this structural optimism, Austin King, Co-Founder of unified decentralized finance trading terminal, Nomina, told Decrypt that he expects Q4 to be an ""exciting quarter for the crypto industry,"" as investors increasingly turn to Bitcoin as a hedge against global political instability.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

After the Hyperliquid NFT sale reached the $467K milestone on the secondary market, traders are shifting attention from high-priced NFTs to altcoins with real growth potential.

Analysts are refreshing their top altcoin analyst watchlist and pointing to coins that could lead the next rally. Among these picks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching interest as a rising contender with strong fundamentals and an expanding community, earning a spot on lists of the best altcoins to buy now.



The Hyperliquid NFT sale $467K set off major talk across trading desks. The Hypurr NFT collection rewarded early blockchain adopters and created a trading frenzy worth over $45 million in just 24 hours. Rare NFTs like Hypurr #21 sold for nearly half a million dollars.



HYPE 1-month price

With such a huge payday for early supporters, many traders are cashing out and looking for altcoins benefiting from NFT sales. Analysts suggest this rotation could drive a NFT-driven altcoin growth opportunity for 2025, moving capital into assets with longer-term upside.

Early signs show the Hyperliquid NFT secondary market fueling this shift. While the NFT hype was intense, some investors now aim for sustainable plays — leading to a hunt for the best altcoins after NFT boom.



Another key name on the top altcoin analyst watchlist is Chainlink (LINK). Whale activity has surged, with large holders adding millions of tokens. Its partnerships with major financial institutions and networks like the Canton Network have improved investor confidence.

Chainlink's push into real-world finance is expanding adoption. With over $100 billion secured across projects and new integrations of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, LINK remains a favorite among crypto analyst picks for 2025. Many believe it could rally strongly as capital moves away from the NFT craze.



LINK 1-month price

XRP remains a core part of lists featuring the 5 best altcoins to buy after the Hyperliquid NFT sale hits $467K. The token has seen historic whale accumulation, with millions flowing into addresses holding between one and ten million XRP.

Spot ETF filings add to its momentum. Analysts say if ETF approvals progress, XRP could deliver strong returns. The NFT-driven altcoin rotation could send fresh liquidity its way as traders seek tokens with institutional support and potential mainstream exposure.



XRP 1-month price

Solana is another key pick when looking at the best altcoins after the NFT boom. ETF approval talks are heating up, and staking features are on the table.

Institutional players have added billions in SOL, while technical upgrades like the Alpenglow protocol could make the network faster and more competitive.

Some experts expect price targets above $300 if ETF momentum and validator improvements hold.

The NFT hype shifting to altcoins may push Solana further, as traders bet on strong infrastructure and upcoming regulatory clarity.



SOL 1-month price

In the middle of this reshuffle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing fresh attention. While bigger names dominate headlines, analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE's potential for sharp upside. The project's clear roadmap, safety audit by HashEX, and transparent team have built investor trust.

Its fast-growing community and active conversation around future growth position it among one of the best altcoins to buy now. As capital rotates from quick NFT flips into long-term plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a crypto analyst pick for 2025.

Traders searching for the best altcoins after the NFT boom increasingly mention it as a strategic choice.

The surge of Hyperliquid NFT secondary market sales reminded traders how quickly profit can shift between sectors. As liquidity moves from NFTs to tokens, a stronger altcoin cycle may form.

Big caps like Chainlink, XRP, and Solana still dominate many top 5 altcoins to watch 2025 lists, but the rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE shows investors want new growth stories with transparency and a clear plan.

With NFT excitement cooling, the market is tilting toward sustainable altcoin opportunities. For those tracking the crypto analyst picks for 2025, staying ahead of this rotation is key.

Q1: Why did the Hyperliquid NFT sale $467K matter for altcoins?
It signaled massive profit-taking and a shift of capital. Many early NFT sellers are looking for the best altcoins after NFT boom to reinvest gains.

Q2: Is MAGACOIN FINANCE safe for long-term holding?
The project completed a safety audit by HashEX and has a transparent team, making it more attractive to investors seeking security and clear development.

Q3: What are the top altcoin analyst watchlist picks for 2025?
Analysts are tracking Chainlink, XRP, Solana, and emerging names like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential high-growth choices.

Q4: How does NFT hype shifting to altcoins affect prices?
It creates liquidity for altcoins. Profits from NFTs often flow into tokens, boosting demand for assets seen as undervalued or primed for growth.

In a step towards asset tokenisation, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has developed a Unified Markets Interface (UMI) which is envisioned as new next generation financial market infrastructure, its Governor Sanjay Malhotra said.

Asset tokenization converts real-world assets into digital tokens on blockchain, creating fractional ownership and global trading opportunities. It offers new possibilities for the financial markets in expanding access, improving transparency and enhancing settlement efficiency through smart contracts.

“The Reserve Bank has conceptualized a Unified Markets Interface as a new next generation financial market infrastructure. This interface will have the capability to tokenize financial assets and settlements using wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC),” Malhotra said at Global Fintech Fest 2025.

He said that early results from the inaugural pilot has shown an encouraging signs of improving market efficiency.

The governor said that there was a need to develop the digital public infrastructure for data integration to widen and deepen financial inclusion.

“The Account Aggregator (AA) framework is one such endeavor. It is empowering individuals to share their financial data safely with regulated entities,” Malhotra said.

Account Aggregator (AA) is a non-bank finance company (NBFC) engaged in the business of providing the service of retrieving or collecting financial information pertaining to the customer. Entities can enrol themselves on AA framework as Financial Information Provider (FIP), such as banking company, NBFC, asset management company, depository, depository participant, insurance company, insurance repository, pension fund. They can also enrol as Financial Information User (FIU) which is an entity registered with and regulated by any financial sector regulator.

Currently, there are 17 account aggregators, 650 FIUs, 150 FIPs, 160 million accounts being served, and 3.66 billion requests from FIUs.

“RBI is in the process of introducing standards designed to improve customer on boarding processes, enhance user interfaces, strengthen data security and increase transparency and awareness in consent management and data sharing under the account aggregator framework,” the governor said.

The account aggregator framework can help unleash the potential in this area by making available data from the providers to the users. However, its success will depend on two critical things – integrating with more financial information, especially information which is vital for assessing the financial status of an individual, and the interoperability across account aggregators.

Malhotra also launched four new products – artificial intelligence-based UPI HELP – a Small Language Model (SLM); IoT Payments with UPI; Banking Connect – Interoperable Net Banking Solution; and UPI Reserve Pay.

Developed in-house as a SLM trained extensively on payment data, UPI HELP currently supports English, with plans to expand to multiple domestic languages. The platform enables users to check transaction status, raise and track complaints, manage mandates, and provide contextual guidance, improving speed, accuracy, and overall experience.

Banking Connect platform will address long-standing net banking challenges, including cumbersome navigation, fragmented integrations, and inconsistent merchant on boarding, settlement, and dispute resolution processes. By removing these hurdles, customers can transact with greater ease and speed across online merchants using own bank app.

UPI Reserve Pay will enable users to set aside (or block) a part of your credit card/pre sanctioned credit line limit to simplify repeat purchases across e-commerce platforms, food delivery apps, and cab aggregators by creating a seamless and native UPI experience.

A typo-flawed $1 million cryptocurrency transfer prompted a US appeals panel in Boston to struggle with the virtue of applying commercial laws governing the replacement of paper stock certificates to digital currencies sent to the wrong blockchain wallet.

The US Court of Appeals for the First Circuit panel posed tough questions to both sides of Celacare Technologies' attempt to revive its bid to have Circle Internet Financial, a cryptocurrency issuer, replace the $1 million in USDC stablecoins that its chief executive lost when mistakenly transcribing a “B” in the wallet address as the number ”8”.

In recent days, comments by senior Indian government figures indicate that India may be considering a proactive approach to stablecoins. Given stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency, this would be a departure for the state. 

The government was originally strongly against cryptocurrencies, with the Reserve Bank of India's efforts to limit their usage overturned by the courts. In comments this week, Piyush Goyal, Minister of Commerce & Industry, described the government's position as neither supporting nor limiting cryptocurrency. The government just heavily taxes transactions. Instead, India has been pursuing a CBDC.

However, recent developments in the US – particularly regulatory moves favoring stablecoins – appear to have prompted a reassessment, highlighted by comments from India's ruling party as well as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. While Sitharaman's statements didn't sound wholeheartedly enthusiastic, the ruling party envisions the same benefits that US Republicans see: that stablecoins can drive demand for government debt.

“Innovations like stablecoins are transforming the landscape of money andcapital inflows. These shifts may force nations to make binary choices, adapt to new monetary architecture or risk exclusion,” said the Finance Minister. “Such developments underscore the scale of transformation which is underway. They also remind us that no nation can insulate itself from the systemic changes. Whether we welcome these shifts or not, we must prepare to engage with them.”

OnePay, the Walmart-backed fintech, is planning to offer cryptocurrency trading and custody services on its app, CNBC reported, citing unnamed sources. 

OnePay is working with Zerohash, a business-to-business-to-consumer fintech that specializes in providing infrastructure for crypto, stablecoins and other digital assets. 

The move comes as OnePay looks to broaden its offerings and get more users on its platform. Walmart's OnePay was designed to be separate from the retailer with a focus on providing banking services to underbanked populations, an area that overlaps with segments of Walmart's retail clientele. Last month, it started offering phone plans, and in June it selected Synchrony Financial as its credit card issuer. —Joey Pizzolato 



U.K. consumers are taking to the barcode cash deposit program Lloyds Banking Group launched in partnership with PayPoint in August. 

PayPoint is a U.K.-based multichannel payments and retail company that allows customers to pay bills, access cash services, send packages and purchase vouchers. PayPoint also offers rewards programs and payment services to businesses. 

The barcode cash deposit allows Lloyds, Halifax and Bank of Scotland customers to deposit cash into their debit account without the need for a traditional branch. Consumers can deposit up to 300 pounds per transaction. 

More than 3 million pounds (about $4 million) have been deposited using the barcode cash deposit feature at PayPoint locations since August, Lloyds said. PayPoint has over 30,000 retail locations, with more than 3,000 of those accepting debit account deposits, according to the company. 

The jump in deposits at PayPoint comes as Lloyds prepares to continue to close branches across the country in its push toward digital. The banking group said it planned to close another 136 branches this year. —Joey Pizzolato



Global Payments' gradual rollout of its Genius payments technology rebrand has entered higher education, with a new version for universities in the U.S. and Canada. The Genius point-of-sale payments system is designed for on-campus merchants, dining halls, recreational facilities, departments and clubs, stadiums and other facilities related to universities. 

Beyond checkout, Genius technology includes inventory management, a variety of hardware such as portable point-of-sale terminals and support for cards, mobile wallets, gift cards and other options. Earlier versions of Genius designed for restaurants, retailers and enterprises were introduced earlier this year. Genius, which is a mix of new payment technology and a relaunch of existing products, is a key part of Global Payments' strategy to focus more on payments than its previous mix of payments and services for card issuers. 

The payments revamp also follows Global Payments' April deal to sell its issuer business to FIS for $13.5 billion while acquiring Worldpay from investment firm GTCR and FIS for $22.7 billion. The acquisition and divestiture are expected to close in early 2026. —John Adams  



Spanish customers that have BBVA accounts and an iPhone 15 Pro or later model can access Apple Intelligence's Image Playground to help design Visa-branded payment cards.

Apple suggests several basic designs as a starting point, and the consumer then adds input, which AI then turns into a card design that is updated in the BBVA app wallet. BBVA is starting with virtual cards, but plans to add physical cards in the near future. There are no limits to the number of designs, though there are parameters such as copyright and suitable content rules. BBVA has also been active in deploying AI internally. 

The bank recently announced a partnership with Google to provide employees with Google's generative AI Gemini app, Google Workspace with Gemini and the NotebookLM research assistant. BBVA in 2024 added more than 3,000 ChatGPT Enterprise licenses through a partnership with OpenAI. —John Adams  



German fintech Vobapay will add Mastercard's open banking technology, enabling Vobapay's clients to offer account-to-account payments at the point of sale. 

Vobapay says the benefit is executing payments without requiring card details, which improves the user experience. While A2A payments are an alternative to credit cards, Visa and Mastercard have both invested in A2A payments as part of their respective services strategy, which aims to draw revenue from sources beyond payment acceptance. Open banking enables third parties to connect to bank accounts with the customer's consent, making it easier to access third-party services. 

Mastercard has grown its open banking product offered through its Finicity subsidiary through a series of global partnerships, often with relatively new technology firms that have worked with the card network on other initiatives. —John Adams 



Cryptocurrency company Coinbase has enabled USDC transfers, providing an alternative to P2P apps such as the bank-led Zelle, PayPal's Venmo, and Block's Cash App. Consumers can send the USDC stablecoin through email addresses or sharable links, with no fees and instant availability. 

The feature appears as a ""Pay"" tab in the Coinbase app, with a search function for users' contacts. 

Coinbase has made several moves to enhance its ability to compete with payment firms and banks as stablecoins start to gain ground among legacy financial institutions. Coinbase has developed a protocol for agentic commerce that allows developers to build AI agents that can communicate with each other and execute payments.

The cryptocurrency company has additionally enabled users to lend USDC stablecoins and access yields of up to 10.7% through an on-chain integration. And it partnered with Meta, Kraken, Ripple, Gemini and other technology firms to improve scam prevention. —John Adams  



India's instant payment scheme, the Unified Payments Interface, is gearing up to add biometric authentication, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. 

UPI users will be able to use facial recognition or fingerprints to approve payments made through the platform as early as Oct. 8, Reuters said. The biometric data will be stored under Aadhar, India's identification system. 

Banks and payments companies have been leaning into biometric authentication for point-of-sale purchases, e-commerce transactions and to fight scams, largely because they are harder — but not impossible — to spoof. But biometrics are still slower to take off in areas such as credit card authorization in the U.S. compared to in Europe, where clearer regulation has paved the way for biometric authentication.  —Joey Pizzolato



Ramp is launching Agents for AP, a specialized AI agent designed to automate certain tasks commonly undertaken by companies' finance departments. 

Agents for AP will be able to code invoices, streamline approvals with ""informed recommendations,"" apply card payments and will also combat fraud, according to Ramp.  

""Ramp's Bill Pay was already automating the majority of the AP process, and Agents for AP are now handling more complex workflows — nearing 100% automation in certain cases,"" said Karim Atiyeh, co-founder and CTO at Ramp, in a statement. ""This is only possible with agents that can source, understand and apply years of contextual knowledge to make decisions on crucial details like GL codes and approval recommendations."" 

The launch comes months after Ramp and Intuit teamed up for business payments. Ramp's Bill Pay product is its fastest growing product line, second only to the company's corporate credit card, according to Ramp. —Joey Pizzolato

Bitcoin's latest breakout is being fueled by institutions and steady on-chain demand rather than speculation, according to new data from Glassnode.

In the Oct. 8 edition of its ""The Week On-chain"" newsletter, the analytics firm said bitcoin's surge to a new all-time high near $126,000 earlier this week was powered by strong ETF inflows and consistent accumulation from smaller market participants. 

The move pushed bitcoin into fresh price discovery before consolidating near $122,500 on Wednesday.

Glassnode said more than $2.2 billion flowed into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs within a single week, marking one of the strongest waves of institutional buying since April. 

Those inflows reversed the mild redemptions seen in September and helped absorb much of the available supply on exchanges.

The firm noted that the fourth quarter has historically been bitcoin's most favorable season, as professional investors often rebalance portfolios toward higher-risk assets such as crypto and small-cap stocks. 

Sustained ETF demand, it added, could continue to anchor prices as year-end approaches.

Glassnode's on-chain data show that mid-tier holders, or wallets containing between 10 and 1,000 BTC, have been the main buyers behind the latest leg higher. 

These accounts have apparently steadily increased their balances while larger whales have taken moderate profits, creating what the firm described as a “more organic accumulation phase.”

Nearly 97% of circulating supply is now in profit, a level that typically marks late-stage bull cycles but does not yet show signs of exhaustion. 

The report highlighted the $117,000–$120,000 zone as a key area of on-chain support, with roughly 190,000 BTC last transacted there — a price range where new buyers may step in if markets pull back.

While Glassnode described market conditions as “robust but maturing,” it cautioned that futures open interest and funding rates have both risen sharply. It noted that annualized funding now exceeds 8%, suggesting a buildup of leveraged long positions that could heighten short-term fragility.

Even so, Glassnode argued that realized profits remain controlled compared with prior market tops, signaling that investors are rotating holdings rather than rushing to exit.

Overall, Glassnode said bitcoin's structure remains sound, underpinned by institutional demand, deep liquidity, and broad-based accumulation. 

The firm concluded that as long as ETF inflows persist, bitcoin's rally could extend further into the fourth quarter, reinforcing its position as the most structurally supported uptrend in years.

 The AFL-CIO says the Senate's crypto framework bill “provides the facade of regulation” that would expose workers' retirement funds to risky assets. 

The largest federation of trade unions in the US says it has “serious concerns” about the Senate's draft bill to regulate crypto, claiming it lacks worker protections and poorly regulates the sector. 

The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) opposed the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA), arguing in a letter to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that it would pose significant risks to workers and the financial system.

The bill's treatment of crypto assets “poses risks to both retirement funds and to the overall financial stability of the US economy,” said AFL-CIO director Jody Calemine.

He added that the bill will enable the crypto industry to “operate in wider and deeper ways in our financial system without sufficient oversight or meaningful safeguards.”

Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand originally introduced the RFIA in 2022 and revised it earlier this year. The Senate Banking Committee is developing the bill as an alternative approach to regulating crypto with a different scope and regulatory emphasis, rather than advancing the CLARITY Act, a market structure bill the House passed in July. 

Calemine said that the AFL-CIO “supports efforts to update regulatory regimes to better protect workers from the volatility of this asset class,” but the bill only “provides the facade of regulation.”

He added that rather than insulating workers from the crypto volatility, the bill “would increase workers' exposure by greenlighting retirement plans like 401(k)s and pensions to hold this risky asset.”

Calemine also claimed that the taxpayer-backed Deposit Insurance Fund, which protects consumer bank deposits, would be subject to greater risk if banks were allowed to custody crypto. 

He also said that the legislation “codifies the tokenization of securities and assets” such that private companies have a pathway to “create a shadow public stock” outside of Securities and Exchange Commission oversight.

The AFL-CIO compared these potential risks to those that caused the 2008 financial crisis, which was high-risk lending by commercial banks.  

Calemine concluded with a call to oppose the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, which is still a discussion draft and not yet formally introduced.

Centuries ago, the Nile River split into two and inadvertently created an island—fulfilling a piece of ancient Egyptian mythology.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Because their ancient mythology references a high ground emerging from water, Egyptians may have constructed the famed Karnak Temple as a way of embracing that idea, building the temple on an island that formed when the Nile River shifted course. 

In a study published in the journal Antiquity, researchers revealed evidence that showed the age of the Karnak Temple near Luxor, one of the ancient world's largest temple complexes and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The study also outlines the striking new links to Egyptian mythology. 

The team wrote that despite almost a century and a half of excavation at the well-studied temple, the landscape that holds the Karnak Temple complex is not well-understood. The team undertook the first comprehensive geoarchaeological survey of the area, linking the site to the “primeval mound” of Egyptian creation myths.

“This new research provides unprecedented detail on the evolution of Karnak Temple, from a small island to one of the defining institutions of Ancient Egypt,” Ben Pennington, lead author of the study and a visiting fellow in geoarchaeology at the University of Southampton, said in a statement from the school. 

An international research team analyzed 61 sediment cores from in and around the temple in addition to studying tens of thousands of ceramic fragments taken from the site. With this data, researchers mapped how the landscape around the temple morphed over the centuries. 

The data showed, according to the study, that the site that now holds the Karnak Temple would have flooded regularly with fast-flowing river water from the Nile before 2520 B.C.E., making the site uninhabitable before that date. Using this geological information, paired with ceramic dating, the team believes the earliest occupation of the site was likely between 2305 B.C.E. and 1980 B.C.E. 

“The age of Karnak Temple has been hotly contested in archaeological circles,” Kristian Strutt, co-author of the study from the University of Southampton, said in a statement, “but our new evidence places a temporal constraint on its earliest occupation and construction.” 

The island location was formed when river channels cut beds to the west and east. This emerging island offered a foundation for both occupation and safe construction. Since, the river has further diverged. 

“The river channels surrounding the site shaped how the temple could develop and where, with new construction taking place on top of old rivers as they silted up,” Dominic Barker, another co-author from the University of Southampton, said in a statement. “We also see how ancient Egyptians shaped the river itself, through the dumping of sands form the desert into channels, possibly to provide new land for building.” 

The dumping of sand ties to an ancient Egyptian creation legend that said a god emerged from “the lake” onto high ground. “It's tempting to suggest that Theban elites chose Karnak's location for the dwelling place of a new form of the creator god, Ra-Amun, as it fitted with cosmogonical scene of high ground emerging from surrounding water,” Pennington said. “Later texts of the Middle Kingdom (1980-1760 B.C.E.) develop this idea, with the ‘primeval mound' rising from the ‘Waters of Chaos.' During this period, the abating of the annual flood would have echoed this scene, with the mound on which Karnak was built appearing to ‘rise' and grow from the receding floodwaters.” 

As the Nile rerouted and left in its wake an island, the researchers believe ancient Egyptians clamored to build on what they saw as evidence of ancient beliefs made manifest. The result was a one of ancient Egypt's largest growing temple complexes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A strange quantum metal just rewrote the rules of electricity","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251007081829.htm","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 06:36:09 GMT","

Quantum metals are metals where quantum effects -- behaviors that normally only matter at atomic scales -- become powerful enough to control the metal's macroscopic electrical properties.

Researchers in Japan have explained how electricity behaves in a special group of quantum metals called kagome metals. The study is the first to show how weak magnetic fields reverse tiny loop electrical currents inside these metals. This switching changes the material's macroscopic electrical properties and reverses which direction has easier electrical flow, a property known as the diode effect, where current flows more easily in one direction than the other.

Notably, the research team found that quantum geometric effects amplify this switching by about 100 times. The study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provides the theoretical foundation that could eventually lead to new electronic devices controlled by simple magnets.

Scientists had observed this strange magnetic switching behavior in experiments since around 2020 but could not explain why it happened and why the effect was so strong. This study provides the first theoretical framework explaining both.

When frustrated electrons cannot settle 

The name ""kagome metal"" comes from the Japanese word ""kagome,"" meaning ""basket eyes"" or ""basket pattern,"" which refers to a traditional bamboo weaving technique that creates interlocking triangular designs.

These metals are special because their atoms are arranged in this unique basket-weave pattern that creates what scientists call ""geometric frustration"" -- electrons cannot settle into simple, organized patterns and are forced into more complex quantum states that include the loop currents.

When the loop currents inside these metals change direction, the electrical behavior of the metal changes. The research team showed that loop currents and wave-like electron patterns (charge density waves) work together to break fundamental symmetries in the electronic structure. They also discovered that quantum geometric effects -- unique behaviors that only occur at the smallest scales of matter -- significantly enhance the switching effect.

""Every time we saw the magnetic switching, we knew something extraordinary was happening, but we couldn't explain why,"" Hiroshi Kontani, senior author and professor from the Graduate School of Science at Nagoya University, recalled.

""Kagome metals have built-in amplifiers that make the quantum effects much stronger than they would be in ordinary metals. The combination of their crystal structure and electronic behavior allows them to break certain core rules of physics simultaneously, a phenomenon known as spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is extremely rare in nature and explains why the effect is so powerful.""

The research method involved cooling the metals to extremely low temperatures of about -190°C. At this temperature, the kagome metal naturally develops quantum states where electrons form circulating currents and create wave-like patterns throughout the material. When scientists apply weak magnetic fields, they reverse the direction these currents spin, and as a result, the preferred direction of current flow in the metal changes.

New materials meet new theory 

This breakthrough in quantum physics was not possible until recently because kagome metals were only discovered around 2020. While scientists quickly observed the mysterious electrical switching effect in experiments, they could not explain how it worked.

The quantum interactions involved are very complex and require advanced understanding of how loop currents, quantum geometry, and magnetic fields work together -- knowledge that has only developed in recent years. These effects are also very sensitive to impurities, strain, and external conditions, which makes them difficult to study.

""This discovery happened because three things came together at just the right time: we finally had the new materials, the advanced theories to understand them, and the high-tech equipment to study them properly. None of these existed together until very recently, which is why no one could solve this puzzle before now,"" Professor Kontani added.

""The magnetic control of electrical properties in these metals could potentially enable new types of magnetic memory devices or ultra-sensitive sensors. Our study provides the fundamental understanding needed to begin developing the next generation of quantum-controlled technology,"" he said.

Are widespread stereotypes accurate1,2,3 or socially distorted4,5,6? This continuing debate is limited by the lack of large-scale multimodal data on stereotypical associations and the inability to compare these to ground truth indicators. Here we overcame these challenges in the analysis of age-related gender bias7,8,9, for which age provides an objective anchor for evaluating stereotype accuracy. Despite there being no systematic age differences between women and men in the workforce according to the US Census, we found that women are represented as younger than men across occupations and social roles in nearly 1.4 million images and videos from Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, Flickr and YouTube, as well as in nine language models trained on billions of words from the internet. This age gap is the starkest for content depicting occupations with higher status and earnings. We demonstrate how mainstream algorithms amplify this bias. A nationally representative pre-registered experiment (n = 459) found that Googling images of occupations amplifies age-related gender bias in participants' beliefs and hiring preferences. Furthermore, when generating and evaluating resumes, ChatGPT assumes that women are younger and less experienced, rating older male applicants as of higher quality. Our study shows how gender and age are jointly distorted throughout the internet and its mediating algorithms, thereby revealing critical challenges and opportunities in the fight against inequality.

Although few deny that stereotypes, or generalizations about social groups10,11,12, are harmful, a fundamental question remains contested: are common stereotypes accurate1,2,3 or socially distorted4,5,6? Some argue that commonplace stereotypes accurately capture observable aspects of social groups; otherwise, they would not gain such widespread adoption1,2,3. Yet, others argue that stereotypes are often exaggerated or illusory4,5,6. Assessing stereotype accuracy is challenging because stereotypes involve not only statistical associations (such as expected correlations among the features of a social group) but also normative judgements (such as that one group is superior to another) for which there is no well-defined ground truth10,11,12. Even for statistical associations, identifying the ground truth is difficult. In some cases, this stems from disagreement on how to measure the ground truth, such as enduring debates over how to measure intelligence13 (a heavily stereotyped characteristic14). Yet, even when there is agreement on the relevant constructs, there is often a lack of large-scale, quantifiable cultural data for measuring stereotypical associations and comparing these to ground truth indicators. As a result, research on stereotypes often yields inconsistent findings, calling into question the pervasiveness and impact of these biases. In this study, we overcame these limitations in the analysis of age-related gender bias, which not only involves biological age as an objective anchor for evaluating stereotype accuracy, but which can also be linked to large-scale statistical biases in how the ages of women and men are depicted online.

On the one hand, evidence abounds that older women face a dual bias at the intersection of gender and age. Policy reports8,15,16, media coverage17 and workplace interviews7,18 indicate that older women are discriminated against in hiring and promotion across industries (known as ‘gendered ageism'7,18,19). This is related to a general statistical bias towards associating women with expectations of youth. From entertainment media to the workplace, women face persistent pressure to appear young, which results in a ‘beauty tax' with sizeable financial and time costs20. This bias also manifests in everyday language. Women in academia21 and industry22 are more likely than men to be referred to using infantilizing pronouns (such as ‘girls'). These patterns suggest that age-related gender expectations may form a culture-wide statistical bias that influences people's perceptions of others throughout society23,24.

On the other hand, the statistical association between women and youth contradicts observable socioeconomic realities. Since the 1960s, women have consistently outlived men in the USA by as much as 8 years, a gap that has been increasing25,26. Census data on occupations present similarly puzzling trends (Supplementary Fig. 1). Over the past decade, there has been no correlation between the fraction of women in an occupation and its median age, according to the US census (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). There were also no clear differences in the age distribution of women and men throughout the workforce from 2009 to the present (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). Moreover, recent surveys failed to observe gendered ageism in certain organizational settings and even suggest that older women may be less affected by stereotypes than older men27,28. These inconsistent findings resonate with critiques against claims of enduring gender inequality, such as research showing declines in gender stereotypes over the last century in online text29,30, as well as studies showing that hiring across industries increasingly favours women31,32. This dissonant landscape raises the question of whether age-related gender bias is an organization-specific or industry-specific problem, or whether it is a culture-wide distortion that continues to reflect and contribute to systemic inequalities.

We argue that this uncertainty is fuelled by the lack of (1) culture-wide multimodal data on the associations between gender and age and (2) computational methodologies for comparing these associations with ground truth indicators. So far, only a handful of studies have examined age–gender associations in small-scale surveys and interviews with professional women7,18,27,28,33 or in sparse, non-representative observational studies of particular industries, such as celebrities and athletes in entertainment media34,35,36,37,38. However, failing to observe age-related gender bias in limited samples of a few contexts does not indicate a lack of prominence on a culture-wide scale. Social biases in how people categorize the world frequently emerge only at scale39,40 and can manifest as exaggerated or even illusory beliefs41. This suggests the alternative view that skewed associations between gender and age can emerge as a large-scale statistical bias that distorts socioeconomic realities despite inconsistencies across small-scale contexts.

Although a number of recent studies revealed the exaggeration of male representation in online texts and images6,42, no comparable analyses exist for tracking age-related representations of gender. To address this gap, we produced a large-scale culture-wide dataset on age–gender associations across modalities, including images, videos and textual data, collected from popular sources of digital media. We began by examining the gender and age associations of all social categories in the English language (n = 3,495) in more than 1.3 million images and thousands of videos from Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, Flickr, YouTube and a random sample of the world-wide web (see ‘Image and video datasets' in Methods for details on pre-processing and post-processing). We benchmarked online images of occupations against the US census data to examine whether they exaggerate the association between women and youth. We went beyond the visual modalities by examining age-related gender bias in nine popular language models trained on billions of words from across the internet, including Reddit, Google News, Wikipedia and Twitter (see ‘Measuring age and gender in online text' in Methods). By examining age-related gender bias in large-scale internet data, our study was uniquely poised to examine the role that mainstream algorithms play in reinforcing this bias. We examined algorithmic amplification in both the image and textual modalities through (1) the study of the psychological effects of using Google Image search and (2) the use of ChatGPT to generate and evaluate resumes in the workplace.

Across all image datasets spanning five popular online platforms, women are consistently represented as younger than men, regardless of whether the age and gender of faces are measured using human judgements, machine learning or ground truth data. First, we analysed 657,035 images from the Google search engine associated with 3,495 social categories, in which the gender and age of images were classified by human coders6 (see ‘Image data collection procedure' in Methods; all categories were examined using retrieved Google Images containing human faces). We found that women in Google Images were coded as significantly younger than men, both for non-gendered searches (such as ‘doctor' or ‘banker'; mean difference in age groups, Mdiff = 0.37; t = −73.84; P = 2.2 × 10−16; n = 3,434 categories; Fig. 1a) and gendered searches (such as searching ‘female doctor' and ‘male doctor'; Mdiff = 0.29; t = −36.52; P = 2.2 × 10−16; n = 2,960 categories; Fig. 1b). Replicating this method over Wikipedia revealed that women in Wikipedia images were also coded as significantly younger than men (Mdiff = 0.71; t = −39.62; P = 2.2 × 10−16; n = 1,251 categories; Fig. 1c).

a–j, The age of either female or male faces according to the top 100 Google Images associated with 3,434 social categories (n = 161,484 images) (a), the top 100 Google Images retrieved using gendered searches (such as by searching ‘female athlete' or ‘male athlete') shown for all non-gendered categories in WordNet (n = 2,960 categories; 495,551 images) (b), 1,251 categories in Wikipedia (from the Srinivasan et al.68 dataset; 14,709 images) (c), celebrities identified by the top 100,000 most popular pages on IMDb (n = 451,570 images) (d), biographical Wikipedia pages describing the same celebrities in the IMDb–Wiki dataset (n = 57,932 images) (e), the top 50 most popular celebrities from 1951 to 2004 as they appear in Google Images, according to the CACD (n = 149,889 images) (f), a random sample across the world-wide web (the 2017 UTK dataset; n = 20,000 images) (g), a random sample from Flickr (the 2014 Adience dataset; n = 26,580 images) (h), a random sample of images from online news websites (the 2008 LFW dataset; n = 13,233 images) (i) and images of the same people identified in the LFW dataset, extracted across 3,425 YouTube videos in 2011 (n = 5,000 images) (j). The method for coding age and gender varies by dataset; a–c rely on human coders; panels d,e,g rely on ground truth measures of the age and gender of celebrities posted publicly online; f,h–j rely on automated deep learning classifications of gender and age. Solid gold and blue lines indicate the average age for female and male faces, respectively.

These results are robust to collecting Google Images from different countries around the world (Supplementary Fig. 3) and controlling for (1) the demographic characteristics and subjectivity of human coders (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 and Supplementary Tables 3–5); (2) the linguistic features of social categories (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 7 and Supplementary Table 6), such as word polysemy, word gender connotation, word age connotation and word frequency in Google Search and in everyday language; (3) the visual features of the images, including the number of faces per image, the number of images associated with each category overall, whether the image repeats across searches and whether the image is photographic or displays a digital avatar (Supplementary Table 7); and (4) whether the faces in each image are cropped before classification (Supplementary Fig. 8), as well as statistical biases in the cropping algorithm itself (Supplementary Fig. 9). We confirm that these results reflect images from a wide range of websites (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Next, we analysed the 2018 IMDb–Wiki dataset43 and the 2014 Cross-Age Celebrity Dataset (CACD)44 consisting of Google Images, each of which provides the true gender and age of the celebrities depicted using their public bio pages and time-stamped photographs. Figure 1 shows that female celebrities are, on average, 6.5 years younger than men on IMDb (t = −169.9; P = 2.2 × 10−16; n = 451,562 images; Fig. 1d), 3.27 years younger on Wikipedia (t = 10.64; P = 2.2 × 10−16; n = 57,972 images; Fig. 1e) and 5.35 years younger in Google Images (t = −90.92; P = 2.2 × 10−16; n = 149,889 images; Fig. 1f). In all cases, the most common (modal) age for women is in their 20s, whereas in images from IMDb and Google, the most common ages for men are 40 years and 50 years, respectively. These analyses show that age-related gender bias online is not an artefact of human perceptions of gender and age, because it is replicated using verified objective information about the age and gender of those depicted. That age-based gender bias replicates strongly in the context of celebrities is concerning, given the salient role that celebrities play in reinforcing stereotypes45.

Finally, we explored age biases in the representation of women and men using prominent image datasets developed for training machine learning algorithms. The age and gender classifications in these datasets were provided by computer vision algorithms constructed by the research teams that released these datasets. We found that women were automatically classified as significantly younger than men in the 2017 UTK46 dataset consisting of a diverse sample of images from across the world-wide web (Mdiff = 5.12 years; t = −19.9; P = 2.2 × 10−16; n = 24,106 images; Fig. 1g), the 2014 Adience dataset47 consisting of images from Flickr (Mdiff = 0.18; t = −6.52; P = 6.79 × 10−11; n = 17,492 images; Fig. 1h) and the 2008 Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset48 consisting of a random sample of images from Google News (Mdiff = 0.84; t = −44.89; P = 2.2 × 10−16; n = 13,143 images; Fig. 1i) (two-tailed Student's t-test). These findings further generalized our results beyond the perceptions of human coders.

A remaining question is whether age-related gender bias is also observed in online videos, which increasingly dominate the world-wide web49. Although an exhaustive analysis of online videos is beyond the scope of this study, we analysed two open-source datasets of screenshots from YouTube videos that provide compelling support for our theory. First, we examined the correlation between gender and age in the 2011 YouTube Faces dataset50, consisting of 3,645 faces of celebrities extracted from 3,425 YouTube videos. Women in the YouTube Faces dataset appear significantly younger than men according to machine learning classifications (Mdiff = 0.87; t = −25.68; P = 2.2 × 10−16; n = 3,645 images; Fig. 1j). We also analysed a more recent dataset of YouTube videos called the 2022 CelebV-HQ dataset51, consisting of 35,666 images collected by identifying public lists of celebrities on Wikipedia and automatically collecting the top 10 YouTube videos associated with each celebrity. Although this dataset contains only a binary measure of age (faces are coded as either young = 1 or old = 0), we can still test our theory by comparing the fraction of women and men coded as young. Only 20% of men were classified as young compared with 33% of women, marking a significantly higher rate of youthful presentations for women (P = 2.2 × 10−16; two-tailed proportion test).

We compared these findings to available industry-level ground truth data to measure the extent to which online images distort the underlying sociodemographic realities of age (occupation-level census data containing both gender and age information are unavailable; see ‘Comparing online images with the census' in Methods). We matched 867 social categories from our Google Images (Fig. 1a) dataset to occupational categories in the US census. Although gender–age associations in Google Images and census data are correlated at the industry level (r = 0.13; confidence interval = 0.11–0.15; P = 2.2 × 10−16; two-tailed Pearson's correlation; Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables 8 and 9), Google Images consistently display exaggerated and, in some cases, inverted trends that consistently amplify the association between women and youth. Extended Data Fig. 3 presents the absolute age gap between women and men in each industry, vertically ranked in terms of the magnitude of this gap while also placing the older gender on the right side. In the sales, resources and management industries, Google Images consistently presented the highest age gap relative to all census years (P < 0.001 for all pairwise comparisons; two-tailed Student's t-test). Moreover, in each of these industries, Google Images displayed men as older than women, whereas women were older than men for each of the census years examined in the sales industry and for two of the years in the resources industry. In the production and service industry, the magnitude of the age gap captured by Google Images was not higher than all census years; yet, the bias towards representing men as older was stable. In each census year, women were older than men in the production and service industries. It was only in Google Images that men were older than women in these industries, suggesting systematic age and gender distortions that associate women with youth.

Given the observational and large-scale nature of these analyses, it is challenging to identify the mechanisms driving these age–gender associations. Nevertheless, numerous patterns in our data were relevant when considering sociologically relevant factors. One such consideration pertains to the hypothesis that gender stereotypes are most salient in high-status and prestigious occupations, which play a prominent role in reinforcing gender expectations and norms of desirability52,53. To test this, we recruited a nationally representative US sample from Prolific (n = 1,002) to evaluate the status and prestige of 867 occupations matched between our Google Image data (Fig. 1a) and the US census from 2015 to 2022 (see ‘Collecting judgements of occupational status' in Methods). Occupations rated as higher status were more likely to elicit Google Images in which men were older than women (Extended Data Fig. 4a; r = 0.08; t = 11.28; P = 2.2 × 10−16; two-tailed Pearson's correlation; n = 867 occupations). We reproduced this correlation using the objective measure of occupational prestige54 of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (Extended Data Fig. 4b; r = 0.11; t = 2.5; P = 0.01; two-tailed Pearson's correlation; n = 532 occupations could be matched). Next, we showed that the probability of men appearing as older in Google Images is significantly higher for occupations associated with higher median earnings (Extended Data Fig. 4c; r = 0.11; t = 7.39; P = 1.07 × 10−13; two-tailed Pearson's correlation; n = 4,444 pairwise comparisons at the census year level from 2015 to 2022; yearly earnings logged). We found that the gender pay gap16,55, or the extent to which men earn more than women in the same occupation, is associated with the digital age gap, or the extent to which men appear older than women in Google Images (Extended Data Fig. 2d; r = 0.04; t = 7 = 3.05; P = 0.002; two-tailed Pearson's correlation; n = 4,444 pairwise comparisons at the census year level from 2015 to 2022; yearly earnings logged). These results were robust to numerous statistical controls (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12 and Supplementary Tables 10–13) and resonate with long-standing concerns about disparities in how genders are perceived and evaluated in the workplace.

A natural suspicion is that age-related gender bias in online images and videos may be driven by affordances of visual communication, such as image filters and cosmetics, which do not generalize to other modalities. Here we show that comparably salient patterns of age-related gender bias are readily observable in massive bodies of internet text data beyond the visual modality. We begin by analysing gender–age associations in GPT-2 Large56, the largest open-source language model of OpenAI trained on billions of tokens of text data from across the internet (see ‘Measuring age and gender in online text' in Methods; Supplementary Tables 14 and 15). As shown in Fig. 2, the representations of GPT-2 Large exhibit a strong correlation between the extent to which a social category is associated with men and older ages (r = 0.87; t = 105.57; P = 2.2 × 10−16; two-tailed Pearson's correlation). These results are robust to alternative methods for extracting age and gender associations (Supplementary Fig. 13), as well as to a range of statistical controls, including word frequency, gender, age and polysemy (Supplementary Fig. 14 and Supplementary Table 16). These associations are significantly predictive of ground truth age distributions by gender and occupation in the census, affirming their empirical coherence (Supplementary Tables 17 and 18). These results are not unique to GPT-2 Large. We replicated these patterns across eight different canonical and popular language models that vary in their training data and algorithmic training methods (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16).

Correlation between age and gender associations for 3,495 social categories in GPT-2 Large. The horizontal axis presents the gender association from 0 (female) to 1 (male), and the vertical axis presents the age association from 0 (young) to 1 (old). The trend line shows the linear prediction according to an ordinary least squares regression. The orange highlighted categories illustrate some of the categories that have the youngest and most female associations, whereas the blue highlighted categories illustrate some of the categories that have the oldest and most male associations.

The systematic distortion of age–gender associations in online images, videos and text across popular platforms that we have identified raises concerns about how mainstream algorithms trained on these data might amplify the spread of this bias. We begin by examining possible algorithmic amplification in the visual modality to investigate whether exposure to visual content from the Google search engine amplifies age-related gender bias in people's beliefs.

To answer this question, we report the results of a pre-registered experiment. We recruited a nationally representative sample of US participants from Prolific (n = 500), who were tasked with using Google to search for images of occupations related to science, technology and the arts (Extended Data Fig. 5; ‘Participant pool' in Methods). In total, 459 participants completed the task. Each participant used Google to retrieve descriptions of 22 randomly selected occupations from a set of 54 (‘participant experience' in Methods). The participants were randomized into treatment or control condition. In the treatment condition (hereafter ‘image condition'), the participants used Google Images to search for images of occupations, which they then uploaded to our survey. After uploading an image for an occupation, the participants were asked to label the gender of the image they uploaded and then to estimate the average age of someone in this occupation. The participants were also asked to rate their willingness to hire the person depicted in their uploaded image. In the control condition, the participants used Google Images to search for and upload images of basic unrelated categories (such as apple and guitar). After uploading a random image, the control participants were asked to estimate the average age of someone in a randomly selected occupation from the same set. The control participants were also asked to rate the ideal hiring age of someone in each occupation, as well as which gender (‘male' or ‘female') is most likely to belong to each occupation. This design allowed us to evaluate the treated participants' age estimates of occupations after uploading an image of a man or woman compared with (1) the control participants' age estimates formed without exposure to images of occupations and (2) the control participants' age estimates conditional on their belief about which gender is most common in each occupation.

We began by testing the prediction that exposure to online images of occupations primes age-related gender bias in the participants' beliefs. To test this prediction, we evaluated whether uploading an image of a woman (man) for each occupation is associated with a lower (higher) age estimate compared with the average age estimate of each occupation provided by those in the control condition who did not encounter online images of each occupation before providing their estimates. Figure 3a shows that the participants who uploaded an image of a woman estimated the average age of an occupation to be 5.46 years younger than those who uploaded an image of a man (t = −19.07; P = 2.2 × 10−16; Student's t-test), holding occupation constant. Moreover, uploading an image of a woman led the participants to estimate a significantly lower age for each occupation (by 1.75 years) compared with the control participants (t = −11.32; P = 2.2 × 10−16), whereas uploading an image of a man led the participants to estimate a significantly higher age for each occupation (by 0.64 years) compared with those in the control condition (t = 3.42; P = 0.0006; Student's two-tailed t-test).

The participants (n = 459) from a nationally representative sample were randomized either to the ‘image' condition, in which they googled for images of occupations (n = 54), or the ‘control' condition, in which they googled for image-based descriptions of random categories (such as apple) unrelated to occupations. a, Average age of each occupation, as estimated by the participants in the image condition, broken down by whether they uploaded a female or male image of the occupation, centred relative to the average age of each occupation provided across all the participants in the control condition. b, Partial effect plot that controls for occupation and participant fixed effects while predicting the average age provided for each occupation depending on the gender of the image uploaded by the participants in the image condition or the gender the participants most associated with each occupation in the control condition. Data points display mean values, and error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. c, Correlation between the gender association and perceived ideal hiring age of each occupation (averaged across all the participants in the control condition). The gender association of each occupation was measured separately according to the participants' manual gender ratings in the control condition and the gender distribution of the images uploaded by the participants in the image condition. Data points show the average gender association and perceived ideal hiring age for each occupation according to each measure. Error bands show 95% confidence intervals.

Notably, these results hold when controlling for the participants' gender and age, as well as whether their own demographics matched those of the people depicted in the images they uploaded (Supplementary Tables 19 and 20). Supplementary analyses further demonstrate that the participants' estimates of the average ages of people in occupations are significantly correlated with the median age of these occupations according to the US census, indicating that the participants' age judgements were coherent and consistent with ground truth sociodemographic distributions (Supplementary Tables 21 and 22).

Next, we leveraged the control condition to examine the effect of exposure to online images depicting occupations, above and beyond the participants' existing biases about the gender composition of occupations. Specifically, we tested whether the participants in the treatment condition reported younger (older) ages when uploading images of women (men) for each occupation compared with the age estimates provided by the control participants, who reported believing that women (men) most often belonged to a given occupation. Figure 3b shows that the control participants who believed women are most likely to belong to a given occupation also estimated the average age of people in this occupation to be significantly younger (by 2.15 years), evidencing a baseline pattern of age-related gender bias in people's judgements (β[male] = 2.15 years; standard error = 0.38; t = 5.55; P = 2.98 × 10−8). However, Fig. 3b further shows that this age gap is even higher among those in the treatment condition. The participants who uploaded an image of a woman for a given occupation reported estimating the age of people in this occupation to be significantly younger than the control participants who already believed that this occupation is female-skewed. This analysis controls for the specific occupation being evaluated, as well as the participants' idiosyncratic judgements through occupation and participant fixed effects (β[gender × condition] = −0.84; standard error = 0.31; t = −2.69; P = 0.007). These results indicate that exposure to online images significantly exacerbates the perceived age gap between women and men, particularly by increasing the association between women and youth.

We conclude these experimental analyses by examining the practical consequences of this age-based gender bias by evaluating its impact on women's and men's perceived fit across occupations. Figure 3c shows that occupations that are more associated with women (men) are significantly correlated with the participants reporting lower (higher) recommended ages for whom to hire in this occupation. Figure 3c shows that the control participants' perceived ideal age for hiring is strongly and positively correlated with the extent to which each occupation is associated with men, as measured by (1) the control participants' manual gender ratings of occupations (r = 0.58; P = 3.52 × 10−6) and (2) the gender associations in the images uploaded by the participants in the image condition (r = 0.45; P = 0.0006; Pearson's two-tailed correlation). These analyses provide evidence that age-related gender associations mediate people's judgements of who is best to hire for a given occupation, with a preference towards hiring younger women and older men.

The above results are highly robust to whether (1) the participants provided gender ratings of occupations without estimating age (as captured by a separately replicated experiment6; Supplementary Fig. 17) and (2) the participants rated hireability using a Likert scale (Supplementary Fig. 18; see Supplementary Tables 23 and 24 for a full summary of all of our pre-registered hypotheses and the associated analyses and results). All of our main pre-registered hypotheses were strongly supported. Note that the framing of our study was updated in response to the review process, with no changes to the reporting of the experimental design or statistical results (see Supplementary Table 24 and the associated discussion for details).

Because popular artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT are trained on internet data, we further propose that ChatGPT will exhibit significant age-based gender bias in its textual representations and evaluations of occupations in professional resumes. Identifying age-related bias in ChatGPT would highlight a potential pathway through which this bias is widely propagated, given that more than 400 million people and two million businesses use ChatGPT weekly57. By adapting prompt engineering techniques developed for auditing biases in ChatGPT's resume generation58, we prompted ChatGPT (v.GPT-4o mini) to create nearly 40,000 resumes for 54 occupations using 16 unique female and male names that were normalized to control for name popularity, familiarity, ethnicity and perceived age group, such that the male and female names were maximally similar along these dimensions (the same names were used in a recent auditing study58) (see ‘Prompt design' in Methods). This experiment consisted of two phases: resume generation and resume evaluation (Extended Data Fig. 6). All resumes were generated and evaluated in June 2024.

We began by examining the resume generation phase, in which we prompted ChatGPT to generate resumes across 54 occupations while varying the prompt across three conditions: (1) the control condition; (2) the control–gender condition; and (3) the treatment condition. In the control condition, we prompted ChatGPT to generate 50 resumes for each of the 54 occupations without specifying the name or gender of the applicant, resulting in 2,700 unique resumes. In the control–gender condition, we replicated the control condition, except that we also asked ChatGPT to include the gender of applicants in the resumes generated. Finally, in the treatment condition, we replicated the design of the control condition, except that our prompt included a specific name for the applicant and asked ChatGPT to generate a resume for the named applicant applying for the specified occupation (in this condition, ChatGPT was not asked to explicitly identify the gender of the named applicant). We used the same occupations in our image search experiment. In the treatment condition, we prompted ChatGPT 20 separate times for each name–gender–occupation prompt combination, yielding a total of 34,560 resumes and 17,280 resumes for each gender group. The resume features generated by ChatGPT were highly coherent and stable (Supplementary Fig. 19 and Supplementary Table 25).

Next, we evaluated the consequences that age-based gender biases in ChatGPT's representations of resumes can have on its practical application as a hiring tool. We focused on one of ChatGPT's most popular uses in the workplace: to evaluate, score and rank resumes to expedite hiring processes by focusing human recruiters on resumes with top scores58. We prompted ChatGPT to evaluate each of the resumes generated in the first phase by providing a score between 1 and 100 to indicate the quality of each resume. All reported results are robust to altering the model temperature of ChatGPT (Supplementary Fig. 20).

We began by examining how altering the gender of a target applicant's name affects the resumes that ChatGPT generates. We compared the resumes that ChatGPT generated in the treatment condition for female or male names while using a linear regression to control for the applicant name and occupation. As Fig. 4a indicates, when ChatGPT generated a resume for a female name, it generated resumes with significantly lower ages (by 1.6 years; t = 20.5; P = 7.09 × 10−93), more recent graduation dates (by 1.3 years; t = 12.5; P = 1.18 × 10−35) and fewer years of relevant experience (by 0.92 years; t = 5.39; P = 6.97 × 10−8) compared with male names (Student's t-test; n = 34,560 resumes). Compared with the control condition, the resumes ChatGPT generated for female (male) applicants were significantly younger (older) and less (more) experienced than the resumes generated for the same occupations without any gender or name (all at the P < 0.00001 level; Student's two-tailed t-test). Thus, ChatGPT exhibits age-based assumptions about women and men that are highly consistent with stereotypical associations relating to gendered ageism.

a, Partial effect plot in an ordinary least squares regression displaying the effect of a male applicant name (versus a female applicant name) on (1) applicant age; (2) years since the applicant's graduation; and (3) the number of years of applicant's relevant experience, while controlling for name and occupation. Only resumes from the treatment condition were examined in this analysis (n = 34,560), because this ensures that all resumes have either a male or female name and were produced through the same prompt. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. b, Linear correlation between applicant age and ChatGPT's rating of resume quality across all resumes (n = 39,560) from all conditions. Data points display the raw distribution of scores for each resume, with one data point per resume. The trend line reflects a standard bivariate linear trend. c, Partial effect plot displaying the interaction effect between applicant age and applicant gender on ChatGPT's rating of resume quality, with fixed effects for applicant name, occupation and phase 1 condition (data from the control condition were excluded because of the lack of applicant gender; n = 37,060 resumes used in total). Error bands display 95% confidence intervals. ChatGPT's temperature was set to its default value of 0.7.

These patterns of age-based gender bias in ChatGPT were replicated in the control–gender condition, in which ChatGPT generated its own name and gender classification for each occupation. When ChatGPT generated a male applicant for a given resume, this applicant was more likely to be older (by 1.3 years; t = 17.3; P = 2.2 × 10−16) and to have graduated less recently (by 1.2 years; t = 7.10; P = 2.29 × 10−12) than when it generated a resume for a female applicant, holding occupation constant (Student's t-test; n = 2,500 resumes). Thus, the effects we observed were not dependent on the specific names used to prompt ChatGPT or on the overall prompt design in the treatment condition.

We next evaluated the consequences this bias had on how ChatGPT evaluated the quality of resumes. Across all occupations, Fig. 4b shows that ChatGPT's judgements of resume quality were significantly and positively correlated with the age of the applicant that ChatGPT initially generated for the resume (r = 0.27; P = 2.2 × 10−16; t = 51.59; Pearson's two-tailed correlation; n = 39,560 resumes). This result equally holds in a linear regression when we controlled for the occupation and name used to generate each application (β[age] = 0.04; t = 6.3; P = 2.96 × 10−10). Finally, we tested whether ChatGPT exhibits a preference not only for older applicants but also for older men specifically, consistent with the predictions of gendered ageism6,7. We used linear regression to predict ChatGPT's judgements of resume quality using an interaction between the age and gender of the applicant while holding occupation and applicant name constant. As shown in Fig. 4c, the model identified a highly significant and positive interaction between being male and older, indicating that the benefit of older age on ChatGPT's judgements of resume quality is even greater if the applicant is male rather than female (β[male × age] = 0.04; t = 6.61; P = 3.66 × 10−11). This interaction effect is robust to altering ChatGPT's model temperature (Supplementary Fig. 20).

In this study, we have provided large-scale evidence that age-related gender bias pervades online media, including images, videos and texts across major platforms, and that the bias towards representing women as younger distorts ground truth realities on the actual ages of women and men throughout society. Our findings raise an alarm about the algorithmic amplification of age-related gender bias on the internet, especially considering that many mainstream machine learning algorithms are trained on these public datasets. Many of the image and text datasets examined in this study are used extensively as canonical training and benchmark datasets for developing artificial intelligence applications. Enormous harm can be caused by latent social biases that lurk in popular machine learning tools59,60, and algorithmic bias typically arises from contaminated training data. Our study provides direct evidence that age-related gender bias is amplified by two of the most widely used algorithms today: the Google Image search engine and ChatGPT. Although companies such as Google and OpenAI invest heavily in reducing stereotypical content in their products61, most studies focus on single dimensions of bias, such as gender-based or race-based biases. Our study highlighted the critical need to account for multimodal and multidimensional forms of bias62, which are more challenging to detect but not less consequential in how people and algorithms represent the social world. The intersectional statistical bias we identified between gender and age may interact with other biases, such as relating to how women and men are depicted in terms of warmth and competence, revealing a promising direction for future research63,64.

How might the digital distortion of age-related gender associations negatively affect women and men? Our results highlighted several key ways in which older women are likely to be disadvantaged by this bias. For example, when generating resumes, ChatGPT not only assumes that women are younger, but also that they have less overall experience. Consequently, ChatGPT is biased towards giving lower scores to resumes from younger women compared with older women while giving the highest scores to older men. Yet, ChatGPT also gives higher scores to resumes from young women than from young men, suggesting that young men may also be disadvantaged by this dual bias (Supplementary Fig. 18). However, a selection bias favouring younger women and older men may further reinforce gender inequalities at the systemic level, whereby women are preferentially hired into roles with lower status and authority but denied mobility, whereas older men continue to enjoy top positions. This resonates with our finding that online content is most likely to depict men as older than women for occupations with higher status and wealth.

A critical direction for future research is to investigate the causal mechanisms through which age-related gender bias seeps into and spreads through the images, videos and text of distinct platforms, each with its own unique audiences and distribution channels. Our results about objective differences in the ages of male and female celebrities visualized on IMDb, Wikipedia and Google probably reflect industry-specific mechanisms related to status dynamics, hiring biases and the objectification of women in entertainment media. Yet, these industry-specific drivers do not account for how strongly women and youth are semantically associated in massive bodies of online text from diverse sources, let alone in ChatGPT's text-based representations and rankings of job candidates. A fascinating question for future work is to explore whether the aesthetic norms and hiring biases of entertainment media spill over into the distortion of age–gender associations throughout social life. A related question concerning supply-side factors concerns whether age-related gender bias in popular algorithms stems from inequalities in the gender of data contributors online. Studies suggest that Reddit users65 and Wikipedia editors66 are disproportionately male, and textual data from these platforms are frequently mined for training artificial intelligence models. Training artificial intelligence on datasets with greater gender equality in data contributors may provide an effective mitigation strategy.

This study highlights the increasingly prominent role of internet culture and algorithms in mediating our representation of the social world. As a recent review article emphasized67, previous studies have been limited in their ability to concretely measure the diverse cultural meanings of age both in terms of its biological basis and its relevance to cultural notions of life stages (such as ‘youth' and ‘childhood'). The strength of our approach is that it captures the cultural meanings of age and gender along many dimensions, from concrete time-stamped images to verbal descriptions of age categories across social roles and contexts. We revealed that the cultural meanings of gender and age are deeply linked on a massive scale across information modalities and in ways that reflect socioeconomic inequalities. Compelling evidence that these patterns are socially constructed comes from our finding that online associations between gender and age heavily distort the measurable ground truth reality of how people of different genders and ages are distributed throughout society. The extent to which algorithms entrench distortions of social reality en masse and to which this can be corrected is a vital topic for future research on internet policy and human cultural evolution. The methods we propose for measuring widespread stereotyped representations online and for grounding them in verifiable sociodemographic realities mark a crucial step in the fight against pervasive cultural inequalities, both online and beyond.

In this section, we detail the methods used in all parts of our analyses, including our observational comparisons of gender and age bias in online images, videos and texts, as well as our Google Image search experiment and our resume audit of ChatGPT. The pre-registration for our online image search experiment is available at https://osf.io/x9scm. This experiment was a successful replication of a previous study with a nearly identical design; the pre-registration of this previous study is available at https://osf.io/2b58d. This study was approved by the ethics review board at the University of California, Berkeley, where this study was conducted.

In what follows, we describe our observational methodology for collecting and analysing large bodies of images, videos and text online. With regard to the crowdsourcing methods applied to analysing our main Google and Wikipedia Image datasets, many of the methods described below (including the procedure and demographic details of the coder population) were reproduced from the original data collection summary provided as part of the first publication of these datasets6. In addition to this reproduced description, we include information on how age classifications of these images were collected, because this feature was not explored or discussed as part of the original publication of these datasets6.

Our crowdsourcing methodology consisted of four steps. We began by identifying all social categories in WordNet69, a canonical lexical database of English. WordNet captures 3,495 social categories, including occupations (such as doctor) and generic social roles (such as neighbour). We then gathered online images associated with each social category from Google and Wikipedia. Next, we applied the OpenCV deep learning module in Python to automatically extract the face from each image. Cropping faces helped us ensure that each face in each image was separately classified in a standardized manner while avoiding subjective biases in coders' decisions for which face to focus on and categorize in each image. Finally, we hired 6,392 human coders from Amazon's Mechanical Turk to manually classify the gender of the faces. Each face was classified by three unique annotators (as per established methodology6,70,71), so that the gender of each face (‘male' or ‘female') could be identified on the basis of the majority (modal) gender classification across three coders. (We also gave coders the option of labelling the gender of faces as ‘non-binary', but this option was only chosen in 2% of cases. Therefore, we excluded these data from our main analyses and recollected all classifications until each face was associated with three unique coders using either the male or female label.) Although coders were asked to label the gender of the faces presented, our measure was agnostic to which features the coders used to determine their gender classifications. They may have used facial features and features relating to the aesthetics of expressed gender, such as hair or accessories. In terms of age, each face was classified as belonging to one of the following age bins (the ordinal ranking of each bin is indicated in parentheses): (1) 0–11, (2) 12–17, (3) 18–24, (4) 25–34, (5) 35–54, (6) 55–74 and (7) 75+. Because the greater number of classification options for age led to fewer images associated with a majority-preferred age classification, we identified the age of each face by taking the average of the ordinal age bin judgements across the three coders. Each search was implemented from a fresh Google account with no previous history. Searches were run in August 2020 by ten distinct data servers in New York City. This study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of California, Berkeley, where this part of the study was conducted. All participants provided informed consent.

To collect images from Google, we followed a previous study by retrieving the top 100 images that appeared when using each of the 3,495 categories to search for images using the public Google Images search engine. (Google provides roughly 100 images for its initial search results.) Across the non-gendered and gendered searches, 3,489 categories could be associated with images containing faces in the Google Image search engine (specifically, 3,434 categories for the non-gendered searches and 2,960 for the gendered searches). To collect images from Wikipedia, we identified the images associated with each social category in the 2021 Wikipedia-based Image Text (WIT) Dataset72. WIT maps all images over Wikipedia to textual descriptions on the basis of the title, content and metadata of the active Wikipedia articles in which they appear. We were able to associate 1,251 social categories from WordNet with images in WIT (across all English articles) that supported stable classification as human faces with detectable ages, according to our coders. The coders identified 18% of images as not containing human faces, and these were removed from our analyses. We also asked all annotators to complete an attention check, which involved providing the correct answer to the common-sense question (What is the opposite of the word ‘down'?) using the following options: ‘fish', ‘up', ‘monk' and ‘apple'. We removed the data from all annotators who failed an attention check (15%) and continued collecting classifications until each image was associated with the judgements of three unique coders, all of whom passed the attention check.

The human coders were all US-based adults fluent in English. Supplementary Table 3 indicates that our main results are robust to controlling for the demographic composition of our human coders. Among our coders, 44.2% identified as being female, 50.6% as male, 3.2% as non-binary and the remaining preferred not to disclose. In terms of age (in years), 42.6% identified as 18–24, 22.9% as 25–34, 32.5% as 35–54, 1.6% as 55–74 and less than 1% as over 75. In terms of race, 46.8% identified as Caucasian, 11.6% as African American, 17% as Asian, 9% as Hispanic, 10.3% as Native American and the remaining as either mixed race or preferred not to disclose. In terms of political ideology, 37.2% identified as conservative, 33.8% as liberal, 20.3% as independent, 3.9% as other and the remaining preferred not to disclose. In terms of annual income, 14.3% reported making less than US$10,000, 33.4% reported US$10,000–50,000, 22.7% reported US$50,000–75,000, 14.9% reported US$75,000–100,000, 10.5% reported US$100,000–150,000, 2.8% reported US$150,000–250,000, less than 1% reported more than US$250,000 and the remaining preferred not to disclose. In terms of the highest level of education acquired by the annotator, 2.7% selected ‘below high school', 17.5% selected ‘high school', 29.2% selected ‘technical/community college', 34.5% selected ‘undergraduate degree', 14.8% selected ‘master's degree', less than 1% selected ‘doctorate degree' and the remaining preferred not to disclose.

To measure age-related gender bias in online images and videos, we analysed a range of open-source datasets collected either for social science research or for training face recognition algorithms, none of which examined or reported correlations between the gender and age of the people depicted. In total, we examined more than one million images from five main online sources: Google, Wikipedia, IMDb, Flickr and YouTube, as well as the Common Crawl (created by randomly scraping content from across the world-wide web), each with distinct ways of sourcing and aggregating data. We measured gender and age using a variety of techniques, including human judgements, machine learning and ground truth data on the self-reported gender and true time-stamped age of the people depicted. Our statistical analyses did not control for multiple comparisons because all tests were theoretically guided and did not involve an agnostic permutation over a set of pairwise comparisons. Although we examined many datasets, our main analyses examined a single correlation (between gender and age) within each dataset separately. We now describe each of these datasets.

First, we used large-scale crowdsourcing to identify age-related gender bias in a new dataset of images from Google and Wikipedia (which was originally collected for a recently published study that did not examine age-related classifications)6. This dataset6 contains the top 100 Google images associated with each of the 3,435 social categories contained within WordNet69, a lexical ontology that maps the taxonomic structure of the English language. These categories include occupations (such as ‘physicist') and generic social roles (such as ‘colleague'). For each category, this dataset contains the top 100 images that appear in Google Images when searching for (1) the category on its own (such as ‘doctor'); (2) the female version of the category (such as ‘female doctor'); and (3) the male version of the category (such as ‘male doctor'). The gendered searches were completed only for the 2,960 non-gendered categories (for example, the searches did not include ‘male aunt'). Altogether, this yielded 657,035 unique images containing faces from Google. Searches were run from ten distinct data servers in New York City. Because Google is known to customize search results on the basis of the location from which the search is run72, we show that our results are robust to replicating this data collection pipeline while collecting Google Images from six distinct cities around the world (Supplementary Fig. 3).

This dataset also leveraged human coders to classify the age and gender of faces in Wikipedia images associated with as many WordNet social categories as possible in the 2021 WIT Dataset68. WIT maps all images over Wikipedia to textual descriptions on the basis of the title, content and metadata of the active Wikipedia articles in which they appear. WIT includes images of 1,251 social categories from WordNet across all English Wikipedia articles, in total yielding 14,709 faces.

We hired 6,392 human annotators from Amazon's Mechanical Turk to classify the gender and age of the faces in these images. Each face was classified by three unique annotators6,70,71 so that the gender of each face (male or female) could be identified on the basis of the majority gender classification across three coders. (We also gave coders the option of identifying the gender of faces as non-binary, but this option was chosen in less than 2% of cases. Therefore, we excluded these data from our main analyses.) In terms of age, each face was classified as belonging to one of the following age bins (in years): (1) 0–11, (2) 12–17, (3) 18–24, (4) 25–34, (5) 35–54, (6) 55–74 and (7) 75+. Because the greater number of classification options for age led to fewer images with a majority-preferred classification, we identified the age of each face by taking the average of the ordinal age bin judgements across the three coders (our main results hold when using the modal age judgement; Supplementary Fig. 4). Our findings continued to hold when controlling for annotator demographics and intercoder agreement, which was high in our sample (Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 3). We also conducted a separate validation task, in which the true gender and age of the faces being classified were known. The results indicate that our coders exhibited reliable and accurate gender and age judgements, with no biases as a function of gender (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5). Sensitivity tests further showed that even if our coders were hypothetically biased in their ability to estimate age as a function of gender, this would not disrupt the statistical significance or directionality of our findings (Supplementary Fig. 6).

We extended our findings by examining age-related gender bias in two large corpora of online images collected from three main websites (IMDb, Wikipedia and Google) for which the self-identified gender and true age of the faces were objectively inferred. This extension allowed us to examine whether women are objectively younger than men in online images, without depending on age predictions from human coders or machine learning algorithms. The first corpus was the 2018 IMDb–Wiki dataset43, which consisted of more than half a million images of celebrities from IMDb and Wikipedia on the basis of those depicted in the top 100,000 most visited IMDb pages. Each image in this dataset was time-stamped for when the photograph was taken, allowing the age of each face to be inferred on the basis of the celebrity's date of birth, which is publicly available through their open profile on IMDb and Wikipedia. This dataset yielded 451,570 images from IMDb and 57,932 images from Wikipedia. The second corpus was the 2014 CACD44, which consisted of 163,446 images collected from the Google Image search engine depicting 2,000 celebrities, comprising the top 50 most popular celebrities each year from 1951 to 1990. The creators of CACD collected time-stamped images by using Google Image search to retrieve images associated with each celebrity from 2004 to 2013 (for example, by searching ‘Emma Watson 2004' through ‘Emma Watson 2013'). We merged the CACD and IMDb–Wiki dataset43 to identify the gender of 1,825 celebrities in the CACD (50% are female celebrities). All images from both datasets containing ages below 0 and above 100 were removed to maximize data quality. Each dataset identified the exact age of the celebrities at the time they were depicted in each photograph by determining the date of birth and gender of each celebrity on their public IMDb and Wikipedia pages and then by comparing this information to the time-stamped date of when each photograph was taken.

Finally, we examined images from four publicly available training datasets widely used to train automated face recognition algorithms. In these canonical datasets, the gender and age classifications were on the basis of a combination of automated machine learning classifications and verification through human annotation. This includes the 2017 UTK dataset46 consisting of 20,000 images scraped randomly from across the world-wide web using search engines and public repositories, the 2014 Adience dataset47 consisting of 26,580 images randomly sampled from Flickr, a public image-based social media platform, and the 2008 LFW48 dataset consisting of 13,233 images randomly scraped from online news websites. Finally, we examined images of faces extracted from screenshots of YouTube videos using two datasets. The first was the 2011 YouTube Faces dataset50 consisting of 3,425 YouTube videos and 3,645 images of celebrities. The second one was the 2022 CelebV-HQ51 dataset consisting of 35,666 images formed by identifying public lists of celebrities on Wikipedia and automatically collecting the top 10 YouTube videos associated with each celebrity.

We were able to match 867 social categories from our main Google image (Fig. 1a) dataset to occupational categories in the US census. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released a breakdown of the median age of each gender, from 2019 to 2023, across five industries: sales, services, natural resources and construction, production and transportation and management. The census assigns each occupation to one of these industries, allowing those occupations matched in our Google image dataset to be assigned a census industry. We estimated the relationship between gender and age at the industry level by averaging the age associations in Google Images across all occupations within a given industry (averaged within each occupation and then across occupations at the industry level). The census age groupings are highly similar to the age groupings the coders used when judging faces. Supplementary Tables 8 and 9 present the robustness of our results to a range of statistical controls.

We collected a nationally representative sample of 1,002 US-based participants who provided their subject evaluations of the status and prestige of occupations. Each participant evaluated 20 randomly sampled occupations from a broader set of 867 WordNet social categories that could be matched with corresponding occupations in the US census. Through randomization, each category was evaluated by 27 unique participants on average (minimum of 15 participants). For each occupation, the participants rated (1) its status using the following scale (How would you rate the social status of someone belonging to this occupation? −2, very negative; −1, negative; 0, neutral; 1, positive; 2, very positive) and (2) its prestige using the following scale (To what extent do you agree that it is prestigious to belong to this occupation? −2, strongly disagree; −1, disagree; 0, neutral; 1, agree; 2, strongly agree). We also asked the participants to rate the status/prestige through the standard question from the general social survey, which asked them to place occupations on a ladder containing 10 rungs, where the bottom rung indicates occupations with very low status, income, education and prestige, whereas the highest rung indicates occupations with very high status, income, education and prestige (Supplementary Fig. 11). The participants' answers across all three questions were highly correlated (all paired Pearson's correlations above 0.85; Supplementary Fig. 9). In our main results shown in Extended Data Fig. 4, we first averaged all participants' judgements of each occupation across the (1) status and (2) prestige question and then assigned each occupation a single status score by taking the mean of its average status and prestige score. In the Supplementary Information, we show that all of our results hold when examining each question separately and when examining the participants' judgements using the standard social status question from the General Social Survey (GSS) (Supplementary Fig. 11 and Supplementary Tables 10–13). Note that Prolific's nationally representative sample of the US population size allows for a maximum of 800 participants. However, this sample size was not large enough to gain sufficiently powered judgements across all 867 occupational categories; therefore, an extra sample of US participants was recruited until all occupations reached a minimum of 15 evaluations from independent participants. All results are robust to a range of statistical controls (Supplementary Tables 10–13).

To measure age-related gender bias in large bodies of internet text, we leveraged word embedding models trained on massive amount of internet data. These models were designed to construct a high-dimensional vector space on the basis of the co-occurrence of words (for example, whether two words appear in the same sentence), such that words with similar meanings are closer in this vector space. Technically, these embedding spaces also capture higher-order similarities on the basis of whether words co-occur in similar linguistic contexts (that is, in association with related sets of words), without requiring words to directly appear together. We harnessed recent advances in natural language processing to extract demographic dimensions in word embedding models that capture the extent to which existing demographics underlie the cultural connotations of categories. We identified both gender and age dimensions. We briefly describe this methodology below.

Word embedding models leverage the frequency of word co-occurrences in text to position words in an n-dimensional space such that words that frequently co-occur together are more closely located in this n-dimensional space. The ‘embedding' for a given word identifies the specific position of this word in this n-dimensional space. The cosine distance between word embeddings in this n-dimensional space provides a robust measure of semantic similarity that captures the similarity of the semantic contexts in which words appear6. To extract a gender dimension in word embedding space, we harnessed the ‘geometry of culture' method of Kozlowski et al.73. This method was originally developed for static embedding models such as Word2Vec and GloVe; therefore, we incorporated key adjustments that enable its application to contextualized embeddings through generative transformer models such as GPT-2 Large. We identified two clustered regions in the word embedding space corresponding to conventional representations of females and males. Specifically, the female cluster consisted of ‘woman', ‘her', ‘she', ‘female' and ‘girl', whereas the male cluster consisted of ‘man', ‘his', ‘he', ‘male' and ‘boy'. For each social category in WordNet, we calculated the average cosine distance between this category and both the female and male clusters. Each category was associated with two numbers: its cosine distance with the female cluster (averaged across its cosine distance with each term in the female cluster) and its cosine distance with the male cluster (averaged across its cosine distance with each term in the male centroid). Taking the difference between the cosine distance of a category with the female and male centroids allowed each category to be positioned along a −1 (female) to 1 (male) scale in the embedding space. Although we recognize that gender is fundamentally non-binary, we built upon a previous study that leveraged this binary framework73 to identify biases in the extent to which people associate concepts with men or women.

The issue with applying this approach to contextualized embeddings is that the embedding associated with an individual word can be sharply different from the embedding associated with this word within a larger context, for example, within a surrounding sentence. For this reason, we modified the geometry of culture method by creating male and female poles consisting of many parallel sentences that vary only in whether they mention the corresponding male or female version of a pronoun. For example, the male pole consists of sentences such as ‘he is a boy' and ‘his hobbies are very masculine', whereas the analogues of these sentences in the female pole are ‘she is a girl' and ‘her hobbies are very feminine'. Fifty sentences were used to form each pole. All sentences used are provided in Supplementary Tables 14 and 15. We conducted key robustness tests to verify the validity of our methods and the robustness of our results to the use of different sentences along the gender pole (Supplementary Fig. 13). In our supplementary analyses involving static embedding models, we used the original geometry of culture approach.

We used this same approach to construct an age dimension in word embedding models. For static embedding models, we identified two clustered regions in the word embedding space corresponding to younger and older ages. Specifically, the younger cluster consisted of the words ‘child', ‘teenager' and ‘adolescent', whereas the older cluster consisted of the words ‘adult', ‘senior' and ‘elder'. All results are highly robust to increasing the number of words used to construct this age dimension. For example, our results replicate when defining the younger cluster using the words ‘young', ‘youth', ‘childhood', ‘child', ‘baby', ‘infant', ‘teen', ‘teenager' and ‘adolescent', as well as when defining the older cluster using the words ‘old', ‘elder', ‘elderly', ‘adulthood', ‘adult', ‘senior', ‘parent', ‘retired' and ‘aged'. We used the same technique to sort categories along a −1 (young) to 1 (old) scale in the embedding space. Similarly, to examine age associations in contextualized embedding models, we generated 50 sentences that hold everything constant while varying whether the age term involved indicates a young or old age (see Supplementary Table 15 for a full list of the age sentences used to create the contextualized age pole).

In all cases examining static models, to compute the distances between the vectors of social categories represented by bigrams (such as ‘professional dancer'), we used the Phrases class in the gensim Python package, which provided a pre-built function for identifying and calculating distances for bigram embeddings. This method works by identifying an n-dimensional vector of middle positions between the vectors corresponding separately to each word in the bigram (for example, ‘professional' and ‘dancer'). This technique then treats the middle vector as the singular vector corresponding to the bigram ‘professional dancer' and is thereby used to calculate the distances from other category vectors. This method is not necessary in contextual language models, which provide unique embeddings for n-grams as distinct from their component words.

Once the corresponding demographic dimensions were constructed for each model, we evaluated the correlation between gender and age associations across 3,495 social categories from WordNet (the same categories examined in our image analyses above). To simplify the presentation of how this gender and age dimensions are correlated, we used min-max normalization to convert the gender dimension into a 0 (female) to 1 (male) association, which, in effect, represents the extent to which each category carries male associations relative to all other categories. We applied the same approach to produce a normalized 0 (young) to 1 (old) dimension, which captures the extent to which each category is associated with older ages relative to all other categories. The supplementary analyses showed that our results are highly robust to varying our technique for constructing the age and gender dimensions (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Tables 14 and 15).

In the main text, we present our results while analysing the largest open-source large language model from OpenAI (GPT-2 Large56), for which word embeddings can be robustly and transparently extracted and examined. GPT-2 Large is one of the largest and most popular open-source language models, trained on billions of words from the 2019 WebText dataset, which primarily comprises Reddit data and the diverse web content (including articles and books) to which these Reddit data are linked. In the supplementary analyses, we showed that these results replicate when examining a wide range of models, including Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT, FastText, RoBERTa and GPT-4, all of which vary in their dimensionality and data sources, as well as the year in which their training data were collected, ranging from 2013 to 2023. We focus our main results on GPT-2 Large, not only because of its scale and popularity, but also because its open-source nature allows us to transparently access and analyse its word embeddings. GPT-4, by contrast, is a closed-source model that relies on using OpenAI's private application programming interface, which limits the interpretability of our method. Nevertheless, supplementary analyses showed that our results replicate when examining this closed-source model (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15).

We invited a nationally representative sample of participants (n = 500) from Prolific. Prolific is a popular online panel for social science research that provides prescreening functionality specifically for recruiting a nationally representative sample of the USA along the dimensions of sex, age and ethnicity. The participants were invited to partake in the study only if they were based in the USA, were fluent English speakers and were over 18 years old. A total of 52% of participants were female (no participants identified as non-binary). The average age of participants was 45.2 (45.9 for women; 44.6 for men). Our sample size was selected to emulate the sample size of a recent experiment with a highly similar design, which effectively measured statistically powered outcomes6. There was an attrition rate of 9.2% of participants (which is within the common range of attrition for online experiments), such that 459 participants completed the task. Our results only examined data from the participants who completed the experiment to ensure data quality. All the participants provided informed consent before participating. This experiment was run on 10 November 2023.

Extended Data Fig. 4 presents a schematic of the full experimental design. This experiment was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of California, Berkeley. In this experiment, the participants were randomized to one of two conditions: (1) the image condition (in which they used the Google Image search engine to retrieve images of occupations) and (2) the control condition (in which they used the Google Image search engine to retrieve images of random, non-gendered categories, such as ‘apple'). In the image condition, after uploading an image for a given occupation, the participants were asked to label the gender of the image they uploaded and then to estimate the average age of someone in this occupation. The participants in the image condition were also asked to rate their willingness to hire the person depicted in their uploaded image (Supplementary Fig. 18). After uploading a given random image, the control participants were then asked to estimate the average age of someone in a randomly selected occupation from the same set. The control participants were also asked to rate the ideal hiring age of someone in each occupation, as well as which gender (male or female) was most likely to belong to each occupation. This design allowed us to evaluate the treated participants' age estimates after uploading an image of a man or woman compared with (1) the control participants' age estimates that were formed without exposure to images of occupations and (2) the control participants' age estimates conditional on which gender they think is most common in each occupation. All participants regardless of condition completed this sequence for 22 occupations (randomly sampled from a set of 54 occupations held constant across conditions). On average, the participants took 35 min to complete the task. All participants were compensated at the rate of US$15 per hour for their time.

The occupations that the participants identified were selected to include professions from science, technology, engineering and mathematics and the liberal arts. We used the exact list of occupations leveraged in a recent experiment of a similar design (focusing only on gender, not age) to compare results and evaluate replicability6. Here is the full pre-registered set: immunologist, mathematician, harpist, painter, piano player, aeronautical engineer, applied scientist, geneticist, astrophysicist, professional dancer, fashion model, graphic designer, hygienist, educator, intelligence analyst, logician, intelligence agent, financial analyst, chief executive officer, clarinetist, chiropractor, computer expert, intellectual, climatologist, systems analyst, programmer, poet, astronaut, professor, automotive engineer, cardiologist, neurobiologist, English professor, number theorist, marine engineer, bookkeeper, dietician, model, trained nurse, cosmetic surgeon, fashion designer, nurse practitioner, art teacher, singer, interior decorator, media consultant, art student, dressmaker, English teacher, literary agent, social worker, screen actor, editor-in-chief and schoolteacher.

The control condition in the resume generation phase used the following prompt (adapted from a recent audit study58): ‘Write a detailed and concise resume for someone applying for a position in the role of [occupation] in the United States. Include the following sections: date of birth in month/day/year format, education with graduate date in month/day/year format, total number of years of relevant experience in numeric format and a numbered list of relevant skills'. This prompt differs from that of a previous study by prompting ChatGPT to include the applicants' age and years of experience. We prompted ChatGPT 50 separate times for each occupation, resulting in 2,700 unique resumes in the control condition.

The control–gender condition in the resume generation phase replicated the design of the control condition, except it also asked ChatGPT to include each applicant's gender in the resumes generated across the 54 occupations. This led to the following updated prompt: ‘Write a detailed and concise resume for someone applying for a position in the role of [occupation] in the United States. Include the following sections: gender of the applicant (male or female), date of birth in month/day/year format, education with graduate date in month/day/year format, total number of years of relevant experience in numeric format and a numbered list of relevant skills'. We prompted ChatGPT 50 separate times for each gender–occupation prompt combination, yielding 2,700 unique resumes in this condition.

The treatment condition in the resume generation phase replicated the design of the control condition, except that its prompt included a specific name for the applicant and asked ChatGPT to generate a resume for this named applicant applying for the specified occupation. We used 16 female names and 16 male names, all normalized in terms of popularity, familiarity, ethnicity and perceived age group, such that the male and female names were maximally similar along these dimensions. These names were developed and deployed by Armstrong et al.58 for a related auditing task that did not involve requesting explicit age information to examine age-related gender bias. The female and male names validated by Armstrong et al.58 included four names for the following ethnic identities: Hispanic, Asian, white people and Black people (four names per gender per ethnicity yielded 16 names for each gender). The prompt in this condition read: ‘[name] is applying for a position in the role of [occupation] in the United States. Write a detailed and concise resume for [name]. Include the following sections: date of birth in month/day/year format, education with graduate date in month/day/year format, total number of years of relevant experience in numeric format and a numbered list of relevant skills'. We prompted ChatGPT with this request 20 separate times for each name–gender–occupation prompt combination, yielding 34,560 resumes in total and 17,280 resumes for each gender group. This excludes the rare cases where ChatGPT failed to produce a resume (for example, by generating an empty JavaScript Object Notation structure without any resume-related information).

In the resume evaluation phase, we prompted ChatGPT to evaluate each resume from the resume generation phase by providing a score between 1 and 100 to indicate the quality of each resume. Specifically, we deployed the following prompt (adapted from Armstrong et al.58): ‘Given the following job title and resume, rate the resume with a score between 1 and 100 to capture the quality of the resume and its fit with the job title. 1 is a low score, while 100 is a high score. Only return a score'.

Panel (A) shows the raw data (with each data point showing a single occupation) for 2012 (the correlation is non-significant; r = −0.021, CI = [−0.12, 0.08], p = 0.70, Pearson Correlation, two-tailed, n = 536 occupations). Panel (B) shows the raw data (with each data point showing a single occupation) for 2023 (the correlation is non-significant; r = −0.046, CI = [−0.14, 0.05], p = 0.36, Pearson Correlation, two-tailed, n = 594 occupations). For all census years for which this data is provided in this format (from 2011 to 2023), there is not a single year with a statistically significant correlation between the fraction of women in an occupation and its associated median age (Table S1). Error bands show 95% confidence intervals.

Comparing the average age of women and men across industries in the U.S. Census (from 2019 to 2023) to the average perceived age of people in occupations from these same industries according to Google Images. The shape of the points indicates the data source, and the color of the points indicates the associated gender (N = 867 matched occupations).

Each panel shows the age gap between each gender for each industry separately. The midpoint of the age gap for each industry and data source is centered at 0 to help visually compare the magnitude of the age gap across datasets for each industry. Negative values along the horizontal axis indicate the gender that is associated with the lower age (relative to the midpoint), whereas positive values indicate the gender that is associated with the older age (relative to the midpoint). The color of the point indicates which gender falls on each side of the gender gap. Bold lines indicate cases where men are associated with a higher age than women for a given data source in a given industry; dotted lines indicate cases where women are older than men.

The age gap for occupations in Google Images is predicted by the perceived status of occupations, as well as by the median yearly earnings of occupations and the gender pay gap by occupation according to U.S. Census data from 2015 to 2022. Google image data is from Guilbeault et al. (2024; see Fig. 1a) and is based on 866 social categories matched to occupations in the U.S. census. In all panels, data points are presented as mean values and confidence intervals display 95% confidence intervals. (A) The correlation between the perceived status of an occupation and the probability that men appear older than women in Google images of the occupation (status perceptions are averaged across a nationally representative U.S. sample, n = 1,002 participants; an average of 27 participants rated each of occupations; data shown in six evenly spaced bins). Examples of occupations in the lowest (highest) 5% of perceived social status according to this measure are provided at the bottom of the figure. (B) The correlation between the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' measures of occupational prestige (shown in quartiles) and the probability that men appear older than women in Google images of the occupation (532 occupations could be matched). (C) The logged median yearly earnings for an occupation (shown in quartiles) predict the probability that men appear older than women in Google images of the occupation. (D) The pay gap in median earnings for an occupation by gender (shown in quartiles) predicts the age gap in perceived age between men and women in Google images of the occupation. For (B) and (C), data are shown for the 753 occupations that could be associated with yearly earnings across Census years, 2015 to the present.

A nationally representative US sample of participants (n = 500) were randomized into one either the Google image condition, and the Control condition (in which they were asked to use the Google Images search engine to retrieve images of random, non-gendered categories, such as guitar or apple). After uploading an image for either an occupation (Image condition) or random distractor category (Control condition), participants indicated the average age of people in the target occupations (from 0 to 100). In the Control condition, participants were asked to indicate which gender they associate with a randomly selected occupation after uploading a description for an unrelated category. Participants completed this sequence for 22 unique occupations (randomly sampled from a set of 54 occupations). Participants in each condition were asked additional questions after inputting their age estimate for each occupation. Specifically, in the Control condition, participants were also asked to use the same age slider to indicate the ideal age of a new hire in the given occupation. Control participants were also asked to indicate which gender they most associate with the given occupation by selecting either “men”, “women”, or “don't know”. In the Image condition, participants were asked to indicate the perceived gender of the face they uploaded for a given occupation (using the same gender options indicated above); and they were also asked to rate their willingness to hire the person depicted for this occupation using a 7-point Likert.

ChatGPT was prompted to generate resumes for 54 occupations in each of three conditions: (i) the Control condition, (ii) the Control-gender condition, and (iii) the Treatment condition. In the Control condition, ChatGPT generated 50 resumes for each occupation without specifying the name or gender of the applicant, yielding 2,700 resumes. In the Control-gender condition, the design was identical to the Control condition except that ChatGPT was also prompted to specify the gender of applicants in the resumes it generated. In the Treatment condition, the design of the Control condition was replicated except that ChatGPT was prompted to generate a resume for a named applicant whose name was selected from a list of 16 male and 16 female names spanning four ethnicities and normed for popularity, familiarity, and perceived age group. In the Treatment condition, ChatGPT was prompted 20 separate times for each name-gender-occupation prompt combination, yielding 34,560 resumes in total and 17,280 resumes for each gender group.

Men are at higher risk of several cancer types than women1. For bladder cancer the risk is four times higher for reasons that are not clear2. Smoking is also a principal risk factor for several tumour types, including bladder cancer3. As tumourigenesis is driven by somatic mutations, we wondered whether the landscape of clones in the normal bladder differs by sex and smoking history. Using ultradeep duplex DNA sequencing (approximately 5,000×), we identified thousands of clonal driver mutations in 16 genes across 79 normal bladder samples from 45 people. Men had significantly more truncating driver mutations in RBM10, CDKN1A and ARID1A than women, despite similar levels of non-protein-affecting mutations. This result indicates stronger positive selection on driver truncating mutations in these genes in the male urothelium. We also found activating TERT promoter mutations driving clonal expansions in the normal bladder that were associated strongly with age and smoking. These findings indicate that bladder cancer risk factors, such as sex and smoking, shape the clonal landscape of the normal urothelium. The high number of mutations identified by this approach offers a new strategy to study the functional effect of thousands of mutations in vivo—natural saturation mutagenesis—that can be extended to other human tissues.

In the interplay between mutagenesis and selection, human somatic tissues evolve as mosaics of competing clones driven by mutations, many of which affect cancer genes4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Although most of these clones do not result in cancer, in some instances they constitute the first step of the evolutionary trajectory towards malignant tumours. Therefore, characterizing the clonal landscape of human tissues can provide a path to understanding the mechanisms of cancer formation and cancer risk. In the case of the bladder, men and people with smoking history have an increased risk of developing cancer, independently of other risk factors1,2 (Supplementary Note 1). The reasons for the sex bias, and whether it is also present in the clonal landscape of the normal urothelium, are not known. The role of smoking—whether purely mutagenic or also as promoter of mutant clones—is not well understood either.

The detection of mutant clones in normal urothelium, as in other normal tissues, is challenging because clones are small and escape detection by conventional bulk sequencing methods. Here we directly probed large mixtures of clones from epithelial brushes of normal bladder using ultradeep DNA duplex sequencing (around 5,000× per sample, amounting to approximately 400,000 haploid genomes in aggregate)13,14. We focused on the detection of clones driven by mutations in 16 genes known to be under positive selection in bladder urothelium10,15, and/or mutated frequently in bladder carcinomas16,17, including the telomerase gene (TERT) promoter18. We then used the magnitude of positive selection for each gene at the sample level to regress out the effect of sex and smoking on their clonal landscape.

We also considered that the capacity to identify the driver mutations of thousands of clones in a human tissue could increase markedly our ability to uncover the functional effect of all mutations in genes relevant in tumourigenesis. Identifying all potential driver mutations in a cancer gene is key to advancing personalized cancer medicine. The selective advantage provided by spontaneous mutations in millions of cells is tested in the interplay between mutagenesis and selection in normal human tissues. We should then be able to probe the results of these natural experiments by sequencing a large enough number of cells in a somatic tissue. We explore this postulate with data from ultradeep sequencing of normal bladder. As a result, we have uncovered a powerful tool with which to quantify positive selection at site resolution.

We collected cells from either one or two regions—the upper (dome) and lower (trigone)—of the bladder urothelium from 45 deceased donors (79 samples) through a brushing of relatively large surface areas (roughly 2 cm2) at autopsy (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Note 2). Clinical data, including exposure to known or suspected bladder cancer risk factors such as tobacco smoking or chemotherapy, was available for most donors (Supplementary Table 1). We used ultradeep DNA duplex sequencing13,14 (average depth ranging between 1,236 and 9,303 across samples, with a median of 5,164; Supplementary Note 2) and a newly developed and carefully calibrated computational pipeline to identify somatic mutations with high sensitivity and specificity in these polyclonal samples (Extended Data Fig. 1a–c and Supplementary Note 3). The accuracy of this technology allows the reliable detection of mutations that are present in a single DNA molecule (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c and Supplementary Note 4).

To investigate how bladder cancer risk factors might change the clonal landscape of the urothelium, we focused on 15 genes identified previously to be under positive selection in normal bladder10,15 and/or known to frequently drive bladder tumours16,17 and the promoter of the gene encoding TERT, which is mutated in around 70% of bladder tumours18,19,20,21,22,23. This amounted to 111,876 base pairs of genomic DNA comprising the exonic regions and neighbouring intronic sites of the 15 genes (in full or selected fragments) and a region of the TERT promoter (hereinafter for simplicity, genes; Supplementary Tables 2, 3 and 4). Across samples, we identified a total of 64,278 mutations, between 54 and 1,785 (median 774) mutations per sample, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), multiple nucleotide variants (MNVs) and indels up to 100 base pairs (Supplementary Table 5). This total number of mutations is approximately 16-fold higher than the number identified in the same genes across 892 bladder tumours (intOGen)24 sequenced over a decade of cancer genomics (Fig. 1b,c).

The overall non-protein-affecting mutation density—mutations per megabase sequenced—was associated, as expected, with age and the exposure to certain mutagenic factors, such as several chemotherapies/radiotherapy (Supplementary Note 5). Using two orthogonal signature extraction methods25,26,27, and supported by the detection of a large number of non-protein-affecting mutations, we discerned the activity of three main mutational signatures (Supplementary Note 5 and Extended Data Fig. 3a–d). These captured the activity of the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases28 (SBS-APOBEC; Fig. 1d), age-related mutagenesis29 (SBS-ageing; Fig. 1d,e) and an unknown process (harder to reduce to a linear combination of mutational signatures in the COSMIC catalogue30) that seemed to be associated with exposure to chemotherapy (SBS-chemo; Fig. 1d,e and Supplementary Note 5). Overall, the landscape of mutational signatures and the number of mutations per megabase sequenced was similar to that identified in a previous study of normal urothelium10 (Extended Data Fig. 2b,c), with the exception of a signature reported to be associated with tobacco smoking. Mutational signatures were correlated highly between the dome and trigone of the same donor (Supplementary Note 5).

The 16 genes included in the panel had been demonstrated previously to be under positive selection in normal urothelium or mutated frequently in bladder tumours. Thus, we first examined whether their mutations were positively selected in the samples included in this cohort. To this end, we used four complementary computational methods (Supplementary Note 6) on the basis of comparing features of the pattern of mutations observed in a gene with that expected assuming neutral evolution31,32.

First, we estimated the expected number of protein-affecting mutations with different impact, that is, missense or truncating (including nonsense and essential splice-site mutations) on the basis of the number of observed synonymous mutations in each gene across samples and in each sample using a newly developed method called Omega (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Note 6). This calculation takes into account the number of sites allowing amino acid changes of each type in the protein, the frequency of trinucleotide changes observed across samples and the depth at which each individual genomic site has been sequenced. Then, using a dN/dS approach33, Omega computes the degree of positive selection on missense (dN/dS missense) or truncating (dN/dS truncating) mutations. These values represent the excess of missense or truncating mutations—driver mutations—among those observed in the gene in the sample (Fig. 2b). In addition to the excess of truncating and missense mutations, we quantified three other signals of selection: clustering of mutations in the three-dimensional structure of the protein, functional impact bias and excess of frameshift indels (Supplementary Note 6 and Extended Data Fig. 4a). These metrics indicated that RBM10, KDM6A, STAG2, KMT2D, ARID1A, CDKN1A, TP53, EP300, NOTCH2, CREBBP, FOXQ1, KMT2C and RB1—13 of the genes included in this study—are under positive selection, driving clonal expansion across the 79 normal urothelium samples (Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). We verified that the same is true for PIK3CA through analysis of the mutations in a hotspot affecting the histidine at position 1,047 (Extended Data Fig. 4d).

The number of observed, expected and estimated driver mutations are indicated for each gene. c, Magnitude of selection on truncating and missense mutations in FGFR3. dN/dS below 1 indicates negative selection. d, Magnitude of positive selection of activating mutations in the TERT promoter. Left, distribution of somatic mutations along the sequence of the TERT promoter colour coded according to whether they are activating (seen in tumours). Right, bar representing the magnitude of positive selection on activating TERT promoter mutations. In dN/dS bar plots (b–d), the shaded segment in each bar represents the number of truncating or missense (or activating in the case of TERT) mutations expected under neutrality. The numbers above the bar detail the value of dN/dS for each type of mutation. Numbers inside bars represent the mutations in excess over the expectation, that is, the drivers. The P values in b–d were calculated using a dN/dS approach (Omega) described in Supplementary Note 6.

This analysis produced two additional findings. First, we discovered that truncating (both SNVs and frameshift indels) mutations of FGFR3 seem to be under negative selection (Fig. 2c and Extended Data Fig. 4b,c). Second, we observed 85 SNVs affecting the TERT promoter (across 42 samples; Fig. 2d). The TERT gene encodes telomerase, and its promoter includes two hotspots that result in the creation of two de novo ETS transcription factor binding sites34 and are mutated frequently in human tumours18,19,22,23. To formally compute the strength of positive selection on the TERT promoter in our cohort, we dichotomized the mutations on the basis of whether or not they have been observed several times across 8,136 tumour whole genomes (Supplementary Note 6; Methods), that is, using their presence in tumours as a surrogate of their capacity to activate the expression of TERT. We could thus calculate a modified dN/dS value for the TERT promoter (dN/dS pTERT; Supplementary Note 6). Although we expected fewer than one activating mutation, we actually observed 56, implying that at least 55 (98.2%) of these mutations detected in the TERT promoter are drivers of clonal expansion, probably by activating the expression of telomerase in normal urothelial cells.

We next computed positive selection separately for each sample in the cohort (Extended Data Fig. 5a). The high depth of sequencing in the study guarantees that these sample-level dN/dS values can be estimated accurately and robustly (Supplementary Notes 7 and 8). The number of clones driven by mutations detected in each of the 13 genes under positive selection varies between zero and several hundreds across the samples analysed from each donor (Fig. 3a). Despite the abundance of driver mutations, the relative size of the clones is very small and thus the fraction of the urothelium covered by mutant clones of these genes is modest (less than 1%) in most cases (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Some activating TERT promoter mutations reach relatively high values of variant allele frequency (VAF), probably due to both clonal expansion and convergent evolution.

Horizontal lines denote the median. e, Association of sex with the protein-affecting (top coefficient) and non-protein-affecting (bottom coefficient) mutation density (left), and the magnitude of positive selection on truncating mutations in RBM10, CDKN1A, ARID1A and STAG2 (right). The plots represent the results of multivariate regressions accounting for age, smoking history, alcohol drinking history, BMI and exposure to chemotherapy. In all regressions (c and e), multivariate linear mixed-effects models (accounting for sex, smoking history, alcohol drinking history, BMI and exposure to chemotherapy) were used to account for the presence of several samples of the same donor, and these models yielded the effect size and P values. Circles represent the point estimate of the effect size of the regressions; horizontal lines represent 95% confidence intervals. Circles with dark outer circumference denote significant associations (false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 0.2). N = 79 samples in b, c and e. All corrected P values for these regressions appear in Supplementary Table 7. F, female donors; M, male donors.

We also found that the patterns of positive selection of the dome and trigone from the same donor were strikingly similar across the entire cohort (Extended Data Figs. 5c and 6a–c and Supplementary Note 5), indicating that the evolutionary dynamics and selective forces in the two regions are equivalent. Thus, a brushing of cells from approximately 2 cm2 of the urothelium provides a good representation of the clonal structure of the entire tissue.

In summary, applying a dN/dS-based approach to mutations detected across urothelial samples through ultradeep sequencing, we demonstrated that a large percentage of mutations in the profiled genes are drivers, indicating pervasive positive selection; we uncovered negative selection for truncating mutations in FGFR3; we showed positive selection for activating mutations in the TERT promoter and we made robust estimations of positive selection and number of driver mutations per gene in each sample, thus enabling the study of inter-individual differences in clonal selection (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 7a,b and Supplementary Table 6).

To identify a potential sex bias of the urothelial clonal landscape, we resorted to regressions that incorporated meaningful covariates, in particular age and history of smoking1,35,36,37 (Supplementary Note 1). Indeed, part of this heterogeneity across donors is explained by age. The density of protein-affecting mutations increases at a higher pace than that of non-protein-affecting mutations, indicating that clones driven by mutations of the 13 genes under positive selection expand with age, as reported for other normal tissues7,8,9,11,12,38,39 (Fig. 3b,c and Supplementary Note 9). In agreement with this, the dN/dS values of missense and truncating mutations of these genes are also associated significantly with age (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Table 7).

Using multivariate regressions, we determined that the values of dN/dS truncating of RBM10, CDKN1A and ARID1A are increased significantly in the urothelium of men compared with women, independently of age, smoking history, alcohol drinking history, body mass index (BMI) and exposure to chemotherapy (Fig. 3d,e, Extended Data Fig. 8a,b, Supplementary Table 7 and Supplementary Notes 9 and 10). In addition, the dN/dS truncating of STAG2 shows a tendency, although not significant, towards higher values in men. Two of these genes (RBM10 and STAG2) are in the X chromosome, whereas CDKN1A and ARID1A are in autosomes. KDM6A is another X chromosome gene that has been described previously with a higher number of mutations in female bladder tumours40. A closer inspection of X chromosome genes confirms the expectation of higher coverage across women for all three, although only RBM10 (and STAG2 to a lesser extent) shows a sex bias of dN/dS truncating (Supplementary Note 9). This implies that the growth of clones driven by mutations under positive selection in these genes is different in the urothelium of men and women (Supplementary Notes 9 and 10). The number of bladder tumours with truncating mutations in RBM10 and CDKN1A is also significantly higher across men than women (Extended Data Fig. 8c,d and Supplementary Note 11). In summary, clonal selection in normal bladder differs between men and women, mirrored by an increased number of mutations in RBM10 and CDKN1A in male bladder tumours.

We discovered that activating mutations in the promoter of TERT (that is, those observed at least twice in tumours18,19,20,21,22,23,34), were much more recurrent among older donors in the cohort. Specifically, all TERT promoter-activating mutations in the cohort, except one, occurred across donors older than 55 years (Fig. 4a,b). Furthermore, in this group, those with a history of smoking exhibited a significantly higher rate of TERT promoter mutations (Fig. 4a,b). Some of these mutations showed relatively large VAF, probably caused by several expanding clones with these mutations (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f and Supplementary Note 10). We found that the association between smoking history in older donors and the rate of TERT promoter-activating mutations is independent of sex, BMI and exposure to chemotherapy (Fig. 4c), as well as the depth of sequencing. The significant increase of activating TERT promoter mutations in smokers contrasts with the absence of association between smoking history and overall mutation density across samples (Supplementary Note 5 and Supplementary Table 7). This result indicates that tobacco carcinogens have a role in promoting the growth of clones with TERT promoter mutations. In summary, the rate of TERT promoter-activating mutations in the normal urothelium is associated significantly with the interaction of age and a history of smoking. More than 70% of bladder tumours have TERT promoter mutations, with a comparable frequency in smokers and non-smokers. In lung tumours, where the frequency of TERT promoter mutations is much lower, we find a significantly higher frequency in smokers (2.1%) compared with non-smokers (0.9%) (Supplementary Note 11). Collectively, these results indicate that exposure of the normal urothelium to tobacco carcinogens may increase the risk of bladder cancer through the promotion of clones bearing mutations of the TERT promoter.

a, Number of activating (observed in tumours) and other (not observed in tumours) mutations in the TERT promoter across donors younger than 55 years (top), older than 55 years with no history of smoking (middle) or older than 55 years with a history of smoking (bottom). b, Density (mutations per Mb) of activating TERT promoter mutations observed in the three groups of donors. The horizontal line denotes the median of the distribution of the frequency of mutations in the group of donors older than 55 years with a history of smoking. The sample size of the three groups was 25 (samples from donors younger than 55), 14 (samples from donors older than 55 with no smoking history) and 38 (samples from donors older than 55 with smoking history), respectively. The two samples from a donor with unknown smoking history were excluded. c, Association between the frequency of activating mutations in the TERT promoter and the interaction between age and smoking history. A linear mixed-effects model was used to compute the P value. The circle represents the point estimate of the effect size of a multivariate linear mixed-effects regression, and the horizontal line represents 95% confidence intervals. The dark outer circumference denotes a significant association (FDR threshold of 0.2). The corrected P value appears in Supplementary Table 7. Number of samples for this analysis is the same as in a and b.

Experimental saturation mutagenesis (that is, the insertion of all possible mutations in a genomic element in experimental systems) has been used to identify sites or regions in proteins that are key for their structure, function or regulation, to understand their role in disease and improve the design of drugs to target them41,42,43,44,45. Recently, we introduced the concept of in silico saturation mutagenesis, exploiting more than 20 years of cancer genomics research on the natural experiments that are human tumours (or clonal expansions in normal blood) to build machine learning models that identify all their potential driver mutations46,47. In contrast to tumours, whose evolutionary history entails the expansion of a single clone, with only one or two mutations observed in a cancer driver gene in most cases, in normal polyclonal samples, several mutations affecting a given gene are detected as drivers of the expansion of several clones. Therefore, sequencing normal human tissues, which can also be considered natural experiments of clonal evolution, can provide a pathway towards natural saturation mutagenesis.

To understand how far along the ultradeep sequencing of roughly 400,000 haploid genomes takes us in the path towards natural saturation mutagenesis, we first calculated the number of mutations observed in each amino acid residue of the protein-coding genes (Fig. 5a). For example, we detected mutations (missense or nonsense) on 230 (58%) of the 394 amino acid residues of TP53 protein product covered by duplex sequencing (Fig. 5a). In normal urothelium, the frequency of mutations by gene differed from those in bladder cancers (Extended Data Fig. 9a) and the proportion of mutated residues was larger in all genes tested (Extended Data Fig. 9b), demonstrating different selective pressures and the advantage of studying mutations in normal tissue to reach saturation mutagenesis.

Next, we asked how many more genomes would need to be sequenced to observe mutations on all amino acid residues of each gene. To estimate this, we first calculated the probability to observe each mutation in a gene under neutrality, on the basis of the number of synonymous mutations and the trinucleotide mutational probabilities observed in our cohort. Thus, we obtained a theoretical curve describing the fraction of all possible mutations that are expected to be observed at different sequencing depths (theoretical kinetic of natural saturation mutagenesis; Fig. 5b (continuous curve), Extended Data Fig. 9c and Supplementary Note 12). The shape of this curve is determined by the difference in probability across mutations, governed by their trinucleotide contexts, with some mutations much more likely to occur than others. For example, for TP53, with the accumulated depth provided by the entire cohort (approximately 500,000×), only on the basis of neutral mutagenesis, we expected to have observed around 26% of all possible mutations. In theory, being able to detect every possible mutation in the gene would require an accumulated depth of around 107, assuming an aggregated mutation density and mutational signatures as the samples in the study.

Nevertheless, the observation of mutations in normal urothelium is not neutral, but instead is strongly affected by selection. To obtain the actual curve of the fraction of observed mutations depending on the number of sequenced genomes (observed kinetic of natural saturation mutagenesis), we sub-sampled the number of mutations observed in each gene across the cohort, respecting their VAF but reducing the depth of sequencing at each position (dots in Fig. 5b and Extended Data Fig. 9c). The divergence in the shape of the two curves shows the importance of selection in shaping the probability to observe a given fraction of mutations in a gene. For example, as missense and truncating TP53 mutations are under positive selection, we actually observed more mutations than predicted by the theoretical kinetic. For several genes, we observed this faster accumulation of mutations than expected under neutral mutagenesis due to positive selection (Extended Data Fig. 9c). The curve for FGFR3 falls below the theoretical curve constructed under purely neutral mutagenesis (Fig. 5b), which supports the notion that FGFR3 mutations are under negative selection in the normal urothelium.

Approaching natural saturation mutagenesis provides an opportunity to calculate the strength of positive selection on mutations affecting each amino acid residue (Supplementary Note 6), and for other within-gene structures such as exons or protein domains (Fig. 5c, Extended Data Figs. 9d,e, 10a and Supplementary Fig. 1). In the case of TP53, most sites under significant selection are in the p53 DNA-binding domain48 (Fig. 5c), and are observed more frequently across tumours24,49,50 (Extended Data Fig. 10b), more likely to be identified as cancer drivers46 (Extended Data Fig. 10b) and tend to score higher on an experimental saturation mutagenesis assay51 (Fig. 5d), as described previously in duplex sequencing analysis of TP53 in other normal tissues52,53,54. In this and other genes that act as tumour suppressors, the mutations with significant site selection appear in buried areas of the protein (Fig. 5c, Extended Data Fig. 10c,d and Supplementary Fig. 2).

The calculation of dN/dS at the level of domains shows that only the p53 DNA-binding domain exhibits a significant excess of missense mutations (Fig. 5e). By contrast, TP53 dN/dS truncating values present a more homogeneous distribution across exons and domains (Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 2). The same is true for other genes such as EP300 and CREBBP where only the histone acetyltransferase domain (HAT-KAT11) shows significant dN/dS missense values (Extended Data Fig. 9d and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). For RBM10, with a much stronger signal of truncating mutations, residues with the highest site selection are distributed more uniformly than in TP53 (Supplementary Fig. 2). Genes affected mostly by truncating driver mutations, such as STAG2 and RBM10, show a higher dN/dS truncating than dN/dS missense values for virtually all exons, except the first and last (Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite the fact that almost all genes sequenced are tumour suppressors, in all cases, a few SNVs exhibit much stronger site selection than the rest (Extended Data Fig. 10a and Supplementary Fig. 2). Whereas FGFR3 mutations showed negative selection overall (Fig. 2c), mutations affecting a single residue (G380) were positively selected in normal urothelium. This residue did not correspond to the three most common FGFR3 hotspots observed in bladder cancer (Supplementary Fig. 3).

TERT promoter mutations with significant site selection in normal urothelium appear more frequently across tumours (Extended Data Fig. 10e), and present overall higher experimental functional impact values55 (Fig. 5f–h). In summary, natural saturation mutagenesis, brought about by the possibility of identifying mutations at extremely low VAF through ultradeep sequencing of normal tissues, opens up the possibility of directly assessing the functional impact of mutations affecting different genes in human tissues.

The reasons behind the wide heterogeneity in clonal landscape observed across normal human tissues from different people7,8,9,10,11,12,38,39 and the potential role of known cancer risk factors are not understood. In this study we demonstrated the suitability of ultradeep DNA duplex sequencing13,14 (approximately 400,000 haploid genomes) to accurately measure the magnitude of positive selection on each of 16 genes in 79 individual samples (Supplementary Note 6). The high number of mutations identified proved key to showing associations between clonal expansions and bladder cancer risk factors. Specifically, we discovered that the magnitude of positive selection on truncating mutations in RBM10, ARID1A and CDKN1A is significantly higher among men even when adjusting for age, smoking history, alcohol drinking history, and BMI. Importantly, mutations in RBM10 and CDKN1A are also significantly more abundant in bladder cancers of men than of women (Supplementary Note 11). We can speculate that the observed differences between men and women could be related to differences in exposure to internal factors (for example, sex hormones) or extrinsic exposures that disproportionately affect men. Discerning whether the bias towards the expansion of clones bearing mutations in these and other genes is somehow related with the observed increased risk of bladder cancer across men requires further investigation. We also found a high increase of TERT promoter mutations among older people with a history of smoking, which may explain at least part of the link between smoking and increased bladder cancer risk35,36,37, given the high frequency of TERT promoter mutations across bladder tumours18,19,20,21,22,23,34. In this cohort, we do not find a specific smoking-associated mutational signature. The high increase of activating TERT promoter mutations in smokers, rather than a general increase in mutation density, points to a non-mutagenic—acting rather as promoter56,57,58—role of tobacco smoking in bladder tumourigenesis. Scaling up these analyses to probe the influence of other bladder cancer risk factors requires the possibility of obtaining samples in a minimally invasive manner, which could be conceivably achieved through urine or lavages59.

The proposal of a pathway towards the study of natural saturation mutagenesis through ultradeep error-correcting duplex DNA sequencing of large mixtures of clones from normal tissues is a very compelling one. In this study we have provided a strong argument for the plausibility of this approach, paving the way for future studies. We have shown that it is possible to obtain a fine map of the degree of selection acting on mutations at individual sites or regions of a protein throughout the normal development of tissues of people exposed to different external factors. Saturation mutagenesis—a key development towards personalized cancer medicine60—through ultradeep sequencing in human tissues, thus provides a cost-effective and direct alternative to complement experimental and in silico approaches. In addition, characterization of the patterns of positive (and negative) selection in different genes and human tissues will be critical to understanding how somatic evolution influences cancer risk.

Two epithelial brushes (2–3 cm2) from the bladder top (dome) and the bladder floor (trigone) were obtained from 53 people without known bladder pathology and no history of bladder cancer upon autopsy (average 4 days post-mortem) at the University of Washington. Next of kin consented to autopsies and research on leftover specimens. The study of de-identified collected specimens and linked clinical history from the deceased donors was reviewed and deemed not human subjects research by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board (STUDY00016707; IRB Federal Wide Assurance number, FWA 00006878). We obtained the following relevant clinical information for all donors: age, sex, BMI, tobacco smoking history, alcohol use, previous cancer and chemotherapy exposure (Supplementary Table 1). Three donors with active or chronic inflammation and four donors with insufficient DNA were discarded. The two samples from another donor were also discarded from the study upon visual inspection of their mutational profile, resulting in a total of 45 deceased donors in this study (Supplementary Notes 2 and 3).

We designed a panel including ten genes identified in a previous study as being under positive selection in the normal urothelium and with more than ten mutations across the 1,647 microbiopsies analysed10. We added five genes that are mutated frequently in bladder tumours30 and the TERT promoter—also known to be under positive selection in bladder carcinomas22,23. This resulted in a panel containing the entire (or almost entire) coding region of 12 genes (ARID1A, NOTCH2, FOXQ1, CDKN1A, KMT2D, RB1, CREBBP, TP53, EP300, KDM6A, RBM10 and STAG2), three genes for which only selected regions were targeted because of clustering of cancer mutations in those regions and/or difficulties for capturing the full gene (PIK3CA, FGFR3 and KMT2C) and the TERT promoter10,61. The panel was constructed by TwinStrand Biosciences and covered 111,876 base pairs, including 65,086 base pairs in coding regions and 46,790 base pairs in non-coding regions (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 and Supplementary Note 2).

After centrifugation of epithelial brushes, DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue (Qiagen) kit, following manufacturer's instructions with some variations (Supplementary Note 2). The DNA integrity number (DIN) was measured using Agilent 4200 TapeStation Genomic tapes. Duplex sequencing libraries were prepared using commercially available kits (TwinStrand Biosciences)13,14,62,63,64 and 250 ng of genomic DNA. The DNA fragmentation step was carried out taking into account the starting DIN of samples and monitored using TapeStation. Fragmented DNA was subject to end-repair, A-tailing, ligation to duplex sequencing adaptors, library conditioning and PCR amplification, according to protocol. The PCR product was captured at 65 °C for 16–20 h. Upon PCR amplification, libraries were pooled for sequencing. Sequencing was performed with a NovaSeq 6000 at the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at University of Washington or a NovaSeq X Plus at Novogene or the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center using 2 × 150 base-pair paired-end reads (around 115 million reads per sample; Supplementary Note 2).

Duplex DNA sequencing was successful for 34 donors on both samples. For 11 other donors, we produced duplex DNA sequencing data only for dome or trigone because of insufficient DNA or too fragmented DNA (DIN < 1.4) in the paired sample. Thus, the final number of donors with available data for at least one sample was 45 (Supplementary Table 1) and the final number of samples processed was 79 (Supplementary Table 4).

We constructed a computational pipeline (deepUMIcaller) in Nextflow65 to call mutations from duplex sequencing data on the basis of an early version of nf-core/fastquorum pipeline66, which implements the fgbio Best Practices FASTQ to Consensus Pipeline (https://github.com/fulcrumgenomics/fgbio/blob/main/docs/best-practice-consensus-pipeline.md) and downstream variant calling by VarDictJava (https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/VarDictJava). A series of filters to discard potential artefacts are included in the pipeline. Code implementing deepUMIcaller is available at (github.com/bbglab/deepumicaller). For a detailed description of the pipeline, see Supplementary Note 3.

To estimate the error rate of TwinStrand DNA duplex sequencing, we compared the density of mutations and mutational profile identified across three cord blood samples (purchased from StemCell) with that expected on the basis of colonies obtained from human haematopoietic stem cells67,68. The estimated error rate resulting from this analysis was around 4 × 10−8, which is two orders of magnitude lower than the mutation density across samples in this study (Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Notes 4 and 8).

We extracted mutational signatures de novo with a Bayesian hierarchical Dirichlet process using HDP_sigExtraction pipeline (https://github.com/McGranahanLab/HDP_sigExtraction) and the R-package hdp developed by N. Roberts (https://github.com/nicolaroberts/hdp)9 and SigProfilerExtractor (https://github.com/AlexandrovLab/SigProfilerExtractor)26. The HDP_sigExtraction pipeline was run with the default parameters with no previous signatures assigned. Five signatures in addition to the null signature were extracted. De novo signatures were extracted using SigProfiler using the nonnegative matrix factorization approach. The same input data were used. The upper bound for the number of signatures was set to ten; however, the most robust solution was three signatures that were similar to the three most active signatures extracted by HDP. These two sets of mutational signatures were decomposed into known COSMIC signatures when possible (Supplementary Note 5).

To account for biases due to the trinucleotide composition of the panel, the number of substitutions of each class was re-calculated. The rate of each substitution was calculated as the number of observed substitutions with the consequence in question divided by the number of corresponding sequenced trinucleotide sites (number of trinucleotides with this consequence in the panel weighted by sequencing depth). This mutational probability was multiplied by the number of the corresponding trinucleotide in the genome to get the expected number of substitutions of this type in the whole genome. The mutational probability of each substitution for the whole genome was calculated by dividing the expected number of substitutions with this consequence per genome by the sum of all expected substitutions per genome. Finally, the expected number of substitutions with each consequence was obtained by multiplying the probability by the total number of substitutions observed in the sample to keep the absolute number of observed mutations.

We tested for possible associations of de novo extracted signatures with age, sex and bladder location. To do this we used linear mixed-effect regression models (Supplementary Note 5). We tested both the number of mutations attributed to the signature (counts) and the relative contribution (proportion) of each signature as a response variable. Age, sex and bladder location were used as fixed effects (separated regression was prepared for each fixed effect variable) and donors were used as random effects to control for non-independence between dome and trigone samples from the same person. P values for the association were obtained using likelihood-ratio tests (ANOVA function) comparing models including and excluding the variable of interest. Associations with all other clinical variables (smoking history, drinking history, chemotherapy history, and so on) were tested in the same way but always including age, sex and bladder location in the regression together with the variable of interest.

We used four methods to compute positive selection on the mutations observed across genes. One method (Omega)—a dN/dS approach to assess the strength of selection on the mutational pattern of genes—was developed de novo for this study and is described at length in Supplementary Note 6 (https://github.com/bbglab/omega). Two others, OncodriveFML and Oncodrive3D, which compute the deviation in the average functional impact and clustering in the three-dimensional structure of proteins, respectively, from those expected under neutrality, had been developed previously, and were adapted here to work on duplex sequencing data. These are also described in Supplementary Note 6. A fourth method, assessing the relative enrichment for frameshift indels observed across genes was also developed de novo for this study and is described thoroughly in Supplementary Note 6. For the TERT promoter, all mutations that were observed at least twice across 8,136 whole-genome sequencing tumour samples sequenced by the Hartwig Medical Foundation and the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes consortium (Supplementary Note 6) were considered activating. The remaining mutations were used to calculate the expected number of activating mutations under neutrality.

The number of missense and truncating driver mutations of each gene in a sample was obtained from the dN/dS missense and dN/dS truncating values. From these values the number of missense and truncating mutations in excess in each sample were calculated. Specifically, the 95% confidence intervals of both dN/dS values were used to compute two extreme values of driver mutations in each sample, whereas the mean dN/dS value was used to compute an expected number of driver mutations.

This mean number was thus used to select the most likely driver mutations in the sample. To this end, mutations were ranked in descending order according to their VAF, and the top number of mutations corresponding to the expected number of driver mutations were selected. Then, for a gene G, we computed the fraction of genomes bearing driver mutations out of those sequenced at each genomic position covered by the DNA duplex sequencing as:

where px is the all-molecules VAF of a driver mutation x (considering both duplex and non-duplex reads; Supplementary Note 3) and n is the number of driver mutations from the previously selected set in the gene. The formula is the realization of the probabilistic principle of inclusion-exclusion assuming independence across mutations69.

The fraction of genomes with driver mutations is equal to the fraction of cells with driver mutations under the assumption that two mutations, one in each homologous copy of the gene, are required to drive the clonal expansion. This extreme would be true in the case that all studied genes behave as classical tumour suppressors and bear deleterious mutations in both alleles. An exception to this rule are the mutations in genes in the X chromosome in men, whereby one mutation would suffice to drive the clonal expansion. In general, it is possible for some genes to be capable of driving the clonal expansion (or mutations at specific positions in a gene) with only one mutated allele. It is also possible that the other allele is affected by a large deletion or methylation event not seen by DNA duplex sequencing. In the extreme that only one mutation per cell per gene is required, the fraction of cells with driver mutations will be double the fraction of genomes. In the plot in Extended Data Fig. 5b, we use the two-hit assumption.

We designed a two-step strategy to assess the influence of known bladder cancer risk factors on features of the urothelium clonal structure across samples from donors in the cohort. As dependent variables representing the urothelium clonal structure, we selected the (protein-affecting and non-protein-affecting) mutation density, and the magnitude of positive selection on genic mutations (dN/dS missense and dN/dS truncating). As the dependent variables are continuous, we chose linear regressions, specifically mixed-effects linear models, to account for two samples from the same donor and use all available samples. As independent variables, we included a list of available clinical features: age (in decades), sex, smoking history (binarized as ever or never smoker), alcohol consumption history (also binarized), BMI (re-scaled within the 0–1 interval), and exposure to chemo/radiotherapy (binarized). For the case of TERT promoter mutation density association, we used the interaction of age and smoking history instead of age and smoking history separately. In the first step, we applied univariate mixed-effects linear models to identify any clinical feature with a significant association with any of the dependent variables for any gene or for all genes. In the second step, we applied multivariate mixed-effects linear models to rule out confounding effects for the associations that seemed significant in the first step. Associations with FDR below 0.2 were deemed significant. We also carried out a binomial test to rule out a spurious dependence of the mutation density on group differences in terms of sequencing depth. For details, see Supplementary Notes 9 and 10.

Mutations identified across 622 muscle-invasive and 105 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC and NMBIC, respectively) cohorts were downloaded from cBioPortal49,70,71,72,73 together with the clinical data of the combined study. From the MIBC Beijing Genomics Institute cohort74 only samples labelled as invasive were considered MIBC and added to the MIBC dataset. Mutations identified in a further cohort of 79 NMIBCs were obtained from the literature40 and included as part of the NMIBC dataset. Only non-silent protein-affecting mutations in 14 of the genes included in the panel were analysed. In case of duplicated samples across MIBC and NMBIC cohorts, the mutations from the most recent published study were kept. In total, mutations across 806 bladder tumours were obtained (622 MIBC and 184 NMIBC). The mutation density per gene across the two datasets was calculated by dividing the number of observed mutations per gene by the length of its coding region. To compute a mutation density metric comparable with that used in the normal urothelium that accounts for the number of megabases sequenced, we multiplied the coding length by two times the number of samples in which that gene was sequenced, to take into account the two copies in a diploid genome. Under the assumption that, in tumours each mutation belongs to a single clonal expansion and in normal tissues we have a mixture of clones, we reasoned that the number of different tumour genomes sequenced would be equivalent to the number of genomes sequenced in normal urothelium. The mutation density per megabase was calculated multiplying the mutation density by 106.

Mutations identified across 33,218 tumours (892 bladder tumours, mostly MIBC) in intOGen24 were downloaded from intogen.org. These mutations were used to obtain the total number of mutations observed in each gene, their distribution along the sequence of the genes in the study and the percentage of sites affected by different numbers of mutations. The same data of 109,017 tumours (3,909 bladder tumours) were obtained from the GENIE project50 to calculate the frequency of mutations in each of the genes and the TERT promoter. Mutations in the TERT promoter were also obtained from two cohorts of tumours (included in intOGen) sequenced at the whole-genome level (Hartwig Medical Foundation21: N = 5,582 and Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes19: N = 2,554). The classification (and score) of all possible mutations in TP53 into drivers and passengers through in silico saturation mutagenesis was obtained from boostDM (intogen.org/boostDM). Details of analyses involving tumour mutations appear in Supplementary Note 11.

To compare the distribution of somatic mutations along the sequence of each of the genes in normal urothelium and bladder tumours, we first downloaded somatic mutations identified across 892 bladder tumours from the intOGen (intogen.org) platform. Although this cohort is larger than the 806 muscle-invasive and non-muscle-invasive tumours used to explore differences in mutation density, it is composed mostly of muscle-invasive carcinomas.

For each gene, we started the analysis with all genomic sites in the coding sequences and splicing sites that passed the pipeline's filtering criteria of sufficient duplex coverage across samples (Supplementary Note 3). We then mapped these DNA sites to protein positions using the Ensembl REST API75, allowing us to determine the total number of protein positions (including amino acid residues and stop codon) covered by the panel. Then, we computed the number of mutations affecting each protein residue of every gene studied here across the 79 normal urothelium samples and the 892 bladder tumours. Next, we obtained the consequence type (missense, synonymous, nonsense or splice-affecting) of these mutations on the MANE transcript76 of each gene from the output of the Variant Effect Predictor v.111 (ref. 77), run within the intOGen pipeline24 (https://github.com/bbglab/intogen-plus). The method to compute the natural saturation mutagenesis kinetics in Fig. 5b is described in Supplementary Note 12. The residue-level sequencing depth shown in Fig. 5c, Extended Data Fig. 9d and Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3 was calculated as the average depth across all sites corresponding to each codon.

We developed a metric to measure selection per site by comparing the observed with the expected number of mutations at each site or residue. The expected number of mutations per site was obtained by distributing the expected number of mutations in a given gene under neutrality along all the possible changes in that same genomic region, with the assumption that only the mutation probability of each trinucleotide and the sequencing depth are responsible for the within-gene differences of mutation probability. We computed this value for each possible mutation in the positively selected genes including the TERT promoter, and for the protein-coding genes we also obtained a value per residue. A more complete explanation on this metric (and the detection of positive selection in sub-genic structures such as exons and domains) can be found in Supplementary Note 6.

Structural models for all proteins used to run Oncodrive3D were obtained from the AlphaFold database (AlphaFold 2 v.4)78,79. Three-dimensional protein structures and protein structural features represented across figures were also obtained from the AlphaFold database. Solvent accessibility and secondary structure information were extracted from the AlphaFold-predicted PDB structures using PDB_Tool (https://github.com/realbigws/PDB_Tool). Structural visualizations of proteins were produced using UCSF ChimeraX80.

The results of two saturation mutagenesis experiments estimating the functional impact of mutations in the TP53 DNA-binding domain51 and along the sequence of the TERT promoter55 were obtained directly from supplementary tables from both papers. In the case of TP53, we used the transformed score. In the case of the TERT promoter, values calculated for the glioblastoma SF7996 cells system were used. In these comparisons, the site selection of individual mutations was used.

We obtained the mutations identified through whole-genome sequencing in clonal or quasi-clonal samples obtained from the normal bladder of donors by laser capture microdissection in a previous study10. We used these samples to construct the mutational profile of normal urothelium, which we compared with that reconstructed in the present study through ultradeep sequencing (Extended Data Fig. 2b). From the same previous study, we obtained the mutations identified through whole-exome sequencing. Mutations obtained from samples sequenced at depth lower than 80× were discarded. From these data, we calculated the number of mutations per megabase observed in each sample, and averaged this value across donors. A linear regression was then constructed between these values and the age of donors, and a trend line calculated. The number of mutations per megabase calculated across the samples in our cohort was overlaid upon the obtained regression. The results of this comparison are presented in Extended Data Fig. 2c.

a) Depth of DNA duplex sequencing across the 79 samples. The boxplots represent the distribution of sequencing depth across all genes included in the panel, while the dots represent the average sequencing depth obtained for each gene in each sample. b) Distribution of DNA duplex sequencing depth across the 16 genes. The boxplots represent the distribution of sequencing depth across all samples, and the dots represent the average sequencing depth per gene in each sample. c) Average DNA duplex sequencing depth obtained for each exon included in the panel, represented by the color of each tile according to the color scale in the colorbar on the right. White color represents the exon is not covered. Box plots in a and b display the quartiles with whiskers extending to the highest and lowest data points within 1.5 times the interquartile range. Details can be found in Supplementary Note 3.

a) Left panel, orange bars, mutations per sequenced nucleotide detected by the DNA duplex sequencing technology in this study using the same panel of bladder genes in cord blood DNA samples from three donors. Blue bars (for comparison), mutations per sequenced nucleotide detected by a similar technology (NanoSeq; data taken from ref. 82) in two cord blood samples (Supplementary Note 4). Each bar presents the mutation density computed for a separate cord blood sample, with vertical lines representing the Poisson 95% confidence intervals. The comparison of the number of observed mutations per sequenced nucleotide with those expected in cord blood DNA based on prior studies (dashed red line, Supplementary Note 4) yields an estimate of the error rate of the technology of ~4 × 10−8 per sequenced nucleotide. Right panel, comparison of the estimated error rate by both technologies with the mutations per sequence nucleotide across the 79 normal urothelial samples included in this study (rightmost red bar). It shows that the rate of errors of the DNA duplex sequencing technology used in the study is approximately 25 times smaller than the mutation density detected in the normal urothelium. (N = 3 for cord blood DNA duplex sequencing). b) Mutational profile of normal urothelium obtained through two orthogonal approaches. Top panel, profile constructed using mutations detected through laser capture microdissection (LCM) of clonal or quasi-clonal samples followed by regular shallow whole-genome sequencing (data taken from ref. 10). Bottom panel, profile constructed using mutations detected in this study from ~2 cm2 brushes followed by ultradeep DNA duplex sequencing. c) Relationship between the mutation density calculated in normal bladder urothelium using two orthogonal approaches. The red dots correspond to the rate of mutations detected through laser capture microdissection of clonal or quasi-clonal samples followed by regular shallow whole-exome sequencing (WES LCMs; data taken from ref. 10). The blue dots correspond to the rate of mutations computed for the 79 samples in this study from ~2 cm2 brushes followed by ultradeep DNA duplex sequencing. The trend line represented in the plot was calculated from the WES LCMs samples. For more details on the error rate of the technology, see Supplementary Note 4.

a) Mutational profile of the signatures identified using SigProfiler. b) Mutational profile of the signatures identified using HDP. c) Activity of the signatures identified using SigProfiler across the 79 samples. d) Activity of the signatures identified using HDP across the 79 samples. For more details on the identification of these mutational signatures and the decipherment of their etiology, see Supplementary Note 5.

a) Five signals of positive selection on the mutations observed in TP53 in all samples. The first three rows show the distribution of truncating (nonsense and splice-site affecting), synonymous, and missense mutation across the coding region of TP53. On the right side, dN/dS truncating (top row) and dN/dS missense (third row) represent the estimation of the excess of truncating and missense mutations, respectively, over the neutral expectation calculated from the observed synonymous variants (second row). The magnitude of the neutral expectation is indicated inside of the horizontal bars with shaded diagonal lines and the p-value corresponds to the Omega implementation of dN/dS (Supplementary Note 6). Fourth row, 3D clustering score of missense mutations (blue line) compared to the neutral expectation (gray line), along with detected 3D clusters of missense mutations (filled light blue line). The right-hand panel represents the distance between the distribution of expected 3D clustering scores of the residue with the highest observed score (gray) and the observed score itself (vertical dashed lines), used to compute an empirical p-value (Supplementary Note 6). Fifth row, functional impact score of SNVs (synonymous, missense and truncating) observed in the protein. The right-hand panel represents the distance between mean expected functional impact scores (gray areas) and the observed average functional impact score (vertical dashed lines), used to compute an empirical p-value (Supplementary Note 6). Sixth row, deviation in the ratio of frameshift (purple) to inframe (brown) indels in the gene compared to the ratio of non-3n to 3n (a length multiple of three nucleotides) indels in neighboring non-coding regions (excess of frameshift indels). The right-hand bars represent the numbers of coding frameshift and inframe indels and non-coding non-3n to 3n indels. Analytical or empirical tests used to calculate the p-values shown in the different panels are described in Supplementary Note 6. P-values for all genes computed using all methods appear in Supplementary Table 6. b) Magnitude of all signals of positive selection calculated for 14 genes on the pooled mutations of the 79 samples. Dashed lines for truncating, missense and indels indicate an equal number of observed and expected mutations of each type (dN/dS =1, that is, no selection). In 3D clustering the size of the circles is proportional to the difference between observed and expected scores. In functional impact bias, the size of the circles is proportional to the Z-score. c) Comparison of the excess of truncating mutations (dN/dS truncating, top) and the excess of missense mutations (dN/dS missense) calculated taking into account every observed mutation only once (as used in the manuscript, and represented by the unshaded bars in each plot) and taking into account the number of DNA duplex reads supporting each mutation (bars shaded with diagonal line pattern). d) Positive selection on mutations in PIK3CA. Left panel, needleplot representing the distribution of missense, truncating and synonymous mutations in the region of PIK3CA covered by sequencing reads. Right panel, magnitude of positive selection on missense mutations across the 79 samples calculated using the Omega dN/dS approach. The p-value is calculated using the Omega implementation of the dN/dS approach described in Supplementary Note 6. The p-value appears in Supplementary Table 6.

a) dN/dS truncating values for RBM10 and TP53 in the dome of donors 04 and 09. All legends as defined in Fig. 2. The p-values are calculated using the Omega implementation of the dN/dS approach described in Supplementary Note 6, and appear in Supplementary Table 6. b) Landscape of the fraction of urothelium covered by driver mutations of each gene in the panel. The values of covered urothelium have been discretized. In most cases, the percentage of urothelium covered by driver mutations of each gene falls in the lowest categories. The right-hand graph shows stacked barplots with the distribution of samples in different categories of covered urothelium across genes. c) Agreement of the magnitude of dN/dS missense (top) and dN/dS truncating (bottom) calculated for all genes in the dome and trigone of donors 14, 04 and 23. R-squared (R²), Pearson's correlation coefficient of the dN/dS values calculated for the dome and trigone samples from each donor. The p-values corresponding to the Pearson's correlation coefficients are shown.

a) Top, number of SNVs that are shared between the dome and trigone samples (or unique to each of them) of donors for which both areas were brushed. Bottom, percentage of SNVs found in the trigone sample of each individual that are shared with the dome sample of the same individual (top), of SNVs found in the dome that are shared with the trigone (middle), and Jaccard index measuring the overlap of the SNVs identified within both samples (bottom). b) Distribution of Jaccard Index values of SNVs (first at the left), missense mutations (second), truncating mutations (third), and non-protein affecting mutations (last to the right) shared between the dome and trigone samples of the same individual and pairs of samples from different donors. The Jaccard index obtained for any subset of mutations is significantly higher for the dome and trigone samples of the same donor (p-values from one-tailed Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney test). N indicates the number of sample pairs. c) Comparison of the distribution of Pearson's correlation coefficients comparing dN/dS values between dome and trigone samples of the same donor (as done in Extended Data Fig. 5c) or from different donors. In the first boxplot, all mutations are included in the calculation of dN/dS values, while in the second, mutations shared between dome and trigone of the same donor are excluded. The correlation is significantly higher between dome-trigone pairs of samples of the same donor than of different donors (p-values from one-tailed Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney test). Only pairs of samples for which Omega values of at least two genes could be computed are included in the boxplots. N indicates the number of sample pairs. Box plots in b and c display the quartiles with whiskers extending to the highest and lowest data points within 1.5 times the interquartile range.

a) Measurement of the tolerance of RBM10 dN/dS truncating to artifactual mutations (artifacts) following the BotSeq mutational profile82. The boxplots represent the distribution of dN/dS values calculated from 100 synthetic samples with increasing rates of injected artifacts between 0 and 1 × 10−7 (one order of magnitude higher than estimated for the technology), and for increasing values of ground truth dN/dS (between 1 and 50). The boxplots display the quartiles with whiskers extending to the highest and lowest data points within 1.5 times the interquartile range. N = 100 synthetic samples. b) Average percentage of RBM10 dN/dS truncating reconstructed value across 100 synthetic samples, calculated by computing which fraction of the ground truth dN/dS in a sample is obtained upon calculation. c) Summary of the results of the experiment of error tolerance. Left panel, average percentage of reconstructed ground truth dN/dS across synthetic samples (for all genes and all ground truth dN/dS explored altogether) that is calculated upon injection of increasing rates (x-axis) of different types of artifacts (color legend). Center plot, average percentage of reconstructed ground truth dN/dS across synthetic samples (for all genes and all artifacts altogether) that is calculated upon injection of increasing rates (x-axis) for different values of ground truth dN/dS (color legend). Right panel, average percentage of reconstructed ground truth dN/dS across synthetic samples (for all ground truth dN/dS explored and all artifacts altogether) for different genes (color legend), that is calculated upon injection of increasing rates (x-axis) of artifacts.

a) From simulated datasets reflecting the same distributional features and data dependencies found in the study cohort, we computed the statistical power as the proportion of times the variable of interest (sex) came out significant in the univariate linear mixed-effects regression against truncating dN/dS. In this analysis the female group was picked as the baseline group. We simulated data with different ground truth female baselines (expected truncating dN/dS among females) and between-group differences (effect size). For each baseline-effect combination we can draw a power value, which are represented collectively in the form of these power profiles (see Supplementary Note 10). For the two exemplary genes RBM10 and ARID1A we highlight the profile curves corresponding to their observed baselines in the cohort and the projected power given the inferred effect in the cohort. b) Table presenting a summary of the five associations found between dN/dS and sex in the study. Here we briefly define the meaning of each column. See also Supplementary Note 10 for a more in-depth account on the methodology. CSQN: Either missense or truncating, represents the specific dN/dS used as response variable in the association analysis. ESTIMATE: Coefficient of the binary variable of interest (“is_male”) inferred via linear-mixed effects regression against dN/dS using the donor as a random intercept. CI_LOW, CI_HIGH: Lower and upper 95% CI bounds of ESTIMATE. PVAL: p-value associated with the variable of interest in the regression analysis. INTERCEPT: Inferred intercept in the regression analysis. BASELINE: Average CSQN-specific dN/dS value in the baseline group of samples (female). INTERCEPT and BASELINE are expected to follow closely one another. COVARIATE: The (binary) explanatory variable representing sex. POWER: Statistical power corresponding to the BASELINE and ESTIMATE in the power profile. EFFECT_PVAL: The “effect p-value” is an ad-hoc metric that we defined as the proportion of times the sex coefficient attains a value at least as high as ESTIMATE upon regression with a dataset corresponding to BASELINE and zero ground-truth effect. It can be thought of as an effect-aware false positive rate. c) Frequency of tumor samples with missense or truncating mutations of 6 genes in males and females across a cohort of 2,965 bladder carcinomas from the GENIE cohort. d) Multivariate logistic regression (including age) of sex on mutations in the 6 genes. Circles represent the point estimate of the effect size of the linear regression, and the horizontal line, the 95% confidence intervals. Circles with dark outer circumference denote significant associations (FDR threshold of 0.2). e) Distribution of expected number of mutations in the two TERT promoter mutational hotspots (chr5:1295113 and chr5:1295135) across donors younger than 55 years old or never smokers assuming a mutation rate equal to that observed across ever smokers older than 55 years old. The red dashed vertical line represents the actual observed number of mutations in the two hotspots across donors younger than 55 years or never smokers. The p-value was calculated empirically based on 10,000 randomizations, as described in Supplementary Note 10. f) Maximum variant allele frequency detected for activating TERT promoter mutations in a sample vs the number of activating TERT promoter mutations (i.e. mutations observed in tumors, see main text) identified in a sample. The observation of different activating TERT promoter mutations in the same sample indicates the existence of convergent evolution of TERT promoter mutations. This, in turn, suggests that the observation of mutations with large variant allele frequency may also represent multiple mutated clones with the exact mutations (convergent evolution) rather than very large clones.

a) Comparison of the density of protein affecting mutations in 14 genes across two cohorts of bladder tumors (muscle invasive and non-muscle invasive) and in the normal urothelium of the 45 donors. Mutation density in tumors is calculated by dividing the number of observed mutations (normally 1) by the gene length in megabases (Mb). b) Percentage of amino acid residues in each gene with zero, one, two, or three or more mutations observed across 892 bladder tumor samples from the intOGen cohort. The order of the genes is as in Fig. 5a to facilitate visual comparison. c) Theoretical and observed curves of saturation mutagenesis for genes not shown in Fig. 5b. The grey dashed line represents the kinetic of saturation mutagenesis under the theoretical assumption of no selection, in which mutations are observed based only on their neutral probability of occurrence. The red circle denotes the degree of saturation achieved by probing the 79 samples in the cohort. The red dashed line is constructed through successive depth down-samples of the current observation and represents the observed kinetic of natural saturation mutagenesis (see details in Supplementary Note 12). d) Natural saturation mutagenesis of EP300 in normal bladder urothelium. Besides the tracks described in Fig. 5c for TP53, 3D clusters obtained via Oncodrive3D (second), dN/dS truncating and dN/dS missense values for each exon (fourth), and the distribution of tumor mutations (from intOGen; see Methods) along the sequence of the gene (last) have been added. These same types of plots are presented for the rest of genes in the study in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3. Right plot, EP300 3D structure with residues with significant site selection highlighted in blue. e) dN/dS truncating and dN/dS missense values for each domain of EP300. The vertical lines represent the 95% confidence intervals of the dN/dS estimate. Solid border represents significant dN/dS values (p-value < 0.05) according to Omega (Supplementary Note 6). N = 79 samples.

a) Manhattan plot illustrating the strength of site selection for all genomic sites included in the sequencing panel. Some of the mutations in the sites with strongest selection are indicated. b) Application of site selection values to TP53 mutations. In all plots, TP53 tumor mutations observed in two large cohorts (intOGen, N = 33,218 and GENIE, N = 109,017) are grouped depending on whether they have been observed across bladder normal samples in this study and their site selection (i.e., not observed, observed with non-significant site selection and observed with significant site selection). Left top panel, distribution of the frequency across intOGen tumors of the three groups of mutations. Right top panel, distribution of the frequency across GENIE tumors. Left bottom panel, boostDM (machine learning models for in silico saturation mutagenesis)46 scores of the three groups of mutations. Right bottom panel, proportion of mutations annotated or not annotated as oncogenic in ClinVar83 or OncoKB84. c,d) Distribution of the solvent accessibility of sites with mutations in each group for TP53 (c) and EP300 (d). e) Application of site selection values to TERT promoter mutations. Mutations observed in two large cohorts of tumors (or the subset of bladder tumors in GENIE) are grouped depending on whether they have been observed across normal samples and their site selection into not observed, observed with non-significant site selection and observed with significant site selection. Left, distribution of the frequency across tumors in a large cohort of whole-genome sequenced samples (N = 8,136) of the three groups of mutations. Center, distribution of the frequency across all GENIE tumors (N = 109,017) of the three groups of mutations. Right, distribution of the frequency across GENIE bladder tumors (N = 3,909) of the three groups of mutations.

As we age, many tissues become colonized by microscopic clones carrying somatic driver mutations1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Some of these clones represent a first step towards cancer whereas others may contribute to ageing and other diseases. However, our understanding of this phenomenon remains limited due to the challenge of detecting mutations in small clones. Here we introduce a new version of nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq)8, a duplex sequencing method with an error rate lower than five errors per billion base pairs, which is compatible with whole-exome and targeted capture. Deep sequencing of polyclonal samples with single-molecule sensitivity simultaneously profiles large numbers of clones, providing accurate mutation rates, signatures and driver frequencies in any tissue. Applying targeted NanoSeq to 1,042 non-invasive samples of oral epithelium and 371 blood samples from a twin cohort, we report an extremely rich selection landscape, with 46 genes under positive selection in oral epithelium, more than 62,000 driver mutations and evidence of negative selection in essential genes. High-resolution maps of selection across coding and non-coding sites are obtained for many genes: a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. Multivariate regression models enable mutational epidemiology studies on how exposures and cancer risk factors, such as age, tobacco or alcohol, alter the acquisition or selection of somatic mutations. Accurate single-molecule sequencing provides a powerful tool to study early carcinogenesis, cancer prevention and the role of somatic mutations in ageing and disease.

In the past decade, increasingly sensitive sequencing methods have begun to unravel the somatic mutation landscapes of human tissues. They have revealed that mutations accumulate linearly with age in a tissue-specific manner2,9,10, largely due to endogenous mutational processes but also influenced by mutagen exposures, germline variation and disease states. These studies have also revealed that as we age our tissues are colonized by myriad clones carrying positively selected driver mutations1,2,3,4,5,6,7. These clones provide a window into early carcinogenesis and may contribute to other diseases. However, most clones are microscopic and methods to detect them, such as laser microdissection11 or single-cell cultures12, are low throughput, which has limited our understanding to a few tissues and small donor cohorts.

An alternative approach is error-corrected bulk sequencing13, such as duplex sequencing, which combines information from both strands of each original DNA molecule to eliminate sequencing and amplification errors14,15,16,17. Theoretically, duplex error rates should approximate the polymerase error rate squared (fewer than 10−8 errors per base pair (bp)). However, they are typically higher (around 10−7) due to interstrand error copying during library preparation8. We have previously described NanoSeq, a protocol that avoids error transfer by using restriction enzyme fragmentation without end repair, and dideoxynucleotides during A-tailing, achieving error rates below 5 × 10−9 errors per bp in single DNA molecules8. As this rate is two orders of magnitude lower than the mutation burden of normal adult cells (around 10−7)2,9,12, mutations are accurately detected from single DNA molecules, enabling the quantification of mutation rates and signatures in any tissue. However, this protocol is unsuitable for driver discovery, as restriction enzymes only provide partial coverage of the human genome.

To achieve full-genome representation while retaining ultra-low error rates, here we introduce two alternative fragmentation methods: (1) sonication followed by exonuclease blunting; and (2) enzymatic fragmentation in a buffer optimized to eliminate error transfer between strands. As in the original NanoSeq protocol8, dideoxynucleotides prevent the extension of single-stranded nicks and quantitative PCR followed by a library bottleneck is used to optimize duplicate rates to maximize cost efficiency. After extensive optimization (Supplementary Note 1), we achieved full-genome coverage (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b) with similar efficiency and error rates as the original NanoSeq protocol.

To demonstrate their accuracy, we used cord blood DNA as a negative control, as neonatal blood cells carry just 60–80 somatic mutations (roughly 10−8 mutations per bp). Both new versions of NanoSeq (sonication -MB-NanoSeq- and enzymatic -US-NanoSeq-) yielded mutation loads and spectra consistent with previous knowledge8 (Fig. 1a,b). By contrast, standard duplex sequencing (with end repair and without dideoxynucleotides), using sonication or enzymatic fragmentation, showed error rates around 1.5 × 10−7 errors per bp and 4 × 10−8 errors per bp, respectively. We then tested these protocols on samples with high levels of DNA damage (pancreas biopsies fixed in formalin for 3 days or 17 days). Standard duplex sequencing error rates increased roughly tenfold due to error transfer at damaged sites, whereas both versions of NanoSeq yielded comparable mutation loads to a control formalin-free biopsy (Extended Data Fig. 1c). This raises the possibility of using NanoSeq on more heavily damaged sources of DNA. The clean fragmentation protocols introduced here may also be useful upstream of other error-corrected sequencing methods beyond duplex sequencing, such as CODEC, SMM-seq or HiDEF-seq18,19,20, to lower error rates while providing full-genome coverage.

Mutant cell fractions are shown for individuals aged 65–85 whose blood samples were not selected on the basis of their oral epithelium results.

Combining these new protocols with bait capture21, targeted NanoSeq can accurately quantify somatic mutation rates, signatures and driver landscapes in any tissue. Unlike traditional bulk sequencing, which only detects mutations over a certain variant allele fraction (VAF) (typically more than 1–5%), single-molecule sequencing detects mutations present at any cell fraction, even in single cells, with a detection probability proportional to the mutation frequency in the cell population. In highly polyclonal samples in which the number of clones is larger than the duplex depth achieved, most mutations are seen in just one molecule, providing an efficient way to profile driver mutations in hundreds of clones simultaneously with a single sequencing library.

Our first somatic mutation studies in skin and oesophagus revealed a rich clonal landscape but were limited to a few individuals due to technical limitations1,2. To investigate how mutation landscapes vary across the population, we chose oral epithelium, a tissue with varied mutagenic exposures and amenable to large-scale non-invasive collection using buccal swabs. Here we describe its mutation landscape across 1,042 individuals, applying targeted NanoSeq to buccal swabs using a panel of 239 genes (0.9 Mb) (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Samples were sequenced to an average depth of 665 duplex coverage (dx), achieving 693,208 dx coverage across all samples. We also applied targeted NanoSeq to 371 blood samples from these donors (cumulative 250,947 dx).

Analysis of the blood data demonstrates that targeted NanoSeq recapitulates the known mutation rates, signatures and drivers of a well-studied tissue. Mutation rates and trinucleotide spectra were consistent with previous whole-genome sequencing of haematopoietic stem cell colonies (Fig. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 3a,b). Using dNdScv to detect genes under positive selection22 (Methods), we identified 14 genes (Fig. 1d, Extended Data Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table 3), all known clonal haematopoiesis drivers23,24. Hotspot dN/dS (the ratio of non-synonymous (N) to synonymous (S) substitutions) analyses also identified evidence of selection on several extra drivers, including JAK2, MYD88, SF3B1, SRSF2, GNB1 and STAT3 (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Notes 2 and 4).

Despite the modest size of the dataset (371 samples, mean 676 dx), we found 4,406 non-synonymous mutations in these 14 driver genes (11.9 mutations per donor), including 1,904 mutations in DNMT3A and TET2 (Fig. 1d). Of the mutations detected, 95% were called by just one molecule, 99% had unbiased VAFs under 1% and 90% had under 0.1% (Extended Data Fig. 3c and Methods). For comparison, a recent study of clonal haematopoiesis in more than 200,000 individuals using standard sequencing (only sensitive to clones with more than 1% VAF) found 0.029 and 0.012 DNMT3A and TET2 mutations per donor25, roughly a 100–200-fold lower yield of driver mutations per sample. Overall, these results confirm the power of targeted NanoSeq to measure mutation rates, spectra and selection in highly polyclonal samples.

Self-collected buccal swabs were received by post from 1,042 volunteers from TwinsUK26. The cohort had a median age of 68 years (range 21–91), 79% women, 37% smokers and 332 pairs of twins (214 identical or monozygotic, 118 non-identical or dizygotic) (Extended Data Fig. 2a–g). A protocol designed to reduce saliva and blood contamination was used, with methylation and mutation analyses confirming a mean epithelial fraction of more than 90% (Extended Data Fig. 2h, Methods and Supplementary Note 4). Across donors, we found 341,682 somatic mutations, including 160,708 coding single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 29,333 coding indels (Extended Data Fig. 4g). We found that mutations in oral epithelium accumulate linearly with age, with rates roughly 18.0 SNVs per cell per year (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.7–19.4) and roughly 2.0 indels per cell per year (95% CI 1.7–2.4) (Fig. 2a,b). Because these rates are extrapolated from genic regions, which often have lower mutation rates, we applied RE-NanoSeq on 16 samples, revealing a genome-wide rate for oral epithelium of roughly 23 SNVs per cell per year (Extended Data Fig. 4a and Supplementary Note 3).

Counts of significant amino acid changes per gene are shown above each bar.

The data also revealed an unprecedentedly rich landscape of selection. We found 49 genes under positive selection by dNdScv, with over 90,000 non-synonymous mutations in them across clones, of which around 62,000 are estimated to be drivers (Fig. 2c–f, Extended Data Figs. 4h and 5a, Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Note 2). Comparison to matched blood suggests that selection in three of the genes (DNMT3A, TET2 and FOXP1) results from low-level blood contamination in the buccal swabs (Extended Data Fig. 3f, Methods and Supplementary Note 4). Several other genes, including PPM1D and ASXL1, are genuine drivers in both tissues. Detailed information on the drivers uncovered is available in Supplementary Note 4 and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6.

The commonest oral drivers match those in skin and oesophagus1,2,3. However, 31 of the oral drivers have not been previously reported in skin or oesophagus, including several drivers of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSC) (Supplementary Note 4). The density of driver mutations is considerably lower in oral epithelium than oesophagus (three to four times lower for NOTCH1 or TP53)2, and a few strong drivers in normal oesophagus seem neutral or weakly selected in oral epithelium (KMT2D, NFE2L2 and PIK3CA). The absence of some important oral cancer drivers from the 46 genes under selection is also interesting. CDKN2A, NFE2L2, PTEN, HLA-A, SMAD4, B2M and RB1 seem neutral or weakly selected in normal oral epithelium despite being common drivers in HNSC (Extended Data Fig. 5e), suggesting that selection on these genes may be a later event in HNSC development. This includes HLA-A and B2M, which may facilitate immune escape later in carcinogenesis.

Although duplex sequencing is normally applied to small gene panels14,21, the use of a quantitative PCR step followed by a library bottleneck simplifies the use of panels of any size, including whole-exome panels. To ensure that major drivers are not being missed by our 239-gene panel, we performed exome-wide NanoSeq on 12 samples to a total duplex coverage of 1,024 dx. This reidentified NOTCH1, TP53, PPM1D, RAC1 and ZFP36L2, suggesting that our panel includes the commonest drivers in oral epithelium. We also found a significant excess of indels in the keratin gene KRT15, which is probably the result of a hypermutation process known to affect highly expressed lineage-defining genes27.

Our data reveal that the oral epithelium is composed of large numbers of small clones, with 10–20% of all buccal cells carrying driver mutations in older individuals (Extended Data Fig. 5d). We found 95.5% of oral mutations in only one duplex molecule, and around 90% had unbiased VAFs less than 0.1%. These VAFs are consistent with the submillimetric size of most clones reported in other epithelia1,2,5, emphasizing the importance of single-molecule sensitivity to study solid tissues in bulk.

Aggregating duplex VAFs (Methods), we estimate that, in donors aged 65–85 years, the average fraction of cells carrying a driver mutation is approximately 10% for NOTCH1, 3% for TP53, 1% for NOTCH2, CHEK2 and ATM, and less than 1% for other driver genes (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5d). The frequency of NOTCH1 and TP53 mutations in oral epithelium contrasts with their frequencies in HNSC (The Cancer Genome Atlas, TCGA) of 16% and 69%, respectively (Fig. 2f and Methods). The similar frequency of NOTCH1 driver mutations in oral cancer and normal oral epithelium suggests that NOTCH1 mutations lead to benign clonal expansions at similar risk of transformation than NOTCH1-wild-type cells. By contrast, TP53 and most other driver genes found under selection in oral epithelium seem enriched in squamous carcinomas consistent with a genuine tumorigenic role of these mutations. We note, however, that comparisons for most genes are limited by the number of cancers sequenced so far, compared with the thousands of normal clones assayed in this study.

The high number of mutations detected per gene also provides unprecedented power to detect negative selection, manifested as genes with a depletion of non-synonymous mutations (dN/dS < 1). Previous studies have shown that, exome-wide, most coding somatic mutations are tolerated and not negatively selected during somatic evolution, in contrast to long-term germline evolution22,28. However, strong negative selection in a small fraction of genes remains possible, particularly in essential haploinsufficient genes, but requires larger sequencing studies to be detectable29.

Powered by the very high duplex depth and using new one-sided negative selection tests (Methods), we found nine genes under significant negative selection in our panel, mostly driven by selection against truncating SNVs (dN/dS < 1 for nonsense and essential splice site mutations) (Fig. 2g and Supplementary Table 3). This includes three essential genes from CRISPR screens (SF3B1, CHD4 and CDK4) (Methods). PIK3CA, SF3B1 and TERT showed negative selection against truncating mutations and positive selection on activating hotspot mutations (coding in PIK3CA and SF3B1, and promoter in TERT), suggesting that these genes are both essential genes in wild-type oral cells, and drivers upon acquiring activating mutations. Aggregating mutations from the 17 panel genes known to be essential in CRISPR screens revealed clear negative selection against truncating mutations in them (dN/dS = 0.69, 95% CI 0.61–0.78) (Fig. 2h). By contrast, dN/dS ratios for not-significantly selected genes in the panel as well as exome-wide dN/dS ratios, excluding selected genes, were consistent with a largely neutral accumulation of coding somatic mutations (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 5f).

The high number of mutations per gene provides an opportunity to start building high-resolution maps of selection across sites for the main driver genes1,2,21,30 (Fig. 3a–c), a form of in vivo saturation mutagenesis. To formalize the analysis of recurrent mutation hotspots, we used site-level dN/dS models (‘sitednds', Methods). Powered by the high number of mutations, we found 1,220 amino acid changes under significant positive selection (q-value less than 0.01), including 599 in NOTCH1 and 268 in TP53 (Fig. 2i and Methods). Restricting hypothesis testing to known cancer hotspots added several oncogenes to the list of positively selected genes in buccal swabs, including PIK3CA, ERBB2, KRAS and HRAS (Supplementary Table 4 and Methods).

TSS, transcription start site.

The distribution of coding mutations in TP53 mirrors that observed across thousands of cancers in the COSMIC database31 (Fig. 3a and Methods). In TP53, we found nearly as many mutations as in 44,000 cancer exomes and genomes, and for several other driver genes, the number of mutations reported here far outweighs all previously observed mutations from cancer studies (Fig. 3b). For comparison, analysis of more than 7,500 cancer exomes from 29 cancer types from TCGA yielded around 15,000 driver mutations in known cancer genes22, a quarter of the driver mutations observed in the current study.

Studying the distribution of mutations within genes revealed a diversity of selection patterns (Fig. 3a,c) (see Supplementary Note 4 and Extended Data Fig. 6 for detailed descriptions). TP53 shows strong selection on missense mutations in the DNA binding domain and on truncating mutations across the gene. NOTCH1 shows a characteristic clustering of missense mutations in EGF repeats 8–12, predicted to disrupt binding to NOTCH1 ligands Jagged and Delta2. Truncating mutations are subject to much weaker selection in the last exon of NOTCH1 (dN/dS for nonsense mutations was 68.4 across the gene and 6.9 in the last exon), which probably reflects their inability to trigger nonsense-mediated decay. RAC1 shows a classical oncogene pattern of strong selection on activating hotspots, with site dN/dS identifying 58 missense sites under significant selection (q < 0.01). Although these sites are scattered along the gene, they cluster around the GDP/GTP binding pocket in the three-dimensional structure of RAC1 (Fig. 3d). PPM1D encodes a known negative regulator of p53 and shows a characteristic pattern of recurrent nonsense SNVs and indels in the last exon, which results in the loss of a C-terminal degradation domain leading to a more stable isoform of the protein, hence increasing p53 suppression32. Finally, TP63 shows an unusual selection pattern with a highly recurrent essential splice hotspot predicted to lead to an alternative isoform of p63 (ref. 33). Extra mutation maps are shown in Extended Data Fig. 6a–i.

Beyond coding mutations, we obtained high duplex coverage in exon-flanking sequences, and we targeted the promoters of many genes (Methods). To test for selection on specific subsets of coding and non-coding sites within a gene, we implemented a new function in dNdScv (‘withingenednds', Supplementary Note 2). This identified several underappreciated driver sites, including strong positive selection on mutations causing stop codon loss in TP53 and PPM1D, on intronic mutations near essential splice sites in TP53, NOTCH1, CHEK2 and NOTCH2, and on some synonymous sites in TP53 and NOTCH1 predicted to affect splicing by SpliceAI34 (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Note 4). In addition, we observed suggestive clustering of mutations at the TP53 transcription start site, the TP53 polyadenylation signal, and at splice sites in the first non-coding exon of TP53 (Fig. 3f), as well as hotspots in non-canonical but previously reported 5′ untranslated region sites in TERT. These analyses also revealed a general inflation of mutations in the core promoters of many genes, suggestive of a higher background mutation rate in promoters rather than selection (Extended Data Fig. 6m), consistent with previous reports35. Despite our panel not being designed to search for non-coding cis-regulatory driver mutations, these examples show the potential of deep somatic mutation scanning to exhaustively discover coding and non-coding driver sites.

Variants of uncertain significance are germline or somatic variants identified by genetic testing whose clinical relevance is unknown. Evidence of selection in cancer is starting to be used for the classification of variants in some genes36 but is limited by the sparsity of cancer genomic datasets. To investigate whether selection in normal tissues could contribute to these efforts, we compared the distribution of site-level dN/dS ratios for sites annotated in ClinVar as pathogenic, benign or of uncertain significance. Nearly all known pathogenic sites in TP53, NOTCH1 and PPM1D had high dN/dS ratios, and nearly all known benign sites had low dN/dS ratios (Extended Data Fig. 6n). Looking at sites reaching or approaching significance (q < 0.20), we find many variants of uncertain significance (and zero benign variants) with comparable evidence of selection to known pathogenic variants (including 86 in TP53, 35 in NOTCH1 and 5 in PPM1D) (Supplementary Table 4). Although deeper sequencing will be required to achieve true saturation (Supplementary Note 4), these results show that ultra-deep single-molecule sequencing of polyclonal tissues has the potential to provide in vivo saturation mutagenesis information for genes under somatic selection.

The discovery of many clones carrying cancer-driver mutations in normal tissues has caused some confusion about their role in carcinogenesis. However, these clones are entirely compatible with a multistage model of carcinogenesis, and were in fact anticipated by some classical mathematical models (see Supplementary Note 5 for an extended description). In the 1950s, Armitage and Doll37 proposed that the rapid increase in cancer incidence with age could be explained by a model in which cells acquire mutations linearly with age and 6–7 driver events are required for transformation. Lesser-known models with clonal expansions were proposed soon after and showed that the size and type of clonal expansion had large effects on cancer incidence. The current model of carcinogenesis is that cancers emerge by somatic evolution. Both mutation and selection (clonal expansion) increase the likelihood of a cell acquiring the complement of driver changes needed for transformation. Carcinogens may thus act by inducing mutations (mutagens) or by altering selection (promoters38,39 or selectogens40) (see Supplementary Note 5 for an extended explanation). By studying the variation in mutation and selection across 1,042 individuals, we can begin to quantify these processes.

To investigate the mode of clonal growth in oral epithelium, we first studied how the frequency of driver mutations increases with age in our cohort. This showed that the estimated fraction of cells carrying driver mutations increases roughly linearly with age, through the accumulation of many small clones, with the VAF of the largest clone per individual growing slowly or plateauing with age (Fig. 4a). As new driver mutations occur continuously, this observation is inconsistent with models of continued clonal growth, including exponential growth, quadratic growth (expected if clones grow only at their edges)41 and models predicting an acceleration of selection during ageing42. Instead, the pattern seems more consistent with a plateauing model of clonal expansion, in which clone sizes are constrained (by cell-intrinsic or cell-extrinsic mechanisms) (Supplementary Notes 5 and 6 and Extended Data Fig. 7). This contrasts with the pattern observed in blood in which both the driver density summed across clones and the size of the largest clone increase almost exponentially with age, consistent with previous clonal haematopoiesis studies43. Models suggest that the slower-than-expected increase in driver density with age and the small size of epithelial clones must be major barriers to carcinogenesis (Supplementary Note 5).

Mechanistic risk models can offer insight into the impact of risk factors on mutational or clonal landscapes and may be used to predict cancer risk.

Targeted NanoSeq also provides information on mutation rates and signatures across individuals. Performing signature decomposition on all 1,042 donors, we found two dominant mutational signatures (Fig. 4b). Signature A resembles a combination of COSMIC single-base substitution (SBS) signatures SBS5 and SBS1 (94% and 6%, respectively, cosine similarity 0.90, Methods). SBS5 is a ubiquitous clock-like signature observed across tissues, believed to result from the occasional misrepair of the continuous DNA damage suffered by all cells8,9,44, whereas SBS1 results from the deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Signature A is largely responsible for the life-long accumulation of mutations in oral epithelium, with a slope of roughly 15.3 mutations per cell per year (Fig. 4c, R2 = 0.65, P < 2.2 × 10−16). Signature B resembles COSMIC SBS16 (cosine similarity 0.97), a common signature in oesophagus and liver, associated with alcohol consumption and aldehyde metabolism3,45,46 (Extended Data Fig. 8). Signature B showed extreme variation across donors, contributing low numbers to most individuals but more than 1,000 mutations per cell in some heavy drinkers (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Note 3).

The paucity of smoking-associated signatures (SBS4 and SBS92) and APOBEC mutagenesis (SBS2 and SBS13) in oral epithelium is remarkable given their frequency in HNSC tumours, but seems compatible with a recent study of oral cancer evolution47. Further analyses supported their paucity, including alternative deconvolution methods, the absence of smoking-associated indel and double-base substitution (DBS) signatures (Extended Data Fig. 8d,e), and non-significant likelihood-ratio tests comparing models with and without these signatures (Supplementary Note 3). The absence of the classical smoking signature SBS4 may be explained by the low expression of CYP1A1 in oral epithelium47, the main metabolizer of benzo(a)pyrene and perhaps by a lower exposure to tobacco mutagens of the basal stem cells in the oral squamous epithelium compared with respiratory epithelium.

Oral cancer risk factors could act by increasing mutation rates or inducing clonal expansions. To test for such mutagenic and selectogenic effects while accounting for confounders, we used multivariate mixed-effect regressions using risk factors and other metadata as covariates, and different measures of mutation rates, signatures or driver densities as outcome variables (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Note 7 and Extended Data Fig. 9). As expected, SNVs, indels, dinucleotides, signature A (but not signature B) burden and the density of all major drivers increased strongly with age. Sex was not significantly associated with differences in any of these outcome variables when correcting for confounders, despite our power to detect differences greater than 5% (Extended Data Fig. 9). This suggests that the higher incidence of HNSC in men may be mostly explained by lifestyle factors, as predicted by some epidemiological studies48.

Tobacco smoking is a major oral cancer risk factor, and we found pack-years to be strongly associated with total SNVs, signature A and signature B, dinucleotide substitutions (but not indels), driver density across genes, NOTCH1 driver density and nominally significantly associated with three other drivers. Alcohol consumption is another major oral cancer risk factor, and we found estimated drink-years to be strongly associated with SNV and signature B burden, but not signature A burden, consistent with the known aetiology of signature B/SBS16 (Methods). Poor oral health is also an oral cancer risk factor49, and we found that the number of missing teeth correlated with signature A burden and overall driver density. We were unable to study the effect of oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in our dataset, an increasingly important risk factor for oral cancer particularly in younger individuals50, as HPV history was unavailable and sequencing-based detection of HPV yielded limited information (Methods).

The association of alcohol consumption with signature B is believed to result from DNA damage by alcohol-derived aldehydes45. However, the mechanistic basis for the association of smoking with signature B is less clear. Analyses in our dataset suggest that smoking increases signature B by exacerbating the mutagenic effects of alcohol consumption, consistent with epidemiological studies51 (Supplementary Note 7). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the association is partially caused by inaccurate self-reporting of alcohol consumption. Whereas our models also suggest that smoking and poor oral health are significantly associated with an increase in signature A/SBS5, the mechanistic bases for these associations remain unclear. Notably, these regressions suggest that 1 additional year of life causes as many mutations in the oral epithelium as roughly 2.8 pack-years or 19.1 drink-years (95% CI 2.03–3.63 and 13.9–24.3, respectively, see Supplementary Note 7 for caveats and interpretation).

More regression models can further disentangle the mutagenic or selectogenic effects of some risk factors. If a carcinogen acts solely as a mutagen without altering selection, driver density should increase proportionally to the increase in mutation burden, at least under some assumptions. Pure promoters or selectogens should alter clonal selection without changes in mutation rates, whereas dual carcinogens may alter both (Supplementary Note 7). Thus, to test for selectogenic effects, we used different regression models correcting driver density for changes in mutation rates (Supplementary Note 7). Putative selectogenic associations included an increase in NOTCH1 clones with smoking, CHEK2 with poor oral health and trends for other genes (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 9d). These associations are suggestive of promoter or selectogenic effects, but they are only correlative and further studies are needed to confirm them. We also note that we have lower statistical power to detect changes in selection per gene than changes in mutation rates (Extended Data Fig. 9e), and that our detection of selectogenesis is limited to effects on clones observed in normal oral epithelium (for example, studying selectogenesis on more advanced precancerous lesions will require other cohorts). Nevertheless, these analyses show the potential of mutational epidemiology studies to illuminate the mechanisms of action of major cancer risk factors.

Altogether, these results indicate that tobacco may contribute to early oral carcinogenesis not through classical SBS4 or SBS92 mutagenesis, but through an acceleration of SBS5 and SBS16 and changes in clonal selection. Alcohol consumption seemed to cause fewer driver mutations than expected from its increase in mutation rates. Analysis of the distribution of signature B mutations revealed that this is due to a low driver-generation potential of signature B/SBS16, as ATA>ACA or ATT>ACT signature B mutations are heavily biased towards intronic sequences (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b).

Finally, this dataset offers an opportunity to start investigating germline influences on somatic mutation rates. First, we leveraged our twin design to test for heritability. We compared the difference in mutation rates and driver frequencies between identical (monozygotic), non-identical (dizygotic) and unrelated same-age pairs of donors, while accounting for confounders (Supplementary Note 8). This provided some evidence of heritability for signature A (monozygotic versus dizygotic P = 0.004), NOTCH1 (P = 0.023) and TP53 (P = 0.018) (Extended Data Fig. 10c). Similar signals were found with more formal ACE (A, additive genetic effects; C, common/shared environment effects; E, unshared environment effects) and genomic-relatedness tests (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Note 8). Second, we took advantage of having genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping and complete metadata from 590 donors to evaluate the effect on the mutation landscape of 52 SNPs associated with oral cancer or clonal haematopoiesis risk. This revealed a significant association between a SNP near ALDH2 (rs4767364), a key enzyme in alcohol metabolism and the rate of signature B/SBS16 (P = 9.4 × 10−5, q = 0.02) (Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Note 8). This suggests that the known association between rs4767364 and HNSC risk52 is driven by a higher mutagenicity of alcohol in these donors, consistent with the known effects of a different ALDH2 SNP (rs671) common in East Asian individuals. Finally, although the statistical power was low, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of mutation rates and driver densities for completeness, not finding convincing genome-wide significant associations (Supplementary Note 8). Altogether, these analyses suggest that germline factors can influence somatic mutation rates and clonal selection, although larger cohorts are needed to comprehensively identify these associations. We note that discovering germline mutations influencing somatic mutation rates could illuminate the mechanistic bases of SBS5 and enable Mendelian randomization for causal inference on the role of somatic mutations across common diseases.

Building on duplex sequencing, we have developed a new version of NanoSeq that achieves accurate somatic mutation detection on single DNA molecules (with fewer than five errors per gigabase) while being compatible with whole-genome, whole-exome and deep targeted sequencing. This method greatly simplifies the study of somatic mutation rates, signatures and driver landscapes in any tissue, regardless of clonality.

Applying targeted NanoSeq to oral epithelium, we have unveiled an unprecedentedly rich landscape of selection in a normal solid tissue, with 46 genes under positive selection, more than 62,000 driver mutations and several genes under negative selection. These data also exemplify how deep single-molecule sequencing of highly polyclonal tissues can yield high-resolution maps of selection within genes. This could complement in vitro saturation mutagenesis efforts to help variant annotation for genetic diagnosis. Whereas this approach is limited to genes under selection in a tissue, a wider range of disease-relevant genes can be assayed across tissues28.

The ability to study somatic landscapes in large sample cohorts offers several opportunities to augment traditional cancer epidemiology. First, systematic studies of the mutation landscape across individuals, case–control studies16,17 and intervention studies could help build mechanistic models connecting risk factors to mutation and clonal landscapes, and these landscapes to cancer risk (Fig. 4g). Such studies could provide insights into the mode of action of poorly understood risk factors (for example, obesity), as well as enable risk prediction or stratification. Second, studies of the mutation landscapes of normal tissues in populations with unusually high rates of certain cancers could shed light on unknown exposures, potentially helping develop prevention strategies. Third, mutation and clonal landscapes may be informative as surrogate risk markers in cancer prevention and molecular prevention trials. Although molecular prevention of cancer in the general population is rarely discussed, the discovery of simple markers of cardiovascular disease risk, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hypertension, enabled the development of statins and antihypertensive medications, which have transformed the management of cardiovascular disease53.

Beyond cancer, somatic mutations have long been speculated to contribute to ageing and other diseases. Suggestive associations have now been found between somatic mutations in certain genes and many diseases54,55. However, systematic studies in polyclonal conditions have not been possible with available technologies. Accurate whole-exome single-molecule sequencing has the potential to enable sensitive and unbiased discovery of somatic driver mutations in any tissue and across diseases.

The TwinsUK study contains around 16,000 participants. From a preselection of 4,800 donors, we invited 1,796 to participate based on several criteria, receiving buccal swabs from 1,236 donors (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The use of these samples was approved initially by the North West Research Ethics Committee (REC 19/NW/0187 and REC 24/NW/0106), and informed consent was provided by participants. To increase our statistical power to study associations with exposures, risk factors and germline factors, we included all available donors of age 80 or higher (n = 230), as many complete twin pairs as possible, smokers, individuals with obesity (BMI > 30), and individuals with available genome-wide genotyping information. We also favoured the selection of men and people of colour to reduce some of the demographic biases in the TwinsUK registry compared with the general population. To test for associations between the mutational landscape and medications or clinical histories, we favoured the inclusion of individuals with a history of cancer (including all donors with a history of oral cancer, n = 12) or a self-reported treatment history including tamoxifen, immunosuppressants, metformin, aspirin or ibuprofen. 194 samples were excluded from analysis based on several sequencing quality metrics, leaving a total of 1,042 samples in the study. Exclusion criteria included: removal of contaminated samples with either human (n = 17) or non-human (n = 132) DNA, exclusion of samples with mean duplex coverage lower than 50 dx (n = 79) and exclusion of swabs with genotyping information not matching the pre-existing genotyping information from TwinsUK (n = 7) (Extended Data Fig. 2a).

From the final 1,042 donors in the study, we also selected 380 individuals with archival whole-blood DNA available for sequencing in the TwinsUK BioBank. In total, 371 samples passed quality controls for study inclusion (Extended Data Fig. 2a). The selection of blood donors was based on several criteria: 12 donors (and their twins) treated with metformin, 30 donors (and their twins) with the highest mutation burden per year in the buccal swabs, 25 donors (and their twins) with the highest driver fractions, 25 donors (and their twins) with the lowest driver fractions, 25 donors with high driver fractions in the buccals for known clonal haematopoiesis drivers (TET2, SF3B1, DNMT3A) and 5 donors with high driver fractions in the buccal swabs for each of the following drivers: PPM1D, ASXL1 and NOTCH3. The remaining twin pairs were sampled randomly.

Metadata were provided by TwinsUK, obtained through periodical questionnaires that were collected longitudinally for most donors. For each participant, TwinsUK provided age, sex, height, weight, BMI, twin zygosity and ethnicity. A few self-reported zygosities were corrected based on genotyping information. Self-reported medication histories were also obtained from questionnaires, however, these are expected to be incomplete. Further information on history of herpes labialis and a short list of prespecified treatments was provided by TwinsUK from anonymized medical records: metformin, tamoxifen, rapamycin, aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and immunosuppressants. Cancer history was provided and coded as: 0 (no cancer), 1 (non-melanomatous skin cancer), 2 (other cancer) and 3 (oral cancer).

For major oral cancer risk factors and other relevant variables, we processed available questionnaires further to obtain summary metrics, including: tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, weight, height, BMI, oral hygiene, gastro-oesophageal reflux, diabetes, history of cancer and medication histories.

Self-reported smoking and alcohol consumption was collated from 14 periodical questionnaires. We focused on the most recent questionnaires due to the relevance of the questions asked in them and the coverage of answers across individuals. For smoking, we kept the maximum value of reported pack-years per donor across questionnaires. As standard, 1 pack-year was defined as 365 packs of cigarettes (7,300 cigarettes). For alcohol intake, self-reported current weekly consumption was available for most donors, but self-reported information on lifetime consumption was only available for a few donors. An estimate of drink-years was calculated by multiplying the average current weekly alcohol consumption, across several questionnaires if available, by the duration of adult life (age minus 18). We note that this estimate is an extrapolation and should be used with caution, but regression models suggest that this estimate was more explanatory than self-reported lifetime consumption (see Supplementary Note 7 for analyses on alternative metrics).

Self-reported information on gingivitis, periodontitis and gum bleeding was only available for a few donors. By contrast, the number of natural teeth remaining was available for most donors, recorded as an ordinal variable. For ease of interpretation in the regression models, we inverted this variable to reflect the number of missing teeth, as follows: 0, 20 or more natural teeth; 1, 10–19 natural teeth; 2, 1–9 natural teeth and 3, no natural teeth. Where several answers were available from questionnaires on different years, the lowest number of natural teeth left was used.

Weight and height were provided by TwinsUK for most donors. Both metrics were averaged across questionnaires for each donor. BMI was calculated using the standard formula: weight/(height2).

Puritan buccal swab kits with instructions for self-collection were posted to the homes of voluntary donors by TwinsUK (CamBio, CA-1723-H100). Kits contained a primary and secondary plastic container, an outer rigid container (Alpha Laboratories, RF95-LL1) and a prepaid return envelope. Participants mailed their buccal swabs directly to the Wellcome Sanger Institute. Swabs were refrigerated at 4 °C on arrival.

To extract DNA, buccal cells were dissociated into 1 ml of PBS solution in an Eppendorf tube through manual agitation for 1 min. The swab tip was then cut with scissors and left in the tube for 30 min before removal. The solution was then centrifuged at 1,000g for 1 min. The supernatant was removed leaving a cell pellet with minimal residual PBS (less than 100 μl). The QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (QIAGEN, 56304) was used for cell lysis and DNA extraction. First, 180 μl of buffer ATL and 20 μl of proteinase K were added to the resuspended cell pellet, followed by overnight incubation on a thermomixer at 56 °C and 800 rpm. DNA extraction followed the manufacturer's protocol with several modifications: centrifugation steps were all performed at 20,000g, DNA was eluted in 50 μl if buffer EB (10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5) (QIAGEN, 19086), incubation with the first elution step was for 5 min, and the eluent was passed through the spin column for a repeat elution into a DNA LoBind 1.5 ml tube (Eppendorf, 0030108051). The extracted DNA was quantified using a Qubit High Sensitivity and then stored at −20 °C before 40 μl of the thawed sample being diluted to a final volume of 120 μl with buffer EB (QIAGEN, 19086) and submitted for NanoSeq library preparation on an Abgene AB0800G plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AB0800G).

A detailed description of the targeted NanoSeq and standard duplex sequencing library preparation protocols is provided in Supplementary Note 1.

Sequencing data were mapped to the human genome (GRCh37, hs37d5 build) with BWA-mem57 as described before8. Bases were called when there was duplex consensus with at least two reads per original strand, requiring a minimum consensus base quality score of 60, a VAF lower than 0.1 in the matched normal, a minimum AS-XS of 10 (below), no more than an average of 3 mismatches per read (or 4 if a variant is called), a minimum coverage of 25× in the matched normal and trimming 8 bp from each read end. We note that by counting all mutant bases and all reference bases in each duplex molecule, NanoSeq implicitly considers the VAF of each mutation to calculate mutation burdens. This makes NanoSeq robust to differences in clonal composition across samples. Compared with ref. 8, instead of sequencing independent matched normals to filter out germline variation, we took advantage of the high coverage and polyclonality of the buccal swab samples to remove germline SNPs by filtering out variants with VAF ≥ 10%. We note that this is adequate as long as the samples are highly polyclonal. Relaxing this cut-off to VAF ≥ 30% did not seem to recover genuine mutations in the buccal swabs but led to an increase in mapping artefacts. Because all blood samples had matching buccal swab data, somatic mutations in blood were called using their buccal swabs as matched normals, excluding as probably germline any variants with VAF ≥ 10% in the buccal swabs.

A significant modification in the targeted NanoSeq calling pipeline compared with our published RE-NanoSeq pipeline is the relaxation of the AS-XS threshold from 50 to 10. AS-XS measures the difference in mapping quality between the primary and secondary alignments, excluding regions with ambiguous mapping from analysis. For mutation burden and signature analyses with whole-genome NanoSeq, we previously recommended a strict AS-XS cut-off to minimize the impact of mapping artefacts8. However, for driver discovery it is important to preserve regions with less unique mapping qualities. Using a list of 1,152 oncogenic hotspots from TCGA and MSKCC provided by the dNdScv package22, we noticed that the original AS-XS cut-off would have filtered out a significant number of them. Reducing the AS-XS cut-off from 50 to 10 ensured the retention of duplex coverage on nearly all canonical cancer hotspots while still ensuring accurate mutation rates and signatures in control cord blood samples (Extended Data Fig. 2l–o).

Two extra filters are important to avoid recurrent mapping artefacts and to minimize the effect of inter-individual contamination. First, a ‘SNP+noise' mask containing common germline SNP sites and recurrent mapping artefacts was generated for targeted NanoSeq as described before8. Second, we noticed that mapping errors not captured by this mask can manifest as recurrent artefacts where the mutant base is often seen at specific positions within a read. This can be caused, for example, by mismapping of reads from polymorphic segmental duplications. A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test on the position of the mutant bases within reads was applied to remove recurrent artefacts after mutation calling. Indels were also filtered out if their overlap with the ‘SNP+noise' mask was 50% or greater, if they occurred at sites without a base called, if they had a VAF > 0.1 or if they were seen in more than 50 samples. This only removed a small number of artefactual indel sites, which also had a strong read positional bias.

The VAF represents the proportion of reads at a specific site carrying a variant, relative to the total reads at that site. When working with standard duplex sequencing or targeted NanoSeq data, only a fraction of read bundles reach the ‘2 + 2' requirement for duplex calling (that is, read families with at least two reads from both strands). We can then calculate three separate VAFs: (1) the ‘duplex VAF', defined as the fraction of callable (2 + 2) read bundles supporting a given mutation, (2) the ‘BAM VAF', calculated using the deduplicated BAM file containing one representative read per read bundle (and including calling and non-calling read bundles) and (3) the ‘unbiased BAM VAF', calculated using the deduplicated BAM file but excluding calling read bundles.

These VAFs can be used for different purposes. (1) Estimation of the fraction of cells in a sample carrying a specific mutation. If a mutation was discovered in a sample using duplex (2 + 2) reads, duplex VAFs or BAM VAFs tend to overestimate the fraction of cells carrying the mutation in the sample due to the discovery bias resulting from the inclusion of reads used for mutation calling. For this purpose, ‘unbiased BAM VAFs' provide an unbiased estimate of the VAF of a mutation in the sample as they are calculated from reads not used for duplex calling. (2) Estimation of the fraction of cells carrying somatic mutations in a given gene. The molecules that reach duplex calling (2 + 2) in a targeted NanoSeq experiment represent a random sample of all copies of a gene in a population of cells. The duplex VAF for a given site represents the fraction of mutant molecules at the site. If we assume that all (or nearly all) cells are diploid and that cells carry at most one driver mutation per gene (heterozygous), then we can estimate the fraction of cells with mutations in a given gene by summing the duplex VAF (vd) of mutations across all sites in the gene (F = 2Σvd). If we assume that cells may carry up to two mutant copies of the gene per cell or if we are looking at a haploid region of the genome (for example, the X chromosome in male individuals), we can estimate the fraction of mutant cells in the sample using the sum of duplex VAFs across all sites in the gene (F = Σvd). Some genes, such as NOTCH1 in squamous epithelia can show biallelic loss by one mutation in each allele (SNVs or indels) or by one mutation and a copy number change (either a deletion or a copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity). We have previously shown that for these conditions, as well as for populations with mixtures of heterozygous and homozygous mutant cells, the fraction of mutant cells in the population falls within the range [Σvd, 2Σvd] (ref. 2). Unless described otherwise, other references to the fraction of mutant cells for a given gene assume a maximum of one driver mutation per cell and a largely diploid population.

As not all non-synonymous mutations in a driver gene are driver mutations22, to estimate the fractions of cells with driver mutations (Figs. 1d and 2e), we multiplied the estimated fraction of cells with non-synonymous mutations by the estimated fraction of mutations that are drivers for each class. We estimated the fraction of mutations that are drivers using (ω − 1)/ω, for mutation classes with ω ≥ 1 (where ω is the dN/dS ratio per mutation type per gene). To account for potential differences in clone sizes for driver mutations, we used dN/dS ratios calculated without collapsing mutations reported by many molecules into single entries to dNdScv (Supplementary Code).

To quantify the epithelial fraction of a representative set of buccal swabs, we used two approaches: (1) targeted enzymatic methylation sequencing on 187 buccal swabs, and (2) comparing the VAFs of clonal haematopoiesis mutations in the buccal swabs of donors with blood and buccal swab data.

From 187 swabs, we generated low-input enzymatic methylation libraries and then undertook targeted capture with a panel of informative CpG sites, using the NEBNext Enzymatic Methyl-seq Kit (NEB, E7120L). We used a custom Twist Bioscience hybridization panel targeting 1,162 CpGs selected from the centEpiFibFatIC.m, centDHSbloodDMC.m and centEpiFibIC.m matrices in the EpiDISH R package58, to deconvolute epithelial, fibroblast, fat and blood cell types. We also targeted 353 CpG from the original Horvath clock59 and 50 CpGs in the promoters of 25 driver genes. The design is available in Supplementary Table 2.

For each sample, DNA was quantified and normalized to roughly 1 ng μl−1. Normalized DNA samples were then sheared with the NEBNext UltraShear fragmentation mix (NEB, M7634L), end-repaired, A-tailed, adapter-ligated with a methylated TruSeq-compatible adapter stub (all using NEB Ultra II reagents) and, after a SPRI (solid-phase reversible immobilization) clean-up, the resulting libraries were oxidized using TET2 (converting methylcytosines to carboxylcytosines) and deaminated using APOBEC (converting bare cytosines to uracils but retaining the carboxylcytosines, thus preserving the locations of methylation marks). The deaminated libraries were amplified, and sequencing indexes (and the rest of the adapter sequence) were introduced using NEB Q5U and the Sanger Institute's UDI primers. After a further SPRI clean-up, libraries were requantified and mixed in an equimolar pool with a cumulative DNA mass of 1–4 μg. Twist Bioscience probes targeting the sequences of interest were then added. After evaporating all the liquid, the probes hybridized to the DNA and the targets were pulled down and cleaned up (using Twist fast hybridization reagents and Thermo DynaBeads MyOne streptavidin-coupled beads). After a final PCR amplification (KAPA HiFi) and SPRI clean-up, a pool of all samples underwent quality control by Agilent Bioanalyser and sequenced in a single S4 lane of Illumina NovaSeq 6000.

Epithelial, fibroblast and blood cell fractions were estimated using EpiDISH and hEpiDISH58. The latter allows hierarchical deconvolution, first relying on centEpiFibIC to estimate epithelial, fibroblast and blood fractions, and applying centDHSbloodDMC to deconvolute the different types of blood cell. The median epithelial fraction across all 187 swabs was 95.1% (Extended Data Fig. 2h). Most of the non-epithelial cells were neutrophils, probably a result of saliva contamination of the buccal swabs.

As a complementary analysis of blood contamination in the buccal swab samples, we compared the VAF of blood mutations in buccal swabs. To do so, we used 43 pairs of buccal and archival blood samples in which the date of collection of the blood sample was within 3 years of the buccal swab, and which contained at least 1 large clone in blood (VAF ≥ 1%). The median of the ratio of buccal VAF to blood VAF for 58 blood mutations that met these criteria was 0.076, which provides an alternative estimate of the median blood contamination in these samples around 7–8%.

The ability of NanoSeq to detect somatic mutations in single molecules of DNA makes it particularly sensitive to DNA contamination, either from other humans (calling germline SNPs from the contaminant individual as somatic mutations in the affected sample) or from other species with sufficient conservation to map to the human genome (which is more likely in targeted NanoSeq due to the higher conservation of coding regions).

We have previously shown8 that when analysing whole-genome NanoSeq data, the percentage of contaminating DNA can be estimated using verifybamID60. However, we found verifybamID to be unreliable for targeted NanoSeq data. To qualitatively detect human DNA contamination on targeted NanoSeq data, a useful metric is the fraction of all substitutions filtered by the ‘SNP+noise' mask. Although useful, this metric may not be reliable for samples with low duplex coverage and few mutations. As a complementary approach, we genotyped common SNPs in targeted regions to identify homozygous alternative (non-reference) SNPs. Presence of reference bases at these sites is indicative of contamination. Although this is not a direct estimate of the percentage of contamination given the difficulty of determining the genotype of the contaminant at those alternative homozygous SNPs, it can serve as a sensitive indicator of inter-individual DNA contamination.

We called SNPs with bcftools61 using the following commands: bcftools mpileup --max-depth 20000 -Ou -f $genome $bam | bcftools call --ploidy GRCh37 -mv -Ob -o BCFTOOLS/$OUT_PREFIX.calls.bcf; bcftools view -i ‘%QUAL > = 100' BCFTOOLS/$OUT_PREFIX.calls.bcf > BCFTOOLS/$OUT_PREFIX.calls.filtered.vcf.

For the assessment of contamination, we restricted the analysis to SNPs overlapping both our SNP mask and our targeted panel. We used bam2R (from the deepSNV R package)62 to obtain the number of reads supporting the alternative and reference alleles, and kept SNPs with a mean coverage across samples greater than 200×. For each SNP in each sample, the genotype was set to ‘NA' if the coverage was less than 20×, to alternative homozygous (1/1) if the VAF was greater than 0.8, to heterozygous (0/1) if the VAF was between 0.3 and 0.7, and to reference homozygous (0/0) if the VAF was less than 0.1. Finally, we only kept SNPs seen in 2 or more samples and in fewer than 1,000 samples. For each homozygous SNP, we calculated the reference fraction and we report the median across all homozygous SNPs in the sample. We considered 17 samples with a median reference base VAF > 0.01 at non-reference homozygous SNP sites to be contaminated and excluded them from all further analyses (Extended Data Fig. 2d).

Donors were requested to rinse their mouths before buccal swab collection to minimize non-human DNA contamination from food or bacteria. However, some samples showed evidence of non-human DNA contamination, which resulted in mismapping of non-human DNA reads to the human genome, detectable as an excess of clustered synonymous mutations. To systematically identify these samples, we used Kraken v.2 (ref. 63), using 1 million unmapped reads per swab and a database of potential sources of contamination able to map to the human genome: Mus musculus, Bos taurus, Ovis aries, Sus scrofa, Equus caballus, Oryctolagus cuniculus, Meleagris gallopavo and Gallus gallus. Bacterial contamination should not be a problem given their sequence divergence from the human genome. In addition, for each sample we calculated the global dN/dS ratio across passenger genes, and compared the contamination fractions estimated with Kraken with the observed dN/dS ratios. dN/dS ratios decrease with non-human contamination because of evolutionary conservation of non-synonymous sites. On the basis of the impact of contamination on dN/dS ratios (Extended Data Fig. 2e), we excluded from further analyses 132 samples with more than 0.25% of non-human unmapped reads.

The genome sequence of 19 HPV types considered high-risk64 were retrieved from GenBank. We built a multiple sequence alignment of these genomes with MAFFT65 using Jalview66. Based on conservation across these highly divergent HPV strains, we retained roughly 3,000 bp for each of the strains to design HPV-specific probes that we included in our Twist target gene panel. The GenBank accession numbers of the 19 selected HPV types were: KU298887.1, KU298893.1, KU298928.1, KX514417.1, KX514421.1, KX514431.1, KY225967.1, LR862061.1, LR862064.1, LR862079.1, MT218010.1, MT783412.1, MT783416.1, MT783417.1, MZ374448.1, MZ509108.1, NC_001357.1, NC_001526.4 and NC_001583.

Once our targeted sequencing data were mapped to the human genome we retrieved the unmapped reads and remapped them to the genomes of the 19 HPV strains using BWA-mem57. Mapping results were reviewed manually to distinguish between unreliable mappings (very repetitive, low-complexity, soft-clipped reads) and probably true HPV sequences. For ambiguous cases, we searched the mapped read with BLAST against the National Center for Biotechnology Information's non-redundant nucleotide database. This allowed us to identify some hits to HPV strains not originally covered in our panel.

We detected HPV in 12 samples, in some cases supported by thousands of reads while in others by as little as one single read. Several HPV strains were detected. The following (anonymized) list of donors show the results: X1 donor (HPV 16, 44 reads), X2 (HPV 53, 6 reads), X3 (HPV 33 and HPV 58, 20 and 5 reads), X4 (HPV 33, 115 reads), X5 (HPV 53, 6667 reads), X6 (HPV 59, 12 reads), X6 (HPV 56, 707 reads), X7 (HPV 51, 236 reads), X8 (HPV 56, 1 read), X9 (HPV 21 not in panel, 2 reads), X10 (HPV 24 not in panel, 1 read), X11 (HPV 30, not in panel, 1 read) and X12 (HPV 33, 6 reads).

Given that only 12 out of 1,042 samples had detectable HPV presence using the targeted capture and that this is not a validated assay for HPV detection, we were unable to study the impact of HPV on the mutation and selection landscape in the oral epithelium, which remains an important question for future studies. Instead, we excluded these 12 samples from the epidemiological regression analyses to reduce the risk of confounding effects.

Pre-existing array genotyping data from TwinsUK were used for GWAS and other analyses. The samples had been genotyped with the following arrays: HumanHap300, HumanHap610Q, 1M-Duo and 1.2MDuo 1M. Following genotype calling, some samples were excluded from analyses involving genotyping data based on different criteria: a sample call rate less than 98%, heterozygosity across all SNPs that were 2 or more standard deviations from the sample mean, evidence of non-European ancestry as assessed by principal components analysis comparison with HapMap3 populations, observed pairwise identity by descent probabilities suggestive of sample identity errors. We also used identity by descent probabilities to correct misclassified zygosity. We then excluded SNPs using the following criteria: Hardy–Weinberg P < 10−6, assessed in a set of unrelated samples; minor allele frequency of 1%, assessed in a set of unrelated samples; SNP call rate less than 97% (SNPs with a minor allele frequency of 5% or more) or less than 99% (for 1% less than or equal to minor allele frequency of less than 5%). Following genotype and sample filtering, the data were imputed using the Haplotype Reference Consortium reference panel and SNPs with an imputation R2 < 0.5 were excluded.

For analyses relying on common SNPs, we called SNPs using bcftools as described in the DNA contamination section. For analyses relying on both common and rare SNPs we run GATK's HaplotypeCaller (v.4.0.1.2)67, using default options, setting ploidy to 2 except for the male chromosome X (haploid) and providing dbSNP v.141 (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp, ref. 68) for annotation of the calls. The resulting VCF files were intersected with our panel regions using bedtools69 and missing genotypes were annotated as REF with bcftools +missing2 (ref. 61), on the basis of the high coverage available.

A detailed description of the methods used to analyse positive and negative selection in this study is provided in Supplementary Note 2. This includes a description of the new one-sided tests in dNdScv, the use of duplex coverage correction in dNdScv, estimates of the number of driver mutations in the dataset and a description of dN/dS analyses at the level of single sites and groups of functionally related sites within genes.

Mutation burden is defined as the number of mutations per base pairs in a given region, and it is calculated in NanoSeq data as the number of mutant bases divided by the total number of bases sequenced with duplex information. Estimating mutation rates from targeted data can have several challenges. First, the mutation burden of a given region of the genome will be affected by its sequence composition. We can remove this confounding effect by correcting mutation burdens by the trinucleotide frequencies of a targeted region (relative to the whole genome) and the mutability of each trinucleotide, as described before8. Whereas this corrects for the effect of different sequence composition, it does not correct for a systematic difference in the mutability of different regions, such as genic and intergenic sequences, as explained in the text. RE-NanoSeq (and the full whole-genome NanoSeq protocols introduced in this study) can be used for an unbiased genome-wide measurement of mutation burdens (for example, Extended Data Fig. 4a–f and Supplementary Note 3). Second, when estimating mutation rates from gene sequences, particularly from panels of positively selected genes, positive selection can lead to an inflation of the apparent mutation rate. To avoid this, the mutation burdens described in this paper were estimated only from passenger genes. Synonymous sites can also be used as a proxy for the neutral mutation rate, as described before2. Finally, mutation burdens estimated from targeted regions can be inflated or deflated by the undue influence of one or a few large clones. For example, if a sample is dominated by a large clone, the presence of a passenger mutation in the clone overlapping the target region would lead to an overestimation of the mutation burden, whereas the absence of any mutation in the clone in the target region would lead to a modest underestimate of the burden. This is apparent in the targeted NanoSeq data for blood (Fig. 1c), in which a few samples show inflated burden estimates due to high VAF passenger mutations. Some duplex sequencing studies avoid this by counting each mutant site only once, but this leads to a systematic underestimation of mutation burdens, leading to lower bound estimates of the mutation burden. Instead, for the targeted NanoSeq blood data, we calculated the CIs for the mutation burden using Poisson bootstrapping of the mutant sites, resulting in wider CIs when one or a few sites had an undue influence in the burden estimate. In general, burden estimates from targeted NanoSeq are expected to be most reliable when working with highly polyclonal samples or when the size of the panel is considerably larger than the inverse of the mutation rate per base pair.

We inferred mutational signatures of SBS using the sigfit (v.2.1.0) R package70. Genome strand information for each target gene was used to produce transcriptional strand-wise (TSW) trinucleotide mutation catalogues (192 mutation categories) for mutations within genes, using the build_catalogues function in sigfit. Inference was performed for a range of signature numbers (N = 2,…,5), using the TSW mutation counts from 92 oral epithelium samples having 500 or more mutations each. To account for variation in sequence composition, observed mutation opportunities (trinucleotide frequencies based on the NanoSeq coverage per site for each sample) were supplied to the extract_signatures function. Mutation opportunities were assumed to be equal between the transcribed and untranscribed strands. The best-supported number of signatures, on the basis of overall goodness-of-fit and consistency with known COSMIC signatures (v.3.0; cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures), was found to be N = 2. Of the two inferred signatures, signature A corresponded to a combination of COSMIC signatures SBS1 (6%) and SBS5 (94%) (cosine similarity 0.90), whereas signature B was highly similar to COSMIC SBS16 (cosine similarity 0.97). To estimate the contribution of both signatures to all oral epithelium samples, these two signatures were fitted to the TSW mutation counts for each sample using the fit_signatures function. Signature burdens (mutations per diploid genome attributed to each signature) were calculated by multiplying the signature exposure estimates by the whole-genome passenger mutation burden estimates for each sample. Before plotting using the plot_spectrum function, signatures were transformed to a genome-relative representation by scaling their probability values according to the corresponding whole-genome human trinucleotide frequencies, using the convert_signatures function.

A high rate of T>C mutations at ApT dinucleotides is common to the COSMIC SBS5 and SBS16 signatures. To explore whether these T>C mutations are caused by similar underlying processes, we studied the extended (pentanucleotide) sequence context of T>C mutations in several datasets. To do so, we obtained TSW pentanucleotide counts for T>C substitutions (256 mutation categories) applying a custom R function to mutations in the following sample sets: (1) matched blood samples (n = 371); (2) hepatocellular carcinoma (Liver HCC) samples from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes study71 (downloaded from dcc.icgc.org/pcawg) for which signature fitting estimated a COSMIC SBS16 exposure greater than 0.2 (n = 4); (3) oral epithelium samples with signature B exposure greater than 0.25 (n = 121) and (4) oral epithelium samples with signature B exposure less than 0.25 (n = 921). Before plotting using custom R functions, pentanucleotide catalogues were transformed to a genome-relative representation by scaling mutation counts according to the corresponding whole-genome human pentanucleotide frequencies. The results of this analysis are described in Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Note 3.

Mutation catalogues of DBSs (78 mutation categories) and indels (83 mutation categories) were produced for mutations in the following sample sets: (1) all oral epithelium samples (n = 1,042); (2) oral epithelium samples from heavy-smoking non-drinking donors (n = 27) and (3) oral epithelium samples from non-smoking non-drinking donors (n = 224). DBS catalogues were produced using a custom R function, whereas indel catalogues were produced using the indel.spectrum function in the Indelwald tool (24 September 2021 version; github.com/MaximilianStammnitz/Indelwald). Although we attempted both de novo extraction and fitting of mutational signatures to the DBS and indel catalogues, mutation numbers were not large enough to allow inference of informative signatures or exposures. Mutation spectra for DBS and indels were plotted using the plot_spectrum function in sigfit. The results of this analysis are described in Extended Data Fig. 8 and Supplementary Note 3.

To test for associations between epidemiological variables and rates of mutational signatures or driver mutation frequencies, we used mixed-effect regression models (lmer function in the lme4 R package72) as described below.

For the analyses shown in the main text, we ran a separate regression model for each outcome variable: SNV burden, signature A burden, signature B burden, indel burden, dinucleotide burden, the sum of all driver frequencies in a sample and the driver density per sample for ten major driver genes. To avoid excessive loss of statistical power due to multiple testing correction across all outcome variables and predictors, and to focus on the genes with the highest information content, we restricted the regression analyses to 10 driver genes with ≥1,000 or more coding mutations across mutation types (missense, truncating or no-SNVs) in the dataset, and with dN/dS ≥ 5 (that is, with an estimated driver fraction of 80% or more).

For the analyses in the main text, we selected nine variables as predictors in multiple regression models, including major oral cancer risk factors as well as other potentially relevant variables: age, sex (female individuals or male individuals), pack-years, drink-years, type 2 diabetes (T2D, Y/N), body mass index, missing teeth, physical activity score (International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)) and cancer history (Y/N). The twin structure was modelled with a random effect. The R code used for these and supplementary regressions is provided in the Supplementary Code, but for illustrative purposes the structure was as follows:

Only samples with a mean duplex coverage across genes ≥200 dx and available metadata for all the predictor variables and the outcome variable in each multiple regression model were included for analyses. Twelve samples with potential evidence of HPV reads (above) and six samples with a self-reported history of chemotherapy were excluded from the regression. These variables may be expected to have mutagenic and/or selectogenic effects on the oral epithelium, but the number of affected donors was too low for a robust analysis in the current study.

P values were calculated for each covariate in each multivariate regression model using a likelihood-ratio test by comparing the likelihood of the full model with a model without each variable, using the drop1 function in R. Multiple testing adjustment using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was then applied to all P values in the main text analyses (126 tests: 14 predictors × 9 outcome variables).

Extra regression analyses, including using extended medication data as predictors, interaction analyses between smoking and alcohol, and measures of selection (corrected for mutation rates) as outcome variables for the detection of selectogenic influences, are described in Supplementary Note 7. Methods and supplementary results for GWAS analyses and heritability tests are described in Supplementary Note 8.

a, Integrative Genomics Viewer image73 showing sequencing reads and coverage for three NanoSeq protocols at the TP53 locus: sonication followed by mung bean nuclease treatment NanoSeq (MB-NanoSeq, top), Ultrashear enzymatic fragmentation NanoSeq (US-NanoSeq, middle), and restriction enzyme NanoSeq (RE-NanoSeq, bottom). Reads are coloured by mapping orientation. MB- and US-NanoSeq show the coverage in merged bams containing all the cord blood samples analysed in this study, whereas RE-NanoSeq shows the coverage in 12 buccal samples. b, Evenness of coverage for the three protocols described in a. Lorenz coverage curves for three million sites sampled from the corresponding bams (locus chr17:6000000-9000000), resulting in Gini coefficients of 0.66 for RE-NanoSeq, 0.18 for MB-NanoSeq and 0.22 for US-NanoSeq. c, Genome-wide mutation burden estimates, as mutations per base pair, for adult pancreas samples formalin-fixed for 3 days (3 d) or 17 days (17 d), and sequenced using four different protocols (sonic refers to sonication and enz to enzymatic fragmentation). Error bars show Poisson 95% CIs. Horizontal lines denote the burden and the associated Poisson 95% CIs in a matching fresh-frozen sample.

a, Flow diagram describing the selection of the donor cohort used in this study. b, c, Distribution of zygosity, sex, age, smoking (pack-years) and drinking (drink-years) values for (b) buccal swab (n = 1,042) and (c) archival blood sample donors (n = 371). d, Identification of samples contaminated with human DNA from another individual, comparing the proportion of mutation calls falling in the ‘SNP+noise' mask versus the median fraction of reference bases at alternative homozygous SNPs; point size is proportional to the duplex coverage. The vertical dashed line indicates our exclusion criterion for human contaminated samples (>0.01). e, Identification of samples contaminated with non-human DNA, comparing the dN/dS values in passenger genes versus the percentage of unmapped reads mapping to a set of potential contaminant species. Horizontal dashed line indicates neutral dN/dS=1. Red points indicate samples with upper bound 95% CI dN/dS ratio <1. Vertical dashed line shows our exclusion criterion for non-human contaminated samples (>0.25). f, Histogram of duplex coverage (dx) in the buccal swab cohort, at on-target and near-target regions. Vertical dashed line shows our exclusion criterion for low coverage samples (<50dx). g, Distribution of the mean deduplicated coverage (×) in the buccal swab cohort, at on-target and near-target regions. Raw sequencing coverage is ~6.6 times higher due to the average 85% duplicate rate required for duplex consensus calling. h, Estimation of epithelial fraction in buccal swab samples by targeted enzymatic methylation sequencing. Vertical dashed line shows the median epithelial fraction of 0.95. i, Sequencing quality metrics including the on-target capture fractions, estimated excess in strand drop-out (SDO), and the achieved duplicate rates for the buccal swab cohort. Random binomial sampling is expected to cause lack of coverage in one of the DNA strands in a proportion of cases. We estimated the excess in SDO by subtracting the observed and expected SDOs. Box plots show the interquartile range, median, 95% confidence intervals and outliers as dots for the buccal cohort (n = 1,042). j, Relationship between duplicate rates and sequencing efficiency, measured as the number of bases with duplex support divided by the total number of bases sequenced. k, Relationship between duplicate rates and sequencing efficiency after factoring in the on-target fraction (t) and the excess in strand drop-out (SDO). l, Number of duplex calls as a function of the primary alignment score minus secondary alignment score (AS-XS) threshold. m, Substitution burdens calculated within each AS-XS threshold corrected for trinucleotide context. Error bars for substitution burdens indicate Poisson 95% CIs. n, o, Hotspots covered by different AS-XS thresholds, shown as (n) total number of hotspots and (o) their aggregated frequency in TCGA. Horizontal dashed line indicates the detection of all studied hotspots.

a, Numbers of total mutations, coding SNVs and coding indels identified in whole blood samples from 371 donors using targeted NanoSeq. b, Trinucleotide mutational spectra of adult haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) colonies from a previous study56 and whole blood samples sequenced using targeted NanoSeq (corrected by the ratio of genomic to observed trinucleotide frequencies). c, Distribution of (log10-scaled) unbiased VAFs for mutations with sequencing depth ≥2000× identified in 371 whole blood samples using targeted NanoSeq. Unbiased VAFs are calculated from read bundles not used for duplex variant calling. d, Relationship between donor ages (years) for matched buccal swab samples and archival blood samples (n = 371). The diagonal line represents the identity function, y = x. e, Venn diagram summarising the overlaps between three approaches for identifying genes under significant positive selection by dNdScv in the archival blood targeted NanoSeq data. f, Ratio of estimated driver densities between buccal swab samples and archival blood samples, for 10 genes identified as being under gene-level significant positive selection in both blood and buccal swab samples. g-j, Mutation barplots for DNMT3A, TET2, CBL and MYD88. The x-axis represents coordinates along the coding sequence. Exons and protein domains are indicated along the x-axis. The y-axis represents number of mutations, either in the 371 TwinsUK archival blood samples used in this study (top) or in lymphoid and haematopoietic neoplasm samples (whole-exome and whole-genome) from the COSMIC database (bottom). Mutations are coloured according to mutation consequence category. Grey shading indicates cumulative duplex coverage across TwinsUK archival blood samples.

a, Regression of SNV mutation burden with age for 12 samples selected from across the age range (black dots), three samples with high SigB signature contribution (grey), and one sample with a high mutation burden from a donor with a history of CHOP chemotherapy treatment (orange). The regression results listed within the plot were generated using only the 12 samples randomly selected for their age range. Error bars show Poisson 95% CIs for the estimated burdens (substitutions per cell). P-values calculated with t-test and 2 degrees of freedom. b, Transcription-coupled repair and damage in three donors with high contribution of SigB. Estimated substitution burdens plus their associated 95% CIs (error bars) across upstream, transcribed and downstream regions, showing T > C and A > G in the coding strand separately. c, Number of substitutions per Mbp per year in 12 age range donors for each of 10 major ENCODE chromatin states. Reference chromatin states were obtained from ENCODE E057 foreskin keratinocytes. Chromatin states BivFlnk, EnhBiv, TssBiv, TxFlnk, and ZNF/Rpts were removed given their smaller footprint and too large confidence intervals. Burdens were normalised to whole genome trinucleotide frequencies. Error bars show Poisson 95% CIs. d, Number of substitutions per Mbp per year in 3 donors with strong SigB exposure for each of 10 major ENCODE chromatin states. Only T > C rates are shown, calculated as the number of T > C substitutions observed and divided by the number of [TA] bps. Error bars show Poisson 95% CIs. e, Cosine similarities between the observed and reconstructed substitution profiles as a function of the number of mutations in each sample, highlighting the outlier donor with a history of CHOP chemotherapy treatment (brown). f, Transcriptional strand-wise trinucleotide SBS spectrum for the outlier CHOP donor. g, Numbers of total mutations, coding SNVs and coding indels identified in oral epithelium samples from 1,042 donors using targeted NanoSeq. h, Numbers of non-synonymous mutations identified by targeted NanoSeq per donor in oral epithelium for genes NOTCH1, TP53, FAT1 and NOTCH2. Mutation counts are ordered independently for each gene.

a, For the 49 significant driver genes in oral epithelium (of which DNMT3A, TET2 and FOXP1 are likely attributable to low-level blood contamination, as shown in Extended Data Fig. 3f), panels show (top to bottom) mutation counts per mutation consequence category, dN/dS ratios per mutation consequence category (horizontal line indicates neutral dN/dS=1), estimated mutant cell percentages in donors aged 65-85, and the distribution of unbiased VAFs. b, Spearman's correlation and associated P-values between the generalised linear model residuals for driver burden across top driver genes (defined as genes with >1,000 driver mutations across mutational classes with >80% estimated driver fraction). c, Venn diagrams summarising (top) the overlaps between four approaches for identifying genes under significant positive selection genes in TwinsUK oral epithelium by dNdScv, and (bottom) driver genes in TwinsUK oral epithelium samples and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSC) in The Cancer Genome Atlas. d, Left. Estimated mutant cell fraction in oral epithelium per donor for 12 genes. Each dot represents one donor in the dataset (restricted to 65-85 year old donors, n = 583). The estimated mutant cell fraction represents an upper bound estimate using the sum of duplex VAFs multiplied by 2 for genes in diploid chromosomes (see Methods for an explanation of the assumptions and rationale). This analysis takes into account all non-synonymous mutations observed in each gene in each donor. The red line represents the median estimated cell fraction across donors. Right. Observed VAFs (shown as percentages) for all non-synonymous SNVs in each gene in each donor, restricted to sites with ≥1000× coverage (most values < 0.01% had unbiased VAFs = 0). Each dot represents one mutation. This highlights that the vast majority of mutations observed across genes have very low VAFs, with only a small number of mutations having VAFs>2% (largely in clonal haematopoiesis genes and a few in TP53). e, Comparison of dN/dS ratios per gene between healthy oral epithelium (top) and HNSC (bottom). f, Observed missense (top) and truncating (bottom) dN/dS ratios per gene for the 239 genes in the dataset, with 95% confidence intervals, showing that dN/dS ratios are close to 1 for the vast majority of genes, with only a small minority of genes showing clear negative selection.

a-i, Mutation distribution within nine selected genes. The x-axis represents coordinates along the coding sequence. Exons and protein domains are indicated along the x-axis. The y-axis represents number of mutations, either in the 1,042 TwinsUK oral epithelium samples used in this study (top) or across whole-exome and whole-genome samples of any cancer type in the COSMIC database (bottom). Mutations are coloured according to mutation consequence category. Grey shading indicates cumulative duplex coverage across TwinsUK samples. j, Diagrams of the 3-dimensional structure of CHK2 (encoded by CHEK2), showing the clustering of sites under significant positive selection on one side of the forkhead-association domain. Residues with site-level dN/dS q-value < 0.01 are coloured. Shading intensity denotes degree of significance. k, Fraction of significant genes (top) and fraction of mutations contributed by genes identified as significant (bottom) identified by gene-level dN/dS across subsamples of the buccal swab cohort. l, Fraction of significant sites (top) and fraction of mutations contributed by sites identified as significant (bottom) by site-level dN/dS for five genes across subsamples of the buccal swab cohort. m, Observed and expected (withingenednds) density of mutations as a function of position relative to the transcription start site (TSS), aggregated across all targeted genes. n, Distribution of site-level dN/dS ratios for sites annotated in ClinVar as benign, pathogenic or of uncertain significance, in NOTCH1, TP53 and PPM1D. Significant sites are shown in red. Box plots show the interquartile range, median, 95% confidence intervals and outliers as grey/red dots.

a-c, Graphs illustrating the increase in the fraction of cells carrying a driver mutation as a function of age, as predicted by (a) exponential, (b) quadratic and (c) logistic models of clonal growth. The dotted line in (c) represents the prediction from a linear growth model. In all three cases, we used a driver mutation rate per cell per year of μ = 4 × 10−6 (1000 driver sites per genome, 4 × 10−9 mutations per cell per year). Other parameters for the three growth models were chosen to obtain a fraction of cells with a driver mutation around 10-15% by age 80, to facilitate comparison to the buccal swab data in Fig. 4a. The parameters used are the following: (a) exponential model using r = 0.1, (b) quadratic model using r = 0.2, (c) logistic model using L = 500 and r = 0.5.

a, Transcriptional strand-wise versions of the trinucleotide SBS spectra shown in Fig. 4b. b, Transcriptional strand-wise pentanucleotide spectra of T > C SBSs in (top to bottom): blood samples (n = 371), hepatocellular carcinoma samples (Liver HCC; Supplementary Note 3) with >20% SBS16 exposure (n = 4), oral epithelium samples with >25% Signature B exposure (n = 121), and oral epithelium samples with <25% Signature B exposure (n = 921). c, Trinucleotide substitution spectra for non-drinking, never-smoking (left) and non-drinking, heavy smoking (right) donors. d, DBS spectra in (top to bottom): all oral epithelium samples (n = 1,042), oral epithelium from heavy smoking, non-drinking donors (n = 27), and oral epithelium from non-smoking, non-drinking donors (n = 224). e, Spectra of indels in the same sample sets shown in d.

a, Heatmap of associations between different measures of mutation burden, signature burden or driver density (y-axis) and relevant donor metadata (x-axis), inferred using linear mixed-effects regression (LMER) models with (top) inverse-normal transformation (INT) or (bottom) outlier removal, where outliers are defined as those values larger than 3 × IQR + Q3 (where IQR is the interquartile range and Q3 is the third quartile for each outcome variable). The P-value of each association is calculated with a Likelihood ratio test and is indicated by both colour shading (red and blue for positive and negative associations, respectively) and asterisk labels (****: q < 10−4; ***: q < 10−3; **: q < 0.01; *: q < 0.05; •: P < 0.05; q-values were calculated with the Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery method). b, Additional SNV burden obtained after regressing out confounders using an LMER model for (left) smoking history across pack-year bins and (right) alcohol consumption history across drink-year bins. Error bars show 95% confindence intervals. Smoking pack-year bins: (−1,0] n = 632 (not shown), (0,5] n = 139, (5,10] n = 63, (10,15] n = 41, (15,20] n = 40, (20,25] n = 21, (25,30] n = 20, (30,35] n = 11, (35,40] n = 16, (40,45] n = 6, and (45,50] n = 4; Drink-year bins: (−1,0] n = 305 (not shown), (0,70] n = 378, (70,140] n = 200, (140,210] n = 92, (210,280] n = 31, and (280,350] n = 13. c, Heatmap (as described in a) with medication history included as predictors. BMI stands for body mass index; IPAQ score for International Physical Activity Questionnaire; ACEIs for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; ARBs for angiotensin receptor blockers; NSAIDs for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; PPIs for proton pump inhibitors; SSRIs for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. d, Heatmap (as described in a) using a multivariate LMER model with the driver density per gene per donor normalised by the exonic mutation burden in passenger genes per donor. Normalisation was achieved by either (left) using the ratio of driver density and mutation burden as a new outcome variable for each driver gene or (right) including the mutation burden as a covariate. e, Heatmaps showing the fraction of significant tests (P < 0.05 or 5e-8, as indicated above each heatmap) for simulations of different variables, for different effect sizes (y-axes), and different fractions of affected individuals (x-axes). The contour line in each heatmap shows the conditions that provide 80% power (i.e. 80% of significant tests).

a, Fraction of ATA > ACA or ATT > ACT SNVs in samples presenting high (top 5%, red) or low (bottom 5%, blue) exposure to Signature B (SigB).

Metallic alloys are routinely subjected to nonequilibrium processes during manufacturing, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical processing. It has been suggested in the high-entropy alloy literature that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a new knob to tailor materials properties. While evidence of the effect of SRO on materials properties accumulates, the state of SRO evolution during alloy manufacturing remains obscure. Here, we employ high-fidelity atomistic simulations to track SRO evolution during the solidification and thermomechanical processing of alloys. Our investigation reveals that alloy processing can lead to nonequilibrium steady-states of SRO that are different from any equilibrium state. The mechanism behind nonequilibrium SRO formation is shown to be an inherent ordering bias present in nonequilibrium events. These results demonstrate that conventional manufacturing processes provide pathways for tuning SRO that lead to a broad nonequilibrium spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium design space of alloys.

Properties of metallic alloys are defined by their chemical composition and microstructure, i.e., the hierarchical arrangement of atoms into structures (known as defects) of different types, densities, and spatial distribution. The processing route during manufacturing is designed to lead metals to predetermined microstructures and chemical configurations. For example, after solidification, the as-cast alloy is often heat treated to reduce chemical segregation, and then subjected to mechanical deformation to increase the density of linear defects (dislocations) because that strengthens the material — a process known as work hardening. Recently, in the high-entropy materials literature1,2,2,3,4, it has been suggested that chemical short-range order (SRO) could offer a new knob to tailor materials properties. Controlling SRO during manufacturing would broaden the design space of metallic alloys without altering their microstructure and chemical composition, offering an additional independent dimension of materials property design.

Chemical SRO is the preference for certain local chemical motifs over others5,6,7. This collection of chemical motifs acts as the background against which the microstructure exists, thereby affecting materials properties by modulating the behavior of crystal defects. Evidence of the effects of SRO on materials properties has been accumulating at a rapid pace, from mechanical properties8,9 to corrosion resistance10,11, catalysis12, and radiation-damage resistance13,14. Controlling such materials properties through SRO requires tuning the amount of SRO present in the material, which is not an easy feat to accomplish in practice. The conventional route is to hold the alloy at a fixed temperature until thermodynamic equilibrium has been achieved (i.e., annealing), establishing with it the corresponding equilibrium SRO at that temperature15,16,17,18. Higher annealing temperatures lead to more disorder and less SRO, while lower temperatures lead to more SRO. Under this approach, the lowest amount of SRO is limited by the melting temperature, which is the highest temperature the alloy can withstand in its solid phase. At intermediate temperatures, this annealing process is often exceedingly slow18 and costly because equilibrium SRO is created through chemically-biased vacancy diffusion, which is a thermally-activated event; at room temperature, most alloys would take centuries to achieve equilibrium. After annealing, the alloy is quickly cooled down to room temperature (i.e., quenched), freezing in the desired degree of SRO.

Alloys are subjected to various other processes besides annealing during their manufacturing, most of which are nonequilibrium processes known to affect the chemical state of the alloy, such as rapid solidification and thermomechanical treatments19,20,21,22. While equilibrium statistical physics and thermodynamics explain the SRO evolution during equilibrium processes, the state of SRO during alloy manufacturing remains obscure due to the absence of an equivalent physical framework for nonequilibrium processes. This reflects a lack of understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of SRO evolution during nonequilibrium processes. These mechanisms must be uncovered and quantified if the SRO knob is to be dialed for the practical co-design of material properties alongside the traditional microstructure and chemical composition degrees of freedom.

Here, we show that nonequilibrium manufacturing processes lead to steady-state chemical short-range order (SRO) that cannot be accessed through equilibrium thermodynamics. Using large-scale atomistic simulations and a minimal physical model, we uncover that these nonequilibrium SRO states arise from inherent ordering biases during processing, such as dislocation motion and solidification dynamics. We construct a physical framework that captures this behavior and delineates a broad spectrum of SRO states beyond the equilibrium manifold, including both quasi-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium regimes.

Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of solidification and thermomechanical processing of the chemically-complex CrCoNi alloy (Supplementary Movies 1–4) were carried out using a high-fidelity machine learning interatomic potential23. This potential was specifically designed to capture chemical SRO with accuracy comparable to electronic-structure calculations, including SRO effects on the solid phase, liquid phase, and microstructural elements such as dislocations. See Supplementary Note 11 for a collection of predictions made with this potential that are in good agreement with experimental results.

The simulations of thermomechanical processing, illustrated in Fig. 1a, were performed by first annealing the alloy at a high temperature, which established an initial equilibrium SRO state. The alloy was then subjected to work hardening through uniaxial tensile deformation at room temperature (300 K), where a constant strain rate of 109 s−1 was applied along the [100] crystallographic direction. The stress measured during the tensile deformation after annealing at 1000 K is shown as a function of the total strain in Fig. 1b, where it can be seen that the elastic deformation regime is followed by a plastic deformation regime in which strengthening occurs until a plateau is achieved24,25.

The reported Dsro values of the as-cast alloy correspond to the final solidified structure. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

The mechanism behind the stress-strain curve in Fig. 1b is the motion and multiplication of dislocations to accommodate the imposed strain rate, leading to the development of a complex network of interacting dislocations (Supplementary Movie 2). When dislocations move, they shuffle atoms near their core by breaking certain chemical bonds and forming new ones (Supplementary Movie 1); a process that has been reasonably presumed to lead to the destruction of SRO26,27,28,29,30. Here, we have quantified this SRO destruction using an approach based on machine learning and information theory as established in ref. 5 (see the “Methods” section SRO quantification). In this approach, the collection of chemical motifs observed during the simulation is first identified using machine learning, and then compared to the distribution of chemical motifs expected in a chemically random alloy. This comparison is performed using a rigorous metric of information known as Jensen-Shannon divergence31,32 (Dsro). Larger values of Dsro indicate higher amounts of SRO, while Dsro = 0 indicates a chemically random alloy (i.e., the absence of SRO). The evolution of SRO during deformation (Fig. 1c) shows that SRO is being progressively destroyed by dislocation motion. However, we find that mechanical deformation does not lead to the complete annihilation of SRO; the SRO trajectory in Fig. 1c indicates that dislocation motion leads to an ultimate steady-state with finite SRO, which we refer to as remnant SRO.

The plastic deformation of alloys can be rigorously regarded as a nonequilibrium process24,25,33,34,35,36,37. The system in Fig. 1a is driven persistently by the mechanical energy provided by the applied strain, which is continuously dissipated by dislocations as they move, multiply, and annihilate each other38. The remnant SRO observed in Fig. 1c is an emergent outcome of this complex system. One could reasonably expect35,36,37 remnant SRO to originate from the competition between thermally-activated vacancy diffusion, which drives SRO towards equilibrium, and chemical mixing due to dislocation motion, which has been presumed to be completely randomizing. But we find that chemical equilibration due to vacancy diffusion is negligible during mechanical deformation at room temperature under the applied strain rate (Supplementary Fig. 16a). This demonstrates that the mechanism leading to remnant SRO is an inherent ordering bias during dislocation motion.

We turn now to investigate the process of solidification from the melt using the simulations illustrated in Fig. 1d and Supplementary Movie 4. The temperature T in these simulations was held at a fixed value lower than the melting temperature23Tm = 1661 K, which defines the degree of undercooling ΔT = Tm − T. The rate at which the solid grows (i.e., the solid-liquid interface velocity in Fig. 1d) was measured for a wide range of undercooling temperatures, as shown in Fig. 1e. The growth-rate dependence on ΔT (Fig. 1e) can be understood through the Wilson-Frenkel model (see, for example, ref. 39) as follows. At low ΔT, the growth rate is primarily limited by the thermodynamic driving force of solidification (i.e., free energy difference between the solid and liquid phases), resulting in an increase in growth rate with increasing ΔT because the driving force increases with ΔT. However, as undercooling increases, the limiting factor gradually shifts from the thermodynamic driving force to the diffusion kinetics at the interface because the diffusivity decreases with ΔT. Thus, at high ΔT, atomic mobility is too slow to keep up with the increasing driving force, and the growth rate stagnates leading to the observed plateau in Fig. 1e. Here we have limited ΔT to just below the turnover point where the growth rate starts decreasing with ΔT, as in that regime the concept of steady-state solidification might not be applicable due to liquid-phase instabilities40. The observed growth rates varied by more than two orders of magnitude, from as slow as 0.43 m/s at ΔT = 1 K, to faster than 100 m/s for ΔT ≥ 261 K. These growth rates cover the entire spectrum of manufacturing processes, from traditional casting to the rapid solidification rates of modern additive manufacturing methods. The SRO formation during solidification was quantified by measuring the amount of SRO (Dsro) in the solidified (or as-cast) alloy as a function of the undercooling, as shown in Fig. 1f. We find that lower undercoolings lead to higher amounts of SRO, but even ultrafast solidification rates do not lead to the absence of SRO; instead, a finite amount of remnant SRO is observed.

The kinetics of solidification is a complex physical process in which atoms in the liquid self-organize into the crystalline solid phase — a transition that occurs at the interface between the solid and liquid phases39,41. The rate at which this transition happens (i.e., growth rate) determines the SRO of the as-cast state (see Supplementary Fig. 21). Slower growth rates provide liquid atoms more time to self-organize and form chemical SRO in the solid phase. However, even at ΔT = 1 K the amount of remnant SRO (Dsro = 0.0201 bits) is still significantly lower than the equilibrium SRO at the melting temperature (Dsro = 0.0323 bits). This indicates that manufactured as-cast alloys should not be considered devoid of SRO, nor considered to have the SRO of an equilibrium alloy at the melting point42. The lowest amount of remnant SRO is obtained for ΔT ≥ 261 K, which coincides with the plateau in growth rate (Fig. 1e, f). Under these far-from-equilibrium conditions the liquid atoms have little time to self-organize.

Equilibrium statistical physics and thermodynamics—which define the SRO of equilibrium processes5—cannot explain the remnant SRO observed during materials processing (Fig. 1). A physical framework that explicitly accounts for nonequilibrium processes is needed. To derive this framework, we introduce in Fig. 2a the simplest physical model capable of accounting for the effects of nonequilibrium processes on SRO (see the “Methods” section Physical model for nonequilibrium SRO). In this model, only two types of dynamical events are in operation: thermal and athermal. During thermal events, a random pair of atoms is selected, and their positions are swapped following an acceptance probability given by the traditional Metropolis-Hastings algorithm43,44. Such thermal events are characterized by their temperature T, and guide the alloy towards the corresponding equilibrium SRO at this temperature. Athermal events are similar, but the swapping of atoms is always accepted, which drives the alloy towards random chemical mixing. The role of athermal events is to mimic the forced chemical mixing of nonequilibrium processes.

a The model has only two possible dynamical events, which are enough to capture the effect of nonequilibrium processes on SRO. Thermal events guide the alloy towards equilibrium SRO at temperature T, while athermal events drive the alloy towards random chemical mixing. Athermal events are periodically introduced with frequency γ. b Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that this simple physical model captures the emergence of remnant SRO. c Spectrum of remnant SRO as a function of the model's temperature and nonequilibrium driving force γ. The highlighted state at 600 K and γ = 0.04 step−1 has nearly the same amount of SRO (Dsro) as an alloy in equilibrium at 800 K. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Athermal events are periodically introduced in between thermal events with frequency γ, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. The parameter γ is the nonequilibrium driving force in this model because it quantifies the deviation from equilibrium conditions, which is a role analogous to the strain rate during mechanical deformation (Fig. 1a) or the degree of undercooling during solidification (Fig. 1d). The SRO evolution derived from the model (Fig. 2b) shows that the competition between thermal and athermal events leads to a steady-state of finite SRO, which is similar to what was observed for mechanical deformation (Fig. 1c). This demonstrates that the model captures the emergence of remnant SRO. The effect of γ on remnant SRO is shown in Fig. 2c, where we find that remnant SRO converges to the equilibrium SRO as γ → 0. Meanwhile, increasing γ drives the alloy to far-from-equilibrium conditions with remnant SRO much different from its equilibrium value.

Notice in Fig. 2c how the remnant SRO at 600 K and γ = 0.04 step−1 has nearly the same Dsro as the equilibrium SRO of an alloy at 800 K. This raises the question of whether these two SRO states are physically equivalent. But this equivalency cannot be established by simply comparing the Dsro value of both states because Dsro is a metric of the amount of SRO in the alloy: it measures only the distance between the SRO state from the chemical state of a random alloy, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. It is reasonable that these two SRO states could have the same amount of SRO (i.e., Dsro) while being physically distinct. We have developed a rigorous approach to establish whether or not remnant and equilibrium SRO states are equivalent, which is described next.

a The remnant SRO state (brown circle) has the same amount of SRO (i.e., Dsro) as the equilibrium state (dark red circle). Deff measures how far the remnant SRO is from the equilibrium spectrum of SRO states. b Diagram of nonequilibrium SRO states as a function of materials processing conditions (temperature and driving force). The effective temperature Teff of a remnant SRO state (indicated by the contour lines) is the temperature of the equilibrium SRO state closest to it. Quasi-equilibrium SRO states are physically indistinguishable from their effective equilibrium states. Far-from-equilibrium SRO states do not correspond to any equilibrium state. The far-from-equilibrium region (orange) comprises states whose Deff values exceed the expected Deff under equilibrium. These states do not possess a physically meaningful Teff. c Illustration of how nonequilibrium processes lead to the three states shown in Fig. 3b. Tm = 1661 K is the melting temperature. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We start by first evaluating the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the remnant SRO and every possible equilibrium SRO state (see Supplementary Fig. 3a). The lowest value of the divergence identifies the effective equilibrium state of the remnant SRO, illustrated in Fig. 3a by Deff (see the Methods section, Effective temperature calculation for more details). This equilibrium SRO state, characterized by a temperature Teff, is the equilibrium state most similar to the remnant SRO of an alloy at temperature T under a nonequilibrium driving force γ. Figure 3b shows how Teff varies with T and γ, with further discussion on the dependence of materials properties on Deff and Teff provided in Supplementary Note 5.

Let us consider now how to use Deff (Fig. 3a) to establish whether or not the remnant SRO of an alloy at temperature T and driving force γ is equivalent to the equilibrium SRO state at temperature Teff. Naively, one could erroneously suggest that the states are equivalent only if Deff = 0. Yet even equilibrium states have Deff ≠ 0 due to the nature of thermal fluctuations. Hence, the correct criteria to determine equivalency is to establish whether or not Deff is statistically distinguishable from its expected value in equilibrium. This analysis identifies an equilibrium state with temperature Teff that is physically indistinguishable from the remnant SRO of an alloy at temperature T under a nonequilibrium driving force γ. We call these states quasi-equilibrium SRO because the nonequilibrium process is quasistatic in the sense that linear-response theory is appropriate and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is applicable45 (see Supplementary Note 4). In the language of the field of driven alloys, we can say that the law of corresponding states proposed by Martin46 is rigorously obeyed for SRO under these driven conditions.

Finally, the states of remnant SRO with Deff outside of the equilibrium range (see Supplementary Note 3) are physically distinguishable from their corresponding effective equilibrium state at temperature Teff. Consequently, the law of corresponding states46 is not an appropriate framework to describe the SRO of such states. We call these states far-from-equilibrium SRO because they can only be achieved in processes with large nonequilibrium driving forces, i.e., beyond linear-response theory approximations (see Supplementary Note 4). Far-from-equilibrium states, illustrated in Fig. 3b, cannot be achieved through thermal equilibration of the alloy, such as annealing processes.

The physical framework for nonequilibrium processes introduced in Figs. 2, 3a can be summarized in a diagram of nonequilibrium SRO states, shown in Fig. 3b. This diagram explains the effect of nonequilibrium processes on SRO (Fig. 3c), which can be used to understand the remnant SRO observed during materials processing (Fig. 1).

We now turn to the analysis of the remnant SRO observed during solidification and thermomechanical processing (Fig. 1) using the physical framework for nonequilibrium SRO developed in Figs. 2, 3. Figure 4a shows that the remnant SRO in the as-cast alloy is far-from-equilibrium for any degree of undercooling ΔT employed during solidification. The lack of reduction in Deff with decreasing ΔT is a result that warrants a brief discussion in light of the increase in SRO with decreasing ΔT observed in Fig. 1f. Smaller ΔT provides liquid atoms more than two orders of magnitude (Fig. 1e) more time to self-organize and form chemical SRO, but Fig. 4a shows that liquid atoms do not use that time to find SRO configurations closer to the ones observed in equilibrium states. This indicates that the ordering bias during solidification is such that the nature of the nonequilibrium SRO formed is fundamentally different from equilibrium SRO—more time to self-organize results in more intense SRO of this different, far-from-equilibrium kind. Figure 4c suggests that a large portion of the SRO of the as-cast alloy is in fact inherited from the liquid phase: notice how most of the Warren-Cowley parameters (αAB) of the solidified alloy are closer to the liquid phase than to the solid phase, even at the smallest undercoolings. This observation suggests the following physical mechanism of SRO formation during solidification. It is well-established that the solid-liquid interface is a region of finite width that is structurally and chemically different from both the solid and the liquid. During solidification, atoms in the solid-liquid interface undergo a diffusion process that leads to their final arrangement into the as-cast crystalline structure. Thus, the nature of this diffusion process (which can be significantly different from the diffusion in the liquid and solid) dictates the resulting SRO state of the as-cast alloy. In ref. 39 it was observed that the solid-liquid interface is a liquid-like region that has its structure altered (with respect to liquid in the bulk) by the influence of the nearby solid surface—an effect that was called interface-induced ordering. Here, we build on that observation to propose that the diffusion mechanism in the solid-liquid interface is also more akin to those of the liquid, which is substantially different from the vacancy-driven diffusion that creates equilibrium SRO in solids. As the undercooling temperature decreases, the increased time available for atomic rearrangement in the liquid phase allows for more of the chemically-biased diffusion in the solid-liquid interface to take place—effectively equilibrating the SRO according to the structure and diffusion in the solid-liquid interface. This results in a far-from-equilibrium SRO that progressively deviates from the liquid SRO as undercooling decreases, but that is still significantly different from the bulk solid state (see Supplementary Figs. 20, 21). This mechanism of SRO formation is behind recent experimental observations and empirical models42,47,48.

The remnant SRO states created during (a) solidification (Fig. 1d) are far-from-equilibrium, while (b) thermomechanical processing (Fig. 1a) leads to quasi-equilibrium states. The reported Deff values correspond to the final snapshots of the simulations. The boundary between quasi-equilibrium (green) and far-from-equilibrium (orange) regimes is defined by calculating the expected value of Deff in equilibrium (see Supplementary Note 3). c Most of the Warren-Cowley parameters (αAB) of the as-cast alloy (ΔT = 1 K undercooling) are closer to the liquid phase than to the solid phase, suggesting that a large portion of the far-from-equilibrium SRO is inherited from the liquid (see also Supplementary Fig. 21). The gray shaded region denotes the range of αAB values between the solid and liquid equilibrium states. d Evolution of the amount of SRO (Dsro) during mechanical deformation of samples prepared using different thermal treatments. The predictive model for Dsro (inset equation and dashed lines) is derived from the observed linear behavior of the (e) entropy-production rate on Dsro. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

The thermomechanical processing of the alloy leads to quasi-equilibrium SRO, as shown in Fig. 4b for the simulation of Fig. 1a and three additional tensile tests with samples prepared using two additional annealing temperatures and a chemically random sample (i.e., a random solid solution—RSS). The nonequilibrium SRO diagram of Fig. 3b indicates that the alloy must go through a continuous transition between quasi-equilibrium states during the tensile tests; to better understand the mechanisms of this evolution, we look into the SRO trajectory during testing. The evolution of the amount of SRO (Dsro) is shown in Fig. 4d, where it can be seen that all four samples converge to the same path-independent steady state of SRO. The creation of SRO in the RSS sample demonstrates the unequivocal existence of an ordering bias during dislocation motion (Supplementary Note 8), which is at odds with the predominant view in the literature26,27,28,29,49 that SRO is simply destroyed by dislocation motion.

Figure 4e shows that rate of SRO change with time (equivalent to the entropy production rate in nonequilibrium systems) follows a surprisingly simple linear equation: dDsro/dt = λDsro + Γ, with λ = − 2.46 ns−1 and Γ = 6.67 × 10−2 bits/ns. Solving this differential equation provides a predictive model of the time evolution of Dsro, shown in Fig. 4d, where it can be seen that the remnant SRO is given by Dsro(t → ∞) = − Γ/λ. The physical interpretation of this behavior is clear: the rate of SRO destruction by dislocations (λDsro) is proportional to the instantaneous amount of SRO in the sample (Dsro), indicating that the reactions between dislocations and chemical motifs—which destroy SRO—occur more frequently when the amount of SRO in the sample is higher. Meanwhile, the rate of SRO creation by dislocations Γ does not depend on Dsro, indicating that SRO is created homogeneously and continuously as dislocations move. This suggests that this inherent ordering bias is part of the natural process of dislocation motion. Dislocation motion is a process driven by the applied mechanical forces, which favor transition through pathways with low energy barriers. The selection of available energy barriers depends strongly on the local chemical motifs near the dislocation core50, thus, dislocation motion in metallic alloys is a chemically biased process that leads to the creation of nonequilibrium SRO, a process similar to the also-chemically-biased vacancy motion that leads to the creation of equilibrium SRO (Supplementary Note 8).

The diagram of nonequilibrium SRO as a function of materials processing conditions (Fig. 3b) has various features that warrant further discussion within the context of alloy manufacturing. For example, the contour lines within the quasi-equilibrium region indicate that any given effective temperature Teff can be obtained under a variety of different processing conditions (i.e., different combinations of driving force and temperature). This trade-off between T and γ shows that different processing conditions can lead to the same quasi-equilibrium SRO state; this observation can be used to optimize materials processing routes for the co-design of SRO alongside the traditional microstructure and chemical composition degrees of freedom. Note also that the quasi-equilibrium region shows that it is possible to achieve effective SRO temperatures above the melting point of the alloy, i.e., Teff > Tm, as demonstrated in Fig. 3b. These states, which are rigorously characterized as equilibrium states, cannot be achieved without nonequilibrium processes because any practical equilibrium processing route would melt the alloy before reaching temperatures above Tm. Finally, note that the far-from-equilibrium region in Fig. 3b shows that far-from-equilibrium SRO states can be achieved at much smaller driving forces if the nonequilibrium process is carried out at a lower temperature. This indicates that manufacturing processes operating at lower temperatures might be better suited to achieve nonequilibrium SRO—given that controlling temperature is often easier than applying very large driving forces.

Nonequilibrium SRO can arise and be controlled by many other manufacturing processes and conditions in addition to the ones considered here (Fig. 1a, d). While these are too numerous to be accounted for in this work, we offer a brief discussion of cases just beyond the limits of our results. The most immediate of such cases is probably the reduction of the strain rate during mechanical deformation, which would lead to higher remnant SRO and different quasi-equilibrium SRO states, as suggested by Figs. 2c, 3b. Lower strain rates also increase the timescale of the tensile test; if the timescale is long enough for vacancy diffusion to be active, then a qualitatively different mechanism for inducing order will also be active. Similar effects could be achieved by increasing the deformation temperature, which was kept at room temperature in our tensile tests. The overall effect of lowering the strain rate on SRO is not trivial; for example, in addition to vacancy activation, the lower strain rate would also result in more planar slip of dislocations, which has non-obvious consequences on SRO. These examples make it clear that the parameters Γ and λ defining SRO evolution (Fig. 4d) are dependent at least on the processing temperature and strain rate. Meanwhile, the timescale of the solidification conditions considered here (Fig. 1e) covers a wide spectrum of manufacturing processes. Effects immediately beyond those considered here would certainly be those related to longer length scales51, such as, for example, suppressing long-range chemical diffusion during ultra-fast solidification, leading to the extended solubility of chemical elements, and the associated change in the composition available for SRO formation.

Chemical and structural SRO have been extensively studied in metallic glass systems52,53. It is therefore instructive to consider potential parallels with the present work. In metallic glasses, chemical SRO develops within a structurally amorphous matrix that becomes frozen due to kinetic constraints, long before structural equilibration (i.e., crystallization) is achieved. These SRO states are thus inherently nonequilibrium. In contrast, the nonequilibrium SRO states investigated here emerge within crystalline solid solutions, where the underlying lattice remains structurally ordered. In these systems, the nonequilibrium character pertains solely to the chemical configuration, not to the atomic arrangement of the lattice. Consequently, the chemical SRO states examined in this work define a fundamentally distinct regime—one in which chemical order alone evolves out of equilibrium in a structurally ordered lattice.

The physical framework for nonequilibrium SRO derived here is broadly applicable to crystalline solid solutions across various crystal structures, alloy chemistries, and manufacturing processes. It is situated within the field of so-called driven alloys. Foundational work in this field has focused on understanding the phase evolution of alloys under irradiation and severe plastic deformation35,54,55, including the observation of far-from-equilibrium effects such as compositional patterning35 that cannot be captured by effective temperature models54. The work presented here extends the understanding of SRO in driven alloys, and culminates in the nonequilibrium SRO diagram of Fig. 3b.

The present results uncover an extensive variety of nonequilibrium SRO states, and demonstrate that SRO should not be considered a one-dimensional property lying along the random-to-thermal-equilibrium line (Fig. 3c). The traditional manufacturing strategy used to create and control SRO (i.e., annealing) accesses only a small fraction of the possible SRO states. Our results also suggest that advanced manufacturing techniques might be particularly well-suited to explore additional regions of the SRO diagram (Fig. 3b); for example, nonequilibrium SRO can be created through severe plastic deformation, which can be achieved by several deformation-based metal additive manufacturing techniques, such as friction stir and cold spray deposition56,57. Moreover, the slow chemical diffusion during equilibrium processes indicates that nonequilibrium processing might be the only practical route to explore the SRO diagram (Fig. 3b). The observation of remnant SRO (Fig. 1c) is also of interest for the field of materials under extreme conditions, where remnant SRO represents the lower bound for chemical mixing, which affects chemical reactivity in high-energy materials. The extent to which nonequilibrium SRO can be induced is strongly influenced by the chemical complexity of the alloy system. Equiatomic, multi-principal element alloys provide a richer configurational landscape58, that can potentially give rise to more diverse nonequilibrium SRO states. Other intrinsic factors1,2,59 such as atomic size mismatch, electronegativity differences, and mixing enthalpy may further shape the SRO diagram of Fig. 3b, offering additional considerations for selecting alloy chemistries while exploring nonequilibrium SRO.

In summary, our work investigates the evolution of nonequilibrium SRO in crystalline alloys through large-scale atomistic simulations of traditional manufacturing processes. We derive a physical framework grounded in machine learning and information theory to characterize these states and distinguish them from their equilibrium counterparts. The results obtained in this study reveal that a broader spectrum of SRO states can be accessed only through nonequilibrium processing routes, beyond those achievable by traditional annealing. These findings thus call for alternative modes of thinking about SRO during manufacturing; in particular, it calls for strategies for materials properties optimization that co-design SRO alongside the traditional degrees of freedom—i.e., microstructure and chemical composition.

All simulations performed here employed the machine learning interatomic potential for CrCoNi developed in ref. 23 (training set TS-f), which is a moment tensor potential60. This is a high-fidelity potential specifically designed to capture chemical SRO with accuracy comparable to density-functional theory calculations, including SRO effects on the solid phase, liquid phase, and microstructural elements such as dislocations. See Supplementary Note 11 for a collection of predictions made using this potential that are in good agreement with experimental results. All simulations were carried out using the Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS, 27 June 2024 release)61 to evaluate the energy and forces of this potential.

Molecular dynamics simulations of uniaxial tensile deformation were conducted on the face centered cubic (fcc) phase of equiatomic CrCoNi with a timestep of 5 fs. The samples were prepared in four initial conditions: one random solid solution and three annealed (i.e., thermally equilibrated) samples at 650 K, 1000 K, and 1800 K. The initial dimensions of the samples were 30a0 × 100a0 × 100a0 aligned along the [100], [010], and [001] crystallographic axes, respectively, where a0 is the lattice parameter at the appropriate temperature. This resulted in approximately 1.2 million atoms in each sample. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all three dimensions.

After annealing, all samples were seeded with six rhombus-shaped dislocation loops created by embedding vacancy-type prismatic loops in the sample. Each dislocation loop had as a Burgers vector one of the six possible \(\frac{1}{2}\langle 110\rangle\) vectors. The edges of the loops were aligned along 〈112〉 directions (i.e., perpendicular to the Burgers vectors), situating all dislocation loops on {111} glide planes. The rhombus edges measured 40 Å, resulting in an initial dislocation density of 1.15 × 1016 m−2. The dislocation loops were placed randomly in the sample while avoiding any overlaps.

Following the creation of the dislocation loops, the samples were equilibrated at room temperature (300 K) and zero pressure for 100 ps using a Nosé-Hoover thermostat (damping parameter of 2 ps and chain length of 3) and a Nosé-Hoover barostat (damping parameter of 10 ps and chain length of 3) allowing only for isotropic deformations. The sample was then mechanically deformed24,25 in tension along the [100] direction at a true strain rate of 109 s−1 for a total of 4 ns. During deformation, the sample was allowed to contract freely along the directions orthogonal to the tensile axis (i.e., [010] and [001]); this was achieved by employing a Nosé-Hoover barostat (damping parameter of 10 ps and chain length of 3) to maintain a total pressure of zero along the directions orthogonal to the tensile axis. The heat generated by dislocation motion was dissipated by employing a Nosé-Hoover thermostat (damping parameter of 2 ps and chain length of 3) to maintain the temperature at 300 K.

The dislocations densities were computed using the dislocation extraction algorithm62 (DXA). All the atomistic simulation visualizations were done using Open Visualization Tool63 (OVITO, version 3.13.0).

See Supplementary Notes 6 and 7 for additional data collected during mechanical deformation.

Molecular dynamics simulations of CrCoNi solidification were carried out at an equiatomic concentration and a total of 196,608 atoms (timestep of 2 fs). The initial configuration contained 25% of its atoms in a cubic fcc slab with orthogonal axis aligned with the \([1\bar{1}2]\), \([1\bar{1}\bar{1}]\), and [110] directions; the remaining 75% of atoms are randomly distributed (i.e., liquid phase) above and below the (100) surfaces of the fcc slab. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions. The initial dimensions were adjusted to accommodate for the lattice constant and liquid density at the corresponding simulation temperature, resulting in dimensions of approximately 71 Å  × 100 Å  × 337 Å .

This solid–liquid system is equilibrated as follows. First, the liquid atoms coordinates were relaxed for 100 steps using the conjugate gradient method while keeping the solid atoms fixed, eliminating any atomic overlaps obtained during the creation of the liquid phase. This is followed by 2 ps of equilibration of the liquid atoms with a Nosé-Hoover thermostat (damping parameter of 0.1 ps and chain length of 3) at the target temperature while keeping the solid atoms fixed. Next, the liquid atoms are kept fixed while the solid atoms are equilibrated for 2 ps at 95% of the target temperature. Finally, the liquid atoms are equilibrated (while keeping the solid atoms fixed) for 2 ps at the target temperature with a Nosé-Hoover barostat (damping parameter of 1 ps and chain length of 3) to achieve zero pressure along the directions perpendicular to the solid–liquid interface.

After equilibration, the solidification simulations were carried out with a Nosé-Hoover thermostat with a large damping parameter of 1 ps in order to not affect the kinetics of liquid diffusion (chain length of 3). Notice that the temperature was calculated after removing the center-of-mass velocity to avoid bias. A Nosé-Hoover barostat (damping parameter of 1 ps and chain length of 3) was also employed to maintain zero pressure along the direction perpendicular to the solid–liquid interface, while the directions parallel to the interface are kept constant during solidification. Solidification simulations were performed from 1660 K to 1100 K, which corresponds to undercooling temperatures ranging from ΔT = 1 K to ΔT = 561 K (the melting temperature was determined to be Tm = 1661 K in ref. 23). The solidification is carried out until the system is 80% solidified, which took from  ≈ 200 ps at the maximum undercooling to  ≈ 35 ns at ΔT = 1 K undercooling. The total linear momentum of the center-of-mass was set to zero every 2 ps to facilitate the visualization of the simulation—note that this has no physical effect on the simulation.

The growth rate is measured by estimating the rate at which liquid atoms transform into solid atoms using the polyhedral template matching algorithm63,64 with a root-mean-square deviation cutoff of 0.15. The growth rate was evaluated with data collected only after an initial equilibration period of 100 ps, and also only before the system is 75% solidified in order to avoid finite system sizes.

See Supplementary Note 10 for additional data collected during solidification.

Monte Carlo simulations were performed to thermally equilibrate the chemical configuration in equiatomic CrCoNi for temperatures ranging from 400 K to 3000 K in increments of 25 K, and from 3000 K to 7000 K in increments of 125 K. A total of 50 independent Monte Carlo simulations were performed for each temperature, where each simulation contained 4000 atoms in a cubic fcc system with dimensions 10a0 × 10a0 × 10a0 oriented along the [100], [010], and [001] crystallographic directions, where a0 is the lattice parameter at the appropriate temperature. Beyond the melting point, the lattice parameters were determined by extrapolating the linear relationship between lattice parameter and temperature. Periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions.

The simulations were initialized by randomly distributing the chemical elements in equiatomic proportions on the fcc lattice. Thermal equilibration was then achieved by performing atom-swap attempts between atoms of different chemical types, with the acceptance of swaps determined by the Metropolis criterion43,44 probability \(\exp (-\Delta E/{k}_{{{\rm{B}}}}T)\), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the system temperature, and ΔE is the change in energy caused by the swap. A total of 160,000 Monte Carlo steps (i.e., atom-swap attempts) were performed, or 40 steps per atom on average. Data for the statistical analyses were collected only after an initial equilibration time of 80,000 steps. Statistically uncorrelated configurations were collected every 13,250 steps during the remaining 80,000 steps, resulting in seven snapshots being collected per Monte Carlo simulation. See Supplementary Note 1 for a complete discussion of the convergence of the Monte Carlo simulations.

The physical model for nonequilibrium SRO introduced in Fig. 2a has only two types of dynamical events in operation: thermal and athermal. During thermal events a random pair of atoms is selected, and their positions are swapped following an acceptance probability given by the traditional Metropolis-Hastings algorithm43,44. Such thermal events are characterized by their temperature T, and guide the alloy towards the corresponding equilibrium SRO at this temperature. Athermal events are similar, but the swapping of atoms is always accepted, which drives the alloy towards random chemical mixing. Athermal events are periodically introduced in between thermal events with frequency γ, as illustrated in Fig. 2a.

In order to solve this model (i.e., obtain the results in Figs. 2, 3) we have employed the Monte Carlo method with the same machine learning potential used in the thermomechanical and solidification simulations; we refer to these simulations as nonequilibrium Monte Carlo. These simulations are nearly identical to the equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations described in the last section, with the only difference being that the atom-swap attempt of every γ−1th step is always accepted, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. This is equivalent to setting T → + ∞ K in the Metropolis criteria, which causes the probability \(\exp (-\Delta E/{k}_{{{\rm{B}}}}T)\to 1\). These T → + ∞ K swaps are athermal events that mimic the forced chemical mixing of nonequilibrium processes.

The nonequilibrium Monte Carlo simulations were carried out using the same size, number of steps, and number of independent simulations as the equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations. They were performed at temperatures ranging from 600 K to 1600 K, at 200 K intervals. A total of 17 different values were chosen for the driving force γ, varying from γ−1 = 5 to γ−1 = 350.

Chemical SRO quantification was performed using the chemical-motif approach introduced in refs. 5, 6. In this approach the chemical environment surrounding an atom is described by a chemical motif \({{{\mathcal{M}}}}_{i}\) consisting of the atom itself and its nearest neighbors (i.e., first coordination shell). In ref. 5 it was demonstrated that this approach completely quantifies SRO up to the first coordination shell of each atom, while the traditional Warren-Cowley parameters65, which focus on pairwise correlations, do not distinguish among certain local motifs. We have employed the Euclidean graph neural network66 architecture provided in ref. 6 to identify all chemical motifs \({{{\mathcal{M}}}}_{i}\) in the simulations, and evaluate their population density distributions \(P({{{\mathcal{M}}}}_{i})\). We will omit the population density distribution P dependency on \({{{\mathcal{M}}}}_{i}\) for brevity.

Chemical SRO causes certain chemical motifs \({{{\mathcal{M}}}}_{i}\) to be more common than others, thereby affecting P. This tendency was quantified in refs. 5, 6 using the Kullback-Leibler divergence67 with respect to the population density distribution of a random alloy Prss (i.e., an alloy without any SRO):

where the sum is over all possible chemical motifs of the alloy. The work performed here required us to employ a different—but similar—quantity known as the Jensen-Shannon divergence31,32, which is more appropriate for our goals. The Jensen-Shannon divergence between two probability distributions P1 and P2 is defined as

where xn = Nn/(N1 + N2) is the weight coefficient of the sample size Nn of Pn, and M = x1P1 + x2P2 is a weighted average of the two distributions. The Jensen-Shannon divergence DJS significantly reduces the bias introduced by having samples P1 and P2 of different sizes68,69 (see Supplementary Note 2), which occurs often in thermomechanical deformation or solidification simulations (see the discussion below on how the motifs are extracted during these simulations). The Jensen-Shannon divergence also has other advantages over the Kullback-Leibler divergence, such as: it is symmetric with respect to P1 and P2, it is bounded, it can be applied to distributions with zero counts, and \(\sqrt{{D}_{{{\rm{JS}}}}}\) is a rigorous mathematical metric70—which makes DJS more appropriate to quantify the amount of SRO than DKL. The amount of chemical SRO in a distribution P1 = P is quantified by setting P2 = Prss in eq. (1):

For the equilibrium and nonequilibrium Monte Carlo simulations the chemical-motif population density P is evaluated by considering the data collected from all seven snapshots of each of the 50 independent simulations (i.e., 7 × 50 × 4000 = 1, 400, 000 motifs for each case). This is done for each temperature, and for each value of driving force γ in the case of nonequilibrium simulations.

The evaluation of P resulting from solidification is more complex. First, the atoms in the initial crystalline seed of the final solidified structures are excluded from the calculation because their chemical motifs are not resulting from the solidification process. The last 25% of the atoms to solidify are also excluded to avoid the influence of finite-size effects (similar to what was done in the evaluation of the growth rate). Finally, the as-cast alloy contained vacancies, which disrupted the identification of chemical motifs. To avoid this problem, the crystal structure surrounding the remaining atoms was classified using the polyhedral template matching (PTM) algorithm64 (with a root-mean-square deviation cutoff parameter of 0.15), and only atoms classified as having an fcc structure were used in the evaluation of P.

The mechanical deformation simulations also required the use of PTM as a pre-processing step because the identification of chemical motifs near dislocation cores is ambiguous. In this case it is necessary to consider two crystal structures—namely, fcc and hexagonal close-packed (hcp)—because the decomposition of \(\frac{1}{2}\langle 110\rangle\) dislocations into Shockley partial dislocations \(\frac{1}{6}\langle 112\rangle\) leads to the formation of stacking faults in which the local crystal structure (up to the first coordination shell) is hcp, which has chemical motifs that are topologically different from the ones in the fcc structure. In order to accommodate both types of chemical motifs, the amount of SRO is quantified as

where fα is the fraction of the system in the α crystal structure (α = fcc or hcp), Pα is the chemical-motif population density of α, \({P}_{{{\rm{rss}}}}^{\alpha }\) is the population density of a random alloy in the crystal structure α, and \(\xi={\log }_{2}(36,333)/{\log }_{2}(140,022)\) is a counting parameter that ensures that the maximum possible contribution of both crystal structures are equal in magnitude (36,333 is the total number of possible motifs in a ternary fcc crystal, and 140,022 is the equivalent quantity for hcp).

Annealing the samples for the mechanical deformation simulations with direct Monte Carlo is unfeasible due to the prohibitive computational cost of this method: the annealing would cost nearly one order of magnitude more than all other simulations in this work combined. To circumvent this, a variation of the reverse Monte Carlo method was employed to produce samples with appropriate equilibrium SRO.

The reverse Monte Carlo method has two objective functions; the first one is

where the sum is over all chemical element pairs (A and B), and

is the Warren-Cowley parameter65 of the AB pair where p(A∣B) is the conditional probability of finding A at a nearest-neighbor site of B, and cA is the average concentration of A in the alloy. This objective function measures the deviation of the sample's Warren-Cowley parameters from their target values \({\alpha }_{AB}^{{{\rm{target}}}}\), which are the equilibrium Warren-Cowley parameters at the annealing temperature. The second objective function is

where \({D}_{{{\rm{sro}}}}^{{{\rm{target}}}}\) is the equilibrium Dsro (eq. (2)) at the annealing temperature.

The objective functions are minimized using a simulated annealing approach with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Each atom-swap step n of the simulation is divided into two parts, first, we evaluate whether the swap satisfies the first objective function with acceptance probability given by

where βn+1 = (1 + n)βn (with β0 = 10), and \(\Delta {\chi }_{{{\rm{WC}}}}^{2}\) is the change in the objective function caused by the swap. The atom-swap is rejected if this first part fails, but if it succeeds, then the algorithm proceeds to test whether the swap satisfies the second objective function, with acceptance probability given by

where \(\Delta {\chi }_{{{\rm{sro}}}}^{2}\) is the change in the objective function caused by the swap. If this part succeeds the atom-swap move is accepted.

This approach is much more computationally efficient as it avoids the evaluation of atomic interactions using the machine learning interatomic potential, and it minimizes the evaluation of Dsro, both of which are computationally expensive.

The effective temperature Teff of a nonequilibrium SRO state is defined as the temperature T of the equilibrium SRO state that is closest to it in terms of chemical-motif \({{{\mathcal{M}}}}_{i}\) population density. In practice this is evaluated by first computing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between the nonequilibrium SRO state P and all the possible equilibrium states Peq(T) (Supplementary Fig. 3), and then identifying the minimum of DJS(P∥Peq(T)) as a function of T. Thus, the effective temperature can be expressed as

where \({D}_{{{\rm{eff}}}}=\min \left[{D}_{{{\rm{JS}}}}(P\parallel {P}_{{{\rm{eq}}}}(T))\right]\) measures how far the nonequilibrium SRO state is from its effective equilibrium SRO counterpart (Fig. 3a). See Supplementary Note 2 for more data regarding the effective-temperature calculation.

The criterion for determining equivalency between a nonequilibrium state and its corresponding equilibrium SRO state is to establish whether or not its Deff is statistically distinguishable from its expected value in equilibrium. This is used to classify the remnant SRO states as quasi-equilibrium or far-from-equilibrium in Fig. 3b. This analysis is described in detail in Supplementary Note 3.

The Warren-Cowley parameters of the solid phase and as-cast state in Fig. 4c are evaluated using eq. (3), which is a traditional approach in the literature. This approach is not applicable to the liquid phase. Instead, the Warren-Cowley for the liquid were evaluated following the analysis from refs. 71 and 72, which defined

where zAB is the average number of atoms of type B surrounding atoms of type A in the first coordination shell, and ZA = ∑BzAB is the coordination number around atoms A. We computed zAB by integrating the partial radial distribution function gAB(r) up to the cutoff distance rcut for the first coordination shell,

where ρ is the average number density of atoms in the liquid, and rcut is determined as the first minima in the total radial distribution function g(r). Note that the liquid WC parameters are not symmetric due to the different coordination numbers of different chemical elements, i.e., in general \({\alpha }_{AB}^{{{\rm{liquid}}}}\ne {\alpha }_{BA}^{{{\rm{liquid}}}}\), as shown in Fig. 4c.

See Supplementary Note 10 for more details on the results of Fig. 4c, including different undercoolings.

Enzymes are the molecular machines of life, and a key property that governs their function is substrate specificity—the ability of an enzyme to recognize and selectively act on particular substrates. This specificity originates from the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the enzyme active site and complicated transition state of the reaction1,2. Many enzymes can promiscuously catalyze reactions or act on substrates beyond those for which they were originally evolved1,3-5. However, millions of known enzymes still lack reliable substrate specificity information, impeding their practical applications and comprehensive understanding of the biocatalytic diversity in nature. Herein, we developed a cross-attention-empowered SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network architecture named EZSpecificity for predicting enzyme substrate specificity, which was trained on a comprehensive tailor-made database of enzyme-substrate interactions at sequence and structural levels. EZSpecificity outperformed the existing machine learning models for enzyme substrate specificity prediction, as demonstrated by both an unknown substrate and enzyme database and seven proof-of-concept protein families. Experimental validation with eight halogenases and 78 substrates revealed that EZSpecificity achieved a 91.7% accuracy in identifying the single potential reactive substrate, significantly higher than that of the state-of-the-art model ESP (58.3%). EZSpecificity represents a general machine learning model for accurate prediction of substrate specificity for enzymes related to fundamental and applied research in biology and medicine.

Mutations that occur in the cell lineages of sperm or eggs can be transmitted to offspring. In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis can increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders1,2,3. Until recently, characterizing the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Here we used the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq4 to sequence 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24–75 years. Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% confidence interval of 1.41–1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq5 of sperm samples identified more than 35,000 germline coding mutations. We detected 40 genes (31 newly identified) under significant positive selection in the male germline that have activating or loss-of-function mechanisms and are involved in diverse cellular pathways. Most of the positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, whereas four of the genes exhibited increased frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations. We show that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2–3-fold increased risk of known disease-causing mutations, which results in 3–5% of sperm from middle-aged to older individuals with a pathogenic mutation across the exome. These findings shed light on germline selection dynamics and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.

All human cells accumulate mutations throughout life. In proliferating tissues, acquired driver mutations that confer a selective advantage can promote the expansion of individual clones in competing stem and progenitor cell populations. Although patterns of selection and clonal expansion have been extensively studied in cancers, recent research has also highlighted their occurrence in normal tissues during ageing6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.

Spermatogonial stem cells of the testis occupy a distinct niche relative to other studied normal tissues. Among replicating cells, these stem cells have the lowest mutation rate, which is around 5–20-fold lower than other studied somatic cell types12. They are also the only adult proliferating cells with the potential to transmit mutations to offspring, balancing self-renewal and spermatogenesis to produce 150–275 million sperm per day15,16. Targeted sequencing studies have revealed that driver mutations are acquired in spermatogonial stem cells and that these cell populations expand along seminiferous tubules, which results in increased fractions of mutant clones that are detectable in sperm1,17,18,19,20. Notably, all the male germline drivers identified so far are activating missense hotspot mutations, which contrasts with the broader range of activating and inactivating drivers observed in cancers and somatic tissues. These germline driver mutations can have substantial implications for offspring, as such mutations are found in a set of 13 genes all known to cause severe developmental disorders3. This effect leads to a significant increase, up to 1,000-fold, in the sporadic birth prevalence of these disorders, with a strong correlation between the age of the father and prevalence2.

Technical limitations, related to the polyclonality and low mutation rate of testis and sperm, have prevented extensive characterization of this selection beyond a limited set of genes. Recent advances in error-corrected duplex DNA sequencing approaches use information from both DNA strands to detect mutations at single-molecule resolution21,22,23,24. These new methods have proven successful for the accurate estimation of mutation burden in sperm, with an error rate of <5 × 10−9 per base pair4. Here we combine the duplex approaches of whole-genome NanoSeq4 with deep whole-exome and targeted NanoSeq5 to characterize positive selection in the male germline and to quantify its consequences for the accumulation of disease mutations in sperm.

We performed whole-genome NanoSeq4 of bulk semen samples (n = 81, 1–2 time points per donor, 57 donors with an age range of 24–75 years) and matched blood (n = 119, 1–3 time points, 63 donors with an age range of 22–83 years) from men in the TwinsUK cohort25 (including 8 monozygotic and 3 dizygotic twin pairs; Methods and Supplementary Table 1). The analysed semen samples had sperm counts >1 million per ml, as samples below this threshold showed evidence of somatic cell contamination (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 1). The mean number of unique DNA molecules per site where a mutation was callable (duplex coverage (dx)) was 3.7 dx in sperm and 4.3 dx in blood (Extended Data Fig. 2a). For sperm (a haploid cell), 1 dx is equivalent to one cell, whereas for blood (a diploid cell), 2 dx is equivalent to one cell.

We identified single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion–deletion mutations (indels) in whole-genome NanoSeq data from sperm and blood. Inherited germline variants were excluded using matched blood (Methods). From the 6,653 SNVs detected in sperm (Supplementary Table 2), we estimated an accumulation of 1.67 substitutions per year per haploid genome (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.41–1.92, linear mixed-effect regression). This result is comparable with estimates from paternal de novo mutations (DNMs) in family pedigrees26 of 1.44 substitutions per year (95% CI = 1.00–1.87) and seminiferous tubules of the testes12 of 1.40 substitutions per year (95% CI = 1.02–1.76; Fig. 1a). Indels accumulated in sperm at a rate of 0.10 per year per haploid genome (95% CI = 0.06–0.15), again similar to the rate observed in DNMs26 of 0.08 haploid indels per year (95% CI = −0.02 to 0.17) and testes12 of 0.08 haploid indels per year (95% CI = 0.02–0.13; Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 3a).

For a–d, models are linear mixed regressions, with the central line showing the model fit and the shaded bands indicating 95% CIs calculated using parametric bootstrapping.

From 92,035 SNVs and 4,641 indels detected in whole blood (Supplementary Table 3), we estimated an accumulation of 19.9 substitutions per year per diploid genome (95% CI = 17.3–22.5; Fig. 1c) and 0.9 indels per year (95% CI = 0.7–1.1; Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 3b). Both estimates are within the range of mutation rates observed for specific cell types in blood13 and are consistent with measuring a weighted average of these cell types in whole blood (Extended Data Fig. 4a,b). Individuals had a mean of 7.6-fold more substitutions per base pair per year (range of 4.2–11.5; Fig. 1e) and 6.3-fold more indels per base pair per year (range of 2.2–18.7; Fig. 1e) in blood than in sperm. Accounting for twin status or multiple time points from the same individuals had a significant predictive effect for mutation burden in blood but not in sperm (Supplementary Note 2).

The SNV mutational signatures in sperm were inferred to be SBS1 (mean 16%) and SBS5 (mean 84%), which were the expected clock-like ageing signatures27 (Fig. 1f,g). In blood, SBS1 (mean 15%) and SBS5 (mean 75%) were also the main mutational signatures, with an additional contribution of SBS19 (mean 10%), which has been linked to persistent DNA lesions in haematopoietic stem cells27 (Fig. 1f,g). We observed that all signatures were correlated with age (Extended Data Fig. 4c,d). SBS1 and SBS5 accumulated in individuals at a mean of 8.9-fold (range of 2.3–39.1) and 6.8-fold (range of 3.7–10.9) higher rate in blood than in sperm, respectively (Extended Data Fig. 4e). This finding indicates that SBS19 does not explain a substantial fraction of the mutation burden gap between the two tissues.

We next investigated positive selection in protein-coding regions in sperm. We used a capture-based modification to NanoSeq5 to deeply sequence coding regions from the same set of semen samples. Specifically, we sequenced 38 samples using whole-exome NanoSeq to a mean depth of 551 dx per sample (20,923 cumulative dx). We also sequenced 81 samples using targeted NanoSeq to a mean depth of 985 dx per sample (79,811 cumulative dx) with a target panel that consisted of 263 canonical cancer driver genes, 107 of which are also associated with developmental disorders (Methods, Extended Data Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 4). We detected 56,503 (58% in coding regions) SNV and indel mutations from the exome panel and 5,059 (58% in coding regions) from the targeted cancer panel (Methods and Supplementary Table 5). The mutation burdens for exome and targeted samples were consistent with whole-genome NanoSeq after correcting for the relative trinucleotide composition of sequencing coverage (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

The majority of variants (99.5%) were detected only in a single duplex molecule of a sample. Similarly, in the 23 samples with 2 time points (mean of a 12.1-year gap), 99.3% of the 5,143 variant calls from the first time point were not called in the second time point. These results are consistent with sperm being a highly polyclonal collection of cells derived from a large population of spermatogonial stem cell progenitors in the testis.

The exome-wide strength of positive selection in sperm was quantified by estimating the rate of nonsynonymous (N) relative to neutral synonymous (S) mutations (dN/dS ratio, where dN/dS = 1.0 indicates neutrality). We used the dNdScv algorithm28 with modifications to account for duplex sequencing coverage per base, CpG methylation levels in testis samples and pentanucleotide context. These modifications refined exome-wide dN/dS ratios by resolving specific mutation rate biases but had minor effects on gene-level dN/dS ratios (Extended Data Fig. 5 and Supplementary Note 3).

Using this model, the dN/dS ratio in the exome-sequenced samples were estimated to be 1.07 (95% CI = 1.04–1.10). This ratio implies that 6.5% (95% CI = 3.8%–9.1%) of the observed nonsynonymous substitutions in sperm conferred a clonal advantage during spermatogenesis in this cohort. Splitting the cohort into thirds by age, the exome-wide dN/dS ratio was 1.01 (95% CI = 0.93–1.09) in 26–42 year olds, 1.03 (95% CI = 0.97–1.10) in 43–58 year olds and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.06–1.13) in 59–74 year olds (Fig. 2f). A linear regression of dN/dS ratio against age group showed a positive trend, although significance was not reached (P = 0.18). This result suggests that the dN/dS ratio may increase over the male lifespan. If so, then the cohort-wide dN/dS ratios presented here partially reflect the age distribution of samples (age range of 26–74 years, mean of 53 years).

Data in f–h show ratio point estimates, error bars indicate 95% CIs.

We next compared the dN/dS ratios across gene sets related to spermatogenesis expression29 (Fig. 2g). Genes with the highest dN/dS ratios were those that were highly expressed during spermatogenesis (1.25, 95% CI = 1.13–1.38) and most specific to differentiated spermatogonial stem cells (1.11, 95% CI = 1.05–1.17). By contrast, the genes that were not expressed in spermatogenesis (0.98, 95% CI = 0.88–1.11) and the genes most specific to elongating spermatids (1.01, 95% CI = 0.94–1.08) showed dN/dS ratios close to neutrality. These results are consistent with the understanding that excess nonsynonymous mutations observed in sperm confer a competitive advantage earlier in their cell lineage, specifically in the spermatogonial stem cells of the testis18.

We then combined exome and targeted panel datasets to investigate which genes were driving the signal of positive selection (Methods). We applied dN/dS tests for excess nonsynonymous mutations at gene-wide and SNV hotspot levels, which together identified 40 genes under significant positive selection. Of these, 35 genes reached exome-wide significance at the gene level (false discovery rate q < 0.1; Supplementary Table 6) and/or contained 1 of 17 exome-wide significant hotspots (q < 0.1; Extended Data Table 1). The genes PTPN11, MIB1, RIT1, FGFR3, EP300 and FGFR2 were significant in both the gene and hotspot tests. The genes KDM5B, NF1, SMAD6, CUL3, RASA2, PRRC2A, PTEN, ROBO1, DDX3X, CSNK2B, KRAS, PPM1D, ARID1A, BRAF, HRAS, KMT2E, SCAF4, BMPR2, TCF12, CCAR2, DHX9, NSD1, LZTR1, ARHGAP35, CBL, SSX1 and RBM12 were significant in only the gene test. The genes SMAD4 and FAM222B were significant in only the hotspot test (Fig. 2a,b). We excluded SEMG1 despite it reaching gene-level significance, as its extreme expression in seminal vesicles30, lack of expression in spermatogenesis and indel-specific enrichment indicate indel hypermutation31,32 from minor seminal vesicle DNA contamination rather than germline selection.

Subsequently, we carried out restricted hypothesis dN/dS tests at the per-gene and per-site level. The gene-level test examined only the set of 263 canonical cancer driver genes on our target panel. The site-level test used a set of 1,963 sites consisting of known cancer hotspots and recurrent DNM sites from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) cohort33. This analysis identified five additional genes—KDM5C, KMT2D, AR, CTNNB1 and RAF1—and seven hotspots not already significant at the exome-wide level (q < 0.1; Fig. 2a,b, Extended Data Table 1 and Supplementary Table 7).

The genes previously implicated in germline positive selection all operate through activating missense mutations, with 12 linked to the RAS–MAPK signalling pathway3 and one (SMAD4) linked to TGFβ–BMP signalling34. Our findings replicated SMAD4 and 8 out of the 12 RAS–MAPK pathway genes as under significant positive selection in this dataset. The four genes that did not reach significance (MAP2K1, MAP2K2, SOS1 and RET) each had between twofold and fourfold enrichment of missense mutations, which corresponded to nominally significant missense enrichment in all four genes (P < 0.1). Given the direct evidence for these genes driving clonal selection in testis and nominal enrichment from sperm sequencing, we anticipate that each will reach exome-wide significance with deeper sequencing.

We estimate that together, the 44 genes linked to germline selection here or in previous studies contain 357 (95% CI = 319–387) excess nonsynonymous variants in exome sequenced sperm samples. This result would account for 23% (95% CI = 14%–43%) of the total estimated driver variants across the exome. The wide CIs and the sensitivity of this estimate to the mutation model used (Supplementary Note 3) suggest that small uncertainties in mutation rates, when propagated across the exome, make it difficult to precisely estimate the fraction of drivers explained. Nevertheless, the findings indicate that additional driver genes remain to be discovered.

The 31 newly identified genes demonstrate that germline positive selection is not restricted to activating mutations or to the RAS–MAPK pathway. For instance, 30 out of the 31 genes are enriched for loss-of-function (LOF) mutations such as nonsense, splice and indel variants, which are indicative of protein-inactivating mechanisms of selection (Fig. 2c,d). Splitting the germline-selection genes and known cancer genes on the basis of ten canonical cancer pathways35, we found that the top gene groups enriched in dN/dS are RAS–MAPK, WNT and TGFβ–BMP signalling (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Indeed, many of these selection genes are linked to the RAS–MAPK pathway (such as NF1, CUL3 and LZTR1), WNT signalling (CSNK2B, MIB1 and CCAR2) and TGFβ–BMP signalling (SMAD6, TCF12 and BMPR2) (Fig. 2c). We also identified several genes that encode epigenetic modifiers (KDM5B, KDM5C, ARID1A, KMT2D, KMT2E, EP300 and NSD1) and genes encoding RNA metabolism proteins (DHX9, DDX3X and SCAF4). These findings highlight a new diversity of genes, mutational mechanisms and pathways that drive germline selection.

It has been observed that cancers and germline developmental disorders share causal pathways and genes36,37. Notably, the 13 genes previously linked to germline positive selection are all known cancer and known developmental disorders genes3,34. This pattern holds, but to a lesser extent, in the new germline selection genes identified here: 16 out of 31 genes are tier 1 or 2 cancer census genes38 and 27 out of 31 are linked to monogenic disorders in the Development Disorder Genotype–Phenotype (DDG2P) or Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) databases39 (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 8).

The overlap between germline positive selection and cancer or developmental disorders is also apparent at the variant level. Somatic mutations that are most frequently observed (>50 times) in the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database are enriched 11-fold (95% CI = 6–20) among our sperm mutation dataset after adjusting for the expected mutation rate (Methods). Similarly, germline mutations that are most frequently observed (>5 times) in a large cohort of children with developmental disorders are enriched 66-fold (95% CI = 41–100) in our sperm mutation dataset (Fig. 2h). Moreover, the mutation types enriched in sperm for a given gene largely matched those enriched in cancer and linked to developmental disorders (Extended Data Figs. 6a and 7). These results show a clear overlap between genes, hotspots and mutation mechanisms that drive germline positive selection, cancer and developmental disorders. A notable exception to this pattern is SMAD4, which has two distinct missense hotspots in sperm that are developmental disorder hotspots causal for Myhre syndrome40 but are not often seen in cancers, a result that replicates recent findings34 (Fig. 2e).

Given the association of many positively selected genes to disease, it is of interest to assess to what degree positive selection may increase the fraction of sperm with potential disease-causing mutations, and thus the birth prevalence of the associated disease. To estimate the fraction of sperm with specific classes of variants, we aggregated the variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of different mutation types and compared this to expected values from our dNdScv mutation model (Methods).

The fraction of sperm carrying noncoding or synonymous mutations increased linearly with age, as predicted by the neutral model (Extended Data Fig. 8). By contrast, missense, truncating and coding indel variants deviated above expected in older individuals, an observation consistent with the dN/dS results and indicative of age-related positive selection.

To assess potential disease burden, we compiled a conservative list of probable monoallelic disease-causing mutations, including pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants from ClinVar41 and highly damaging variants (combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD)42 value of >30) in high-confidence monoallelic developmental disorder genes from the DDG2P cohort39. Across all ages, the observed frequency of disease mutations exceeded expectation from the germline mutation model. The expected fraction ranged from 0.73% in 30 year olds to 1.6% in 70 year olds. When fitting a quasibinomial regression, the observed values ranged from 2% (95% CI = 1.6%–2.5%) in 30 year olds to 4.5% (95% CI = 3.9%–5.2%) in 70 year olds, with a significant relationship between the observed fraction and age (P = 1.75 × 10–5; Fig. 3c). These differences represent similar enrichments of 2.8-fold (95% CI = 2.2 to 3.5) and 2.9-fold (95% CI = 2.5 to 3.3) in 30 year olds and 70 year olds, respectively.

a, Estimated mean percentage of sperm in the cohort with a likely monoallelic disease mutation (left) or a driver mutation in a germline-selection gene (right). Disease mutations are divided into the fraction that was expected from the mutation model, the portion explained by driver variants and the portion unexplained. Driver mutations are split by those contributing to the disease mutations and the remainder, ‘ageing drivers'. b, Estimated percentage of sperm per individual with a driver mutation by age. c, Observed and expected percentages of sperm with a likely disease mutation by age. For b and c, the central line represents the model-predicted mean from quasibinomial regression, and shaded bands indicate 95% CIs. d, Cohort means from a split by gene and ordered by estimated mutation percentage. Per-gene contributions are shown above each gene; the summed contributions of all genes are shown below. Genes with four or fewer variants are grouped on the left with a condensed x axis for clarity.

Notably, the disease cell-fraction estimates were made up of many low-frequency variants rather than being driven by individual high VAF mutations. The estimates in exome samples are made up of a mean of 18.3 distinct variants (range of 4–62) per individual. Furthermore, 692 out of 696 (99.4%) of all those variants were only observed in a single sperm, similar to the average of all variants (99.5%).

We next investigated to what degree the observed enrichment of disease mutations can be attributed to driver mutations in positively selected genes. Fitting a quasibinomial regression, we observed a strong positive correlation between age and driver rate (P = 7.95 × 10–6) with an estimated 0.5% (95% CI = 0.3%–0.8%) of sperm from individuals at age 30 years and 2.6% (95% CI = 2.0%–3.3%) of sperm from individuals aged 70 years with a known driver mutation (Fig. 3b). However, only about two-thirds (65.6%) of those driver mutations met our criteria of likely disease-causing.

Mutations in sperm that are likely disease-causing and those classified as known driver mutations represented overlapping, yet distinct, annotations (Fig. 3a). Across the cohort, an estimated 3.3% of sperm carried a likely disease-causing mutation. Of this, approximately one-third (1.2%) was expected by the neutral mutation model, another third (1.1%) was explained by known driver mutations and the remaining third (1.0%) was unexplained by either source. These findings indicate that the increase in likely disease-causing mutations is largely driven by germline positive selection on known genes, but also indicate that additional driver genes with disease associations remain to be identified.

After examination of the driver mutations that did not meet our criteria for likely disease-causing, we estimated that they affected 0.6% of sperm across the cohort. The inheritance consequences of these mutations are unclear. For instance, SMAD6 variants, which are linked to variably penetrant congenital phenotypes43, may be disease-causing in some cases but not others. Other possibilities include mutations that are unannotated disease-causing, impair fertilization, are embryonic lethal or act through biallelic disruption.

A large fraction of sperm with disease and/or driver mutations could be attributed to a small number of genes. Of the 374 genes with at least one such variant, 33 with ≥5 independent mutations, most under significant positive selection (26 out of 33), accounted for 42.8% of the disease or selection burden (Fig. 3d). Notably, six of those genes, all under significant positive selection (KDM5B, MIB1, SMAD6, PRRC2A, NF1 and PTPN11) alone explained over 20% of the disease or selection fraction. This result suggests that although all individual driver mutations were observed at low allele frequencies, they were disproportionately concentrated in specific driver genes.

We next examined whether risk factors beyond age contribute to the accumulation of disease or driver mutations in sperm. Known germline mutagens include chemotherapy, inherited DNA repair defects33,44 and weaker influences from genetic ancestry and smoking45. Although our cohort did not include individuals with chemotherapy exposure or DNA repair defects, phenotype data on body mass index (BMI), smoking and alcohol consumption, all known to affect mutation burden in some somatic tissues46, were available. Using multivariate generalized linear models (Methods and Extended Data Fig. 9), we tested associations between these factors and measures of mutation burden, signatures and driver cell fractions, correcting for multiple testing. Across sperm datasets (targeted, exome and whole genome) no significant effects were found for BMI, smoking pack-years or alcohol drink-years. Notably, in blood samples, smoking and alcohol consumption showed significant effects on SNV and SBS5 mutational signature burdens. These findings indicate that the male germline may be largely protected from these exposures, although further investigation in larger and more diverse cohorts is needed.

Mutations in sperm account for about 80% of DNMs and are therefore also the primary origin of population-level variants. Comparisons of these germline mutation sources offer insight into how positive selection in spermatogonia manifests over time.

Control DNMs from unaffected offspring47 showed a dN/dS ratio near neutrality (0.98, 95% CI = 0.90–1.08; Fig. 4a), whereas DNMs from children with developmental disorders showed a marked nonsynonymous enrichment (1.36, 95% CI = 1.33–1.39; Fig. 4a), a result consistent with previous reports33. However, ascertainment biases in these cohorts probably distort the observed ratios, and larger, unbiased birth cohorts will be required to resolve the baseline of DNMs entering the population.

a, Exome-wide dN/dS ratio point estimates across different variant sets, including n = 38 biologically independent sperm samples, DNMs from n = 1,886 healthy trios47 and n = 22,742 trios from the DDD cohort33, and population variants from n = 125,748 individuals in gnomAD48, split by allele frequency (AF). Error bars indicate 95% CIs. b, Observed/expected enrichment of missense and LOF (essential splice, nonsense or indel) variants in positively selected genes in sperm (x axis) from dN/dS models versus gnomAD (v.2) LOF z scores. Positive z scores indicate LOF depletion, whereas negative scores indicate excess over expected.

To assess how selection shapes germline variants in the population, we analysed dN/dS ratios across allele frequencies in gnomAD48 (Fig. 4a). This analysis revealed a decay in dN/dS ratios at higher allele frequencies, a result consistent with purifying selection across generations. Together, these results suggest that positive selection is the greater force that acts on germline mutations during spermatogenesis, whereas negative selection predominates over generations. This finding mirrors the well-established contrast between selection on cancer and population-level mutations28.

Most genes in gnomAD have positive z scores, which indicates LOF depletion due to negative selection. Of the 31 selection genes with LOF enrichment in sperm (range of 3-fold to 50-fold), 27 showed LOF depletion in gnomAD, a result consistent with positive selection during spermatogenesis but purging in the population by negative selection. Notably, four genes, SMAD6, MIB1, LZTR1 and SSX1, had more LOFs than expected in gnomAD (Fig. 4b). The latter three are among the strongest LOF-enriched outliers in gnomAD (v.2) and are flagged by gnomAD for unexplained LOF enrichment. Our results suggest that their increased LOF frequency in gnomAD reflects increased input from germline positive selection, with insufficient negative selection to remove them from the population.

We sequenced sperm and blood from healthy men spanning a wide age range to quantify mutation rates and positive selection in the male germline. Mutation rates and signatures in sperm matched those from family trio and testis studies12,26,49,50,51,52. Despite sharing SBS1 and SBS5 signatures, mutations accumulated around eightfold more slowly in sperm than blood, a result that supports our previous observations of the protected nature of the germline relative to the soma12.

By analysing more than 35,000 coding mutations from sperm exome-wide, we corroborated key findings from previous studies of spermatogonial selection1,17,18,19,20 and significantly advanced our understanding of its scope and impact. Our results replicated 9 out of 13 known germline-selection genes and confirmed that the impact of selection increases with age, leading to an increased fraction of sperm with pathogenic variants. We also identified 31 new positively selected genes, thereby broadening the range of pathways and mechanisms implicated in this process. The discovery of diverse genes and the identification of LOF as a common selection mechanism highlight the power of NanoSeq to enable exome-wide searches and to detect mutations in single cells, overcoming the limitations of previous methods reliant on high-frequency gain-of-function missense mutations. These findings reveal that germline selection operates in the broader framework of cellular selection, driven by many of the same genes and mechanisms that shape clonal dynamics in somatic tissues. However, unlike somatic selection, germline selection affects offspring phenotypes and influences evolutionary trajectories.

Perhaps unsurprisingly then, driver mutation burden in sperm is low compared with many somatic proliferative tissues. In middle-aged to older men, we showed that only 1–3% of sperm carry a known driver mutation. Low levels have also been reported in colon (about 1%) and liver (1–5%)8,9. In blood, many individuals fell within this range, although some showed large expansions of single clones14. Much higher burdens are seen in epithelial tissues such as endometrium, oesophagus and skin, where 30–50% of cells often have driver mutations6,7,10. These differences are probably shaped in part by both tissue architecture and mutation rate. In the testis, the low mutation rate combined with the tubular structure may together be crucial to constrain the generation and spread of driver clones. This low driver rate also aligns with the rarity and biology of tumours that originate from spermatogonia, which are typically driven by aneuploidy rather than sequential driver mutations53.

Our findings have significant implications for disease and evolutionary studies that rely on germline mutation models, as they do not currently account for positive selection. We showed that this selection can distort estimates of selective constraint based on population-level data. Germline selection will also affect the discovery of disease-causing genes from DNM enrichment tests. For example, excess LOF mutations in MIB1 found in developmental disorder trios33 probably reflects germline selection rather than disease association, as they are more common in population cohorts than expected and do not show phenotype correlation54. In principle, case–control tests for DNM enrichment would avoid this bias, but require large cohorts of age-matched controls for sufficient statistical power. Until such resources become available, DNM enrichment studies should consider evidence for germline selection influencing individual genes presented here (Supplementary Table 5).

Unlike MIB1, most genes under positive selection during spermatogenesis are linked to severe monogenic disorders. We demonstrated that positive selection in spermatogenesis led to a substantial twofold to threefold enrichment in sperm with likely disease-causing mutations across the age range studied. As a result, we estimate that 3–5% of sperm from men aged over 50 years carry a likely disease-causing mutation, a value that exceeds previous estimates based on germline mutation models55.

Although these risks are substantial, typical paternal age at conception is lower than in our cohort, which suggests that the impact on birth outcomes may be more modest. Moreover, the relationship between sperm mutations and birth prevalence remains uncertain. Many pathogenic variants in sperm may not result in live births owing to impaired fertilization, embryonic lethality or pregnancy loss (Supplementary Note 4). Nevertheless, growing awareness of these risks may prompt interest in reproductive planning, genetic counselling or clinical interventions. Translating these findings into specific clinical recommendations, however, presents challenges. Unlike inherited variants, which are present in every cell, or aneuploidies, for which clinical focus is limited to a few recurrent events, pathogenic mutations in sperm are both highly diverse and individually rare, which makes them difficult to target with standard screening approaches. Nonetheless, targeted risk assessment may be valuable in specific contexts, such as individuals with an increased risk of sperm hypermutation due to impaired DNA repair or chemotherapy exposure52,56.

Our results focused on SNVs and indels, without capturing other variant classes. Although long-read sequencing studies have begun to explore these in sperm57 and trios58, further work is needed to capture the full range of human germline variation and its impact on offspring.

This study provides important insights into the historically underexplored reproductive risks of ageing in men. Unlike the well-established effects of maternal ageing on oocyte quality and aneuploidy59, we are only beginning to understand the full scope of male-specific risk, including the clonal expansion of driver mutations. As trends towards delayed reproduction continue60, it is essential to recognize that the age of both parents contributes to risk of disorders in offspring. Future research will refine our understanding of selective pressures and disease risk associated with germline mutation, clarifying their implications for human reproduction and health.

This study was carried out under TwinsUK BioBank ethics, approved by the North West–Liverpool Central Research Ethics Committee (REC reference 19/NW/0187), IRAS ID 258513 and earlier approvals granted to TwinsUK by the St Thomas' Hospital Research Ethics Committee, later the London–Westminster Research Ethics Committee (REC reference EC04/015).

Semen samples were collected or obtained from archival samples with informed consent from 75 research participants in the TwinsUK cohort25. Archival whole-blood samples were also obtained from 67 of those men from the TwinsUK BioBank. A total of 104 semen samples spanned an age range of 24–75 years and included 29 men with 2 time points separated by a mean of 12.1 years (range of 12–13 years) and the remaining 46 men with a single time point. A total of 133 blood samples were collected at an age range of 22–83 years from men with 1–4 time points. The mean interval between blood time points was 8.1 years (range of 1–13 years). In the cohort, there were a total of nine monozygotic twins and three dizygotic twin pairs. Counts of samples, time points and twin pairs that were successfully sequenced and passed analysis quality control thresholds are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

Self-reported age, height, weight, ethnicity, twin zygosity, smoking and alcohol consumption were obtained from questionnaires provided by TwinsUK and periodically taken. All individuals who provided ethnicity information indicated white. BMI was calculated as weight/height2. A smoking pack-years was defined as 365 packs of cigarettes and a total pack-year was calculated using the highest estimate across all questionnaires from cigarettes per day or week and total years smoked. Alcohol drink-years was calculated using average weekly alcohol consumption extrapolated to the duration of adult life before sampling (age – 18).

DNA was extracted from sperm samples using a Qiagen QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit. Isolation of genomic DNA from sperm protocol 1 (QA03 Jul-10) was followed, but with the exceptions of substituting DTT in place of β-mercaptoethanol for buffer 2 and substituting buffer EB in place of buffer AE for the elution of DNA.

DNA was extracted from whole blood using a Gentra Puregene Blood kit using the protocol for 10 ml of compromised whole blood from the Gentra Puregene Handbook (v.06/2011).

Three separate Twist Bioscience gene panels were used for targeted NanoSeq sequencing in this study: (1) a custom pilot panel of 210 genes; (2) a similar but extended custom panel of 263 genes (Supplementary Table 4); (3) and a default exome-wide panel of 18,800 genes. The two custom gene panels were highly similar, with the extended panel being almost exclusively regions added to the pilot panel. From the 84 samples that underwent targeted sequencing, 13 were sequenced using a pilot panel of 210 canonical cancer or somatic driver genes, and all 84 were sequenced using the extended panel of 263 genes. Sequencing coverage and mutations were merged from samples sequenced on both targeted panels and they were treated as ‘targeted' samples in the Article. The custom panels were designed by gathering sets of published lists of genes implicated as drivers in cancers61,62,63,64 and somatic tissues6,65 as previously described5.

Restriction-enzyme whole-genome NanoSeq libraries were prepared as previously described4 and subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) at target 20–30× coverage on NovaSeq (Illumina) platforms to generate 150-bp paired-end reads with 9–10 samples per lane. Standard WGS of blood (31.7× median coverage) was used to generate matched-normal libraries for both restriction-enzyme NanoSeq blood and sperm samples.

Targeted and exome NanoSeq libraries were prepared by sonication and one to two rounds of pull down of target sequences. They were then PCR amplified and sequenced with NovaSeq (Illumina) platforms to generate 150-bp paired-end reads with 7–8 samples per lane for the targeted panel and 2 lanes per sample for the exome panel. These steps are described in detail in ‘Sonication NanoSeq, Library amplification and sequencing, and Hybridization Capture' of supplementary note 1 of ref. 5.

All samples were processed using a Nextflow implementation of the NanoSeq calling pipeline (https://github.com/cancerit/NanoSeq). BWA-MEM66 was used to align all sequences to the human reference genome (NCBI build37). Whole-genome NanoSeq samples were called with their matched WGS normal and default parameters except for var_b (minimum matched normal reads per strand) of 5 as needed for WGS normals, cov_Q (minimum mapQ to include a duplex read) of 15 and var_n (maximum number of mismatches) of 2.

For targeted and exome samples, we leveraged the high sequencing depth and high polyclonality to exclude variants with VAF > 10% instead of using a matched normal. Default parameters of the calling pipeline except for cov_Q of 30, var_n of 2, var_z (minimum normal coverage) of 25, var_a (minimum AS-XS) of 10, var_v (maximum normal VAF of 0.1) and indel_v (maximum normal VAF) of 0.1. After variant calling, we further filtered variants to those below 1% VAF. The few variants observed between 1% and 10% duplex VAF as variants were highly enriched for mapping artefacts, particularly for indels. No excluded variant from the additional 1% VAF threshold was found to be either a likely driver or a ClinVar pathogenic variant.

A set of common germline variants from dbsnp67 and a custom set of known artefactual call sites in NanoSeq datasets were masked for coverage and variant calls as previously described4.

The single-molecule accuracy of the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq allows sequencing of polyclonal cell types such as sperm, but also renders mutation calls sensitive to nontarget cell-type contamination and to contamination of foreign DNA. Nontarget cell-type contamination was evaluated using manual cell counting of semen samples, which resulted in the exclusion of six samples with a sperm count of <1 million sperm per ml. Sperm counting methods and analysis are detailed in Supplementary Note 1.

Foreign DNA contamination in whole-genome NanoSeq samples was assessed using verifyBamID68, which checks whether reads in a BAM file match previous genotypes for a specific sample, with higher values indicating more contamination. Three blood whole-genome NanoSeq samples were excluded on the basis of a verifyBamID alpha value above the suggested4 cut-off value of 0.005. In sperm, we found that several samples had outlier mutation burdens with verifyBamID values just below the 0.005 cut-off. This result is logical, as sperm has a much lower mutation rate compared with somatic tissues, for which the recommended cut-off was designed. Consequently, sperm samples are more sensitive to low levels of contamination. To account for this, we adjusted the verifyBamID alpha threshold for sperm to a more stringent level of 0.002, which resulted in the exclusion of three samples on the basis of this criterion.

When assessing foreign DNA contamination in targeted and exome samples, we found that 9 targeted and 3 exome samples had verifyBamID values above >0.002, slight outlier mutation burdens and a high ratio of SNP masked variants to passed variants (4-fold to 16-fold more masked variants). After further investigation, we found that all samples that exceeded verifyBamID thresholds were processed in the same sequencing batch and that this contamination could be explained by inherited germline variants of other samples in that same batch. This result suggested that a small amount of cross-contamination may have occurred during sample preparation or sequencing steps. To remove contaminant germline mutations, we performed an in silico decontamination step as previously described4. This step involved calling germline variants from all targeted and exome samples using bcftools mpileup69 at sites where there were >10 reads and a mutation call with VAF > 0.3. All such sites were subsequently masked across all samples for both mutation calls and coverage, which essentially extended the default common SNP mask to also include rare inherited variants across the cohort. This approach resulted in all samples previously identified as contaminated with mutation burdens consistent with their age and all with a ratio of masked to passed variants of <0.1, and were therefore retained for analysis.

Given that mutation rates are strongly influenced by trinucleotide composition, it is important to consider differences in sequence composition when comparing mutation rates in datasets that target different regions of the genome70. The coding region target panels and the restriction enzyme used in whole-genome NanoSeq for instance, each will systematically bias sequencing coverage to specific genomic regions that may not reflect the full genome. To correct for these effects, in each sperm NanoSeq dataset, we generated a corrected mutation burden relative to the full genome trinucleotide frequencies as previously described4.

To compare whole-genome NanoSeq mutation burdens to mutation burdens from standard WGS, we multiplied the corrected mutation burden estimates described in the previous section by the genome size per cell type. We assumed 2,861,326,455 mappable base pairs in a haploid cell for germline datasets and the diploid equivalent for blood.

External datasets for comparison to NanoSeq results were processed to achieve comparable burden estimates. For testis WGS samples71, we implemented a previously described method4 that restricts analysis to regions with high coverage (20+ reads) that overlap with NanoSeq covered regions and corrected for differences in trinucleotide background frequencies relative to the full genome. For trio paternally phased DNMs from standard sequencing, as a callable genome size per sample following thorough filtering was available, we generated the mutation per cell estimate by multiplying the paternally phased DNM count by the ratio of the total genome size to the callable genome size of the sample as follows: DNMs paternal × (total genome/callable genome). For comparison with cell types in blood, we directly compared results to published mutation burden regressions13.

To investigate the relationship between age and mutation burdens, we performed linear mixed-effects regression analyses. For each tissue and mutation type for which a regression was performed, the model was constructed using the lmer function from the lme4 package72 in R. Each model included age at sampling as a fixed effect and a random slope for each individual to account for multiple time point samples, with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) set to false, specified as follows:

The 95% CIs for regression lines were calculated through bootstrapping by simulating prediction intervals. For each model, we generated 1,000 bootstrap samples. Predictions and their associated standard errors were calculated for a sequence of ages from 14 to 84 years. The 95% CIs were then derived by determining the range within which 95% of the bootstrap sample predictions fell.

We extracted DNM signatures using hierarchical dirichlet process (HDP; https://github.com/nicolaroberts/hdp), which is based on the Bayesian hierarchical dirichlet process. HDP was run with double hierarchy: (1) individual identifier (ID) and (2) tissue types (either blood or sperm), without the COSMIC reference signatures73 (v.3.3) as priors, on the mutation matrices. The number of mutations were normalized for the trinucleotide context abundance specific for each sample relative to the full genome. Both clustering hyperparameters, beta and alpha, were set to one. The Gibbs samples ran for 30,000 burn-in iterations (parameter ‘burnin'), with a spacing of 200 iterations (parameter ‘space'), from which 100 iterations were collected (parameter ‘n'). After each Gibbs iteration, three iterations of concentration parameters were conducted (parameter ‘cpiter'). Two components were extracted as DNM signatures, which were further reconstructed and decomposed into known COSMIC (v.3.3) SBS signatures using SigProfilerAssignment (https://github.com/AlexandrovLab/SigProfilerAssignment).

To examine genes under positive selection and to quantify global selection, we used the dNdScv algorithm28. This algorithm was extended using the base-pair-level duplex coverage, the methylation level and the pentanucleotide context to capture more complex context-dependent mutational biases and to achieve higher accuracy for our selection analysis. Detailed methods for input mutations, model selection and evaluation, site dN/dS tests, driver mutation estimation and gene set enrichment are described in Supplementary Note 3.

Positively selected genes were annotated with monoallelic disease consequences using the 29 February 2024 release of the DDG2P database39 and the 21 June 2024 release of the OMIM database74. OMIM annotations related to somatic disease, complex disease or tentative disease associations were excluded.

Genes were also annotated for their potential mutation mechanism observed in sperm and cancer or developmental disorders when available. In sperm, genes were labelled as LOF if they had nominal enrichment of nonsense + splice variants and/or indel variants (ptrunc_cv <0.1 | pind_cv <0.1) and 2+ LOF mutations. There were two exceptions to this, whereby genes met these thresholds but were labelled as activating owing to having a restricted repertoire of LOF mutations that are known to be oncogenic in cancers: CBL (LOFs in and downstream of the RING zinc finger domain)75 and PPM1D (LOFs in final two exons)76. All other genes had missense enrichment only and were labelled as activating. The mechanism in cancer was defined by using the ‘role in cancer' field of the COSMIC cancer gene census (v.99)38, where ‘oncogene' was labelled as activating and ‘tumour suppressor gene' as LOF. Annotations of a fusion mechanism were not displayed, except for genes that had neither an oncogene nor a tumour suppressor annotation, which were labelled as ‘fusion only'. The developmental disorder mechanism was defined by using the variation consequence field of DDG2P, for which ‘restricted repertoire of mutations;activating' was labelled as activating and ‘loss_of_function_variant' was labelled as LOF.

The lollipop gene mutation plots were created using a coordinate system, whereby position 1 was defined as the first coding base of the GRCh37-GencodeV18+Appris77 transcript of the gene. The data sources included protein domains from UniProt78, somatic mutations from the exome and genome-wide screens of the COSMIC (v.99)38, ClinVar (release 2024.07.01)41 pathogenic annotation, per base pair cohort-wide (targeted + exome) NanoSeq coverage, sperm mutation count (number of independent individuals with a mutation) and mutation consequence and amino acid change annotated by the dNdScv algorithm28. These data were plotted using code modified from the lolliplot function in the trackViewer R package79.

Variants were annotated using Ensembl's variant effect predictor (VEP)80 with added custom annotations of mutation context, ClinVar (release 2024.07.01)41, CADD (v.GRCh37-v1.6)42 and the average methylation level in testis. Methylation data were obtained from whole-genome shotgun bisulfite sequencing methylation data from male testis samples from a 37-year-old (ENCFF638QVP) and 54-year-old (ENCFF715DMX) from the ENCODE project71. The average methylation level was calculated by selecting CpG sites with coverage of three or more and averaging the per cent of sites methylated between the two samples.

Variants were annotated as likely monoallelic disease-causing mutations if they met at least one of two criteria: (1) reported in ClinVar as pathogenic, likely pathogenic or if they were reported as ‘conflicting classifications of pathogenicity', where the conflict was between reports of pathogenic/likely pathogenic and ‘uncertain significance' with no reports of benign or likely benign and not specified as a recessive condition; or (2) were a highly damaging variant in high-confidence monoallelic developmental disorder genes from DDG2P39. Genes met the following criteria: (1) allelic requirement being monoallelic_autosomal, monoallelic_X_hem, monoallelic_X_het or mitochondrial; (2) confidence in strong, definitive or moderate; and (3) a mutation consequence of ‘absent gene product'. Highly damaging was defined as being a ‘high' impact variant in the VEP annotation (frameshift splice_acceptor, splice_donor, start_lost, stop_gained or stop_lost) or a missense variant with CADD42 score >30 (top 0.1% damaging).

Variants were defined as a likely driver if they met the ‘highly damaging' criteria defined above in a significant germline-selection gene with LOF mutation enrichment or if they were in 1 of the 24 significant mutation hotspots. This resulted in 320 variants being labelled as likely drivers in exome samples.

To calculate the mean count of synonymous, missense or LOF or pathogenic mutations per sperm cell, we summed the duplex VAFs of all variants in that class. For example, if an individual had 3 synonymous mutations each observed once with a duplex coverage of 100 at each of those sites, each of those variants would have a duplex VAF of 1/100 = 0.01. The sum of VAFs in this example would then be 0.03 and this would then be reported as the estimate for the mean count of synonymous variants per sperm cell for that individual. At low fractions such as 0.03, the mean count per cell is approximately equivalent to the percentage of sperm with this mutation class (3%); therefore, the driver and disease mutations are reported as percentage estimates. At higher fractions (for example, mean count > 1), the fractions are not equivalent to percentage, as many cells will have multiple variants of that class; therefore, the estimates are reported as mean count.

Expected mean counts for SNVs were generated by annotating each possible substitution at each covered site with an expected number of mutations per sample as given by expCountSNV = context_mut_rate × duplex_coverage × age_correction. The context_mut_rate was given by the 208 basePairCov + cpgMeth trinucleotide mutation model estimates for that trinucleotide + methylation mutation context (Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Table 9). Duplex coverage is the exact duplex coverage at that site for that sample. The age_correction parameter was given to normalize the mutation model estimates (derived from all exome samples) to the mutation rate of that sample based on age. Specifically, we fit a linear model to the mutation burden versus age of the exome samples and used this to generate a predicted mutation rate for each sample based on age. The per sample correction parameter was calculated as the age predicted mutation burden divided by the mean mutation rate of all exome samples (3.89 × 10–8). The resulting corrections spanned from 0.50 (youngest sample) to 1.42 (oldest samples). The expected indel mutation rate was calculated in the same way, except with a single mutation rate parameter (indels/bp) expCountIndel = indel_mut_rate × duplex_coverage × age_correction. The expected mean count was then calculated for each category (for example, synonymous or likely disease) by summing the expected values for each SNV and/or indel base pair matching the relevant annotation. As background for possible ClinVar pathogenic variants, we only considered indels of size 21 bp or less, the largest detected indel in the dataset. Regressions were fit with either linear models or generalized linear models (glm in R) with family = quasibinomial.

We tested for associations between mutation outcome variables from sperm genome, sperm exome, sperm targeted and blood genome NanoSeq data and the phenotype predictor variables of BMI, smoking pack-years and alcohol drink-years. These tests were performed using a Gaussian family generalized linear regression in R. For each mutation outcome variable the test took the following form: glm(mutationOutcome ~ age_at_sampling + BMI + pack_years + drinkYears, family = “gaussian”).

The mutation outcome variables examined were SNV and indel burden from all four sequencing datasets, SBS1 and SBS5 count from sperm genomes, SBS1, SBS5 and SBS19 from blood genomes, and likely disease cell fraction and likely driver cell fraction from sperm targeted and sperm exomes. The significance of each predictor was assessed from the summary output coefficients of the model, and P values were adjusted for 68 total tests using the false discovery rate method.

a,b,c, Slides of Papanicolaou stained semen samples for (a) an azoospermic sample where no sperm cells are visible, (b) an oligozoospermic sample where a small number of sperm samples are visible and (c) a normozoospermic sample where many sperm cells are visible. Sperm concentrations are given for each sample in millions of sperm per ml (M/ml). The black band in the bottom left of each slide photo corresponds to 100 µm. Staining was independently repeated once with similar results. d, The distribution of sperm counts on a log scale among semen samples analysed with colour bands indicating the concentration bin of the sample. All samples below 1 million/mL were subsequently excluded. e, The distributions of mutation burden per year from blood samples and three categories of sperm samples broken down by sperm concentration.

a, Graphical relationship between NanoSeq methods applied in manuscript. Both sperm and blood samples underwent genome NanoSeq, used for mutation burden and mutational signature analyses. Only sperm samples were used for targeted NanoSeq applied for selection, driver, and pathogenic variant analyses. Targeted NanoSeq is adaptable to different target panels, and we have named the sample sets as “targeted” for the samples using the 263 gene cancer panel and “exome” for samples using the exome wide panel. b, Mean duplex coverage (log scale) and percentage of genome covered (log scale) per sample. Panels summarise the mean duplex coverage (dx) and mean percentage of genome covered per NanoSeq type and tissue. c, Mutation burden of targeted (dark orange), exome (yellow), and genome (blue) sperm sequenced samples that were observed without correction (left), corrected for trinucleotide composition of covered base pairs relative to the whole genome (middle) or corrected and masked for mutations and coverage in the 44 genes linked to germline positive selection (right). Models are linear regressions, with the central line showing the model fit and the shaded bands indicating 95% confidence intervals.

a,b, Distribution of indel types observed in whole genome (a) sperm and (b) blood.

a,b, Substitutions (a) and indels (b) per diploid cell from blood NanoSeq relative to specific blood cell types13. c,d, Substitutions per haploid cell for sperm (c) and diploid cell for blood (d) split by signature contributions of SBS1, SBS5, and SBS19. a,b,c,d, Models are linear mixed regressions, with the central line showing the model fit and the shaded bands indicating 95% confidence intervals calculated by parametric bootstrapping. e, Ratio of age-corrected blood to sperm substitutions per diploid cell per year for mutations assigned to SBS1 and SBS5. Each dot corresponds to an individual with both a blood and sperm sample and where individuals had multiple timepoints the mean value of all timepoints in that tissue was used. Box plots show the median as center line, the 25th and 75th percentiles as box limits, and whiskers extending to the largest and smallest values within 1.5× the interquartile range from the limits from n = 57 biologically independent samples.

a,b, Mean duplex coverage (a) and methylation percentage (b) of all base pairs with exome sequencing coverage split by mutation consequence. c, C > T mutation rate point estimates at CpG sites in n = 38 biologically independent exome-sequenced sperm samples split by methylation bin based on percentage methylated from testis bisulfite sequencing. d, Comparison of global dN/dS ratio point estimates from mutations of n = 38 exome-sequenced sperm samples using different modifications to the dNdScv algorithm. Categories include all nonsynonymous mutations, missense, nonsense or essential splice. The basic model excludes genes with no coverage and uses default parameters. Additional models show the impact of adding corrections for duplex coverage per base pair (BasePairCov), CpG methylation level (CpGmeth), and pentanucleotide context (Penta). e, Comparison of per-gene significance in exome-wide (blue) or restricted hypothesis (orange) dN/dS tests using the different models. Genes that did not reach significance in either test are shown in grey. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

a, dN/dS ratios for sperm SNVs across germline selection genes and cancer gene census genes split by ten canonical cancer pathways, where the dotted black line indicates neutrality and the dotted orange line represents the cohort average across all genes. b, The mutation mechanism assigned to each gene based on the mutation pattern in sperm, developmental disorders, and cancer (Methods).

a,b,c,d,e,f, Observed sperm mutations across the cohort for six illustrative genes where the height of the “lollipop” represents the number of unique samples with a mutation at that location and the colour represents its mutation type. Mutations are labelled with their amino acid consequence for point substitutions or their insertion (ins)/deletion (del) consequence of in frame (IF) or frameshift (FS). A “P” indicates that the variant is classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in ClinVar. Exons are shown as purple rectangles and the blue background represents the total duplex coverage across the cohort. Lines below the gene indicate COSMIC somatic mutations in cancer within that gene.

The relationship between age and the mean count of SNVs (non-coding, synonymous, missense, and loss-of-function (nonsense or essential splice)) and indels (non-coding indel and coding indel) per sperm cell. The red points represent the observed values for each individual. The grey line represents the expected mutation count per sperm based on the germline mutation rate model. Error bands indicate 95% confidence intervals of linear regressions.

Correlation of cohort phenotypes with mutation outcomes across sequencing datasets. Associations were tested using two-sided generalised linear models (family = gaussian). P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the false discovery rate (FDR) method. Asterisks indicate FDR-corrected P value ranges: (*P value > 0.01 to <0.05, **P value > 0.001 to <0.01, ***P value < 0.001).

Amazon Prime Day is a solid way to stock up on anything your little heart may desire. Sure, there are great deals to be had on everything from Apple gear to laptops to power banks, but the smaller and more frivolous items are on sale, too—like beauty deals and, as you'll see below, toys.

Of course these can make good gifts for any youngsters in your life. Or you can pick up a few things while they're on sale ahead of Angel Tree season. But if you, too, are in tune with your inner child, maybe it's time to treat yourself to one of these WIRED-approved frivolities. Check out our list of the Best Amazon Prime Day Deals Under $100 for additional picks.

Kellytoy

Amazon

Oh my God? Do you see this thing? It's a bigfoot. With rainbow tie-dye hair. It's literally so adorable and comfy-looking. I haven't owned it (although I might after writing this story), but I have been the proud owner of a similarly constructed Squishmallow, and the top portion of hair on these designs is both fluffy and soft. Your very own Sasquatch, complete with wee footprints, and at more than half off the normal price. The 20-inch Squishmallows are jumbo and work well as a pillow or backrest, though they might be too large to rest on your bed unless you're willing to fork over a solid chunk of real estate. I haven't met a single Squishmallow I disliked or that was poorly made—it largely comes down to your personal preference.

Valtech

Magnetic building tiles

Why buy your kid a Dream House, a castle, and a car when you can give them a kit to assemble their own, plus many more things? Magna-Tiles are colorful and versatile but at a regular price of $50 for 32 translucent geometric shapes, they're not cheap. This Prime Day deal brings them down to $35, or just over a buck each. You can grab two and set a child's imagination loose.

Lego

Amazon

This Lego set is full of gorgeous fall tones and looks great on a mantel or table once you're done building. It's a split design, so you can build it in tandem with someone else if you so desire (though I personally could never). This product is now retired, which means you can only get it from third-party merchants rather than from Lego directly. It features gerbera daisies, roses, and pieces that are made of plant-based sugarcane plastic. It also makes a great white elephant gift.

Elon Musk will settle a $128 million lawsuit with four Twitter executives whom he fired after taking over the company in 2022.

One of Musk's first moves upon buying Twitter was to fire CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, and top lawyers Sean Edgett and Vijaya Gadde. The four executives never received severance payments, which they claim is because they tried to hold Musk to his $44 billion commitment when he tried to back out of buying the company. The lawsuit even quotes Walter Isaacson's biography of Musk, which quotes him as saying that he would “hunt every single one” of Twitter's C-suite “till the day they die.”

While a court filing confirms that the parties have reached a settlement, it's not yet clear what the terms of that settlement are.

It's not just these executives who have sued Musk for severance payments. Musk recently settled a class action lawsuit concerning 6,000 laid-off Twitter employees. Many of these former Twitter staff complained that they received incomplete severance payments or did not receive severance payments at all.

If the hypothesis is correct, it sets an incredibly high bar for starting a new programming language today. Not only does one need to develop compiler, runtime, libraries, and IDE support (which is a tall order by itself), but one must also provide enough data for LLMs to be trained on, or even provide a custom fine-tuned snapshot of one of the open models for the new language.

reply

I see that difference in llm generated code when switching languages. Generated rust code has a much higher quality than python code for example.

reply

I don't work in this area (I have a very unfavorable view of LLMs broadly), but I have colleagues who are working on various aspects of what you ask about, e.g., developing testing frameworks to help ensure output is valid or having the LLMs generate easily-checkable tests for their own generated code, developing alternate means of constraining output (think of, like, a special kind of type system), using LLMs in a way similar to program synthesis, etc. If there is fruit to be borne from this, I would expect to start seeing more publications about it at high-profile venues in the next year or two (or next week, which is when ICFP and SPLASH and their colocated workshops will convene this year, but I haven't seen the publications list to know if there's anything LLM-related yet).

reply

CC can do that by itself in a loop, in ~3mo apparently. https://cursed-lang.org/I know it's a meme project, but still it's impressive. And cc is at the point where you can take the repo of that language, ask it to ""make it support emoji variables"", and 5$ later it works. So yeah ... pretty impressive that we're already there.

AI labs and startups should focus on breakthrough research—new architectures, training methods, the stuff that ends up in papers. Instead, they burn countless hours configuring cloud infrastructure, debugging distributed training, and negotiating GPU deals.

We know because we lived it. While training our own models, we realized we were spending 60% of our time on infrastructure and 40% on actual research. Talking to other teams, we found everyone had this problem. Small labs can't afford dedicated infra teams. Large labs waste research talent on DevOps.

This infrastructure tax is holding back AI progress. We decided to eliminate it.

Today, wanting performance means vendor lock-in to NVIDIA. This creates artificial scarcity: limited production capacity, sky-high prices, and compute monopolies. By making all hardware from AMD GPUs, TPUs, Trainium, whatever comes next, equally usable, we'll unlock massive new supply.

In this world, anyone can train state-of-the-art models without ever thinking past their PyTorch code. Startups won't need infrastructure teams. Researchers won't waste time on cloud configuration. CEOs won't negotiate GPU rental deals.

Compute will be abundant, cheap, and boring. And AI research will accelerate because researchers can finally focus on research.

If there's one thing an A-series Pixel device is known for, it's giving you a lot for a little less. That's to say the “A” signifier connotes value, and that applies to Google's Pixel phones, but also to Pixel Buds, the company's line of wireless earbuds. In keeping with that A-series reputation, the Pixel Buds A-series were a good value when they were released in 2021. For $99, they're fairly feature-rich and leaned into a design that was comfortable and provided enough passive noise cancellation to satisfy lots of people who bought them. There was one thing they didn't have, though: active noise cancellation, better known as ANC.

That may have been fine for the time, but this is 2025, and while companies might've been able to get away with ANC-less wireless earbuds a few years ago, even today's more budget-friendly picks come with the ability to cancel noise both actively and passively. Clearly, Google knows that, which is why the Pixel Buds 2a add ANC and still manage to keep the price down. That's a tantalizing deal on paper, but there's a lot that goes into making a pair of wireless earbuds worth buying in this day and age, which begs the question: are Google's A-series Pixel Buds still a great value?

Pixel Buds 2a

The Pixel Buds 2a are comfy ANC buds with an affordable price tag.

Pros

Cons

Let's start from the top. The Pixel Buds 2a are $129, which is a $30 premium over the last generation. That price hike, while not ideal, does come with some notable improvements, including ANC. It's hard to overstate how important ANC is in a pair of wireless earbuds nowadays. It's one of those things where, if you've never had a pair of ANC buds, you might not get it, but once you have ones that cancel noise, non-ANC buds feel untenable.

The thing about ANC is that not all noise cancellation is created equally. For the Pixel Buds 2a, Google claims that its ANC is actually 1.5 times better than the ANC on the Pixel Buds Pro (first-generation), meaning you're actually getting more in that department than Google's Pro-series. Having used both the Pixel Buds Pro and the Pixel Buds 2a, I can confirm; Google is giving you more ANC than you might expect here.

At my office, I was able to tune out plenty of noise to the point where I couldn't even hear my coworkers chatting. On the subway (my obligatory testing ground for ANC buds), I was also pleasantly surprised at the amount of noise that the Pixel Buds 2a cancel. I can still hear some train noise with the Pixel Buds 2a in, but not what I would describe as a disruptive amount. They're better in the ANC department than the Nothing Ear 3 that I recently tested and marginally better than the Pixel Buds Pro, as promised. They're nowhere near the same level of ANC as high-end options like Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen), but those wireless earbuds also cost $299, so that comparison is a little unfair.

I did experience multiple moments where it felt like ANC dropped off momentarily, but it's hard to say why; it was noticeable in louder environments like riding the subway or walking down the street past construction. For reference, the Pixel Buds 2a don't have adaptive ANC, nor do they have Adaptive Sound, which is a feature in the Pixel Buds Pro 2 that adjusts the volume in loud environments. The issue wasn't enough to scare me away from the Pixel Buds 2a, but it is something that I noticed in my testing. If there is some kind of issue, it's something that could most likely be fixed in a software update.

Overall, my impression is that you're getting a good amount of ANC for the value, and the overall package feels even greater once you start factoring in the fit and feel.

One area that I'm sure adds to the feeling of better noise canceling than the competition is the fit of the Pixel Buds 2a. Like the past Pixel-branded wireless earbuds, the Pixel Buds 2a are stemless, which I love. As nice as some wireless earbuds, like Nothing's Ear series can look, sometimes the stems have a tendency to feel unwieldy and have a much higher chance of looking wonky once they're in your ears if they aren't aligned on each side. The Pixel Buds 2a, on the other hand, fit snugly in your ear and maybe even more so than other generations, both Pro and non-Pro.

This time around, Google includes a “twist-to-adjust stabilizer,” which is a small lip under the bud part. It's a small design tweak, but the Pixel Buds 2a get a lot of mileage out of it. The wireless earbuds feel even more planted in your ears as a result, and inserting them requires less futzing. I'm fairly sure that they contribute to some passive noise cancellation, too, both because it makes ensuring the buds are snug an easy feat, and then it also creates a bolstered seal on the outside, which probably blocks more noise. I have no way of verifying that, but based on my listening, it just feels that way.

Outside of the stabilizer, the Pixel Buds 2a just look great, too. The pair I tested came in an “Iris” color, which is a light purple that some may describe as lilac. Iris, and the Pixel Buds 2a, are a proper antidote to AirPods‘ homogeneous white that's both iconic and a little boring at this point. The Pixel Buds 2a also get a redesigned case that's a little bit slimmer than the last generation, which isn't super important at the end of the day, but is more than welcome. If there's one thing I hate, it's feeling like my pockets are clogged up with an unnecessarily thick charging case.

Outside of ANC, the Pixel Buds 2a are most improved in the battery department. This generation of A-series buds has 7 hours of ANC playback, which is up from 5 hours in the previous generation. Anything around 6 hours of ANC playback is better than average in my experience, and obviously much better than 5 hours, which is frankly not up to par.

There is one caveat here, though, and that's in the case. While the Pixel Buds 2a case has a nice feel and is slimmer, it will get slightly less battery life than the previous generation, but mostly because of the addition of ANC. The Pixel Buds 2a case is rated for 20 hours of battery if you're using ANC and 27 hours with ANC off, and chances are, you're going to be using ANC most of the time. The first-gen Pixel Buds A-series are rated for 24 hours of battery life, though there was no ANC in the equation to compare against.

In my testing, listening to the Pixel Buds 2a in hour increments over the course of a few days, I found those estimates to be accurate, which slots them in the upper range for battery life among other wireless earbuds in this price range.

When it comes to sound, I've never been particularly impressed with the Pixel sound (that goes for the Pixel Buds Pro, too), but I don't dislike it either. For the Pixel Buds 2a, I'd say that general attitude still applies. I find the Pixel Buds 2a hold their own in the sound department. These aren't particularly bass-y buds, which I'm fine with, but they're solid all-around performers. I listened to Daft Punk's “Da Funk,” and I find the soundstage on the Pixel Buds 2a is generally smaller and less bombastic than competitors like OnePlus Buds 4, which really crank up the bass and low end in particular.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly, but I just find the sound from the Pixel Buds 2a to be more muted and generally flatter than the competition, including the Nothing Ear 3. That could also have something to do with the fact that both the competitors I just listed have personalized EQ, which better tunes the wireless earbuds to my specific hearing. No matter what the reason is, my take is that Pixel Buds 2a are serviceable in the sound department, but they didn't blow me away. If you're a hi-fi audio kind of person and pay attention to which frequencies you can hear and how well, these probably aren't the pick for you, even at this price point.

I wouldn't say that the Pixel Buds 2a are overflowing with features, but you've got a lot of your bread and butter here. There's a transparency mode for when you want to use the wireless earbuds without ANC; there are tap controls for activating a voice assistant, play/pause, and track skipping; there's also hands-free Gemini and Gemini Live if either of those is your thing.

I used Gemini Live a bit to explore an album I was listening to (Pavement's “Terror Twilight”) by summoning a live chat with the command, “Hey Google, let's talk live,” and then asking when the album I was listening to came out. First off, props to Gemini for even knowing what I was talking about; it understood that I was listening to a song on Spotify and wanted more context. I had a brief chat about the album, when it came out, and whether I liked it, and then Gemini asked what kind of music I liked, to which I replied, “grunge-y rock music.”

Tastefully, Gemini recommended Mudhoney and not Nirvana or Pearl Jam. Who knew Gemini was such a hipster? Overall, Gemini Live can be kind of fun, though I don't think I'll be springing for a chat with a chatbot too often. Maybe you will, though! And if that's your thing, it's nice to have such easy access built right into the Pixel Buds 2a.



© Raymond Wong / GizmodoAs always, the Pixel Buds 2a work best with Android devices, especially if you're going to use the Pixel Buds app, which you still cannot download on iOS. There's also the ability to use Google's Find Hub to locate the buds in the event they get lost, which is great if you're the type of person who likes to throw their wireless earbuds around indiscriminately. There's also spatial audio, which is increasingly a thing on lots of wireless earbuds, though I'm not super certain that anyone cares to use it for most things. But hey, it's there if you do want to use it.

The thing is, the Pixel Buds 2a aren't really about having all the fancy features. If you're buying any A-series Google device, you're in search of value, and this year, for $30 more you get ANC and a much-improved battery life. As a bonus, you also get a very comfy and nice-looking pair of wireless earbuds that, while not winning any superlatives from me, still hold it down in the sound department. So, to answer the question we started with, “Are the Pixel Buds 2a a good deal?” Let's just say I would not try to stop you from buying a pair.

In a world before Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7, Google's new $1,800 Pixel 10 Pro Fold might have stood a chance. But after falling head over heels for Samsung's $2,000 foldable, Google's third-gen foldable just doesn't cut it—even with Gemini.

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is not a bad foldable. It's a more polished device compared to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, with improvements in all the areas you'd expect year over year, like faster performance, longer battery life, and increased durability. It just doesn't excite when you hold its bulky frame that looks nearly identical to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to the thin and light Z Fold 7. Samsung's book-style foldable looks and feels like it's from the future; the Pixel 10 Pro Fold feels like Google is too fixated on AI and neglecting why people buy new phones—for the hardware.

That's the nature of consumer electronics. It's cutthroat when the competition brings it, and boy, did Samsung turn things up with the Z Fold 7.

Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold

Google's Pixel 10 Pro Fold is an expensive foldable that leans hard into Gemini and AI, but falls short compared to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7.

Pros

Cons

Unlike the Cosmic Orange iPhone 17 Pro, which drew the stares of what felt like every plugged-in New York University student returning back to school near the Gizmodo office, I had no fear of using the Pixel 10 Pro Fold out in public in advance of its release. Nobody noticed the unreleased phone because it looks almost exactly like the previous model, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Okay, the cover screen is a larger 6.4 inches versus the previous 6.3 inches, but I couldn't feel any difference.

There's nothing wrong with an evolutionary design. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold feels refined for the premium foldable it is. The aluminum is high quality, with an external screen that's flush to the metal frame. The buttons are all nice and clicky to the press. The “Moonstone” colorway—a gray with hints of purple—looks attractive; I don't share the same love for the “Jade” yellow, which looks like lemonade to me. In my hand, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold feels sturdy—heavy (258g versus the Z Fold 7's 215g), but substantial. Even without a case for added grip, I never felt it'd slip out of my hand.

New stuff that you won't see off the bat is better durability in a number of places, and the Pixelsnap magnetic wireless charging/accessory support. Google says it redesigned the hinge to be gearless, which in turn allows the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to fold for up to 10 years' worth of folds. I can't confirm that claim, but I guess that's something worth touting. The foldable also has an IP68 rating, which finally makes it not only resistant to water but also fully dust-resistant. This increased durability puts the Pixel 10 Pro Fold on par with pretty much every non-folding phone. The IP68 rating is one upside the Pixel 10 Pro Fold has compared to the Z Fold 7, which only has an IP48 rating, meaning it's only shielded against particles larger than 1mm. How much does this matter in daily use? I've had no dust issues with the Z Fold 7 yet, but if you work in dusty environments like construction sites, you may appreciate the higher IP rating on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The 8-inch “Super Actua Flex Display” is also tougher. According to Google, the ultra-thin glass has “two layers of anti-impact film” that should better protect it from drops. Again, I can't test these claims with my loaner unit (I'm sure Zack Nelson aka JerryRigEverything will put it through his standard durability tests), but it's good to see the extra protection.

Pixelsnap magnetic wireless charging and accessory support is also low-key awesome. As I said in my Pixel 10 and 10 Pro reviews, it's just Google's version of Apple's MagSafe, which is to say it's a more secure way for wireless charging than a Qi2 charging pad or stand. On Google's official Pixelsnap Charging Stand, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold can be used unfolded on a table or nightstand. I hate to admit that I am that guy, but I was that guy watching Netflix and YouTube on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold while lying on my side in bed. Judge all you want, but it beats holding the foldable up or using it in its mini laptop-like mode, where video only fills up half of the foldable display. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold also charges faster (up to 50% in 30 minutes) with a wired cable, but you will need a fast charging brick.

Taken together, these upgrades may feel like substantial improvements over the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. But every time I pick up the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, I can't help but compare it to the Z Fold 7. Samsung's foldable is thinner, lighter, and feels better in the hand and my pants pockets. And even though the triple-lens camera bump makes it wobble like crazy on a surface, the crease on the Z Fold 7's foldable screen is also less visible almost three months later. Meanwhile, the crease on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is more pronounced, warping content in an unignorable way whenever I load up a lengthy article or video.

Pixel phones are known for having some of the best cameras. On paper, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold reads like it has a good bag of cameras. There's a 48-megapixel main camera, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, and 10.8-megapixel telephoto with 5x optical zoom. A 10-megapixel camera is embedded in both the cover screen and inside the foldable display.

On a $1,800 phone, the cameras should not have any compromise. Every camera—especially the ones housed in the camera bump—should take class-leading photos on the same level as flagship non-folding phones. This year, the cameras to measure up to are the iPhone 17 Pros, Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and Pixel 10 Pros. The cameras on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold don't, and I'm not the only one who thinks so. Gizmodo social media editor and video producer Adriano Contreras, who is a self-described Pixel fanboy entrenched deep into Google's hardware ecosystem, also thinks the cameras on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold (and the 10 Pros) have actually regressed compared to the Pixel 9 series.

You don't even need to pixel peep to see something about the photos and videos coming out of the Pixel 10 series… looks worse. Photos out of the 48-megapixel main lens—the one that should be sharpest in great lighting and low-light—often look soft with more smeary details compared to the iPhone 17 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra/Z Fold 7. I was surprised to see how comically saturated Adriano's skin looked during one sunset shoot on Gizmodo's rooftop. As I flipped through the camera roll on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to select a range of shots for the below gallery, I couldn't help but feel like many of my photos looked like cartoons—the colors don't look real. Night Sight photos have barely improved in several generations; what should be dark or black skies render as pixelated blues, grays, and purples, like pixels buffering when you've got a bad connection.

Zoom in even a little on photos, and the clarity—or reduced clarity—becomes clear. The same way that people are starting to rebel against the excessive HDR processing from iPhone cameras, I think Google needs to dial back its own computational photography. When a photo becomes more of an ideal “memory” as you imagined or remembered than an accurate representation of a moment that actually happened, it feels like we've crossed a line.

Below are two sets of images shot from the following lenses: 0.5x (optical), 1x (optical), 2x (optical-quality), 5x (optical), and 20x (digital Super Res Zoom):

Google says the Tensor G5 chip that powers the Pixel 10 series improves image processing, while maintaining the image quality that Pixel phone cameras are known for, but it really does feel like the company might have leaned too hard into computational photography and AI solutions, and somehow made everything look uglier.

I know that Google is going all-in on AI and Gemini, integrating it across Android and into as many apps as possible, but the AI camera and editing features in the Pixel 10 series are all kind of gimmicky. Add Me (adds the photographer into the shot using AI compositing), Best Take (creates one “best” photo where everyone is smiling and doesn't have their eyes closed or blinking), and Camera Coach (uses Gemini to analyze a scene and then offer framing suggestions) are all worth trying out, but none of them are must-haves. Add Me and Best Take may solve “real” problems like including everyone in a shot or the hassle of taking multiple photos to get that one perfect one, but they also don't feel ethical to me; it's “Photoshopping” without needing to do editing. Those “photos” aren't real. Google doesn't seem to care because its Pixel camera chief, Isaac Reynolds, is more interested in creating memories as you want to remember them, not necessarily what actually happened.

That's also a good segue to the generative AI features like Super Res Zoom and Help Me Edit. The former is a way to upscale zoomed-in photos—on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, it's for magnification up to 20x—and was introduced in the Pixel 3. But Help Me Edit, an editing feature within Google Photos, which lets you tell Gemini with a text prompt the changes you want to make, and it will hopefully make them for you, is a step down a very slippery slope.

I get that it's democratizing and making photo editing easier and faster, but it's also enabling doctored photos to spread at an even faster pace. I'm not a boomer denouncing new methods to do old things like edit photos, but I think we should have a conversation about whether using AI to generate family photos that never happened or create details in zoomed-in photos that were never actually there is something we actually want. Left unchecked, the authenticity of photography, especially phone photography, is at the sole direction of the people in charge of helping us capture reality. My point is, Google's idea of what a camera and photography are is veering away from my definition. So we're back to deciding whether you want the best image quality or all these AI camera and editing features you may or may not care about.

Another area where Google seems more interested in AI than offering a competitive experience to the Z Fold 7 and other foldables? Performance. Google is now on its fifth generation of custom Tensor G-series silicon, and it's still a laggard compared to Qualcomm's Snapdragon and Apple's A-series chips.

Android 16 is powered by the new Tensor G5. It's performant enough for basic phone things, but pales in comparison to the power you get from the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip in phones like the Galaxy S25 Ultra or OnePlus 13 or the A19 chips in the iPhone 17 series and iPhone Air. Phones with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip are around 40% faster on Geekbench 6's single-core benchmark than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and the iPhone 17 series and iPhone Air are almost 75% faster. It's only going to look worse for the Tensor G5 in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold when phones with Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip are released in the next few months.

If you're a gamer who likes to play 3D games like Genshin Impact or Fortnite, or you're looking to use CapCut for editing more involved TikToks or Reels, I would look elsewhere. The Z Fold 7 performs way better for both games and editing videos. There was a recent report that said Genshin Impact was unplayable on the Pixel 10 series because of a new update. The game ran okay on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold with the default “medium” settings—not buttery smooth but not nearly as jittery as that one video had suggested. Google and the game's developer miHoYo have since come out to debunk that Genshin Impact runs poorly on Pixel 10 series phones.

With a less powerful CPU and GPU in the Tensor G5 SoC (system-on-chip), my main concern for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is how it'll perform in a few years. My experience with Pixel phones has always been that they really start to show sluggishness even within a year of ownership. Somehow, fundamental stuff just breaks, and there seem to be hardware and software issues constantly popping up with every “Pixel Drop” of features. While 16GB of RAM is roomy—4GB more than the 12GB in the Z Fold 7—the 256GB of storage is offensive on an $1,800 phone. Consumers deserve at least 512GB when they're paying twice as much as a non-folding phone.

Tell Google all of this, and company reps will deflect and tell you the Tensor G5 is designed for best-in-class AI, designed specifically for Gemini Live, Magic Cue (the opt-in AI feature that offers “agentic” suggestions like relevant information and actions within apps), and all the other AI stuff happening underneath the hood. That may be true, but I've yet to experience any “holy shit” moment where I've felt Gemini or Magic Cue—the two headlining AI features on the Pixel 10 series—made the current phone experience appear outdated.

As I said in my Pixel 10 review, Gemini Live and Magic Cue are still works in progress. They are very hit or miss; working sometimes, not working when you expect it to. As a techie, I can see a future where proactive AI on phones that offers suggestions at the right time in the right place can be really powerful. I want to spend less time buried in my phone tapping in apps and let an AI—whether that's Gemini or Siri or whatever—take the wheel. I've been hearing this spiel for over a decade. Nobody has cracked it just yet, not even Google. Gemini is still in the early innings of an AI ball game where it's really hard to convince people to change how they're used to using their phones. Even when I know there are AI features that could do something for me, I still find myself doing things manually. Old habits are hard to break.

While testing the many new AI features in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed and underwhelmed. If you're buying this phone, you should take the time to learn what each AI feature is and how to use it. You should opt into as many of them as possible and really try to adjust your mobile computing to embrace this “intelligence,” otherwise, you're wasting your $1,800 value. Why not get a different foldable if you don't care about AI features that much? I gave all the AI features a fair shake, but in the end, I reverted back to using the foldable like any similar device—as a tablet for watching videos and reading. I hate to say it, but Gemini opening to the side of my other app content as opposed to blocking it just isn't enough of a selling point.

The bar for what to expect from a foldable—the kind that opens up like a book and often costs nearly $2,000—was raised this year by Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7. To even compete, any foldable needs to push the envelope of design while offering an experience on par with it or better. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold hardware is nice, but incomparable next to the Z Fold 7, even if it's slightly more durable.

Things would be different if Gemini, Magic Cue, and the other AI features in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold were a game-changing experience, but the reality is they're not… yet. Maybe someday that may be the case, but it's just not on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.

Perhaps the only feature that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold wins against the Z Fold 7 without contest is battery life. Google shoved in a 5,015mAh battery that brute forces its way to longer battery life compared to the Z Fold 7's 4,400mAh cell. Whereas the Z Fold 7 barely makes it through a full day with at least 10-15% in the tank after 12 hours, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold easily ended the same period with 25-30% left. I never had battery anxiety while using the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. It's one advantage of a thicker phone, I suppose.

The value proposition for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is still the same it's been for the previous two generations: you get a bigger screen. At least with Samsung's Z Fold 7, the bigger screen folds up into a footprint that feels like a regular big-ass phone. Unless you're deeply intrigued by the potential of Gemini and AI, the Z Fold 7 is the better foldable, though you'll need to fork over an extra $200. On the day this review is publishing, I've seen new Z Fold 7 foldables going for the same price $1,800, because of Prime Day. Those deals will only get better into the holidays.

Last week, OpenAI released Sora 2, the latest version of its AI video creator, along with a new Sora app for making and sharing those videos. The new tool has led to an explosion in realistic AI videos on social media, including plenty of fresh discussion about intellectual property rights. But one of the oddest things to emerge with Sora 2 is a new crop of videos showing AI protesters.

These aren't just any protest videos. Specifically, supporters of President Donald Trump appear to be making videos of protesters being brutalized by the federal agents and troops who have been sent to U.S. cities. Trump has most recently tried to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago, and while those deployments have been delayed by the courts, those cities are still crawling with ICE agents terrorizing immigrant communities.

One of the new fake protester videos, which has over 40 million views on Instagram, shows someone clad in black shouting in the face of a soldier dressed in fatigues.

“What's your name, soldier?” the AI protester yells repeatedly. The text on the screen reads “wait for it” before the AI soldier sprays the protester with orange pepper spray, yelling back “Sergeant Pepper.”

 View this post on Instagram



The video has been shared on several platforms, including TikTok and X, where many people don't seem to understand it's AI. The actor James Woods, a Trump supporter who frequently shares right-wing memes on X, wrote on Tuesday about the video, “Couldn't get better than this. Haiku-level brilliant.” Many of the comments seem to be just as oblivious to the fact that it's AI.

Another video that's become popular on Facebook, Instagram, and X shows AI protesters shouting “no queso, no cheese,” apparently a racist riff on the common protest chant “no justice, no peace.” The AI protesters in the video are also sprayed with a chemical agent.

The video has gotten over 1.5 million views on X alone, with the caption, “Lmfao, that was beautiful and before you ask I voted 100 for this!!” 

The phrase “I voted for this” has become a common thing for far-right supporters of Trump to say when something particularly brutal has happened to their political opponents.

Lmfao, that was beautiful and before you ask I voted 💯 for this!! pic.twitter.com/O6VLFZnw3i

— 🇺🇸Steve2A🇺🇸God🇺🇸Family🇺🇸Country🇺🇸 (@lakemonstercl1) October 7, 2025



The Instagram version of the video includes the caption “Liberals acting like clowns – got treated like clowns by federal agents – goodbye – FAFO,” an acronym for “fuck around and find out.” Some users on Instagram have pointed out that it's AI, but the account insists in the comments that it's real. 

It's not real, obviously. And the big Sora watermark should be the clue to anyone who's familiar with OpenAI. But unfortunately, that kind of watermark isn't enough for most people these days to differentiate between fake and real content.

The shorter Sora videos are also being compiled into larger compilations of AI-generated fakes, like in this one on X that includes jokes about the protesters being paid. It's a common right-wing accusation that all the people protesting Donald Trump are actually paid to be there, often by liberal activists like George Soros.

The most curious thing about all of these fake protester videos is that there are plenty of real videos to share. For example, a pastor in Chicago was shot in the head with pepper balls by agents last month. Rev. David Black was protesting outside an ICE facility near Chicago, Illinois, and was simply speaking peacefully when he was attacked.

Rev. David Black stood in front of a Chicago-area ICE facility and began to pray.

The masked ICE agents on the roof responded by firing pepper balls, with one striking him in the head

Another one of several videos showing protesters getting brutalized while doing nothing wrong was recently captured in Portland. A woman is seen simply talking with police before she's sprayed for absolutely no discernible reason.

Unbelievable. Outside the Portland ICE facility, a man and a woman were standing and talking to a pair of cops with shields when one of them draws his pepper spray and unloads it into her face. She was still crying out in pain several minutes later and had to be taken away to get… pic.twitter.com/2j2CVdO5rC

— Dispatches and drama from Seattle protest scene (@bennetthaselton) October 3, 2025



But real videos of a pastor or a woman getting treated with unnecessary violence don't really fit the narrative that President Trump and his fascist goons are trying to sell. Trump has claimed the reason he's sending agents and troops to U.S. cities is that they're overrun with crime. And he just wants to restore law and order.

In reality, violent crime is near a 50-year low, and Trump is simply trying to strike fear into the hearts of ordinary Americans as his thugs disrupt countless lives. That disruption is having an economic impact, as restaurants in Chicago are comparing the loss of business to the start of the covid-19 pandemic.

Perhaps that's why we're seeing so many fake videos of protests on social media right now. They need a pretext to justify their brutal crackdown on working people. Trump himself seems to have been convinced to deploy the National Guard to Oregon because he saw too many old videos of Portland from the summer of 2020 on TV. And when it comes to Trump, he's pretty easy to fool.

Trump has even shared an AI video of himself promoting a magical “med bed” that can cure all diseases. The president's Truth Social account deleted the video, but it's still not clear why he shared the conspiracy theory in the first place. It's entirely possible he thought it was real. We simply don't know.

Remember when the president saw a photoshopped image of the letters “MS-13” on someone's hand back in April and insisted it was real?

Trump is not a smart man. And his followers are even dumber, as they spread AI slop far and wide, creating an alternative reality where sadistic troops dole out punishment to the left on American streets. Unfortunately, you don't need AI to see so much brutality right now. And if Trump has his way, you're going to see a lot more of it very soon.

Arduino community gets access to Qualcomm hardware and software resources for rich AI projects 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Recent AI market plays have produced all sorts of inter-company investments and flat-out acquisitions. Most of those are somewhat predictable, but occasionally an unexpected deal comes out of left field. Mobile chip giant Qualcomm is acquiring microcontroller expert Arduino for an undisclosed sum. Along with its acquisition, Qualcomm also announced a new Arduino Uno Q board and Arduino App Lab IDE software.

The chipmaker claims that buying Arduino allows it to deliver ""a full-stack edge platform,"" or in other words, edge-device AI, with Arduino microcontrollers as the hardware piece of that puzzle. That would make a measure of sense, given Qualcomm's remarks that this acquisition should dovetail nicely with its acquisitions of the Edge Impulse IoT AI platform and IoT DevOps provider Foundries.io.

Since its founding in the mid-2000s, Arduino has grown to become the default option for anyone wanting an affordable microcontroller, thanks to the open-source design of the hardware and software. The devices spawned thousands of clones and an immense community that makes it exceedingly simple for newcomers to join in. The main distinction between an Arduino and a Raspberry Pi is the former is microcontroller based, the latter being a micro-computer. Though, Raspberry Pi has entered the microcontroller scene with its Raspberry Pi Pico, powered by its own RP2040 and RP2350 custom silicon.

The immediate question likely to be on most enthusiasts' minds, then, is what will happen to Arduino now that it's owned by one of the largest technology companies on the planet. For its part, Qualcomm states that Arduino will ""preserve its open approach and community spirit"" and ""retain its independent brand, tools, and mission"".

While that statement sounds good at face value, Qualcomm's (in)famous legal team might take umbrage with the amount of ""-duino"" clones out there. The Arduino ecosystem is a free-for-all (in a good way), and if Qualcomm adds any barriers to Arduino device usage, like forced product registrations or more restrictive licensing, that could put a significant chill on the project.

The devices themselves (and their clones) are ubiquitous and can be found most anywhere that sells electronic components and even big-box retailers. Any tightening of the supply chain or preferential resellers would also carry a negative impact.

Having said all that, there's no denying that having immediate and direct access to Qualcomm's technology and resources might prove a substantial benefit to Arduino. Chips and designs ought to be far easier to source, and Qualcomm's weight in purchasing components could result in even more affordable or better-performant Arduino devices.

As for the new Arduino Uno Q, it marries a Qualcomm DragonWing QRB2210 CPU that's capable of running Debian Linux with an STM32U585 microcontroller. This is the first Arduino product meant to work with the new Arduino App Lab, an IDE for Real-time OS, Linux, and Python — though it's apparently not yet available in the Arduino downloads section.

The price points, although likely justifiable, are encroaching on Raspberry Pi territory. The Uno Q comes in two variants: one with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of eMMC storage, for $44 or 39€, that can be preordered today and will ship on October 25; the other with 4 GB of memory and 32 GB of storage for $59 or 53€. If you fancy the higher-end model, you should be able to order it in November, though the release date is currently set to ""end of year."" Let's hope Qualcomm continues to invest in the Arduino ecosystem and maintains its open spirit.

Medscape 2050: The Future of Medicine

“One thing to do between now and 2050 is learn some Chinese.”

So says Carlos del Rio, MD, professor of medicine and infectious diseases at Emory University and chair of the Department of Medicine, as well as co-director of the Emory Center for AIDS Research. 

As the US withdraws funding for medical research, del Rio predicts China will take over the leading role globally. The result: “Chinese is going to be the language of science; it's not going to be English anymore … because we have ceded that leadership position. And China will then be the one that develops those great inventions” to address the healthcare issues of the future. 

As a researcher in the field of vaccines and emerging pathogens, del Rio also feels the US is heading in the wrong direction when it comes to preparing for the next pandemic, starting with learning from the COVID response. “We failed in multiple ways,” del Rio says. “The fact that the US had one of the highest mortality rates in the world is really embarrassing.” But instead of absorbing important lessons about social determinants of health, “what we're seeing is enormous political backlash,” del Rio says, “this idea that public health is wrong.”

To meet these challenges, del Rio says medicine must rethink training for the next generation of physicians and focus on collaboration. “We need to train people to work as teams,” del Rio believes, “to work collaboratively with other specialties and with other fields,” from pharmacists to law enforcement.

It will be crucial to see the big picture while also understanding each patient as an individual, recognizing how social inequities drive disease and impact access to treatment. “Osler used to say,” del Rio quotes, “it is not a disease that a patient has; it's a patient that has a disease.” Those future patients may benefit from exciting medical advances, but they will probably come from China.

BERLIN — Pairing a screening or surveillance colonoscopy with a same-day esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) proved feasible and yielded clinically relevant upper gastrointestinal (GI) findings, including malignancies and lesions requiring ongoing surveillance, according to an interim analysis from the TOGAS study.

“There was an abundance of benign but clinically relevant findings,” said lead investigator Jan Bornschein, MD, gastroenterologist at Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, England, who presented the interim results of the study here at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2025.

While the study found upper GI neoplasia in only 1.4% of participants, 17.8% of individuals were marked for upper GI endoscopic surveillance.

The results may inform how Europe develops gastric cancer prevention programs alongside those for colorectal cancer, said Bornschein. “If we can combine the upper GI endoscopy with other modalities [colonoscopy], the more likelihood there is that you can have a one-stop test package,” he said. “A combination, particularly for bowel and stomach, is more feasible and also more cost-effective. So far, the findings show that it's definitely a strategy that, in my opinion, is worth implementing.”

Bornschein and the TOGAS study group hope that the combined approach will prove workable across diverse European settings and will help identify a spectrum of upper GI pathology, from cancers and dysplasia to atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, that can meaningfully affect follow-up surveillance.

These findings come amid data showing rising rates of early-onset (younger than 50 years) GI cancers in the US, including colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, and esophageal tumors. These trends, previously reported by Medscape Medical News, point to environmental and lifestyle drivers, strengthening the case for earlier detection and risk-tailored strategies for upper GI neoplasia and preneoplastic conditions detected during existing colorectal cancer screening pathways.

However, Bornschein noted that prevalence varies considerably across Europe. “There are areas, particularly in the Eastern regions, and in some parts of the West, for example, Portugal, that have a very high incidence of GI cancers. In the UK or in Germany, we have noticed a decline over the years, so the numbers are actually much better than they used to be.”

The study is the second in a series of three TOGAS pilot studies and was conducted across eight centers (France, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) in adults aged 50-74 years attending screening or polyp-surveillance colonoscopy. 

A European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy-aligned protocol defining image documentation, biopsy sampling, and quality parameters was followed to ensure a standardized approach. “Marked preneoplastic change” was defined as gastric glandular atrophy or intestinal metaplasia at the Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment/Operative Link on Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia Assessment stage III-IV and/or Endoscopic Grading of Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia > 5, triggering a need for endoscopic surveillance.

Data were gathered on colonoscopy findings (including polyp surveillance and family history), EGD findings plus biopsies, serum pepsinogen, and Helicobacter pylori serology. Outcome measures included the prevalence of gastric cancer and preneoplastic conditions, the diagnostic accuracy of pepsinogen testing, comparisons between national settings, the relevance of upper endoscopy in fecal immunochemical test-positive cases, and overall H pylori prevalence.

A total of 846 participants were analyzed. At baseline, the mean age was 62 years, 52.2% were men, and 84.2% were White, despite efforts to recruit a more diverse population. Around 390 participants drank alcohol, and 190 smoked tobacco.

A total of 37.8% of participants had undergone prior EGD, of which 94.7% were performed more than 3 years before the study start. The history of GI surgery was 13.7%, and the history of cancer was 14.5%. Around 11% took aspirin, and 14% took proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). “We were surprised at the low prevalence of PPI use,” remarked Bornschein. “It was also good news that around half were never smokers.”

Key results for upper GI neoplasia included six patients (0.7%) with gastric cancers, three (0.4%) with esophageal cancers, and five (0.6%) with duodenal tumors. H pylori positivity was found in 303 patients (35.8%), with an additional 81 (9.6%) reporting a history of eradication.

Colorectal findings included 15 patients (1.8%) with cancers and colon polyps in 503 (59.5%) participants.

Regarding preneoplastic conditions, endoscopy identified intestinal metaplasia in 174 patients (20.6%), of which 65 (7.7%) were multifocal. Atrophy was observed in 220 patients (26.0%), with 59 (7.0%) showing multifocal atrophic changes. Both intestinal metaplasia and atrophy were found together in 105 (12.4%) patients. Barrett's esophagus was detected in 31 (3.7%) patients.

“I'd really like to highlight these further benign gastric findings,” said Bornschein. These included gastric ulcers in 28 (3.3%) patients, erosive gastritis in 245 (29.0%) patients, esophageal ulcers in three (0.4%) patients, Los Angeles Community College District classification esophagitis in 13 (1.5%) patients, and duodenal ulcers in 10 (1.2%) patients. “These were asymptomatic, but we were able to identify them,” he noted.

“We've had a very low rate of complications (0.01%),” he added.” I don't want to jinx that now. These were basically related to sedation.”

Massimiliano di Pietro, MD, consultant gastroenterologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, England, and the principal investigator of the PROSPERO study, which aimed to determine the prevalence of premalignant upper GI conditions in routine endoscopy in the UK, commented on the findings. The TOGAS study focuses on asymptomatic individuals referred for colonoscopy and examines the value of performing an upper GI endoscopy at the same time, he explained. “This approach might identify upper GI conditions that require monitoring, in particular early cancer.”

“On the other hand, the PROSPERO study focuses on patients referred for upper GI symptoms and diagnosis,” he said. Preliminary data from that study, presented during the same session as the TOGAS trial, showed a 13.6% prevalence of premalignant upper GI conditions in a symptomatic UK patient population referred for endoscopy.

“In some respects, the findings were similar, particularly the rate of upper GI cancer at 1.4%, although there were differences in the prevalence of premalignant conditions,” he noted. “This may be explained by the fact that TOGAS is a European study, while PROSPERO is UK-based, where the distribution of upper GI cancers differs, with more esophageal adenocarcinoma vs gastric adenocarcinoma.”

Reflecting on both of the studies, Di Pietro said they are “really important in fulfilling an unmet need in the quality of upper GI endoscopy. Currently, there are no diagnostic quality indicators in upper GI endoscopy, so it's difficult to rate the performance of endoscopists in the same way as we can in lower GI. It's really important to understand the population prevalence, both in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, of premalignant and malignant upper GI conditions.”

TOGAS 2 is recruiting until February 2026, with 1200 of a potential 1600 participants recruited to date. The data will be used for implementation modeling and to inform quality indicators for future screening programs. Final results and plans for a follow-up study are expected in 2026.

Bornschein declared receiving advisory and speaker fees from Flynn Pharma Ltd. and Juvisé Pharmaceuticals. Di Pietro reported having no disclosures relevant to the studies discussed.

Working in a persistently high-turnover practice in England was associated with lower scores for job and life satisfaction as well as components such as autonomy, belonging, and competence among general practitioners (GPs).

""This analysis of a large sample of GPs provides further emphasis for practices, networks and government on the need to act to implement changes to support staff in these key domains,"" the authors wrote.

The study was led by Laura Jefferson, PhD, of the Department of Health Sciences at the University of York in York, England. It was published online on September 29, 2025, in British Journal of General Practice.

The study's design precluded establishing causal inferences between GP turnover and job satisfaction. The cohort lacked ethnic diversity and underrepresented salaried and locum GPs. Data were limited to pre-COVID experiences, potentially affecting current relevance.

One author reported being funded through a fellowship with the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR). The GP Worklife Survey was funded by the NIHR Policy Research Programme through the Policy Research Unit on Health and Social Care Systems and Commissioning (PRUComm).

HONOLULU — Adding intermittent theta-burst trans-spinal magnetic stimulation to treadmill training is safe and improves gait and other motor symptoms in adults with Parkinson's disease (PD), new research suggested.

In a randomized, double-blind study, patients with PD and gait impairment who underwent 10 sessions of theta burst stimulation followed by treadmill training had significantly greater change in fast gait speed (FGS) than those who received matching sham stimulation plus treadmill training, meeting the primary endpoint.

The active treatment group also showed greater improvement in Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FoG-Q) scores, near falls, and motor experiences of daily living. In addition, there were no significant between-group differences in adverse events (AEs).

The findings were presented here on October 6 at the International Congress of Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders (MDS) 2025.

Co-investigator Larissa Karlla Lopes, University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, told meeting attendees the investigators had sought to examine whether theta burst spinal stimulation “could enhance” the benefit treadmill training provides to gait function.

“Gait disorders are a major cause of disability in Parkinson's, appearing early and worsening over time,” Lopes said. “Management remains challenging, requiring combined therapeutic approaches,” she added.

The researchers assessed 70 adult patients with gait impairments and PD at three research centers in Brazil between October 2022 and May 2024. 

All were randomly assigned to receive either 10 sessions of trans-spinal theta burst stimulation administered over 2 weeks followed by 30 minutes of treadmill training at progressive speeds (n = 34; median age, 62 years; 62% men) or matching sham stimulation (with the coil turned off) plus treadmill training (n = 36; median age, 59 years; 75% men). The active treatment was performed in 20 trains of 20 bursts at 5 Hz with 8-second intervals. 

Follow-up occurred 3, 15, 30, and 90 days after intervention completion. 

Results showed significantly greater change in FGS from baseline to day 3 post-intervention, as measured by the 10-m walk test, for the active treatment group compared to the sham group (P = .001).

Participants also had greater improvement in near falls (P = .004), the MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale II scores (P = .04), and FoG-Q scores (P = .046).

Significant between-group differences were observed on the FoG-Q at day 30 (-2.3; P = .002) and day 90 (-1.75; P = .02) post-intervention, as well as on Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire 39-item mobility scores at day 30 (P = .02). While 29% of the active group reported mild, transient AEs vs 20% in the sham group, the difference was not statistically significant.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, session co-moderator Tatyana Simuni, MD, professor of neurology at Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, cautioned that the study didn't appear to be “ready for prime time” yet.

“The data are interesting, but mechanistically we need to understand why spinal cord stimulation would improve the pathway involved in Parkinson's disease,” said Simuni, who was not involved with the research.

She added that although several of the findings were statistically significant, she would like to know more about the study's clinical meaningfulness.

The investigators and Simuni reported having no relevant financial relationships.

Even in regions with strong healthcare systems, long waiting lists remain a challenge. Some local authorities are exploring ways to use the autonomy granted to them by the Constitution in healthcare to develop alternative solutions. In Tuscany, Italy, a pilot initiative is being launched to shift some of the simpler diagnostic procedures into general practitioners' (GPs') offices. The dual aim is to reduce waiting lists and improve access for patients, particularly older adults and those living far from city centers.

Under this initiative, patients cared for by one of the 269 participating GPs will be able to undergo spirometry; arterial blood gas analysis; ECGs; Holter monitoring; thoracic and abdominal ultrasounds; carotid Doppler imaging; and lab tests, including creatinine and glycated hemoglobin, directly in their GP's office.

The program defines two levels of patient management, depending on the complexity of the test and the GP's individual expertise. Some participating GPs will also perform injections as part of pain management.

At first glance, the initiative appears promising, but uptake among Tuscany's roughly 2000 GPs has been low; only 12% volunteered. In the Northwest region of Tuscany, overseen by the local health authority (Azienda Unità Sanitaria Locale [AUSL] Toscana Nord Ovest), only 24 GPs signed up. Of these, just seven work outside the provincial capitals, where services are most urgently needed, and only one is based in the Apuan Alps.

In the provinces of Arezzo, Siena, and Grosseto (under AUSL Toscana Sud Est, another regional health authority), 64 GPs enrolled, while 179 — about two thirds of all volunteers in the 1-year pilot — are affiliated with AUSL Toscana Centro, which oversees Florence, Pistoia, and Prato.

No public comments were available from the regional president, Eugenio Giani, or the regional health commissioner, Simone Bezzini, regarding the limited GP participation. The agreement includes additional compensation for participating GPs, linked to the number of patients and a minimum number of tests per year, though exact figures were not disclosed. The overall project budget is approximately €2 million, and participating health authorities will provide the necessary equipment if GPs do not own any or prefer not to use their own.

Despite these supports, nearly 9 out of 10 GPs declined participation, raising questions about feasibility. Some may feel inadequately trained to perform these diagnostic tests, while others recognize that adding these responsibilities to their already heavy workload could be unsustainable.

For patients, increased access to diagnostics in the GP's office may also create challenges. If appointments are already difficult to secure, adding ECGs, ultrasounds, and Holter monitoring could further strain time and resources. Efforts to reduce hospital and specialist waiting lists may inadvertently lengthen waits for GP visits and could increase the risk for errors in performing or interpreting tests, as primary care physicians generally have less specialized experience than full-time diagnostic specialists.

Some cautious GPs may still refer borderline cases to specialists, potentially increasing unnecessary testing, which already accounts for up to 30% of the diagnostic workload in Italy's National Health Service.

When these tests are available in GP offices, questions arise: Who will refrain from checking carotid arteries when the procedure is not indicated in asymptomatic patients or those without specific risk factors? Additionally, tying GP compensation to the number of procedures, while reasonable, may inadvertently encourage unnecessary tests that primarily serve to meet targets rather than patient needs.

The agreement signed with Tuscany's unions of GPs may not have been particularly compelling, given the low participation rate. There are also concerns that adding these services could increase bureaucratic demands in interactions with regional health authorities.

“It is important to minimize time spent on administrative tasks and maximize time for clinical and diagnostic work,” Niccolò Biancalani, regional secretary of FIMMG, Tuscany's union of GPs, told Il Tirreno Toscana, a regional newspaper covering Tuscany. “Even today, on average, a GP spends 2-3 hours per day just completing prescriptions.”

How much time remains for GPs to perform additional tests, interpret results, and explain them to patients, beyond consultations, patient discussions, phone calls, and other administrative responsibilities?

Some experts suggest that moving diagnostics into GP offices may be a step ahead of the broader solution offered by community health centers, which are being planned to provide more structured primary care support.

“I believe that opening the community health centers — which will include multiple territorial functional units, along with the new agreement with the regional government providing GPs with secretarial and nursing support — will be a major contribution to increasing participation, even in peripheral areas where uptake has been low,” Biancalani concluded.

The goal, he emphasized, should be to implement these centers as quickly as possible, rather than expecting individual GP offices to fully compensate for the absence of such integrated primary care infrastructure.

The U.S. men's national team's October window gets underway on Friday against South American opponents Ecuador.

Mauricio Pochettino's men will begin their two-match window in Austin, Texas, seeking to carry over their form from September's finale against Japan. Facing off against the second-place finishers in CONMEBOL's World Cup Qualifying cycle won't be easy, but Ecuador will provide a strong test for the Americans. 

Christian Pulisic, Haji Wright, and Alex Zendejas headline the in-form players this window, while Weston McKennie and Antonee Robinson jump back into the mix after some time away. 

Matt Freese will aim to continue locking down the No. 1 goalkeeper spot while Chris Richards and Tim Ream are two players looking set to anchor the backline. 

Absences to Tyler Adams, Sergino Dest, and Josh Sargent, could open the door for others to boost their stocks with only eight months to go until the FIFA World Cup begins. 

With the USMNT seeking a strong outing against Ecuador, here is the starting lineup that we believe should start: 

Who should start: Matt Freese

Matt Freese has done well in his USMNT appearances to date and I see no reason why Pochettino should change things up. Freese's height and range makes him a tough goalkeeper to beat and bearing a major drop in form, I don't see him relinquishing this spot anytime soon.  

Who should start: Alex Freeman, Chris Richards, Tim Ream, Antonee Robinson.

The return of Antonee Robinson gives the USMNT a strong two-way player at left back. 

Robinson is fighting to get back to his full role with Fulham and a strong USMNT window could certainly help there. The veteran full back is a menace in the final third while also providing solid defensive work on the back end. 

Chris Richards and Tim Ream are the USMNT's No. 1-2 options at centerback and I expect those two to be paired up again. Richards has continued to rack up the minutes for Crystal Palace, playing week in and week out in multiple competitions. 

Ream, whose regular season is nearing a close with Charlotte FC, has played ample minutes in Dean Smith's squad. The 38-year-old is showing zero signs of slowing down, despite being in the latter stage of his career.

With no Sergino Dest or Joe Scally, Alex Freeman should get the nod at right back. Freeman has quickly become a rising talent in MLS and could very well compete for the starting right back job next summer. 

A healthy Dest might hurt Freeman's chances, but for now, it's his time to shine. 

Cameron Carter-Vickers, Miles Robinson, and Mark McKenzie are likely to see minutes this window and could two of those three could be paired together against Australia. Max Arfsten may be used to give Robinson some relief, especially if Pochettino is not ready to use him for 90 minutes in either match.

Who should start: Tanner Tessmann, Weston McKennie, Malik Tillman

The absence of Tyler Adams could see a number of different midfielders used this camp. 

However, I think Weston McKennie should get the starting nod in Adams' absence, as he tries to get reacclimatized to the program. McKennie has been in-and-out of the Juventus starting lineup this season, but his presence in the USMNT system is something that shouldn't wary. 

Tanner Tessmann's positive run of form with Lyon has led to his inclusion in camp. Tessmann has been amongst the goals in recent weeks, playing in Ligue 1 and the Europa League. His work rate and range makes him a good option to start against Ecuador, who will be eager to own possession against the U.S. 

Malik Tillman at the No. 10 is Pochettino's best option right now. Tillman has started to pick up steam with the USMNT over the last few months, enjoying a strong showing at the Gold Cup. 

Goal contributions have been a bit tough at Bayer Leverkusen, but Tillman has a long season to get things going in Germany.

Aidan Morris, James Sands, Cristian Roldan, Brenden Aaronson, and Diego Luna should all see time in this match as Pochettino will try and rotate and avoid any injuries. 

Who should start: Alex Zendejas, Haji Wright, Christian Pulisic

The front-three chosen for his XI may be the USMNT players riding the best runs of form at club level. 

Haji Wright leads the EFL Championship with eight goals and isn't showing any signs of slowing down. Wright has helped Coventry City to top of the league table by scoring in a bunch of different ways for Frank Lampard's squad. 

A strong window here could boost his No. 9 hopes majorly.

Christian Pulisic has six goals for AC Milan this fall, helping the Rossoneri enjoy a positive start in both of their active competitions. The USMNT's leading attacking threat closed the September window with a positive performance and should be the first name on Pochettino's lineup card Friday night. 

Alex Zendejas closed the September window in style, which has led to a strong run of form for Club America. Zendejas has scored five goals and added one assist in his last five outings in Liga MX, being a productive player in the final third.

His willingness to try things in the final third makes him a different player at right wing and right now, he's more likely to find the back of the net than Tim Weah. 

Folarin Balogun and Patrick Agyemang could get the nod over Wright, but I'd ride the hot hand right now if I was Pochettino. Agyemang's physicality paired with Balogun's vertical running makes both good options off of the bench, or starting options against Australia. 

What do you think of our projected lineup? Who are you most excited to see play? Are there any doubts you have?

Share your thoughts below.

Stick to the 3-4-2-1.

At this point, in Pochettino we trust!!!!! LET'S GOOOOOOO

Bizzy,

When the USMNT employs a 3-4-3 formation, do they receive a special exemption from FIFA to use 12 starters?  Cue the clown music…

…and then take the time to sign yourself up for a math class and add it to your existing academic curriculum of, “Reading Comprehension Skills.”

Papa Grande, Dude, really?

Master of the Obvious,
He's just mad because of his timeless stupidity and consistent ignorance………..pay him no mind, as that is just the outburst of an ignorant pathetic infant who doesn't know how to express himself. Again, what a way to embarrass yourself…..lol

For the ADULTS in this convo…..lol, this is the line-up I MEANT

The Egyptian national team will play in a World Cup once again, eight years after their last appearance, after sealing their qualification for the 2026 World Cup, which will be held in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, with a dominant 3-0 victory over Djibouti on Wednesday.





It was a commanding win led by Mohamed Salah, the Liverpool superstar and the symbol of the Pharaohs, who was determined not to miss another global tournament after being left out of the Qatar 2022 World Cup.

The Egyptian forward opened the scoring in the 14th minute, finishing with his trademark precision after a through ball from Trezeguet to make it 2-0, effectively sealing the match early on. Salah completed his stellar performance with a second goal in the 84th minute, striking first-time from a long pass by Marwen Ateya to seal the final 3-0 scoreline.

With this victory, Egypt confirms its return to the elite of world football and will take part in the World Cup finals for the fourth time, after previous appearances in Italy 1934, Italy 1990, and Russia 2018, where they failed to advance past the group stage.

Meanwhile, Ghana has yet to secure its spot in the 2026 World Cup, despite strengthening its hold on first place in Group I with a convincing 5-0 win over the Central African Republic. The Ghanaian team, featuring Villarreal midfielder Thomas Partey, who scored one of the goals, also needed a stumble from Madagascar, which ultimately defeated Comoros 2-1.

Mohamed Salah is going back to the World Cup with Egypt next summer.

The Liverpool superstar scored twice in a 3-0 victory over Djibouti on Wednesday to ensure Egypt will top its African qualifying group with one round to spare.

Salah and Egypt went to the 2018 World Cup, but he was affected by a shoulder injury sustained in the Champions League final weeks earlier, when Liverpool lost to Real Madrid.

At that edition, Egypt lost all three of its group games -- against host Russia, Uruguay and Saudi Arabia.

Two goals from Salah and one from Adel make Egypt the third African country after Morocco and Tunisia to book a berth.

Egypt have booked a berth at the FIFA World Cup 2026 with an easy 3-0 win over Djibouti in Casablanca that gave them top place in Group A with one game remaining.

Liverpool star Mohamed Salah scored twice and Ibrahim Adel claimed the other goal for the Pharaohs on Wednesday, as they became the third African country after Morocco and Tunisia to book their place in next year's finals in North America.

Salah has scored nine goals in Egypt's marathon qualifying campaign that began two years ago.

Egypt have competed at three previous World Cups but failed to qualify for the 2022 edition in Qatar, where Morocco had their best run as semifinalists and Tunisia were knocked out in the group stage.

Meanwhile, Thomas Partey was on the scoring sheet as Ghana trounced the Central African Republic 5-0 in Meknes, and they need one point from their final match at home to Comoros to qualify.

Mohammed Salisu, Alexander Djiku, captain Jordan Ayew, and Kamaldeen Sulemana were the other scorers for the Black Stars, who led 1-0 at half-time.

Cape Verde came from two goals behind in Tripoli to draw 3-3 with Libya and edge closer to a first World Cup appearance.

The island nation of about 550,000 inhabitants off the coast of Senegal will clinch first place in Group D if they defeat Eswatini in Praia on Monday.

Known as the Blue Sharks, the Cape Verdeans are two points ahead of Cameroon, who beat Mauritius 2-0 in Saint-Pierre with Manchester United striker Bryan Mbeumo among the goal scorers.

Cape Verde have 20 points after nine rounds, two more than Cameroon, whose eight World Cup appearances are an African record.

Cameroon, firm pre-qualifying favourites to win the group, had to secure maximum points in Mauritius to keep alive their hopes of overtaking Cape Verde, but needed 92 minutes to ensure success. They complete their schedule at home to Angola in Yaounde and must win to have any hope of automatic qualification.

Should Cape Verde finish first, Cameroon would hope to finish among the four best-ranked runners-up and qualify for the playoffs in November.

The winners of the African mini-tournament, comprising single-match semifinals and a final, advance to six-nation inter-continental playoffs next March with two World Cup places up for grabs.

The 2026 tournament will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada from June 11 to July 19.

The Republic of Ireland have been boosted by the fitness of Evan Ferguson and Troy Parrott. 

Fifa World Cup qualifier: Portugal v Republic of Ireland

Venue: Estadio Jose Alvalade, Lisbon Date: Saturday, 11 October Kick-off: 19:45 BST

Coverage: Live text commentary on BBC Sport website

Republic of Ireland assistant head coach John O'Shea says strikers Evan Ferguson and Troy Parrott are both in contention to feature in Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Portugal.

Ferguson was a doubt heading into camp with an ankle injury that meant he was an unused substitute in Roma's Serie A win over Fiorentina last weekend. 

Parrott returned to action for the first time since August after recovering from a knee injury when he came off the bench in AZ Alkmaar's Eredivisie win over Telstar. 

""Evan took part in pretty much all the training today, so really good,"" O'Shea said. 

On Parrott, O'Shea added: ""There's every chance, but you also have to respect the kind of injuries he's had. We look after the player first and foremost and hopefully then we can make that decision closer to kick-off.

""But what we're seeing is very positive. Everything, the strength and the power and the speed that he has is good to see.""

Parrott, 23, was in excellent form before his injury, scoring 10 goals in seven games in the Eredivisie and Uefa Conference League qualifying. 

""Troy has been doing everything right on and off the pitch for the last few years to be the best professional he can,"" added O'Shea. 

""That's led to him possibly getting back that bit quicker from an injury that could have kept him out for longer too.

""It's brilliant to see and obviously he was getting the rewards before the injury too. The type of character he is in the group as well. Anyone that has that kind of attacking talent is going to be very important for us.""

The Republic of Ireland's qualification hopes suffered a major blow with a shock defeat by Armenia in Yerevan last month. 

Heimir Hallgrimsson's side welcome Armenia to Dublin on Tuesday after facing Portugal in Lisbon.

Beijing finalist Linda Noskova is still going strong at the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open, defeating Naomi Osaka in the second round to notch her 10th Top 20 win of 2025 in her first week as a Top 20 player herself.

Despite a grueling breakthrough fortnight at the China Open, Linda Noskova is still going strong in the sweltering conditions of the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open. The 20-year-old Czech took down yet another big name in the second round on Wednesday, outserving No. 11 seed Naomi Osaka 7-6(2), 6-3 in 1 hour and 28 minutes.

Wuhan: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Noskova has barely had a moment to breathe over the past week. On Saturday, she overcame Jessica Pegula from three match points down in the Beijing semifinals to reach her first WTA 1000 final. On Sunday, she lost in three hard-hitting sets to Amanda Anisimova. Two days later, she was back on court for her Wuhan first round, battling late into the evening to hold off Yulia Putintseva in a third-set tiebreak.

Less than 24 hours after that, Noskova powered to her 10th Top 20 win of 2025 over Osaka, in her first week as a Top 20 player (at No. 17) herself. She's now won seven of her last eight matches.

For Noskova, the key to keeping her run going has been finding the balance between building on Beijing and starting afresh.

""I try to be as humble as possible, because every tournament is different,"" she said after defeating Osaka. ""You have to step on a new court almost every single day. So I tried to focus just on this tournament, and leave what happened last week behind.

""But at the same time I want to bring that confidence on court. So I have to take some percentage of it as well.""

The percentage Noskova has retained includes superb serving form. She expected the quality of her delivery to be crucial against fellow big server Osaka, and so it proved: there was just one break of serve in the whole match. It went to Noskova in the penultimate game, allowing her to close out the win with an emphatic hold to 15. She had previously saved all four break points she had faced in the contest.

The serve-dominated dynamic also caused Noskova to note her pride in another area of improvement.

""I'm getting better at tiebreaks, I think,"" she said. ""So it was great to have another one on the board for me.""

The numbers bear out Noskova's feeling. In 2024, she compiled a 12-8 record in tiebreaks. In 2025, she's 14-4 and counting, including two already this week in Wuhan.

She'll have the opportunity to make back-to-back WTA 1000 quarterfinals against another big server in No. 8 seed Elena Rybakina. The Kazakhstani player has won both of their previous meetings, at Roland Garros 2023 and Brisbane 2024, in straight sets.

James Vowles, Team Principal at Williams, is the latest guest on the Beyond The Grid podcast.

With 16 Drivers' and Teams' World Championships combined, Williams are the third most successful team in Formula 1 history – behind Ferrari and McLaren.

But they haven't won a title since 1997, and it has been 13 years since they last took a race victory, so Team Principal James Vowles is on a mission to bring the glory days back to the Grove-based outfit.

In 2025, the team have taken big steps towards success. Carlos Sainz secured the team's first podium in four years when he finished third in Baku, and they have amassed their highest points total since 2016.

Speaking to Beyond The Grid host Tom Clarkson, James reveals what he and Carlos spoke about over dinner before that sensational podium, why that result means so much to the whole team, and the reasons Carlos had endured a frustrating season up to that point.

On the other side of the garage, James shares what he thinks is different about Alex Albon this year and how he has risen to the challenge of having a much more experienced and competitive team mate.

And while Williams have performed better than expected in 2025 with such a strong driver line-up, their main focus is 2026. So what opportunities will the new era of Formula 1 bring them?

Given James' first-hand experience of the intense championship battles between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at Mercedes, what would his approach be if Alex and Carlos are fighting for a title in the coming years?

Spanish is what's got people all worked up.

	Since the NFL announced Bad Bunny as headliner of the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, seemingly every pundit on earth has had some profound opinion.


	In The New York Times, Molly Jong-Fast labeled Bad Bunny an “anti-ICE pop star” in a column titled “The N.F.L. Gets it: Why Don't Democrats?” insinuating that Bad Bunny is the face that can somehow save Democrats from freefall. On the flip side, MAGA mavens piled on the criticism fast and furious, with podcaster Benny Johnson labeling Bad Bunny an “anti-ICE activist” and “massive Trump hater.”


	And, when a major network interviewed me live immediately after the Bad Bunny announcement, I was asked: “Isn't he controversial?” I was genuinely baffled at the question. “No, he's not,” I said in complete truthfulness.

	Bad Bunny hasn't had major scandals of any sort; he has no arrest record; he's never made news for being intoxicated or under the influence; he hasn't had public fights with other celebrities or newsmakers, nor is he known for provocative social media posts or proclamations. He's not given to making polarizing statements or offering political opinions, save for those directly related to his homeland of Puerto Rico, where he lives full-time.


	And while several Latin artists have been openly critical of the United States' current immigration policy, even there, Bad Bunny has tread lightly. His widely quoted comment regarding ICE came at the tail-end of an interview published online by i-D magazine in September, where he was pointedly asked if his decision to not give concerts in the U.S. was out of concern about the mass deportations of Latinos here.


	“There were many reasons why I didn't show up in the US, and none of them were out of hate — I've performed there many times. All of [the shows] have been successful,” he said, noting that Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the US, and “People from the U.S. could come here to see the show.” But, he added, “there was the issue of—like, f–king ICE could be outside [my concert]. And it's something that we were talking about and very concerned about.”

	











	Is that really a controversial statement? The man isn't saying anything against the U.S. or the U.S. government — and hasn't even mentioned President Trump, as many other artists have directly and pointedly done, including rapper Doechii in her recent BET Awards acceptance speech.


	The fact that an artist has different political views from the president shouldn't disqualify them from performing at the Super Bowl. Taylor Swift, after all, was widely speculated to be the Super Bowl performer in 2026 and she has aligned herself with Democratic politics — but it's hard to imagine the same people would be as angry about her Super Bowl set just because of her politics.


	Furthermore, as a Puerto Rican, Bad Bunny is considered a U.S. citizen, can vote in presidential primaries and pays state, local and income taxes (Puerto Ricans can also have representatives at congress meetings, but they cannot vote in general elections). Despite his citizenship, however, Bad Bunny sings only in Spanish and speaks English with a Spanish accent. And that is what has everybody's panties –from the left and from the right — tied up in a knot.


	Spanish is the second-most-spoken language in the world among native speakers, second only to Mandarin. In the U.S., Spanish is the second most spoken language behind English. Approximately 14% of the population — some 45 million people — speak it at home, according to Census data. According to Luminate, Spanish is the second most-listened to language in music, by far, with 24% of American music listeners consuming music in Spanish (French trails in third place at 8%). English is of course the top language in music consumption, by percentage of the total (88.8%), followed by Spanish (8.1%) and Korean in a distant third (0.7%) — and Bad Bunny has been the most-listened-to artist in the world for three of the past five years.


	But, as those of us who speak Spanish daily can attest, many still look down on Spanish as a language, and definitely on the people who speak it. This isn't conjecture nor paranoia; being a Latin immigrant makes for a barrier of entry, and certainly the biggest hurdle I've had to overcome at a personal level. I've been berated for speaking Spanish in the most genteel of environments: the park, the club, the theater. Early in my career, I lost a job as a DJ for a classical music station in Los Angeles, of all places, because a listener called in to say she “couldn't understand” me.  

	











	My U.S.-born children have been sanctioned for speaking Spanish, to themselves, in sports tournaments, in states both to the left and to the right — and I became used to parents talking to me very slowly, as if my slight Spanish accent somehow made me hard of hearing or slow to understand.  Speak with a British, French or Italian accent and you are chic, educated, sharp. Speak with a Spanish accent, and your IQ suddenly dips. 


	So, let's acknowledge that having Bad Bunny headline the Super Bowl is a bold choice — but let's also be real about the reasons.


	While he is not the first Latin artist to perform on that stage – Gloria Estefan, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira have all headlined— those three are known as bilingual, “crossover” acts whose biggest hits came in both English and Spanish. In fact, all three performed bilingual sets.


	But Bad Bunny has never performed in a bilingual format. As an artist who writes his own lyrics, he feels at ease in his native tongue, and belongs to a streaming generation that readily accepts music in other languages — unlike two decades ago, when recording in English was required to reach broader listenership. Singing and performing in Spanish are core to his music and his artistic persona, not because he's making a political or social statement, but simply because that's his language.


	Now, he's been asked to headline the Super Bowl halftime show, and he's accepted — not because he's attempting to make a political statement, but because he's proud to showcase his culture and heritage.

	











	“I'm very happy,” he said in his opening monologue when hosting Saturday Night Live over the weekend. “Especially for all the Latinos and Latinas in the whole world and here in the United States. The people who have worked to open doors. More than my accomplishment, it's an accomplishment of all of us, demonstrating that our mark and our input in this country cannot be thrown out or erased.”


	Take the man at his word. Playing the Super Bowl is an honor. The fact that an artist will do so in a language that has become a global musical unifier is truly the highest form of flattery. Rather than criticize, second-guess or raise hell in either direction, let's just celebrate, kick back and enjoy a show that should be massively entertaining for all viewers — regardless of their native language.

EJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami also sat on the couch with Jimmy Fallon and were presented with a platinum plaque for the hit movie's soundtrack.

	Gil Kaufman



	Tuesday night (Oct. 7) was full of firsts for the real-life singers of the Netflix hit KPop Demon Hunters  No. 1 single “Golden.” Not only did EJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami get to sit on the couch with Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon and talk about the wild ride they've been on since the animated film that was released on June 20 has blown up to become the streamer's most-watched movie of all time, but they also got to perform their signature hit live on TV for the first time.


	Dressed in all black, the trio, who provide the vocals for fictional group HUNTR/X in the film, were introduced by a short animated video before EJAE sang, “I was a ghost, I was alone/ Eoduwojin abgilsog-e/ Given the throne, I didn't know how to believe/ I was the queen that I was meant to be/ I lived two lives, tried to play both sides.” 

	











	Ami then moved to the front and sang about living “two lives” and trying to play “both sides,” as images from the film screened behind them before Nuna stepped up with some soul-sparked vocals about being a “problem child” who got “too wild.” When the soaring chorus came around, all three lined up and busted out the by-now-iconic “Up, up, up” refrain on a futuristic set featuring flashing vertical neon stripes and a digital projection floor.




	The performance came as the soundtrack to the film is slated to return to No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart dated Oct. 11, rolling up its second week atop the tally. “Golden” has spent eight weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, turning the real-life trio into overnight stars thanks to their vocal work in the film about a K-pop supergroup who balance pop stardom with a side gig as demon slayers in which they sing for the roles of Rumi (EJAE), Mira (Nuna) and Zoey (Ami). 


	Before that, the group sat on the couch with Fallon to talk about the “surreal,” “scrumptious,” and “delicious” experience they've had so far, with EJAE laughing that their surprise Saturday Night Live cameo last weekend was “so insane.” Ami added that the “10-year-old in me just came to live being on set” in the sketch they shared with the night's host, 2026 Super Bowl halftime performer Bad Bunny, comparing the experience to being at “theater camp.”


	Fallon then proceeded to blow their minds with some facts and figures about the hit soundtrack, which has been on the Billboard 200 album charts for 15 weeks so far. He also noted that “Golden” has been No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 for eight weeks, is the longest-running No. 1 so far this year on the Global 200 Singles chart, is the first No. 1 female K-pop song in the history of the Hot 100 and that they are the longest-running No. 1 girl group of the century in the Hot 100, besting Destiny's Child.


	All they could do was cover their faces and exhale at the impressive list of accomplishments. Asked what their wildest experiences have been so far, EJAE said that during a trip to South Korea recently she was wearing a mask and a hat and was still recognized by the cabin crew and pilots, who all came by to say hello. During Nuna's trip to Korea, she watched a “cute little grandpa” in a “swagged out” outfit play “Golden” on a traditional Korean instrument in a subway station, a sight she said was the highest possible compliment.

	











	Ami described a shopping trip to H Mart in Los Angeles to get some cup noodles during which she heard a five-year-old boy just belting “Golden” at the top of his lungs, which melted her heart. “It's one thing to hear our song on the radio, but to hear it come out of a child… live… in H Mart?” she said.


	After describing how she instantly came up with the hook after getting the rough “Golden” track from the song's producers while riding in a cab, EJAE told the story of seeing a ghost while recording the song. With volume knob stuck during the session, EJAE called an engineer to help, but then it inexplicably began working again, even though nobody was in the room with her. “For a split second, .3 milliseconds, I saw a tall dude with a flannel,” she said referring to the specter as a “grunge ghost,” and noting that her mom later reminded her of the myth in Korea that if you see a ghost while recording a song it's a guaranteed hit.


	Fallon ended the chat by surprising the trio with the presentation of the platinum plaque for the movie's soundtrack.

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Four-time Academy Award nominee Saoirse Ronan (Brooklyn) has inked a deal to play Linda McCartney, the first wife of The Beatles' Paul McCartney, in Sam Mendes'  The Beatles — A Four-Film Cinematic Event, multiple sources tell Deadline.


	Reps for Sony declined to comment. Ronan joins a cast that includes Paul Mescal as Paul McCartney, Barry Keoghan as Ringo Starr, Joseph Quinn as George Harrison, and Harris Dickinson as John Lennon. With each of the Mendes-directed Beatles films telling the story of a different member of the band, Ronan is expected to feature prominently in the installment centered on McCartney, though it' s unknown to what extent she might appear in the other three.

	











	Linda McCartney was a photographer, musician and animal rights activist who rose to prominence in the 1960s with her portraiture of The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and The Doors. The first female photographer to have her work on the cover of Rolling Stone, she married Paul McCartney in 1969 and worked alongside him as part of his band Wings in his post-Beatles career. A passionate advocate for vegetarianism and animal welfare, she launched her own company, Linda McCartney Foods, in 1991 and passed away from cancer in 1998.




			Watch on Deadline		







	We were first to report on the Beatles films from Mendes, all of which will be released in theaters in April 2028, in a bold experiment in eventizing. Mendes will direct from scripts written by Jez Butterworth, Peter Straughan and Jack Thorne, as we told you first, though it's unclear which projects each is tackling. A collaboration between Sony Pictures Entertainment and Mendes' Neal Street Productions, the films will be produced by Mendes, Pippa Harris and Julie Pastor of Neal Street, as well as Alexandra Derbyshire, in association with Apple Corps for Sony Pictures.


	This marks the first time that The Beatles and Apple Corps Ltd. have authorized the use of the band members'  life stories and music in scripted films. In addition to distributing, Sony Pictures is the financier of these projects.

	











	An Irish actress known for her work in prestige pictures like Brooklyn, Lady Bird and Little Women, Ronan has most recently been seen in Nora Fingscheidt's The Outrun and Steve McQueen's Blitz. Up next, she'll be seen starring in Bad Apples, a dark comedy from filmmaker Jonatan Etzler that's coming off its world premiere at TIFF. As we first reported, she's also set to star opposite Austin Butler in Deep Cuts, a music-themed A24 love story from The Iron Claw's Sean Durkin, adapting the debut novel by Holly Brickley.


	Ronan is represented by CAA.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Paramount Television Studios has signed a first-look deal with Jessica Biel and Michelle Purple's Iron Ocean, the first such pact for Paramount's recently revived television studio. The first project under the agreement is spy thriller The Ambler Warning, based on Robert Ludlum's bestseller, with Biel set to star and executive produce.


	Jason Horwitch (Echo 3, Fight Night) is attached to write the adaptation and serve as showrunner on the The Ambler Warning, which reimagines the book's male protagonist Hal Ambler as Erica Ambler, played by Biel. While on assignment, CIA Case Officer Erica Ambler (Biel) suffers a devastating injury, waking up without her memories in custody at a supermax prison for the world's deadliest spies. Erica must figure out who she is and who she can trust, while piecing together the clues that will prevent a lethal attack on American soil.

	Horwitch will executive produce alongside Biel and Purple for Iron Ocean and Ben Smith and Jeffrey Weiner for Captivate Entertainment (the Jason Bourne series). The Ambler Warning will be produced by Paramount TV Studios, Iron Ocean and Captivate Entertainment.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Biel and Purple were originally in talks with Skydance Television for The Ambler Warning and a first-look deal. Following Skydance's August acquisition of Paramount Global, the conversations migrated to Paramount TV Studios, the new streaming-focused studio comprised of Skydance Television and Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios. It is run by former Skydance TV President Matt Thunell.

	











	“We are so excited to be partnering with Matt Thunell and the team over at Paramount Television Studios. We have been long time fans of Skydance, which is where our conversations with Matt first started, and now to be bringing that deal to our previous home at Paramount Television Studios feels full circle,” Biel and Purple in a joint statement. “We can't wait to get started creating content with a team that is as passionate about Iron Ocean's mission as we are. Ambler Warning is just the beginning.”


	Biel and Purple's Iron Ocean, launched by the duo in 2007 with a mission to amplify female voices, had two back-to-back first-look deals at the previous incarnation of Paramount TV Studios, which was shut down in 2024. The remainder of their second pact finished up at CBS Studios, which at the time absorbed PtvS' slate, with a 7th Heaven reboot stemming from the deal still in development there.


	Iron Ocean's series credits include USA Network's The Sinner, Hulu's Candy, and Prime Video's recent hit thriller The Better Sister — all of them starring Biel — as well as Facebook Watch's Limetown and Freeform's Cruel Summer, which is eying a revival with a third installment in development.


	“I have always admired the incomparable Jessica Biel and Michelle Purple, and the high-quality, audience-pleasing series they make” said Thunell, President of Paramount TV Studios. “We are thrilled to welcome Iron Ocean to Paramount Television Studios and launch our partnership with Ambler Warning as the first project.”


	Paramount TV Studios' blended slate includes such series as Landman, Tulsa King, Lioness, The Agency, MobLand, Mayor of Kingstown and School Spirits for Paramount+; Dexter: Resurrection for Showtime; Reacher, Cross, and The Runarounds for Prime Video; Foundation for Apple TV+; Emily in Paris and XO, Kitty for Netflix; and The Road for CBS.


The Amber Warning was an incomplete manuscript at the time of Ludlum's 2001 death. His estate brought in an author and an editor to finish it, and the sky thriller novel was published by St. Martin's Press in 2005.


	The deal for The Amber Warning follows the big bidding war this past summer for Ludlum's  ‘Jason Bourne' And ‘Treadstone' book series, which was won by NBCUniversal. Captivate Entertainment and the Robert Ludlum Estate are repped by WME.


	Biel earned an Emmy nomination for her starring role in Season 1 of The Sinner anthology series. Outside of scripted series, Iron Ocean has produced the film The Book of Love, starring Biel, Jason Sudeikis and Maisie Williams, and Investigative Discovery's Fatal Destination true-crime docuseries. Biel next stars opposite John Cena in Sam Hargrave's action-adventure Matchbox from Apple Original Films, Skydance, and Mattel Films. She and Iron Ocean are repped by UTA, LBI Entertainment and The Lede Company. Biel is also repped by Yorn Levine Barnes. 


	Horwitch recently served as executive producer and showrunner on the Peacock limited series Fight Night: The Million Dollar Heist. He also executive produced Apple TV+'s Echo 3 and was executive producer/showrunner on Epix's Berlin Station. He is repped by WME and Manage-ment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Zach Bryan distances himself from ""both sides of the aisle"" after right-wing backlash","https://www.avclub.com/zach-bryan-bad-news-backlash-response-both-sides","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:34:00 GMT","

Zach Bryan is clarifying his intentions with his song “Bad News,” a snippet of which he posted to Instagram last week. Though the lyrics he shared appeared to be anti-ICE and lamented the “fading of the red white and blue,” Bryan distanced himself from any “side” of the political debate. (Remember “Rich Men North Of Richmond“?) He, himself, is on “neither of these radical sides,” the country singer promised.

In the statement shared to his Instagram Story (via Deadline), Bryan explained that he had written the song months ago and even shared a snippet online months ago, presumably to deny having shared the latest snippet in response to any one particular current event. He doesn't seem to want his song swept up in any “divisive” narrative (though surely he realized name-dropping ICE was going to cause a stir). “This song is about how much I love this country and everyone in it more than anything. When you hear the rest of the song, you will understand the full context that hits on both sides of the aisle. Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back,” the Navy veteran wrote. “I served this country, I love this country, and the song itself is about all of us coming out of this divided space. I wasn't speaking as a politician or some greater-than-thou asshole, just a 29-year-old man who is just as confused as everyone else.”

The response to the brief snippet “makes me not only embarrassed but kind of scared,” Bryan admitted. “Left wing or right wing we're all one bird and American. To be clear I'm on neither of these radical sides. To all those disappointed in me on either side of whatever you believe in just know I'm trying my best too and we all say things that are misconstrued sometimes. Everyone have a great day and I love each and every one of ya!!!”

The “Bad News” snippet caused a stir with MAGA-affiliated fans, the Department of Homeland Security, and even the White House. In a statement to Newsweek littered with references to the artist's music (we'll say it again, it's fan behavior), a White House spokesperson said, “While Zach Bryan wants to Open the Gates to criminal illegal aliens and has Condemned heroic ICE officers, Something in the Orange tells me a majority of Americans disagree with him and support President Trump's great American Revival. Godspeed, Zach!”

The controversy comes after a summer of Bryan making headlines for beefing with other country artists. In a follow-up post to his statement, the singer-songwriter admitted the heightened scrutiny has been difficult, “and it's so hard to see where my bearings even are anymore,” he wrote. “I am SO proud to have served in a country where we can all speak freely and converse amongst each other without getting doxxed or accosted on the internet or worse; the violence and heartbreak we've faced in the last few months!” he concluded. “God speed ol sons I'm out.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","It's always (mostly) sunny at UNEC: How Undeclared started a new chapter for Freaks And Geeks crew","https://www.avclub.com/undeclared-one-season-wonders-weirdos-and-wannabes-fox-tv-2001","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:00:00 GMT","

How do you follow up something perfect? It's a very enviable and—one would assume—daunting question. And it was faced, in the late '90s, by a few people who could be loosely be defined as working in the loosely defined realm of popular culture: directors like Wes Anderson, who would answer that query by widening his scope (and budget, color palette, ensemble, and number of carefully-constructed establishing shots and costumes); bands like Wilco, who would make the ambitious masterpiece that made their career, albeit one that ironically also got them dropped by their label for not being, to their ears, marketable; artists like Cat Power's Chan Marshal, who would release one of the best covers after one the best two-chord songs ever; and writers like Kenneth Lonergan, who would use the Off-Broadway buzz he got from This Is Our Youth to make a remarkable debut film. 

Now, a TV show, obviously, is different and less personal-stampy than an album or a movie (or a book or what-have-you, to quote The Big Lebowski). But if there was one perfect series from this time—and one that had started and ended all too quickly and thus felt fully formed and consistently “complete”—it would have to be Freaks And Geeks, a beautifully bookended, “this-is-mine“-worthy obsession in a medium that, just by its nature (so many episodes, tight schedules, voices in the room, years over its run), doesn't—can't—have a lot of those. It was also incredibly real and hilariously and often painfully relatable. As The A.V. Club‘s Danette Chavez put in her One-Season Wonders on the 1999 NBC show: “Freaks And Geeks was a beacon to anyone whose high-school experience was awkward, boring, humbling, or painful—basically, anything other than the sexy and stylish depictions that had dominated teen-centered movies and shows.” 

In the case of Freaks And Geeks, and in particular, its executive producer and co-writer and -director, Judd Apatow, the answer to that question above—how do you follow up something perfect?—brought up another very obvious question. “And so when Undeclared started, when I was trying to find a way to get Amy [Poehler] involved,” explained Apatow in 2011 at the Paley Center For Media in Beverly Hills during a reunion of the show's cast, “and I wanted to try retain as much of Freaks And Geeks as I could, I thought: Well, how old would they be next?” And thus a series, which you would not be wrong describing in a boiled-down-to-the-basics, caveman-uttered sort of way as “Freaks And Geeks but college but sitcom,” was born. 

﻿

And you really can't talk about Undeclared, which kicked off its one and only season on Fox in September 2001, without talking about Freaks, if only because they share so much DNA. Geeks creator Paul Feig helmed the show's fantastic second episode, “Oh, So You Have A Boyfriend?” (a half hour that, interestingly, had two versions—an initial one titled “Full Bluntal Nugety” had a whole lot more Ted Nugent—and involved reshoots, which you can read about in Erik Adams' recaps); Seth Rogen, who was hired at just 18 years old, wrote for the show and starred as a main character; and director Jake Kasdan, who directed the most episodes of Freaks, also returned. In front of the camera, there were a ton of familiar faces, including Freaks And Geeks titular players such as Jason Segel, Busy Philipps, Martin Starr, and Samm Levine (very amusing as the frat president Books here), as well as Natasha Melnick, Steve Bannos, David Krumholtz, and Mark Allan Staubach (who played Sam's dream-girl cheerleader Cindy Sanders, a stressed-out math teacher, Neal's brother who's enjoying college far more than high school, and that “Yeah, Ken, smash me a piece of that!” pot dealer, respectively) and drop-ins like Mike White (who was also a writer on Freaks).  

Unlike its spiritual predecessor, Undeclared is not a perfect show. It is, however, a great and very funny one—under or outside of the shadow of that cult darling that came before it—with a confident and reliable comedic rhythm that's easy to both get sucked into and casually enjoy, like you're lounging on that futon and sipping a can of Hamm's while chuckling along to a story in your friend's dorm room. But that is one tough act to follow, and it feels almost unfair to compare the two. Apatow's series didn't exactly conjure critical hosannas that it was “tender [and] achingly real,” to lift a pull quote from the back of Freaks‘ Shout! Factory DVD set—nor did it, from the outside, seem to aspire to. In his review of Undeclared: The Complete Series for The A.V.Club, Scott Tobias accurately summed it up as, comparatively, “a more easily digestible comedy about campus life.” This one doesn't make you cry like, say, when Sam (John Francis Daley), after learning that his friend's dad is cheating, hugs his own father (played by the late, great Joe Flaherty). That doesn't mean it's not moving or doesn't touch on pain, and you may just well up just a bit when an insane diva of a boyfriend and his college-freshman girlfriend break up (a scene that, for some reason, hit harder during the rewatch for this piece).  

But Undeclared is definitely both literally and figuratively sunnier than Freaks, moving from the Michigan suburbs in the early '80s to the “University Of Northeastern California” in modern times, with the occasional palm tree and steady sunshine that comes with filming parts of a TV show at UCLA. And it follows, essentially, two groups of newly arrived freshmen/roommates who go through classic college rites of passage. There's Steven (Jay Baruchel, who, like Sam in Geeks, looks refreshingly and accurately quite young and acts, at first, accordingly awkward), a former high-school nerd and our POV character who is trying to reinvent himself as a cool, confident guy in college (and whose idea of flirting is, relatably, asking “Do you know this guy was in Election?” on what he thinks is a date); Lloyd (Charlie Hunnam, current star of Monster: The Ed Gein Story), a handsome British theater major who is actually a cool, confident guy (and who everyone wants to sleep with); Ron (Rogen), a bespectacled, overanalyzing smartass of a business major and Maxim magazine enthusiast; and the goofy Marshall (Timm Sharp), who is studying music unbeknownst to his parents, loves Beck, and (at least for this writer, who was also a college freshman in the fall of 2001) is the most reminiscent of dorm guys—or at least the ones you'd want to be around—of this time. And down the hall, there's Lizzie (Carla Gallo), Steven's love interest who's girly and has that aforementioned crazy and clingy boyfriend; and Rachel (Monica Keena), Marshall's kinda-but-not-really secret crush who is introduced as prone to panic attacks in the pilot but quickly becomes the saner and more independent voice of reason of the pair. (Later in the season, the new roommates are joined by a third, Christina Payano's upbeat Tina, who is really into the song “How Bizarre.”) 



If that setup sounds male-centric, it is. As Gallo pointed out in that reunion, the show had only two female writers: Jenni Konner (who would go on to co-showrun the twentysomething, post-college series Girls, which was executive-produced by Apatow) and Alexandra Rushfield (who would collaborate with Apatow again as a scribe on the thirtysomething, more-into-the-real-world show Love). And the women's storylines here—on the freshman 15, a bad dye job, ladies' night, and the fight that erupts from replaying that 1996 OMC hit—often don't have the gravity, perspective, or lived-in verisimilitude of those of their fellow co-eds on the floor, although there is a funny bit in which Rachel's overstrict mother discovers a stuffed animal filled with her daughter's condoms, smokes, and booze. Sure, it “ain't the same fuckin' ballpark” as 2003's Old School, in which the only female-focused storyline that springs to mind is a blowjob class, but it's worth noting—as is, come to think of it, that Adam Sandler (playing himself) sleeps with Lizzie. 

Of this main freshmen cast, the MVP goes to Sharp, who has an affable everydude vibe and is quite funny whenever Marshall is into the spotlight—by playing his awful Beck-esque song to a crowd, buying a pet bird as a fashion accessory in the midst of a bender, or getting death's-door sick just so he can spend time with holistic-medicine proponent Rachel. (At the Paley Center, Rogen said that he “is actually the reason Danny McBride is an actor,” as the future star took over Sharp's role in David Gordon Green's open-hearted indie All The Real Girls “at the last second” because of his part in Undeclared.) But one of the big and constantly enjoyable strengths of this sitcom is its incredibly stacked cast for characters outside that main crew: Segel, for this staffer's money, has never been as laugh-out-loud funnier as he is here as a Lizzie's rage-prone, oft-screaming older BF and copy-shop employee, Eric; Poehler, who also made her SNL debut in September 2001 (and hosts this weekend's edition), brings a manic energy, lighting up each scene she's in as an unstable head RA; Loudon Wainwright is hilarious as Steven's boundary-less father, who announces that his wife separated with him on his son's first day of college—and proceeds to play drinking games with his roommates and pass out; and the great Kevin Rankin plays Lucien, the childlike, sweet, and oblivious floor RA with a lisp. There are some very fun guest stars, too (Will Ferrell's speed-freak townie, Fred Willard's reenergized veteran professor, Kevin Hart's religious student), but the best of the bunch is Ben Stiller as a longhaired ex-addict and former stepfather of Eric. 

﻿

But those guest spots don't work without a solid base, and this group of tossed-together teens has the necessary comfortable chemistry, as seen in this bit from “Truth Or Dare” (an episode written by Rogen and directed by Superbad‘s Greg Mottola), wherein the guys write a literal script and perform it in order to coax the girls into the titular game:   

Marshall: Whoa, wait, what was that?


Lloyd: Oh, nothing.


Marshall: No, I saw that. You just told a secret.


Steven: Yeah, I saw that too. [Whispers] Perry.  

Perry (Jarrett Grode, with some characteristically wonderful dry delivery): Yes, I saw that as well.  

Marshall: What was the secret? 

Lizzie: What did you say? 

Lloyd: I didn't say anything. 

Marshall: Ron, what did he say? 

Ron: I can't.  

Marshall: How dare you not tell me.  

Steven: The truth is, you really should tell.  

Ron: Well, the truth of the matter is, Steven, that I cannot dare tell. 

Good stuff. Unfortunately, just like Freaks And Geeks, this series was relegated to weird timeslots and released inconsistently and out of order. “We were really trying to figure out: How funny can we make one of these half hours?” recalled Apatow in 2011. “It was really weird to do a single-camera comedy, so [network executives] would say, ‘Where are we gonna put it on the schedule? There's no other [show] like it on TV—it feels weird against a sitcom.'” And just like Freaks, it was canceled for low ratings. 

Three years later, Apatow took the same stage in Beverly Hills, this time to receive the 2014 PaleyFest Icon Award. “Everything I've done, in a way, is revenge for the people who canceled Freaks And Geeks,” he remarked. “It's really demented, but it's just like ‘you were wrong about that person and that person and that person—and that writer and that director.' And I really should get over that.” Possibly. But if that spite led to a show this delightful—not to mention had a hand in an industry-changing R-rated-comedy boom, some of which was pretty great—then there's a solid case to be made that those bad impulses did some good.     

One-season wonder, weirdo, or wannabe? Wonder.

On Tuesday, October 7, viewers who tuned into the FOX series “Murder in a Small Town” watched the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner in his final performance before his death. The beloved actor, who was best known to many as Theo Huxtable on “The Cosby Show,” passed away in July after getting caught in an ocean current. 

After his death, showrunner Ian Weir commented on his excitement about working with him. “We were really delighted when Malcolm agreed to join us as a guest star — and completely thrilled by the experience of working with him,” he told People. “He was such a leader and a gentleman. It's such a terrible, tragic loss.”

At the end of the episode is a touching message: “Dedicated to the memory of Malcolm-Jamal Warner.”

The episode is titled “Mother Love,” and is the third episode of Season 2. Warner plays a father named Richard Bannister, who is fiercely protective of his teen daughter. Shortly after his ex-wife comes into town after a five-year absence, she's found murdered. Bannister ends up as the primary suspect. Many other characters and subplots were unfolding during the episode, but Warner made it feel like he was in a starring role.

“He was so dynamic in the role,” producer Kim Roberts told TV Insider. “It was actually not meant to be a huge role, and he found a way of bringing that character to life beyond any of our expectations. And he had to walk a really fine line between protecting his daughter and making sure that she wasn't going to be further traumatized and being sympathetic.”

“And I think he did an amazing job at doing both — that is, that we really cared for him and understood the dilemma, while at the same time… [he was] someone who was definitely a suspect in the murder,” Roberts continued. “So we were thrilled to have him, and he was such a joy to work with as well.” 

I think he really touched all of the crew, just because he is genuinely the person that you see, like he's just so — was, unfortunately — just so full of life, so full of goodness, and said really, really positive things to everyone, and it's very sad,” co-producer, Tina Pehme added. “We're very lucky to have had him.”

While Warner was known for giving his all to his performances, he also gave everything to friends and family. After his passing, many people, both expected and unexpected, came forward to talk about how he had changed them. His publicist, Jordyn Palos, claimed that he was responsible for her career. Others, like Anthony Mackie, Viola Davis, and Keshia Knight Pulliam shared the impact he had on their lives.

Warner is survived by his wife, Tenisha, and daughter. He had protectively kept both out of the spotlight, but Tenisha broke her silence on Instagram two months after his death.

“Tomorrow marks our anniversary —and my heart is wide open,” she wrote.

“For the first time,I'm sharing a glimpse of the love that began it all.”

“I can still hear my husband's laugh,still feel the way he made room for every part of me —every tear, every dream.”

When director Joachim Rønning came on board “Tron: Ares,” the third film in the Disney sci-fi series that began in 1982 with “Tron,” he knew there was one set piece that absolutely had to deliver. 

“The first thing I think about, and that I think a lot of the fans think about, when it comes to ‘Tron' is the light cycle,” Rønning told IndieWire, referring to the sleek computer-generated vehicles that race through the electronic grid in which much of “Tron” takes place. “I've been in love with them since the first movie.”

The light cycle vehicles are at the center of spectacular set pieces in both the original “Tron” and its 2010 sequel, Joseph Kosinski's “Tron: Legacy,” both of which were cinematic touchstones for Ronning. “It's probably my favorite scene in the first movie, and also in ‘Tron: Legacy,'” Rønning said. “I think Kosinski created such an amazing action sequence. So I worked hard to take it to the next level.”

The “next level” was baked into the premise of “Tron: Ares,” in which the “programs” — avatars for the humans who created them — get out of the computer and onto the streets. In the previous “Tron” films, the high-tech action was limited to grids that existed inside computers, where everything but the programs (played by human actors like Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner) was electronic.

 










In “Tron: Ares,” Jared Leto's title character finds himself driving a light cycle through Vancouver amid real cars and buildings, which created a new challenge for the filmmakers but provided the perfect way to present a light cycle chase in a new way. Rønning was determined to do as much practically as possible, which meant building a real light cycle.

“The light cycles still needed help from [effects house] Industrial Light and Magic, but I was able to build real assets so that I could put my cameras on them,” Rønning said. “We shot for six weeks of nights for a 15-minute sequence, and it was logistically very hard to do because we had to shut down 10 blocks at a time.”

Shooting real vehicles on real city streets had the advantage of providing Ronning with inspiration just by taking cues from his environment. “ I remember I wanted to have a break in the middle of the sequence where it all goes quiet and we're building suspense,” Rønning said. “I was walking all over Vancouver trying to come up with an idea for how to do it, looking for a location that could inspire me. I found this old parking garage with a spiral driving ramp, and I just designed it out of that, making it a little homage to ‘Terminator 2' and the T-1000.

Even scenes that one might think were entirely computer-generated were done practically, thanks to some ingenious solutions engineered by Rønning's special effects department. The light cycles leave trails of light behind them that can block or slice other vehicles, and at one point, Ares' cycle drives right down the middle of a cop car, cutting it in half. According to Rønning, this was all done in-camera by building police cars that were pre-cut in half, then stitched back together.

 










“It's being pulled by a truck on a 100-yard wire to get up to speed, and it's remote-controlled,” Rønning said. “At a certain point, charges in the middle of the car blow and split the car in half, and then Industrial Light and Magic comes in and creates the light wall going through it.” 

Ultimately, Rønning said that the scariest part of the whole process was that the production was so well-resourced that he had no excuse not to make a great set piece.

“When you do these big movies, you have amazing support and some of the best actors in the world,” he said. “You have the best crews in the world. You have Industrial Light and Magic. So the daunting aspect is thinking that it all comes down to me to fill these big shoes of the first two films. As a fan of the franchise, I put a lot of pressure on myself, and on everyone around me. I think I lost 20 pounds during those six weeks [of shooting the light cycle sequence]. But hopefully the audience can feel the hard work.”

Disney opens “Tron: Ares” in theaters on Friday, October 10.

Rush fans still recovering from the shock of learning that the band will be back on the road next year for the first time since the death of drummer and lyricist Neil Peart may have to adjust their 2026 plans once again: Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson announced today that they're doubling the length of their Fifty Something Tour in the face of “incredible demand,” adding 11 shows.The expansion adds two shows each in Los Angeles, Fort Worth, Chicago, New York, and Toronto, plus one additional date in Cleveland. Mexico City remains a single show. The five major U.S. and Canadian markets now get four shows apiece, while Cleveland gets two. The tour marks Lee and Lifeson's first full shows together since winding down Rush's last tour in 2015, and it will feature German virtuoso Anika Nilles taking over on drums. Each “evening with” performance will include two sets drawn from a pool of 35 songs.


	At the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame event where Rush announced the tour, Lee revealed the turning point came from casual jam sessions. “We were laughing so hard, and we were enjoying it so much, and it was almost like playing those songs dispelled the dark clouds,” he said.

	Lifeson said he found himself reenergized by the complex material. “To be challenged with that again was really, really exciting,” he told the Cleveland crowd. “And the more we started rehearsing and playing, the more I just fell in love with the idea of playing again.”

	











	The tour launches June 7, 2026, at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles — the same venue where Rush played their final show with Peart on Aug. 1, 2015. Artist presales will begin Monday, with general on-sale starting Oct. 17.

BURRILLVILLE – A movement is underway to save the Conjuring House, which is scheduled to be auctioned on Halloween, including a GoFundMe for people who want to help buy the paranormal attraction.

The movement started with Andrea Perron, who lived in the Round Top Road house as a teenager in the 1970s and wrote about her family's experiences with spirits haunting the centuries-old farmhouse.

Some humans may be part alien - after having extraterrestrial genes ‘inserted' during abductions, scientists claim.

The bombshell follows a study which analysed DNA from ordinary people and folk who claim to have been snatched by ET.

Researchers probed 581 families from the 1,000 Genomes Project discovering ‘large sequences' of DNA in 11 that did not appear to match either parent.

The aberrations involved a bundle of 348 non-parental genetic variants.

As the subjects were born before 1990 the findings could not be down to the effects of gene-editing technology like CRISPR which only emerged in 2013 and can be used to inactivate, edit, or insert material to cure diseases and improve agriculture.

Researchers also analysed results from individuals who self-identified as alien abductees and discovered some showed evidence of non-parental markers.

Lead researcher Dr Max Rempel, founder and chief executive officer of the DNA Resonance Research Foundation, said: “Humanity may be undergoing genetic transformation.”

The fallout could have affected millions of people worldwide.

If the evidence is confirmed Rempel said ‘it could be possible to detect which humans carry alien DNA - essentially identifying hybrids'.

That could suggest that aliens are walking among humans after camouflaging their genes - like the plot of 1978 horror movie Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.

Rempel speculated a portion of folk with autism, ADHD, Asperger's and other neurodivergent traits could contain these alien insertions.

He suggested extraterrestrial genetic modifications could bestow humans with unusual abilities like telepathy - like Ellen Ripley's psychic abilities in the sci-fi movie sequel Alien: Resurrection.

Rempel, who holds a PHD from the Institute of Gene Biology in Moscow, Russia, accepted there was ‘no conclusive evidence yet' as scientists ‘need better datasets which are available only on approval'.

“That takes time and effort,” he said.

He now hopes to use next-generation sequencing - which can pick up novel variants at a higher resolution - to pinpoint where aliens infiltrated the DNA strand.

“We need to consider how much alien hybridization is healthy for the planet and which alien races we might give priority,” he added.

The researcher's hypothesis appears to support fringe theories shared by UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists who suggest alien-human hybrids exist.

The Nazca Mummies found in Peru purportedly contain both human and alien DNA though some insist they are elaborate hoaxes.

Both NASA and the US Pentagon have declared there is no evidence of alien life on Earth.

Nigel Watson, author of Portraits of Alien Encounters Revisited, urged caution, warning technical errors or unknown biological mechanisms could also explain the anomalies.

He said: “Alien abduction experiences can stem from a variety of terrestrial factors.

“We need to carefully verify these accounts before drawing conclusions about DNA.”

But he added: “If proven, this would be as world-shattering as recovering a flying saucer.”

Jonathan Rinderknecht allegedly started blaze that destroyed over 6,800 structures in California

A 29-year-old man has been arrested and charged with igniting the fire that days later became the devastating Palisades blaze, which killed 12 people and destroyed more than 6,800 structures in one of the most destructive wildfires in Los Angeles history.

Jonathan Rinderknecht was arrested near his Florida residence on federal charges of destruction of property by means of fire, acting US attorney for the central district of California, Bill Essayli, announced on Wednesday. No motive was presented.

The investigators allege Rinderknecht maliciously started what became the Lachman fire, shortly after midnight on New Year's Day in the Pacific Palisades. That fire smoldered underground for nearly a week before resurfacing on 7 January amid heavy winds, spreading rapidly to become the Palisades fire, investigators say.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) said a wide-ranging investigation it conducted in past months raked in more than 13,000 items of evidence, and included hundreds of interviews – some overseas – and more than 200 leads. Investigators also documented more than 300 ATF reports, including a 200-page report detailing the origin and cause of the investigation.

According to Essayli, Rinderknecht, who was a Palisades resident before relocating to Florida, had been working as an Uber driver on New Year's Eve and returned to the Pacific Palisades after his evening shift. Two passengers told law enforcement he appeared “agitated and angry” that night, Essayli said.

After dropping off a passenger, according to the investigators, Rinderknecht parked his car and walked up a nearby trail, taking iPhone videos at a hilltop location while listening to a rap song whose music video included objects being set alight. He had reportedly listened to the song and watched its video repeatedly in the days before the fire.

Law enforcement officials identified and interviewed Rinderknecht on 24 January. During questioning, he allegedly lied about his location when he first saw the fire, claiming he was near the bottom of a hiking trail. However, geolocation data from his 911 call showed he was standing above the fire in a clearing merely 30ft from the blaze as it rapidly grew, prosecutors said.

Among the digital evidence collected was an image Rinderknecht had generated on ChatGPT months before the fire, depicting what Essayli described as “a dystopian painting showing in part a burning forest and a crowd fleeing from it”.

The Palisades fire was one of several major blazes that encircled Los Angeles in early January. The blaze destroyed more than 6,800 structures, including homes and businesses, and damaged over 1,000 more buildings. A fire that broke out the same day in nearby Altadena killed nearly 20 people. Investigators have not yet determined the cause of that fire.

Rinderknecht faces a mandatory minimum five-year federal prison sentence if convicted, with a maximum penalty of up to 20 years. He was scheduled to make his initial appearance on Wednesday afternoon in federal court in Orlando, Florida.

“While we cannot undo the damage and destruction that was done, we hope his arrest and the charges against him bring some measure of justice to the victims of this horrific tragedy,” Essayli said.

In a statement, California governor Gavin Newsom thanked investigators for “confirming the indisputable facts on the ground”.

“Today's arrest of 29-year-old Florida resident Jonathan Rinderknecht marks an important step toward uncovering how the horrific Palisades fire began and bringing closure to the thousands of Californians whose lives were upended,” he said.

An outside review of Los Angeles county's response to the blazes released last month found that critical staffing shortages, including at sheriff's department and the office of emergency management, contributed to the emergency. The report also concluded that outdated policies for sending emergency alerts led to delays in warning residents about the need to evacuate as flames began consuming neighborhoods in Altadena and the Pacific Palisades. In addition, the report noted, information sharing between emergency responders was hampered by unreliable cellular connectivity, inconsistent field reporting methods, and the use of different communicating platforms.

The report was produced by the consulting firm McChrystal Group and was commissioned by county supervisors.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Israeli and Hamas officials are set to hold talks at the Red Sea city of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.The Associated Press

The most promising effort yet to end the war in Gaza was bolstered as senior figures from Israel and the United States joined the negotiations on Wednesday after Hamas handed over its lists of hostages and Palestinian prisoners to be freed in a swap. 

With U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point plan appearing closer than any previous bid to halt the war, delegations were upgrading their presence at the indirect talks, launched on Monday in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. 

Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff and Israeli Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a close confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, arrived and began participation in the talks, Israeli and Palestinian sources said.

Also joining the discussions was the prime minister of longstanding mediator Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, according to Egyptian sources.

Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including ceasefire talks, famine and the Israeli ground offensive.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the mediated negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas had made “a lot of headway” and that a ceasefire would be declared if they reached a positive outcome. Trump also expressed optimism about progress toward a deal on Tuesday, and European, Arab and other states will meet in Paris on Thursday to discuss Gaza's post-war transition, with Washington likely to be represented, diplomatic sources said. 

But crucial details are yet to be spelled out, including the timing, a post-war administration for the Gaza Strip and the fate of Hamas. Gaza authorities say more than 67,000 people have been killed and much of the enclave has been flattened since Israel began its military response to the Hamas attack two years ago. Around 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage back to Gaza, according to Israeli officials, with 20 of the 48 hostages still held believed to be alive.

Hamas said it had handed over its lists of hostages and Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged in a swap, and was optimistic about the talks so far.

The list of Palestinians Hamas wants freed is expected to include some of the most prominent prisoners ever jailed by Israel, whose release had been off limits in previous ceasefires.

Hamas said on Tuesday it wants to reach a deal to end the war in Gaza based on a plan proposed by U.S President Donald Trump, but it still has a set of demands.

Reuters

According to a Palestinian source close to the talks, the list includes Marwan al-Barghouti, a leader of the Fatah movement, and Ahmed Saadat, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Both are serving multiple life sentences for involvement in attacks that killed Israelis.

Hamas says the indirect negotiations were focused so far on three issues: halting the conflict, withdrawing Israeli forces from Gaza and the swap deal.

Across Canada, Oct. 7 anniversary marked by mourning and protest

The group has so far refused to discuss Israel's demand that Hamas give up its arms, which the Palestinian source said Hamas would reject as long as Israeli troops occupy Palestinian land.

Two sources familiar with the talks confirmed that sticking points included the mechanism for the Israeli withdrawal, with Hamas seeking a clear timeline linked to the release of hostages and guarantees of a complete withdrawal by Israeli forces.

Within Gaza, Israel has dialled down its military campaign at Trump's behest, but it has not halted strikes altogether. The Israeli military said its forces had killed several militants in Gaza City, Gaza's main urban hub, who it said were on their way to attack Israeli soldiers. Gaza medical authorities reported eight people killed in Israeli strikes in the last 24 hours, the lowest toll for weeks. Daily death tolls had been around 10 times as high over the past month as Israeli forces advance on Gaza City.

“We hope from God that a ceasefire would take place as soon as possible, because people can't bear the suffering anymore,” said Jehad al-Shagnobi, whose house was destroyed in the Sabra district of Gaza City. Another participant in the talks was Turkish spymaster Ibrahim Kalin, Egyptian sources said. This pointed to a growing role for Turkey, a NATO member with close contacts with Hamas. President Tayyip Erdogan said Trump had asked Turkey to help persuade Hamas to accept the deal.

Opinion: An Israel-Hamas deal makes sense for both sides – but huge obstacles remain

Trump's plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza's post-war administration. Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen.

There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007.

Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries. It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza.

Global outrage has mounted against Israel's assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a U.N. inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel calls its actions self-defence after the 2023 Hamas attack.

It's been two years since Hamas-led militants stormed into Israel, plunging the region into war. Here are the key statistics from the conflict.

Can a veggie schnitzel legally be called a schnitzel even if it contains no meat? Some have argued such names are confusing consumers. The European Parliament seems to agree.

The European Parliament has voted in favor of banning words like ""burger"" and ""sausage"" to market their plant-based counterparts. 

The decision comes on the back of a proposal from members of the center-right European People's Party (EPP).

""A steak is made of meat — full stop. Using these names only for real meat keeps labels honest, protects farmers, and preserves Europe's culinary traditions,"" said lead negotiator and EPP member of parliament Celine Imart ahead of Wednesday's vote. ""Calling it 'meat' is misleading for the consumer,"" she added. 

But there was disagreement within the EPP, with some members voting against it.   


""We shouldn't take consumers for fools. If a package says 'veggie burger' or 'veggie sausage,' everyone can decide for themselves whether they want to buy it or not. I believe and hope that the discussion will come to nothing,"" said EPP member Peter Liese. 

In response to the majority ballot, Anna Cavazzini of Germany's Green Party said ""While the world is burning, the EPP has nothing better to do this week than to involve us all in a debate about sausages and schnitzel."" 

She told DW it was now ""up to the Council and the German federal government to put an end to this nonsense, which confuses consumers, costs companies millions, and won't help farmers."" 

According to the German consumer protection organization Verbraucherzentrale, people prefer products meant to mimic the taste of meat have names that made them recognizable as such. 

""Terms such as 'vegan schnitzel' don't cause confusion but help with orientation and promote clarity,"" the organization's food expert Astrid Goltz told DW. 

In Germany, major supermarkets such as Aldi Süd and Lidl, fast food joint Burger King and sausage producer Rügenwalder Mühle pushed back against the proposal and called on the EU parliament to vote against it. 

Consumers are well able to distinguish meat and plant-based alternatives, they said in a joint statement before the vote. A ban would ""force companies to use unfamiliar terms which significantly complicates market access and slows down innovation dynamics.""

A recent study put the potential for plant-based products at about €65 billion ($75 billion) by 2045 in Germany alone, with some 250,000 new jobs. 

According to European consumer watchdog organization foodwatch, the proposal was an attempt at slowing down the uptick in people choosing to occasionally forego meat. 

""Under the pretext of consumer protection, the EU wants to ban familiar terms such as tofu sausages or seitan schnitzel — this is not consumer protection, this is lobbying for the meat industry,"" said Chris Methmann, director of foodwatch Germany, in a statement.

Research by sustainability NGO Changing Markets Foundation points to aggressive tactics deployed by the meat industry, with massive campaigns pushing for disinformation.  

A 2020 study by the European Consumer Organization found that 80% of consumers don't see any problem with names such as soy sausage or veggie schnitzel if they are clearly labeled as plant-based products. 

In response to a push by France to regulate the wording of veggie foods, the European Court of Justice ruled in 2024 that EU member states cannot prohibit the use of terms traditionally linked to animal products. 

Even after the vote, it remains up in the air whether consumers have to stomach new words for their plant-based schnitzels — it's now up to the heads of state and governments to decide.

            Arizona's Democratic senators got into a hallway confrontation with Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday as the government shutdown's eighth day dragged on.
    


            The clash between Johnson and Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego centered on the speaker's decision not to swear in Democrats' newest congresswoman-elect until they break the Senate logjam and reopen the government. Full of traded insults and forceful cross talk, the six-minute exchange underscored just how far apart the two parties remain on how to approach reopening the federal government as each side digs in.
    


            The Democratic senators had been speaking with reporters outside the speaker's office in the US Capitol to argue he was refusing to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva because she'd be the deciding signature to force a House vote related to the Jeffrey Epstein case files.
    


            The speaker exchanged handshakes with the pair as he approached to push back on their claims.
    


            “Your excuse just keeps on moving,” said Gallego, as the Democrats pointed to Johnson's swearing-in of Florida GOP Reps. Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine during a pro forma session – when the House wasn't formally in session – earlier this year.
    


            Johnson defended his decision to not do the same for Grijalva by saying “that was the exception we did because the family was here. Ms. Grijalva, Rep.-elect Grijalva has not yet had a scheduled date because she was elected after the House was out of session. So, I am anxious to administer the oath to her as soon as you guys vote to open the government.”
    


            Johnson, who said he was happy Grijalva was elected, denied that it had anything to do with a vote on the Epstein files and remarked the House didn't need to vote on releasing more of them because the House Oversight Committee is already conducting a bipartisan investigation.
    


            “They're doing the work. They're doing it methodically. They're doing it with subpoena power, and you don't need an act of Congress for that to happen because they're already on it,” Johnson said.
    


Speaker Johnson said he'd swear in new House Democrat ‘as soon as she wants.' Now Republicans are backtracking



            The exchange grew more heated as the lawmakers cut each other off, raising their voices to speak over each other.
    


            “Stop covering up for pedophiles,” Gallego charged.
    


            “That is ridiculous,” Johnson immediately shot back, arguing separately that “it has nothing to do with Epstein.”
    


            GOP Rep. Mike Lawler of New York walked up to the group near the exchange's end, jumping in to defend Johnson.
    


            “Nobody is covering up for pedophiles. Back the hell off. You're absolutely absurd,” he told Kelly and Gallego.
    


            The lawmakers also traded barbs over the best way to reopen the government.
    


            Kelly repeatedly pushed Johnson to bring the House back into session so that lawmakers could have a serious discussion about how to fund the government and address expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies – a key demand for Democrats. He said his Republican colleagues in the Senate were telling him that they didn't want to negotiate without House Republicans also weighing in.
    


            “If you bring them back, we will have a discussion. It's very simple,” Kelly said.
    


            Johnson was adamant that the House had done its job, a line he has repeated countless times since government funding lapsed on October 1, and said there wouldn't be a discussion on the Obamacare subsidies until Democrats provided the needed votes in the Senate to pass the Republican House-passed short-term funding bill and reopen the government.

            In an apparent attempt to make it personal for the speaker, Kelly argued health care premiums could skyrocket in Johnson's own Louisiana district.
    


            “I imagine yours are going to hurt even worse than ours with these premium increases. We have to fix this,” Kelly said.
    


            But Johnson held firm that he would not have that policy conversation until the government shutdown ended.
    


            Multiple times, the Democrats gestured to the empty House floor and accused Johnson of giving his lawmakers an extended summer vacation as the two sides continued to talk over each other.
    


            Lawler held up a copy of a House bill that he said would extend the ACA subsidies for one year.
    


            “We actually have put forth legislation to do it. You guys just keep pontificating. How about you go down the hall and go vote to open the government up? That would be great,” he quipped.
    


            After accusing the Democrats of “holding the American people hostage,” Johnson ended the exchange.
    


            “OK I'm going to get back to work. These gentlemen had a publicity stunt here. You see the issue, they need to go vote to reopen the government, plain and simple. The House has done its work,” he told reporters.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Katie Porter, famous for grilling opponents, is criticized for demanding a reporter be more ‘pleasant'","https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/08/politics/katie-porter-interview-california-governor","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:34:36 GMT","


            Katie Porter became a national figure among Democrats for her sharp questioning of Trump administration figures, often holding a whiteboard, in House Oversight Committee hearings. The confrontations she sparked often went viral when she posted them online.
    


            That made her recent demand that a local CBS reporter have a “pleasant, positive conversation” with her – and her threat to cut off their interview – all the more noteworthy.
    


            Porter, now running for governor of California, is drawing blowback after threatening to walk out of an interview with CBS News Sacramento. A portion of the interview was posted online and widely shared, even as Porter's campaign noted she ultimately spoke to the reporter for another 20 minutes.
    


            “What do you say to the 40% of California voters who you'll need in order to win, who voted for Trump?” reporter Julie Watts begins in the clip. (President Donald Trump won 38% of the vote in California last year.)
    


            “How would I need them in order to win?” Porter shot back, emphasizing her focus on the state's Democratic voter base. “I feel like this is being unnecessarily argumentative. What is your question?”
    


CA gubernatorial candidate interview goes viral when she threatens to walk out



            Watts pressed on. “We've also asked the other candidates, do you think you need any of those 40% of California voters to win? And you're saying, no, you don't.”
    


            Porter then cut in, “OK, so, I don't want to keep doing this. I'm going to call it, thank you.”
    


            Watts continued to argue that Porter's rivals had answered similar questions, but Porter responded, “I don't care,” saying that she had “never had to do this before” in cutting off the interview.
    


            “I want to have a pleasant, positive conversation, in which you ask me about every issue on this list. And if every question, you're going to make up a follow-up question, then we're never going to get there,” Porter said, referencing policy debates she wanted to discuss.
    


            The moment drew national attention to a still-developing race to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, a contest former Vice President Kamala Harris considered but ultimately decided not to join.
    


            Porter is a former congresswoman who ran unsuccessfully for US Senate in 2024. She is a former law professor and protege of Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
    


            Former Biden administration Health and Human Services Director Xavier Becerra, one of Porter's top rivals in the gubernatorial race, responded to clips of the interview picked up by social media, writing, “I'm not interested in excluding any vote. Every Californian deserves affordable health care, safe streets, a roof over their head and a living wage.”
    


            And former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa also weighed in, writing that “We need a leader who will solve hard problems and answer simple questions.”
    


            Liberal commentator Mehdi Hasan on X called it a “car crash interview,” while Republican strategist Matt Whitlock wrote, “This Katie Porter crashout is INCREDIBLE.”
    


            California, the largest state in the country, is also among the most Democratic. No Republican has won it at the presidential level since Ronald Reagan in 1988, and in the 2024 campaign, Kamala Harris won her home state by more than 30 points.
    


            However, California's distinct “top two” primary system – in which the first and second place candidates in a primary advance to the general election, regardless of party – means that two Democrats could face off on the final ballot, incentivizing appeals to independents and Republicans.
    


            Porter, Becerra and Villaraigosa rank as the most prominent declared Democratic candidates, but US Sen. Alex Padilla and billionaire businessman Rick Caruso loom as potential entrants.
    


            Conservative commentator and strategist Steve Hilton, meanwhile, leads among GOP candidates, drawing a meaningful share of the vote in public polls. That raises the prospect of a splintered Democratic field opening a path to the general election ballot for the Republican in the deep-blue state.

Fox News correspondent Madison Scarpino has the latest on the Charlotte light rail stabbing on 'The Story.'

An Indiana man accused of stabbing a 69-year-old at a gas station has ignited outrage after records revealed a staggering criminal history – nearly 100 prior arrests – with little to show in the way of punishment.

Courtney Boose, 41, was arrested after the alleged gas-station stabbing, according to the Lawrence Police Department and Fox 59, which reported that Boose has been arrested 99 times over the years on charges ranging from theft and trespassing to battery. 

Despite that record, court documents reviewed by Fox News Digital show he's never served a day in state prison.

BLUE CITY ERUPTS AS 91-TIME FELON TRIES TO DODGE PRISON, WEASLE INTO REHAB AFTER CRASH

Boose's long paper trail through Marion County courts paints a picture of a man repeatedly cycling through the system. 

Public filings list dozens of convictions and dismissals spanning more than two decades, mostly low-level felonies and misdemeanors such as theft, criminal trespass and panhandling. Even when convicted, Boose typically received short county-jail terms or time served.

One 2019 case included a battery resulting in bodily injury charge, which was later dismissed in a plea deal, and a conviction for misdemeanor theft that earned Boose just two months behind bars. 

In 2020 and again in 2022, he pleaded guilty to felony trespass and was sentenced to county jail time already served, court records show.

BLUE CITY CRIME CRISIS: REPEAT OFFENDER STRIKES AGAIN AFTER CHARLOTTE TRAIN MURDER

Indianapolis Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) President Rick Snyder blasted the situation as proof that repeat offenders are ""being turned back onto the streets faster than officers can arrest them.""

""This is exactly what we've been warning about,"" Snyder said on ""The Hammer and Nigel Show"" on 91.3FM WIBC. 

You've got someone arrested 99 times, accused now of stabbing an elderly man, and he's never seen prison…

Prosecutors recently downgraded Boose's latest charge from attempted murder to aggravated battery, a level three felony, reducing potential prison exposure from up to 40 years to a maximum of 16. He is being held at the Marion County Jail on a $50,000 bond. Fox News Digital has reached out to Marion County for comment.

""What's the number of times where somebody in a black robe says, 'You know what, I don't think this guy is getting it'?"" Snyder asked.

Critics argue Boose's record highlights problematic ""catch-and-release"" justice, where habitual offenders face little deterrent. In deep-blue San Francisco, residents protested Troy McAlister's bid to swap prison time for a drug rehabilitation program just years after he allegedly plowed down two pedestrians.

""91 felonies, 2 deaths, No more chances,"" signs read outside San Francisco's Hall of Justice. ""Judge Begert chooses politics over public safety. Justice NOW.""

The case of McAlister, 50, has long been a lightning rod of restorative justice reform, forcing elected officials to confront whether policies meant to show compassion to offenders put the public at risk.

McAlister was on parole on Dec. 31, 2020, when he allegedly drove a stolen car while intoxicated, ran a red light, and killed Hanako Abe, 27, and Elizabeth Platt, 60. 

""Troy McAlister has been charged with 91 felonies over the course of his multi-decades career here in San Francisco, and we don't think that someone should be given infinite chances to ultimately correct course,"" Scotty Jacobs, director of Blueprint for a Better San Francisco, told KTVU-TV.

New York salon owner Ashley DiMatteo and hairstylist Briana Delvecchio discuss why losing weight, especially with GLP-1s, often leads to temporary hair loss.

Most of us think of a salon shampoo as a moment of relaxation, when we get to lean back and let the stylist wash and rinse our hair. 

But for a very small number of people, that innocuous posture can set off a cascade of vascular injury known as beauty parlor stroke syndrome (BPSS).

BPSS refers to stroke‐like events triggered by hyperextension or rotation during hair-washing or other activities, which can compress or tear the vertebral arteries in the neck. 

TENNIS CHAMPION MONICA SELES REVEALS INCURABLE DISEASE AS DOCTOR SHARES WHAT TO KNOW

The term was popularized in 1993, when New York neurologist Michael Weintraub described five case reports of patients who developed symptoms following salon shampoo treatments. 

A recent review published this year in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine identified 54 documented cases of BPSS over nearly five decades, drawn from 22 studies. Among those, 42 cases started in beauty salons, eight in dental settings and four in other contexts. 

Leaning back into a salon sink can strain the neck's arteries in rare cases, according to a 2025 review in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine. (iStock)

Most affected patients (roughly 80%) were women, with ages ranging from teenagers to seniors. 

A 2018 review in Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine stated that BPSS occurs when the neck is held in an extreme backward or twisted position during a wash or treatment, stretching or compressing the vertebral arteries that run along the spine to the brain.

SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS COULD WARN OF MS MORE THAN A DECADE BEFORE DIAGNOSIS, STUDY FINDS

In rare instances, that posture can cause a tear in the artery wall, called a dissection, which may then form a clot and block blood flow to the brain.

Most beauty parlor experiences are entirely safe, but simple ergonomic tweaks can make them even safer. (iStock)

The same review describes how even minor structural issues, such as bone spurs (osteophytes) in the cervical vertebrae, can worsen compression and increase risk. In effect, a casual tilt of the head can briefly limit blood supply to key parts of the brain stem and cerebellum.

Symptoms typically appear during or within several days of a triggering posture, according to the American Journal of Emergency Medicine review.

Common warning signs include dizziness, vertigo, neck pain or visual disturbances. More serious cases may lead to weakness, numbness or speech difficulties.

Supporting the neck with towels or cushions during shampooing can minimize the risk of artery compression, experts say. (iStock)

Diagnosis usually involves MRI or CT angiography to confirm arterial dissection. As with other stroke types, doctors often treat patients using antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs, though some require vascular stenting or surgery, experts say.

Health researchers writing for the American Council on Science and Health in New York City emphasize that BPSS is highly uncommon and largely known from isolated case reports rather than population data.

Even so, the Pro Beauty Association in Arizona advises stylists to provide neck support like rolled towels or cushions, and to allow clients to sit more upright during washes. 

Experts also recommend that clients speak up immediately if they feel neck strain or dizziness.

Former Virginia Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger is directing her attention to federal worker back pay in an apparent attempt to pull focus away from Jay Jones's violent text messages. At the same time, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears‘s campaign blasts the Democratic ticket on Jones's violent rhetoric.

Republicans, including President Donald Trump, have called on Democrats to force their candidate for attorney general, Jones, to drop out of the election after text messages surfaced in which he said state House Speaker Todd Gilbert should get “two bullets to the head.” He has not dropped out, and Democrats have been mum about holding him accountable for his violent rhetoric, frustrating conservatives further.

Spanberger has condemned Jones's violent rhetoric, but she didn't ask him to leave the race. Instead, she has redirected her messaging to focus on the government shutdown, seizing on the opportunity to slam Republicans on a Trump administration memo threatening to withhold back pay from furloughed federal employees.

JAY JONES'S VIOLENT TEXT MESSAGES IN VIRGINIA BLEED INTO THE NATIONAL DEBATE

“President Trump is punishing Virginians for his own refusal to work in good faith to end this shutdown. Withholding back pay would do nothing to strengthen our country — and would be a further attack on Virginians' livelihoods,” Spanberger said in a statement. “My opponent, Winsome Earle-Sears, has backed President Trump's job-killing and price-hiking agenda at every turn.”

Virginia ranks third, behind Washington, D.C., and Maryland, among states or districts with the highest percentage of their workforce being employed by the federal government.

Earle-Sears has joined national GOP leaders in blaming the government shutdown on congressional Democrats, releasing a video advertisement on her social media pages in late September. She said, “Abigail Spanberger is right there with them,” in a post on X.

“We need a clean, continuing resolution. The Democrats are holding it up,” Earle-Sears said in the advertisement.

The Earle-Sears campaign did not respond to the Washington Examiner's requests for comment on the issue of federal worker back pay.

Meanwhile, Earle-Sears's campaign hasn't taken its foot off the gas on slamming Jones's violent texts. Her campaign released a new ad titled “Two Bullets” that says plainly, “Jay Jones says he wants to put two bullets in a political opponent.”

The ad also references a June video in which Spanberger called on Virginians to “let your rage fuel you,” in a further attempt to tie the Democratic candidate to violent political rhetoric. Spanberger was attempting to motivate voters to get involved in politics, encouraging them to send postcards and knock on doors.

Earle-Sears has been consistently polling behind Spanberger by double digits, leading some Republicans to withhold endorsements or donations. Trump hasn't given her a full-fledged endorsement, and some of Gov. Glenn Youngkin's (R-VA) biggest donors haven't donated similarly to Earle-Sears. However, after the news of Jones's violent texts, the Republican Governors Association announced a $1.5 million additional donation to Earle-Sears's campaign this week, bringing its total buy-in on the Republican's campaign to $5 million, according to Politico.

TRUMP GIVES EARLE-SEARS THE COLD SHOULDER AS HE WADES INTO VIRGINIA RACES

Earle-Sears and Spanberger are set to face off in their first debate on Thursday at Norfolk State University. Election Day is on Nov. 4.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","Pam Bondi, Loyal Servant","https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/pam-bondi-loyal-servant/684487/","Wed, 08 Oct 2025 13:18:51 GMT","

At a congressional oversight hearing yesterday, the attorney general followed her north star: pleasing the president.

At a normal congressional oversight hearing, the person testifying at least answers a decent number of the questions asked by members of Congress from the opposing party. Not Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday, Bondi spent her time talking over Democratic senators, leveling personal attacks at them, and refusing to provide basic factual information. With Republicans, in contrast, she was smooth and solicitous. She expressed her fealty to Donald Trump, calling him “the most transparent president in American history” and saying that she'd “loved” seeing a photo of herself having dinner with the president. The almost-five-hour hearing was a portrait of an attorney general as the president's loyalist rather than as a constitutional officer with the appropriate respect for a coordinate branch of government.

The problems began almost right away, when Ranking Member Dick Durbin of Illinois, a Democrat, asked Bondi whether the White House had consulted the Justice Department before deploying National Guard troops to American cities. “I am not going to discuss internal conversations with the White House,” Bondi informed him. Then she declared, “I wish you loved Chicago as much as you hate the president.”

Bondi returned to this tactic repeatedly over the course of the hearing, sometimes in almost exactly the same words. She also told Senator Alex Padilla, a Democrat, that she wished he loved his home state of California “as much as you hate President Trump.” (This was in response to a question from Padilla about whether government officials are obligated to follow court orders.) She accused Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island of “trying to slander President Trump left and right.” (Whitehouse had asked whether the FBI had discovered photographs of Trump with young women while searching Jeffrey Epstein's property.) She told Senator Adam Schiff of California, “If you worked for me, you would have been fired.” (Schiff had wanted to know whether Trump's immigration adviser, Tom Homan, had accepted $50,000 in the course of an FBI sting operation, as multiple news outlets had reported.) She also refused to answer questions on whether career prosecutors had recommended against indicting FBI Director James Comey, what legal theory justified the administration's recent military strikes on boats in the Caribbean, and why the Justice Department had fired scores of civil servants.

“This is supposed to be an oversight hearing,” Schiff said at one point. “Oversight!” Bondi scoffed, leaning back in mock disbelief, her mouth pulled into a smirk.

The next senator up was Katie Britt of Alabama, a Republican, who asked Bondi about how the Justice Department is working to “keep our kids safe” from online predators and social media. Britt's questions were typical of Republicans on the panel: complimentary, nonconfrontational, and pitched to make Bondi and the Republican Party look good. Bondi responded to Britt with a pantomime of gratitude. “This, I believe, is what an oversight hearing should be about,” she declared.

This is not what oversight is about. The goal of oversight hearings is to provide the legislature, a branch of government equal in authority to the executive, with an opportunity to hold a presidential administration responsible for disasters, shortcomings, and breaches. The point is not to puff up the executive's ego; it's to help inform Congress as it considers whether and how to draft legislation, as is its constitutional responsibility. Oversight is often messy, absurd, and heavily choreographed, but accountability and information-gathering are the aims that Congress is meant to reach toward. “A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information,” the Supreme Court held in 1927. Today, however, Republicans in Congress have little interest in legislating, so they are not in need of many facts. They're happy to yield before the Trump administration rather than challenging it.

Bondi was disdainful of the committee, flattering it only when it allowed her to demonstrate her loyalty to the president. Her performance encapsulated Trump's understanding of the relationship between Congress and the presidency. The legislature, in this vision, is subordinate. Pam Bondi certainly treated it that way.

The IRS on Wednesday said that it was furloughing nearly half of its workforce due to the ongoing government shutdown.

About 34,000 IRS workers are being furloughed, according to the tax agency. Another 39,870 employees, representing 53.6% of the workforce, will remain on the job.

The furloughs came as the shutdown of federal government operations was in its eighth day, and as dueling funding resolutions that would end the crisis for the sixth time failed to pass in votes by the Senate.

""Due to the lapse in appropriations, most IRS operations are closed,"" the agency said in a message to employees on Wednesday.

""An IRS-wide furlough began on October 8, 2025, for everyone except already-identified excepted and exempt employees,"" the message said. 

""Employees who are not exempt or excepted are furloughed and placed in a non-pay and non-duty status until further notice; however, all employees should plan to report to work for their next tour of duty.""

Furloughed IRS workers were told in a letter that they will receive back pay when the shutdown ends. That letter came a day after an internal draft memo suggested that the Trump administration might question its obligation to give back pay to some furloughed employees.

The furloughs come as the tax agency was already dealing with the effects of mass layoffs that reduced its workforce by about 25%, from around 100,000 workers to about 75,000 now. The layoffs were implemented after President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.

A shortage of air traffic controllers could delay more flights, the Federal Aviation Administration warned on Wednesday, as concerns grow about the effect of the government shutdown on U.S. aviation.

About 10,000 flights were delayed on Monday and Tuesday, though disruptions dropped on Wednesday to just over 2,500. Delays could be caused by weather or other reasons aside from staffing issues. But a shortfall of already-thin air traffic control staffing this week had prompted the FAA to slow or halt arrivals in Burbank, California, and Nashville, Tennessee, among others.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned Monday that the FAA is seeing a ""slight uptick"" in sick calls of air traffic controllers.

He also said the shutdown is exacerbating concerns about the strain on air traffic controllers, a shortage of whom has vexed airline executives for years. 

""Nearly 11,000 fully certified controllers remain on the job, many working 10-hour shifts as many as six days a week, showing extraordinary dedication to safely guiding millions of passengers to their destinations—all without getting paid during this shutdown,"" the air traffic controllers' union, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said in a statement.

Earlier Wednesday, the FAA had warned there could be a staffing trigger at Newark Liberty International Airport, but that caution had been removed by the afternoon. Newark was not seeing an influx of flight delays.

The government shutdown stretched into its eighth day Wednesday, as the Senate failed to pass a funding proposal again.

Duffy said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that no one airport is consistently having issues with air traffic controller staffing and urged Congress to pass a funding bill.

""The conversations and the fights that are happening are about issues allegedly that are going to come to fruition at the end of the year,"" he said. ""Open up the government, take the months to have a conversation and negotiate, but let's not use this as leverage with hardworking Americans that keep our skies safe for political benefit.""

During a shutdown, ""essential"" workers such as air traffic controllers and TSA agents are continuing to work without pay, while many other employees are placed on furlough.

A more than monthlong shutdown that started in late 2018 ended early the next year, hours after a shortage of air traffic controllers snarled air travel in New York.

In this article

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday that the U.S. is ""not far ahead"" of China in the artificial intelligence race, and that the country needs a ""nuanced strategy"" to stay on higher ground.

Huang has been walking a tense line between the two countries and has praised China's AI models, including DeepSeek, Alibaba, and Baidu. Although U.S. models remain more advanced, China's open-source models are ""well ahead,"" Huang said.

The CEO courted China in July with several trips following U.S. chip restrictions and warned that Chinese chip systems from companies like Huawei should not be discounted.

President Donald Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping on a call in September and announced plans for the pair to meet at the APEC South Korea summit at the end of October.

Here are five key things Huang said about the AI race on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

Nvidia, widely regarded as the leading AI chip manufacturer, announced in September plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build out AI data centers. However, these large investments in computing power require a massive amount of energy, which China far outpaces the U.S. in production. 

China generated a total of 10,000 terawatt hours, or one trillion watt hours, of electricity in 2024, over double the U.S.'s output, according to the Energy Institute.

While the U.S. may be leading in advanced chip designs, including Nvidia's Blackwell processor, China's tech giant Huawei has been adding pressure with its plans to launch its new computing systems to power its in-house Ascend chips as soon as next year.

China reportedly prohibited tech companies from using Nvidia chips, instead focusing on advancing domestic chips to challenge Nvidia processors. Alibaba and Baidu reportedly began using internally designed chips to train AI models.

Huang said that China's under-regulation at the industrial level makes the country ""quick in adopting new technology."" 

According to a China State Council directive, the country is aiming for AI adoption to reach 70% of the population by 2027 by imbuing various agents and other applications across core industries.

""I hope that American companies in American society are going to be fast in adopting AI applications, because ultimately this industrial revolution wins at the AI application layer, at the diffusion layer,"" Huang said.

China holds 50% of the world's AI researchers and 30% of the technology market, Huang said. 

The country's stocks have seen a strong rally as confidence climbs in its chip progression and AI development. China's market has seen a huge boom as tech companies see share prices grow over triple digits in the past year. 

Alibaba stock rose by almost 180% year to date, while electronics giant Xiaomi saw shares increase by 125%.

Huang pointed to developing the American tech stack to win AI developers and markets globally and warned the U.S. would fall behind if American technologies are not allowed to ""diffuse and be proliferated around the world.""

The CEO referenced comments from White House AI advisor David Sacks about the tech landscape in five years.

""If America, the American tech stack, is 80% of the world, then we are doing a good job winning the AI race. If the United States is 20% of the world, then we've lost the AI race,"" Huang said.

Huang also referred to companies like Azure, CoreWeave, and Anthropic AI as playing a key part in revolutionizing the entire tech stack.

Kent, Wash.-based Stoke Space Technologies today revealed that it has raised $510 million in fresh funding to accelerate development of its fully reusable medium-lift Nova rocket.

The Series D funding round, let by Thomas Tull's US Innovative Technology Fund, comes in conjunction with a $100 million debt facility led by Silicon Valley Bank. Stoke said the new financing has more than doubled its total capital raised, bringing the figure to $990 million.

“This funding gives us the runway to complete development and demonstrate Nova through its first flights,” Stoke co-founder and CEO Andy Lapsa said in a news release. If all goes according to plan, the first Nova rocket is expected to lift off next year from Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

Stoke Space, one of the brightest stars of the Seattle area's growing space industry, is focusing on building a fully reusable rocket capable of putting two to 20 tons of payload in orbit. The company was founded in 2019 by Lapsa and Tom Feldman, a fellow veteran of Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture. Feldman now serves as Stoke's chief technology officer.

SpaceX has pioneered reusability for its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy first-stage boosters, and Blue Origin has designed the booster of its New Glenn rocket to be reusable. But recovering and reusing the second stage of an orbital-class rocket is a tougher nut to crack. That's one of the things that SpaceX is working to achieve with its Starship super-rocket — and that Stoke is working to achieve with Nova.

Stoke Space has developed a liquid-cooled heat shield that could open the way for second-stage reusability, which would lower the cost of access to space. The prospect of cheaper launches is why the startup has attracted nearly a billion dollars in funding from investors including Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Industrious Ventures and Y Combinator.

In today's announcement, Tull praised the Stoke team's vision and said he was “proud to support their mission in defining the next chapter of U.S. aerospace.”

“Launch capacity is now a defining factor in the U.S.'s ability to compete and lead in the space economy,” Tull said. “Stoke's pioneering approach to reusable launch systems directly advances our national security and commercial access to orbit.”

The investors who joined USIT in the Series D round include Washington Harbour Partners LP, General Innovation Capital Partners, 776, Breakthrough Energy, Glade Brook Capital, Industrious Ventures, NFX, Sparta Group, Toyota Ventures and Woven Capital.

Stoke said the fresh funding will be used to expand production capacity for the Nova launch vehicle and finish refurbishment of Launch Complex 14 — the pad from which John Glenn lifted off to become the first American in orbit in 1962. Stoke also plans to invest in its supply chain, its Boltline software for project management, and the infrastructure that will be needed for high-cadence launch operations.

In addition to the Florida launch facility, Stoke has a 168,000-square-foot headquarters facility in Kent — not far from Blue Origin's HQ — and a 75-acre test facility in Moses Lake, Wash.

While SpaceX and Blue Origin are focusing on heavy-lift rockets such as Starship and New Glenn, Stoke is targeting the medium-lift launch market. Even though Stoke Space hasn't yet launched a rocket to orbit, it was added to the U.S. Space Force's list of providers for national security launches this year.

“We've designed Nova to address a real gap in launch capacity, and the National Security Space Launch award, along with our substantial manifest of contracted commercial launches, affirms that need,” Lapsa said. “The fresh support from our investors and government partners enables our team to remain laser-focused on bringing Nova's unique capabilities to market.”

BERLIN — Women who use menopausal hormone therapy (MHT; ie, hormone replacement therapy ) have an up to 30% reduction in the risk of developing esophageal and gastric cancers compared to nonusers, according to a large population-based study across five Nordic countries. The association appeared strongest for combined estrogen-progestin and systemic formulations.

“This is one of the largest and most comprehensive studies to date supporting the hypothesis of an inverse association between MHT and risk of esophago-gastric cancer,” said Victoria Wocalewski, MD, from the Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, who presented the findings at United European Gastroenterology (UEG) Week 2025. 

There was a decreased risk for all investigated cancers in MHT users, but the strongest association was observed for esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), said Wocalewski. In addition, “there were discrete dose-dependent results for [EAC] and gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) but not for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).”

Previous research has suggested that hormonal changes could partly explain the male predominance in esophageal and gastric cancers, but evidence from large, well-controlled datasets has been limited. 

“Cancer rates in women increase significantly after age of 60, so it has been hypothesized that this pattern is linked to declined levels of estrogen that comes with menopause,” said Wocalewski, explaining the rationale for the study.

“Some studies looking at MHT use have indicated a possible protective effect, but with some contradictory results and type-specific variations,” Wocalewski noted. “Our study aimed to investigate these previous findings using a larger study sample.”

The population-based case-control study drew on prospectively collected data from the NordGETS database including national prescription, cancer, and population registries in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden spanning 1994-2020. In total, 19,518 women with esophago-gastric cancer were compared with 195,094 controls randomly selected from the general population, and matched for age, calendar year, and country (in a 1:10 ratio). Women were 45 years or over with a diagnosis of EAC, ESCC, or GAC. 

In total there were 5000 cases of EAC, 4401 of ESCC, and 10,117 of GAC, with the median ages being 74, 72, and 75 years, respectively; most cases of EAC and ESCC were found in Denmark, and most cases of GAC were in Sweden. 

The investigators categorized participants by defined daily doses (DDDs) of MHT into three equal sized categories: low (< 158 DDDs), intermediate (158-848 DDDs), and high (> 848 DDDs). MHT was defined as systemic or local, and estrogen only or combined with progesterone. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for three major cancer outcomes of EAC, ESCC, and GAC, adjusted for known confounders such as age, obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, reflux disease, Helicobacter pylori eradication, and concomitant use of statins or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, Wocalewski noted that they did not adjust for socio-economic factors. 

Compared with nonusers, women with any MHT exposure had a markedly reduced risk of EAC with adjusted ORs (aORs) of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.67-0.81) for low-use, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.61-0.75) for intermediate-use, and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.61-0.75) for high-use groups. Various adjustments were made for obesity, reflux, statins, and NSAIDs, as well as smoking, alcohol use, and H pylori eradication.

Similar inverse associations were seen for ESCC with aORs of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.62-0.77), 0.70 (95% CI, 0.62-0.77), and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.64-0.79) across the dose categories, and for GAC where risk decreased progressively from 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.96) to 0.80 (95% CI, 0.74-0.86) across increasing MHT doses.

When stratified by hormone formulation, combined estrogen-progesterone therapy and systemic MHT conferred the strongest risk reduction. For example, systemic MHT use was associated with aORs of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.61-0.74) for EAC and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.76-0.88) for GAC, while local (vaginal) preparations showed slightly weaker associations at 0.72 (95% CI, 0.66-0.78) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83-0.92), respectively. 

In EAC, combined estrogen-progesterone therapy led to an OR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.63-0.73) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.69-0.87) for women on estrogen alone. Similar results were found for ESCC. For GAC, combination resulted in an aOR of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80-0.89) and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.81-0.97) in estrogen only therapy respectively.

“Our results reinforce the concept that estrogenic signaling may influence tumor development in the upper GI tract,” said Wocalewski. “Understanding these mechanisms could help identify at-risk populations and inform prevention strategies,” she added, noting that, “hormonal effects on epithelial tight junctions and nitric oxide synthesis in the gastrointestinal tract” would have an influence on smooth muscle cells.

Commenting on the study for Medscape Medical News, Jan Bornschein, MD, University of Oxford, UK, who was not involved in the research, said the results are “highly relevant.” 

“We've seen for a long time a link between hormones and GI pathology... however, it has been poorly investigated and the whole mechanisms are not understood, so it's welcome that this group is moving forward and investigating this in a structured way,” he said.

Another delegate cautioned that MHT was associated with a risk for other non- gastrointestinal cancers. “I think it's extremely important, because there are data on associations [of MHT] with breast cancer and also endometrial cancer. It's good to see that it may help and reduce this cancer, but we have to be really careful about the others.”

Dr Wocalewski reports no relevant conflicts of interest. Dr Bornschein has no disclosures relevant to this study. The study was funded by Karolinska Institutet and supported by national cancer and prescription registry data from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden.

Things about residency that might surprise you. 

First is how much you actually use your voice, such as advocating for your patients during rounds, coordinating with nursing, and negotiating discharge plans with social work. Suddenly, you're not just observing the system; you're actually in it. 

Another surprise is how much joy there is in the small wins —something as simple as being able to connect with a patient or having a family thank you for just being there and listening. 

You might also be shocked by how much your attendings want your opinion. They're not just there to quiz you, but to actually treat you like a colleague and help prepare you for your future.

Then the oddly sweet little things that are so important for this very long journey: midnight birthday cupcakes during night float, seeing a senior resident back you up when you're drowning, or how one of your patients actually thinks about you and draws you a picture. 

While the hours are really long, and sometimes the pager noise will absolutely haunt your dreams, the humanity, the humor, and the growth are the things that will really catch you off-guard. They will also be the things that you look back at with admiration.

Get unrivaled matchday access

The U.S. Men's National Team returns for the October international window, one year after Mauricio Pochettino made his debut as head coach at Q2 Stadium last fall.

The USA will face 2026 FIFA World Cup-qualified nations Ecuador and Australia in October. First up, the USMNT will take on the South American squad in Austin, Texas on Oct. 10 at 8:30 p.m. ET.

Less than 250 days until the world's largest sports event kicks off in the United States, Pochettino and the USMNT continue to build toward next summer. The last time the squad took the field, the USA beat another World Cup-bound team in Japan. The Americans look to continue that momentum in this window. 

Here's everything you need to know as the U.S. prepares for Ecuador:

The USMNT played at Q2 Stadium one year ago in the 2024 October international window — the first match with head coach Mauricio Pochettino on the sidelines. The USA beat Panama 2-0 as Pochettino began his international coaching tenure with a victory over a Concacaf foe.

It's been a year of learning under Pochettino, as veteran center back Tim Ream described. Ream, 38, has adapted to a new playing style under this staff, and one thing that's clear is the intensity they demand in training which carries over into matches.

“We step over the line like this is it — nothing else matters,” Ream said. “There's nothing in the world between the start of a training or the start of a game, at the end of a training or the end of a game. There's nothing else that matters. Every touch, every pass, every piece of communication is the most important thing. That's something that I think is really starting to take hold within the group. It's something that I've noticed really become prevalent over the last year.”

The Americans hold an undefeated 6-0-0 record at the home of Austin FC. The venue opened in 2021 and has quickly become a special place for the USMNT. Each of the six wins have been shutouts. The energy at games has been electric, too. Three of the outings have been sellouts with a total average attendance of more than 18,000. Most recently, the USMNT claimed a 1-0 victory over Saudi Arabia in the Concacaf Gold Cup Group Stage in June. Defender Chris Richards scored the lone goal.

As the Americans gear up to face top opponents already qualified for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, they'll lean on veteran leadership in Tim Ream and Cristian Roldan. Ream carries an “aura” that makes anyone feel welcome coming into camp. With the celebration of his 38th birthday this week, he's also provided an example of continuing a high-level career at any age. 

“He's revitalized his National Team career at an older age,” Roldan said of Ream. “It provided me with a little bit more added motivation to get back here with the team, to really believe that I could get here. He's an example that you can not only play at a really high level but sustain that throughout your career.”

Roldan returned to National Team duty for the first time since 2023 in September. The veteran impressed Pochettino with the way he carried himself — along with productive minutes on the field — and earned another call-up in October. 

Christian Pulisic entered October camp in electric form, having delivered six goals and two assists in just seven matches for AC Milan. He leads Serie A in scoring and goal contributions. As the U.S. prepares to face World Cup-bound Ecuador and Australia, the veteran winger brings not just attacking firepower but leadership for the squad.

“Christian is a great player,"" Pochettino said. ""He's a player that has continuity, and I think we can say he is the most important player now for the National Team that is performing and playing under big pressure. He needs to perform every single week and every single game in a place like Milan, and he's doing well.”

A number of USMNT players return in this international window. Cameron Carter-Vickers, Weston McKennie, Tanner Tessmann and Patrick Schulte made their first appearance on a camp roster since the Concacaf Nations League in March. Aidan Morris came back into camp after a year since he last played in the October 2024 friendlies, including Pochettino's initial game in Austin. Meanwhile, James Sands earned his first call-up under Pochettino after last appearing in a U.S. shirt in 2023. 

“It's been a good start to the year, regardless if I get called in the camp,” Morris said. “My theme doesn't change. I just try to wake up every day and just get better, get that 1% better. Then just control what I control. With that, obviously, leads to growing and getting better, and then leads me to these opportunities here.”","{'href': 'https://www.ussoccer.com', 'title': 'US Soccer'}","soccer"

Jasmine Paolini and Elena Rybakina advance in Wuhan with contrasting wins. Paolini rallies past Yuan, while Rybakina defeats Cristian. Paolini nears career-best season, reaching 40+ WTA 1000 hard-court wins while Rybakina faces Noskova next.

Seventh seed Jasmine Paolini and eighth seed Elena Rybakina advanced to the third round of the Dongfeng Voyah · Wuhan Open on Wednesday with contrasting victories.

Paolini was the first to move through, rallying past local wildcard Yue Yuan 3-6, 6-4, 6-3 for her fourth consecutive win over the Chinese player. Rybakina followed soon after, defeating Romania's Jaqueline Adina Cristian 6-4, 6-3 to reach the round of 16.

Both players remain in contention for WTA Finals berths

With three spots still available for the season-ending WTA Finals in Riyadh, both Rybakina (currently eighth) and Paolini (ninth) improved their qualification chances. Based on the current standings, Rybakina must finish at least one round ahead of Paolini this week to maintain her edge in the Race to Riyadh.

Paolini closing in on Career-Best Season

Wednesday's win marked Paolini's 39th WTA main-draw victory of 2025 — one short of her career-best 40 wins from last season. She will look to match that mark when she faces Denmark's Clara Tauson next, holding a 1-0 career head-to-head lead. With a month remaining in the season, the Italian appears well on track to set a new personal best for main-draw wins in a single year.

Paolini reaches 40+ WTA 1000 Hard-Court wins

The 29-year-old also became the fourth Italian player to record 40 or more WTA 1000 hard-court main-draw wins since the format was introduced in 2009, joining Roberta Vinci, Flavia Pennetta and Sara Errani. The victory also made her the oldest player to notch 24 or more main-draw wins at WTA 1000 events in a single season since Serena Williams, who tallied 25 in 2014.

Rybakina chasing 10th Quarterfinal of the Season

Rybakina has reached nine quarterfinals on the WTA Tour this year, trailing only Iga Swiatek (13) and Aryna Sabalenka (12). She is currently tied with Jessica Pegula and Ekaterina Alexandrova, who face each other in the round of 16 in Wuhan.

Rybakina to face Noskova Next

The former Wimbledon champion will next meet in-form Czech Linda Noskova, who reached the final in Beijing last week. Rybakina leads their head-to-head 2-0, having won at Roland Garros in 2023 (6-3, 6-3) and in the Brisbane semifinals in 2024 (6-3, 6-2).

Jasmine Paolini and Elena Rybakina advance in Wuhan with contrasting wins. Paolini rallies past Yuan, while Rybakina defeats Cristian.

Ella Lloyd reflects on her season so far in F1 Academy

Jolyon Palmer's Analysis: Oscar and Lando clash in Singapore

Former Renault F1 driver Jolyon Palmer analyses whether Oscar Piastri's complaints were justified, and whether McLaren should have intervened to keep things fair between their two drivers.

Singapore provided another contentious intra-team McLaren moment, as Lando Norris overtook Oscar Piastri in the opening corners of the race, with the help of a bit of contact. It was a race where you could sense the Australian's growing frustrations, as he again had his championship lead nibbled.

There are two aspects to this: the stewarding side, and the team side – and it's the latter where Piastri's frustrations lie.

Technically speaking, this wasn't a move that was penalty-worthy from Norris. I liked the attempt. It was punchy, gutsy and quite simply had to be attempted by a driver looking to boost his hopes of winning the title after a difficult Qualifying session.

Taylor Swift, The Life of a Showgirl (Republic): For most of the last decade, it seemed not only unbeatable, it seemed un-nearable. From the time Adele set the modern-era single-week sales record in late 2015 with a jaw-plummeting 3.378 million, up until this very week, no other artist had even gotten in her general neighborhood — with only one artist even clearing the one-million mark in sales over that time period, doing so with four separate albums. (The “modern era” begins in 1991, when Luminate — then SoundScan — began electronically tracking data.)


	That one artist, of course, was Taylor Swift. After Reputation debuted with 1.22 million in sales in 2017, her next few releases debuted in the six digits, as she started making her albums immediately available for streaming on DSPs. But then, even with the albums on streaming, she cleared the million mark in sales again in 2022 with Midnights (1.14 million), then in 2023 with 1989 (Taylor's Version) (1.36 million) and in 2024 with The Tortured Poets Department (1.91 million). She was getting closer, but she still wasn't particularly close — that TTPD mark may have been several times bigger than any sales week posted by any other artist this decade, but it only got her about 57% of the way to 25. Adele's mark still looked safe for the foreseeable future.  

	











	As it turns out, it might have only been safe for one more year. On Saturday, Billboard reported that Swift's new album, The Life of a Showgirl, had debuted with 2.7 million in sales in just its first day— already blowing well past Tortured Poets, and getting 80% of the way to 25. Those numbers have steadily increased over the course of the week, and as of Billboard's latest update, have swelled to 3.2 million — fewer than 200,000 copies away from passing an Adele mark no other artist could even see with a telescope, with two days still to go in the tracking week.  


	One related all-time mark of Adele's has already fallen to Swift this week: Showgirl has posted 3.5 million in equivalent album units (EAUs), a mark which also factors in streaming equivalent albums (SEAs) and track equivalent albums (TEAs) — though because none of the album's songs were available for digital purchase individually, Showgirl has not amassed any of the latter. Because 25 was not initially available in full on streaming — only its lead single, “Hello,” was on DSPs at that point — its debut EAU number (3.482 million) was only 104,000 higher than its sales number, with that difference largely coming from TEAs. With Swift's album also breaking records on DSPs, it has already amassed 300,000 in SEAs, allowing Showgirl to pass 25 in overall units with two days to spare in the tracking week.  


	Will the sales record ultimately fall too? It could be close: While in the 25 era, a greater number of debut-week purchases were still made in-store, in 2025, a much higher percentage comes from pre-orders, with fans purchasing multiple different variants of the album. (A full 23 of those were available pre-release, across vinyl, CD, CD boxed set and cassette, some including additional collectibles, with two of the boxed sets even coming with a cardigan and a crewneck, respectively.) Hence, while Adele's 3.378 million number was picked up a little more gradually throughout its week — she was only up to 2.433 million by day four — Swift's Showgirl number is much top-heavier, “only” growing by 500,000 over the four days of reporting following that first-day number.  

	











	Still, it seems likely that Showgirl will ultimately get past the 3.378 million mark. It's already gotten a mid-week boost from four new CD variant releases, only available for a limited time, which each included unique cover art and two unique alternate versions of tracks from the original album. (One of the CD boxed sets, featuring the cardigan, was also restocked on her webstore.) As Swift continues on the promotional trail, appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Apple Music's The Zane Lowe Show in the past couple days, it would not be surprising to see more appearances to come, and possibly more new variants to be released, over the next last couple days of the week, as Adele's record appears more vulnerable than we'd ever imagined it would be again.
