After winning her second consecutive US Open title, Aryna Sabalenka went to her happy place, Greece, for some R&R. And while she was there, she spent a bit of quality time with another pretty good tennis player: 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic. Alongside their significant others, Georgios Frangulis and Jelena Djokovic, the foursome enjoyed dinner in Athens. A post shared by Aryna Sabalenka (@arynasabalenka) "But I won a lot of points against him, for the record. I hope he's gonna confirm that. I guess it was a good one. I really hope he goes all the way. He's gonna win the tournament, and I'm gonna say it was all me. "But yeah, we had a fun time in Greece. He's always open to giving me advice. Djokovic has been winning in Shanghai, and Sabalenka followed suit at the Dongfeng Voyah ¬∑ Wuhan Open. Sabalenka arrived early for this tournament -- one of the perks of withdrawing from last week's China Open in Beijing -- and prepared herself for the conditions in Wuhan, where it's been brutally humid. "Honestly, I thought this year that the US Open was quite humid, but when I came here, I realized the US Open was not humid at all," Sabalenka told reporters in her post-match press conference. "The humidity is insane, and conditions are incredibly tough. I did a great preparation in Greece, and I came here four or five days [early] to prepare for these conditions. Sabalenka will play 16th seed Liudmila Samsonova in the Round of 16. While on vacation in Greece following her US Open victory, Aryna Sabalenka spent some quality time with another pretty good tennis player: 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic.</p>

It's weird when you get these kinds of nights. ‚ÄúI've been trying to work my way there obviously for a while now, working on this type of game plan, but to execute it live on a match court at this stage against an opponent like this is a different story to practice. I'm very pleased, because to play like this means things are coming along nicely.‚Äù Yet by sinking Musetti for his fifth win against a Top 10 opponent in 2025, the 10th-placed Auger-Aliassime has moved to within 530 points of his rival as both players vie for a Nitto ATP Finals spot. The Canadian brought similar form to his clash in China with Musetti, in which he fired 24 winners, including seven aces, to his opponent's 11. The 25-year-old also saved all three break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, and he has now held in 28 of 29 service games across his three matches in Shanghai so far. After avenging his defeats in his two previous meetings with Musetti (Paris 2024 Olympics, Miami 2025), Auger-Aliassime has levelled the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series at 4-4.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The family WhatsApp group for Arthur Rinderknech and Valentin Vacherot has been busy during the Rolex Shanghai Masters. Frenchman Rinderknech and Vacherot of Monaco are cousins and are both into the quarter-finals at an ATP Masters 1000 tournament for the first time. On Wednesday, Rinderknech defeated his third seeded opponent in the tournament, taking out Jiri Lehecka 6-3, 7-5, joining his cousin in the quarter-finals. Vacherot beat Tallon Griekspoor in three sets on Tuesday night. "Our family WhatsApp group is buzzing a lot the past few days," said Rinderknech, who signed the courtside camera lens 'I follow you Val' with a heart emoji after his latest win. "I can't complain, it's great and it's reuniting the family together, at least online, having some fun. Vacherot's coach is half-brother Benjamin Balleret, who also played on the ATP Tour and reached a career-high No. Balleret says there's a lot of excitement from both families back home. "There are 20, 25 people in the WhatsApp group," said Balleret. It is basically almost all now only about tennis and where the next holidays will be and how it will be." Rinderknech is 6-3 vs. Top 20 opponents since June, after going 0-16 from the start of the 2023 season up until June. He defeated 28th seed Alex Michelsen in the second round and third seed Alexander Zverev in the third round. "My serve was good today and I am really glad,‚Äù said Rinderknech, who will improve from No. 43 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, just one spot from his career-high of No. ‚ÄúI knew it was going to be important against a player like Jiri, because he's really good on serve as well. So the serve was going to be really important. I came out a bit on fire today and it was a good match and being able to close in two sets, that was important and really happy about it.‚Äù 204 Vacherot qualified and he is the first player from Monaco to advance to an ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final and the lowest-ranked quarter-finalist in tournament history (since 2009). He's also only the third qualifier to reach the quarter-finals in Shanghai, joining Matthew Ebden (2011) and Mischa Zverev (2016). "He's playing good tennis this week and has been playing great tennis for few years now,‚Äù Rinderknech said on Vacherot. I'm really happy and glad that he's showing his best tennis this week. Vacherot, who plays 10th seed Holger Rune on Thursday, reached a career-high No. 110 in June last year but a right shoulder injury sidelined him for the second half of last year. "He couldn't serve or hit a forehand," said Balleret. "We were almost scared at some point that he couldn't play tennis for even two years or something. We tried many things and he actually tried to play at the US Open qualies but he played one match, and in the second match he retired in the second set. That was also his first career main draw in an ATP Masters 1000 tournament. He is 22-16 on the ATP Challenger Tour with his best result a runner-up in Francavilla al Mare, Italy in May. "Generally I was happy this whole week, but not like through the roof. This one is unbelievable, so much emotions. Just thinking of the tough times I had last year, even this year, and just to share that with my coach, brother, and my girlfriend, it's just unbelievable. They were also doubles partners on occasion. "I recruited him to College Station," said Rinderknech. "I was there two years ahead of him, and we had two and a half years I think in common. It was a great time together and we spent so many days doing many things and having a lot of fun, so it was really cool to be together in the same team and same place for a few years." Now the former college teammates will be watching each other in Shanghai along with their families back home.

"For me it just shows consistency and that is what I am most proud of," De Minaur said on earning 50 tour-level wins. "Showing up every single week and it is an amazing number. I am hoping for many more to finish off the year and not stay at 50. I told myself at the start of the week that it was all going to be a big mental effort to go out there and compete. I am happy to be in the quarter-finals and give myself another opportunity."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three-time champion Aryna Sabalenka improved her perfect record at the Dongfeng Voyah ¬∑ Wuhan Open to 18-0 after coming from a set down to defeat Rebecca Sramkova. Returning to action for the first time since claiming her fourth Grand Slam crown at the US Open, World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka needed a set to find her groove at the Dongfeng Voyah ¬∑ Wuhan Open. Famously, Wuhan has long been one of Sabalenka's favored hunting grounds. She won her first WTA 1000 title here back in 2018, and has yet to lose a match at the tournament. The three-time champion extended her perfect record in Wuhan to 18-0 -- the longest such streak at a single event since Caroline Wozniacki won her first 20 matches at New Haven, including three titles, between 2008 and 2012. Sramkova also came into the match with an unbeaten record in Wuhan -- albeit based on just a single match, her first-round defeat of Anna Kalinskaya. Twelve months ago, the Slovak was surging into the Top 50 after winning her first WTA title in Hua Hin and making a further two finals in Monastir and Jiujiang. Next, Sabalenka will resume her rivalry with Liudmila Samsonova in the third round. 16 seed came from a set down to defeat Sofia Kenin for the first time in three meetings, advancing 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 in 1 hour and 56 minutes. Sabalenka owns a 3-2 head-to-head advantage over Samsonova, including straight-sets victories in their two most recent encounters, at Cincinnati 2024 and Indian Wells 2025. 66-ranked Sramkova wasted no time in asserting herself on the match. Three clean winners in the first game, including two spectacular returns, enabled her to break Sabalenka's serve immediately. That set the tone for a first set in which Sramkova aimed to land the biggest blows first in every exchange, and largely succeeded. She tallied 15 winners in the set, including five aces and four returns. By contrast, Sabalenka managed just three winners off the ground. She slammed consecutive winners on both game points, and snatched the first break of the set as Sramkova sent a forehand wide. She began to withstand Sramkova's first strike, and in longer high-octane exchanges she invariably found a higher level. The four-time major champion faced two potential turning points in the last two sets, and passed both tests with clutch tennis. "I have to say she played incredible tennis, especially in the first set," Sabalenka said in her on-court interview. Three-time champion Aryna Sabalenka improved her perfect record at the Dongfeng Voyah ¬∑ Wuhan Open to 18-0 after coming from a set down to defeat Rebecca Sramkova.</p>

Leading Baptiste by a 5-2 double break, Pegula couldn't capitalize on five match points across the next two games before her countrywoman broke at love to suddenly level the scoreboard.üñ•Ô∏èüì≤ Pegula vs. Baptiste: The Match In 15 Minutes In what looked to be a decisive final set for the No. 6 seed turned into a dramatic fight to the finish line. I don't really know what to say about that match. While Baptiste came within two points of completing a stunning comeback, Pegula eventually wrapped up the battle on her seventh match point. What followed was a roar of delight‚Äîand perhaps relief‚Äîafter Baptiste's forehand flew long to end the clash at two hours and 57 minutes.‚ÄúI don't really know what to say about that match. It's been brutal,‚Äù Pegula reflected in her on-court interview. ‚ÄúI had match points, and then she started playing well. But I held tough, so yeah, that was a wild ride.‚ÄùThe emotion was understandable given Pegula's loss in Beijing to Linda Noskova four days earlier after holding three match points against the Czech. ‚ÄúI don't really know what to say about that match.
