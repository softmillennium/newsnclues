                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some humans may be part alien - after having extraterrestrial genes ‘inserted' during abductions, scientists claim. The bombshell follows a study which analysed DNA from ordinary people and folk who claim to have been snatched by ET. Researchers probed 581 families from the 1,000 Genomes Project discovering ‘large sequences' of DNA in 11 that did not appear to match either parent. As the subjects were born before 1990 the findings could not be down to the effects of gene-editing technology like CRISPR which only emerged in 2013 and can be used to inactivate, edit, or insert material to cure diseases and improve agriculture. Researchers also analysed results from individuals who self-identified as alien abductees and discovered some showed evidence of non-parental markers. Lead researcher Dr Max Rempel, founder and chief executive officer of the DNA Resonance Research Foundation, said: “Humanity may be undergoing genetic transformation.” If the evidence is confirmed Rempel said ‘it could be possible to detect which humans carry alien DNA - essentially identifying hybrids'. Rempel speculated a portion of folk with autism, ADHD, Asperger's and other neurodivergent traits could contain these alien insertions. Rempel, who holds a PHD from the Institute of Gene Biology in Moscow, Russia, accepted there was ‘no conclusive evidence yet' as scientists ‘need better datasets which are available only on approval'. The researcher's hypothesis appears to support fringe theories shared by UFO enthusiasts and conspiracy theorists who suggest alien-human hybrids exist. The Nazca Mummies found in Peru purportedly contain both human and alien DNA though some insist they are elaborate hoaxes. Both NASA and the US Pentagon have declared there is no evidence of alien life on Earth. He said: “Alien abduction experiences can stem from a variety of terrestrial factors. “We need to carefully verify these accounts before drawing conclusions about DNA.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Supernatural ended in 2020 after 15 seasons and just as many years, but love for and interest in the show endures, even all these years later. In fact, despite the 20-year gap between Supernatural's debut and the present day, Supernatural conventions, hosted by Creation Entertainment, continue to draw major crowds. At one such convention, "Creation's The Road So Far... Throughout those conversations, the Supernatural cast members discussed several of the show's biggest and, in some cases, most controversial moments, story arcs they would have liked to see, how they felt about changes made to their characters, and much more. After sustaining a gunshot wound to the head, Bobby is left fighting for his life in the hospital while experiencing a series of memories from throughout his life. The episode is beautifully shot, written, and acted, but it was still quite a blow to see this beloved character, who had been a true father to Dean and Sam, go. "Dramatically, what happened with Bobby in season 7 was gorgeous stuff to play, and it had a huge impact on the audience, and I loved it. Although it was delightful to see Beaver portraying Bobby again, it wasn't the Bobby that fans or the brothers knew and loved. Instead, this Bobby had no connection to Sam and Dean at all. However, Beaver also pointed out that the issue was in part a matter of how much time we got with this new version of Bobby, which wasn't actually all that much. Along with a joke about how, for some reason, people believed 15 seasons was enough, he said: "So, it was a little off-putting to play like I didn't really know them or didn't really care about them, because I wasn't really sure what was left other than just some grouch. Although, I think if the show had stayed on longer, there are more interesting things that could have happened with that guy, and maybe we could have seen a new relationship develop." Even as his AU self, Bobby remained a beloved character (and Beaver's portrayal was much more than just a grouch), but Beaver's overall comments reflect a desire to have seen more of the original Bobby, from seasons 1 through 7—something many fans have voiced as well. Other character departures were impacted by forces beyond the writers', or anyone else's, control. While Dean dying wouldn't have changed had COVID not happened, the finale that was planned pre-COVID would have seen the return of numerous characters and therefore a very different ending. “Plans had been made for the last episode of Supernatural, which was to take place in Dean's version of Heaven, which was a Roadhouse bar, and Sam was going to die, and he was going to come to find Dean's version of Heaven and go into this Roadhouse bar, and we would see all of these sort of fan-favorite cast members, and crew members from Supernatural actually, peppered in as extras filling out this Roadhouse. It was going to be kind of an epic scene." In addition to how thrilling it would have been to see so many fan-favorite faces and get an on-screen rendition of "Carry on My Wayward Son," this original ending would have meant a very different departure for Castiel. Ultimately, Cas didn't appear in the finale at all. Regarding that change and his feelings about Castiel's alternate ending, Collins shared: "COVID hit, and there were all of these restrictions on how many people were allowed to be in a scene at all, and also, it was a two-week quarantine for any actors that were coming into Canada, so they'd have to stay in a hotel room for two weeks, which would have been prohibitive. If you're going to bring 30 or 40 actors up and put them up for two weeks each, it's prohibitively expensive, so they had to jettison that entire script and come up with a totally new end[ing], which was two brothers outside on a bridge. COVID safety protocols were in play at that point, so yeah, it was very different, and I would have loved to have seen the original ending.” Like Castiel, Kim Rhodes' character, Sheriff Jody Mills, also appeared on Supernatural through season 15, although Jody had a less ceremonious exit from the show. In fact, Rhodes expressed that she'd been somewhat frustrated with the nature of Jody's final episode: "At the end, her last episode, there was a whole explanation where she shouldn't go [on an investigation] because what if she gets hurt, that would make Claire sad. ...The idea that, oh, Claire would be sad, didn't sit right with me. Ultimately, I did it, because that's what they wanted me to do, but I did have a couple discussions with the director and was kind of like, 'Um, could she maybe just not roll over quite so fast?'" Rhodes specifically highlighted the gendered implications of this narrative decision: "I feel like 'the feels' is often given as an excuse for a woman not to do something, and I don't like to see that. Like, give me a concrete reason; Jody is a concrete person, and this is something we have all agreed is dangerous, and yet we are going to do it to the best of our capability. So, to all of a sudden be like, 'Oh, yeah, sad is a good reason to not,' I was grumpy about that." As mentioned, Castiel's final appearance on Supernatural is in the episode "Despair." In "Despair," Castiel allows himself to be taken by the Empty, but not before telling Dean he loves him (something Dean does not say in return). This moment sparked intense debate for numerous reasons, although the most notable is tensions surrounding whether this declaration of love by Castiel was romantic. After the scene fans were not happy with different aspects of it, and there was blowback about not getting adequate acknowledgment or recognition from Dean to what Cas had said and things like that. There was some frustrating stuff to navigate there in the aftermath, but I actually was, personally, really proud of having done that and glad that we did it. And, on balance, I think it's all quite good." Regarding the idea that some fans still believe this was not a romantic declaration of love from Castiel, Collins said, "I think that is inaccurate." John Winchester's behavior as a father is one of the most discussed aspects of Supernatural to this day, and because Bobby was essentially Sam and Dean's adoptive father (he even says he adopted two boys at one point), he is often compared with John in a way that heavily favors Bobby. Specifically, many perceive John Winchester's parenting as neglectful at best, particularly given that he would leave the boys alone when they were young to go out on hunts. By contrast, Supernatural reveals sweeter and sweeter moments between Sam, Dean, and Bobby over the years, including a scene in which Bobby tosses a ball with young Dean. When asked what he thought Bobby really felt about John, particularly considering they had been friends, Beaver shared: "I think he admired him as a hunter, and they were friends, but sometimes your friends just really piss you off, and sometimes they do it consistently enough that you lose respect for them, and I think Bobby was able to see things in the boys, in their needs, in their upbringing, that somebody needed to look out for. And, being as single-minded and as easily distracted by the hunting work as John was, somebody had to step up because otherwise these kids would, you know, if there hadn't been Bobby, what would have happened to these kids?" "I think Bobby thinks deep down inside, with all his guilt and shame about all kinds of things, I think he thinks he did a good job with them and that they're good strong men in part because of him." This is certainly a sentiment that many fans share, and episodes like "Death's Door" reinforce just how much Bobby really did love Sam and Dean, even when he tried to maintain a tough exterior. One such show was the spin-off series Wayward Sisters, which would have starred several of Supernatural's most significant female characters, including Jody, Claire, and Donna, and focused on their life hunting together as a found family. In many ways, it was a new take on the classic Supernatural story. Speaking about the CW's decision not to pick up Wayward Sisters and what her feelings are about it now, Kim Rhodes said: However, Rhodes also shared that she disagreed with the decision: "Do I think it was a smart decision on the CW's part? Do I think we have maintained a presence and a connection with Wayward longer than the show probably would have stayed on the air? It's true that Rhodes, and other Wayward Sisters castmates like Briana Buckmaster, who played Donna, maintain a strong bond with the fanbase. That's especially clear during the conventions, at which Rhodes and Buckmaster co-host events like "PJ Party," which Rhodes described as being all about community. Rob Benedict's Supernatural character, Chuck, undergoes a massive evolution, initially introduced as a bit of an awkward author who is accidentally writing the story of Sam and Dean's life, then revealed to be a prophet, and, eventually, confirmed to be God himself. Far from a benevolent father, though, this version of God saw Benedict in the role of the show's ultimate villain in season 15. People may not know this, but I get the script like five days before we shoot. I remember thinking, 'Fans are going to hate me,' which is true." Now, though, Benedict's perspective on this character choice is largely positive: Misha Collins had his own arc as God, which likewise saw Castiel transform into a villain, although he didn't see himself as such. On the contrary, Castiel believed that he was going to save everyone by acquiring more and more power and filling the role of the absent God who had seemingly abandoned humans and angels alike. I mean, that felt really cool, and it was fun to do. Misha Collins and Rob Benedict ended up loving their villain twists, but there were certain character arcs and narrative choices that weren't as popular for Supernatural's stars. The Darkness as an antagonist, along with this duality, was fascinating, and Benedict expressed that more could have been done with the story: "At the end of season 11, after this big, huge buildup of Chuck and God and the Darkness, I wish there had been a little bit more to that reconciliation. Misha Collins likewise identified some plots he liked less than others for his character. I didn't want to do more of that. I didn't want to do more Nazi Cas, and, you know, there were some that I was happy to leave behind after a short period, but God Cas, human Cas, and Lucifer Cas were all things that I could have done more of because I had fun with all of them." Regarding why 'Crazy Cas,' who had suffered as a result of taking on Sam's trauma from Lucifer's cage, specifically wasn't his favorite, Collins explained: Sometimes, there were things for me as an actor on Supernatural where scripts would come in, and I would be like, I can't do this and have it feel honest to the character. A lot of the fish out of water stuff, where Castiel was just like not understanding that reference, but we were seven seasons in, and Castiel had been around humans for years and years and years at that point. Some of the writing I felt didn't really always evolve with the characters, and it felt hard to play those things, and honestly, crazy Cas was one of those things." Along with Benedict and Collins, Jim Beaver also had certain arcs he would have liked to see explored in more detail. Specifically, Beaver discussed the multiple potential romances for Bobby—including Jody Mills, Mary Winchester, and Ellen Harvelle, among others—none of which played out long-term on the show. "I would have liked to have seen what happened with that little bit of spark that happened between Bobby and Sheriff Mills because I think Bobby and Jody were a really interesting mix in terms of personality, and I think it would have been real fun to explore what a romance was like in the midst of hunting." While the cast of Supernatural therefore expressed a range of opinions on character choices, story arcs, and how the show ended, one thing is clear: these actors care about their characters and this show just as deeply as many in the fanbase do.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new daily GB News programme broadcast from Washington features climate denial, vaccine misinformation, and non-stop praise for Donald Trump – as its hosts tell the American audience that the UK needs to be ‘saved' GB News' new US-focused show is providing a regular platform for conspiracy theories – as well as the claim that the UK needs to be ‘saved' by Donald Trump's America. The right-wing millionaire added: “We need to make Britain great again… We need as many as possible of you… to appear on our channel, to tell the story of what you're doing to turn your country around.” Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage, a GB News presenter, was the headline speaker at the party. The new US show appears to be fulfilling Paul Marshall's wishes. Hosted by Bev Turner and Ben Leo live from the United States, The Late Show Live is also being shown – along with other GB News output – on Donald Trump's streaming platform Truth+ as well as other pro-Trump networks. Content from the inaugural US show – which also aired in the UK – included frequent praise for Trump and his MAGA backers by the GB News hosts and guests – and vice versa, praise for GB News by MAGA figures. Turner's heavily pro-Trump commentary has previously included her saying “I think we've got such amazingly exciting times ahead” under the President, and on another occasion, “where Trump goes, hopefully the UK will follow”. Leo also has also praised Trump, called the climate crisis a “climate scam”, and frequently uses far-right tropes about a so-called immigrant “invasion”. He has previously referred to pro-immigration politicians as “traitors” and said of the US President: “I think President Trump, in decades to come, will be remembered as one of the greatest US presidents in living history. He has shifted the Overton window on everything from mass deportations, from the trans debate, take your pick… I think his face should be carved into Mount Rushmore.” The first programme featured an exclusive interview with senior Trump advisor, former Fox News anchor and 2020 election result-denier Kari Lake, who – along with host Ben Leo – repeatedly castigated the UK on issues such as immigration, free speech, and the BBC licence fee, while calling for Reform UK's Leader Nigel Farage to become the next prime minister. On its second airing on 23 September, Turner backed Donald Trump's announcement urging pregnant women to stop taking Tylenol – the name for Paracetamol in the US – claiming, without firm evidence, that it caused autism. She said: “I just find it astonishing when Wes Streeting comes out as our Health Secretary the morning after and just says this is wrong as though he has evidence… I imagine he hasn't even read their report by the time he went on breakfast telly this morning.” “Social media is literally awash with people, pregnant women today on TikTok. I mean, it blows my mind, necking Tylenol just to say, you take this Donald Trump as they put Tylenol down their gullet with their pregnant bump. They are that politically enraged by Donald Trump that they would risk the health of their baby rather than listen to people who have their best interests at heart.” Claims that migration organisations are controlled by ‘Zionist-type people' remain online despite growing complaints That same night, right-wing American guest and commentator Stephen Kent drew a comparison between diverse London with “Pakistan or India”. GB News' Neil Oliver also made an appearance, who has platformed antisemitic conspiracy theories on his YouTube show. Kent described climate advocacy as having “religious fundamentalist energy”, suggesting it meant “we need to cleanse the Earth of human beings”. In the third show, host Bev Turner challenged a guest, Mally Smith, who had said of Trump's attack on Tylenol: “We also should have scepticism if we're taking medical advice from one guy who told us to inject bleach during Covid, which would be President Trump.” Receive the monthly Byline Times newspaper and help to support fearless, independent journalism that breaks stories, shapes the agenda and holds power to account. We're not funded by a billionaire oligarch or an offshore hedge-fund. She also suggested that Charlie Kirk's alleged killer should be killed “by firing squad”. There were dozens of arrests for offences including affray, violent disorder, assaults, and criminal damage. In another segment, right-wing British-Indian activist Aman Bhogal said that the UK Government's plans for digital IDs presented “a very, very slippery socialist slope to full-blooded communism” and that “Starmer might as well rename the country the People's Republic of North London”. The programmes so far have also seen frequent claims from hosts Turner and Leo that the Prime Minister should replicate Trump's border policy, with Turner declaring to a guest that “we” – either GB News or the UK – “are here to be saved!” On the programme's fifth airing, host Ben Leo claimed that “there's some streets [in the UK] where they don't speak English at all. According to the latest 2021 Census data, more than 91% (52.6 million) of residents in Britain, aged three years and over, had English (and English or Welsh in Wales) as a main language. A further 7.1% (4.1 million) were proficient in English but did not speak it as their main language. Guest Raheem Kassam also branded the UK civil service's “quote unquote, deep state” as “nefarious” and “entrenched”. On US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) making light of deportations, he said: “As a Brit who has 50,000 illegal migrants flooding the Channel since Labour took to power, I quite enjoyed that.” He praised Trump's military deployments to Democrat cities, adding: “I love them. Commenting on the UK Government's plans for digital IDs, he suggested that it was a form of social control, claiming, without evidence, that it could be used to monitor how much meat people eat. “Maybe they'd say… you've had too many steaks this year… Your carbon footprint is doing harm to the nation… You are eating chickpeas and gruel for the next six months until your social credit score is big enough”, he claimed. Leo added: “Call me a conspiracy theorist, but I don't care.” Commenting on the 2020 US Presidential Election which President Joe Biden won, Leo gave a nod to Donald Trump's debunked claims of election fraud, saying: “Wasn't it interesting that 20 million less [sic] people voted in the election last year than the 2020 election?… Where did 20 million votes go?” The answer is that many Democrats stayed at home. In another segment, he said that he was “pro-gun”, adding a usual (and much parodied) pro-gun trope: “I argue guns don't kill people. While he conceded that it may be preferable to have no guns, he added: “At a time when criminals, bad people, bad hombres, have access to all sorts of weapons, the only sane response can be is: you need to make sure you're armed yourself.” GB News is broadcast in the UK on streaming channels regulated by broadcast regulator Ofcom, including this new US show which airs on UK television from midnight until 2am every night. Asked about the various comments on GB News' US show, as documented in this article, an Ofcom spokesperson told Byline Times: “Our broadcasting rules apply only to content that airs on Ofcom-licensed channels. We enforce these rules fairly and proportionately, acting independently and impartially at all times.” However, this comment came before Byline Times learnt that the show was also broadcast on the channel's UK station. “Ofcom has an ongoing duty to be satisfied, as the independent UK broadcasting regulator, that broadcast licensees remain fit and proper to hold their licences. Politico reported that the US launch party of GB News' new Washington DC bureau featured “many of the Trump administration's biggest hitters” at a private members' club. The outlet added that the White House threw its “full weight” behind the launch, “offering up as speakers both Trump's Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick” and that “almost a dozen members of Trump's Cabinet were in attendance as speakers discussed a budding transatlantic alliance that could help propel Farage into Downing Street”. We want to shine a light on what's happening here.” Marshall was reportedly “close to tears” as he quoted Churchill, branding Trump and his supporters “the new world” which would replace the “old” one. “We need you to come and save us”, Politico reported. GB News did not respond to Byline Times' request for comment. Correction: This article initially stated that the US show was not regulated by Ofcom. The show is broadcast on GB News' UK channel from midnight every night.

He attended the annual convention along with his former co-star, Jared Padalecki. During a fan interaction at the SPN Philly Con on Sunday, October 5, 2025, Jensen Ackles asked one of the fans, “What show are you binging right now?” The Boys actor jokingly added, “If you say The Summer I Turned Pretty, I'm gonna kick you out of this place,” prompting laughter and applause from the audience. The fan responded by saying, “I don't know what that is.” Ackles, who was surprised by the answer, said, “You don't know what that is? The fan further added, “I'm actually making my mom watch Supernatural right now.” Both Ackles and Padalecki appreciated it and said, “Alright, mom. Also known as Creation Philadelphia, it is an annual convention focused on the popular dark fantasy TV show, Supernatural. It brings together many of the show's stars, including Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, and others. For the uninitiated, Supernatural is a popular horror drama that aired on TV from 2005 to 2020. Raised by their father, John Winchester (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan), who trained them to fight evil after their mother's mysterious death. After running for 15 successful seasons, the series concluded with a satisfying finale. Evolve Media is a publisher of leading enthusiast destinations.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The analysis, released by Casino.ca during World Space Week, combined official reporting data with digital media coverage to determine which U.S. states and Canadian provinces have recorded the most UFO sightings per capita since 1974. The results showed a clear pattern — states with active volcanoes also tend to have more UFO activity. However, when it comes to total sightings, Ontario took the lead with 22,860 recorded encounters, far surpassing other provinces. British Columbia, despite ranking third per capita, has logged 7,927 sightings — which researchers noted may be linked to the province's volcanic geography. By contrast, Newfoundland and Labrador was the least likely province to experience UFO activity, with just one sighting per 7,451 residents. Researchers and UFO enthusiasts have long noticed that UFO reports cluster near active volcanoes and deep-water regions, leading some to speculate that these areas may act as hiding places or “bases” for unexplained aerial craft.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FLORIDA – A molecular biologist is stirring up global curiosity after claiming to have discovered what could be “alien genes” embedded in human DNA, suggesting that extraterrestrial influences may have shaped parts of humanity's genetic makeup. Dr. Max Rempel, founder and chief executive of the DNA Resonance Research Foundation, analyzed genetic data from 581 complete families in the 1,000 Genomes Project and found 11 families with “large sequences” of DNA that didn't match either parent. According to Dr. Rempel, the unusual findings could not be explained by known human gene-editing technologies like CRISPR. “If confirmed, it could be possible to detect which humans carry alien DNA — essentially identifying hybrids.” In total, his study identified 348 non-parental variants that he says can't be explained by normal heredity or modern genetic manipulation. Dr. Rempel also analyzed 23andMe data from people who claimed they had been abducted by aliens, and found similar unexplained DNA markers in some of those samples. However, he cautioned that public DNA databases often contain older data from cultured cells, which can show genomic changes unrelated to extraterrestrial causes. Dr. Rempel theorized that, if confirmed, alien DNA could eventually explain unusual human abilities, including telepathy or heightened perception. He believes these sequences might represent genetic modifications introduced in ancient or recent history. “Should human genetics prove to be influenced by extraterrestrials,” Dr. Rempel added, “we'll need to consider how much alien hybridization is healthy for the planet — and which alien races we might give priority.” For now, Dr. Rempel says his team needs larger, verified DNA datasets and ethical approval to continue analyzing families who claim extraterrestrial contact.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The idea that humanity is not special on a cosmic scale has dominated science for centuries. However, a new study challenges this principle and offers an unexpected answer to the question of why we have not yet found brothers in mind. This trend gave rise to the Copernican Revolution: Earth and humanity do not occupy a privileged place, and life is supposed to be a common phenomenon in space. This logic has focused astrobiologists' attention on red dwarfs — the most common stars around which rocky planets located in “habitable zones” are most often found. Columbia University professor David Kipping decided to test whether we really are typical. Kipping conducted a Bayesian analysis to assess the probability of our existence. This is bad news for missions aimed at finding life around red dwarfs such as Proxima b. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of life on such planets, priorities have to change. Future research, such as the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), should focus on finding Earth-like planets around stars similar to our Sun. As Kipping concludes, although red dwarfs remain interesting objects, G-type stars should be the primary target in our hope of finding extraterrestrial civilizations. Earlier, we reported on where extraterrestrial life could find a home in the Solar System. Supermoon 2025 over Earth: a grand autumn celestial show in three acts</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Burgers have gotten considerably more expensive in recent years, but they remain among the most affordable food items on restaurant menus. Thought up by the chefs at Asador Aupa, a Basque cuisine eatery located in Cabrera del Mar, Catalonia, this exclusive treat reportedly took eight years of research and experimentation to develop, and its exact ingredients remain a secret. All we know is that the burger's heart-stopping €9,450 ($11,000) price tag isn't linked to gimmicky and meaningless ingredients like edible gold, but to quality ingredients, a unique dining experience, and exclusivity. Asador Aupa was founded by Bosco Jiménez, better known as BdeVikingo, a Spanish chef and gastronomic influencer known for his love of the Basque cuisine. His concept for the world's most expensive burger was simple – “luxury shouldn't be noisy, it should be unattainable.” Few people can afford to pay $11,000 for a burger, but even having obscene amounts of money isn't enough. To try the world's most expensive burger, you have to be invited by Asador Aupa. “This experience is by invitation only. Only those selected to experience it are allowed,” the restaurant's website states. However, if you do get selected by Asador Aupa, you will be invited to a private room of the restaurant, seated at a table with a few other lucky patrons, and served a delicacy cooked with the “three best meats in the world”, “the most exclusive cheese in Europe”, and a special sauce prepared with a luxury spirit. Then there is the fact that you could buy a small car with that money. It makes Golden Boy, the previous world's most expensive burger, seem cheap by comparison.</p>
