                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Analysts are refreshing their top altcoin analyst watchlist and pointing to coins that could lead the next rally. Among these picks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching interest as a rising contender with strong fundamentals and an expanding community, earning a spot on lists of the best altcoins to buy now. The Hyperliquid NFT sale $467K set off major talk across trading desks. The Hypurr NFT collection rewarded early blockchain adopters and created a trading frenzy worth over $45 million in just 24 hours. Rare NFTs like Hypurr #21 sold for nearly half a million dollars. Analysts suggest this rotation could drive a NFT-driven altcoin growth opportunity for 2025, moving capital into assets with longer-term upside. Early signs show the Hyperliquid NFT secondary market fueling this shift. While the NFT hype was intense, some investors now aim for sustainable plays — leading to a hunt for the best altcoins after NFT boom. Another key name on the top altcoin analyst watchlist is Chainlink (LINK). Whale activity has surged, with large holders adding millions of tokens. Its partnerships with major financial institutions and networks like the Canton Network have improved investor confidence. With over $100 billion secured across projects and new integrations of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol, LINK remains a favorite among crypto analyst picks for 2025. Many believe it could rally strongly as capital moves away from the NFT craze. The token has seen historic whale accumulation, with millions flowing into addresses holding between one and ten million XRP. Analysts say if ETF approvals progress, XRP could deliver strong returns. The NFT-driven altcoin rotation could send fresh liquidity its way as traders seek tokens with institutional support and potential mainstream exposure. Some experts expect price targets above $300 if ETF momentum and validator improvements hold. The NFT hype shifting to altcoins may push Solana further, as traders bet on strong infrastructure and upcoming regulatory clarity. In the middle of this reshuffle, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing fresh attention. While bigger names dominate headlines, analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE's potential for sharp upside. The project's clear roadmap, safety audit by HashEX, and transparent team have built investor trust. Its fast-growing community and active conversation around future growth position it among one of the best altcoins to buy now. As capital rotates from quick NFT flips into long-term plays, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming a crypto analyst pick for 2025. The surge of Hyperliquid NFT secondary market sales reminded traders how quickly profit can shift between sectors. As liquidity moves from NFTs to tokens, a stronger altcoin cycle may form. Big caps like Chainlink, XRP, and Solana still dominate many top 5 altcoins to watch 2025 lists, but the rise of MAGACOIN FINANCE shows investors want new growth stories with transparency and a clear plan. With NFT excitement cooling, the market is tilting toward sustainable altcoin opportunities. Q1: Why did the Hyperliquid NFT sale $467K matter for altcoins? The project completed a safety audit by HashEX and has a transparent team, making it more attractive to investors seeking security and clear development. Analysts are tracking Chainlink, XRP, Solana, and emerging names like MAGACOIN FINANCE as potential high-growth choices.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a step towards asset tokenisation, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has developed a Unified Markets Interface (UMI) which is envisioned as new next generation financial market infrastructure, its Governor Sanjay Malhotra said. Asset tokenization converts real-world assets into digital tokens on blockchain, creating fractional ownership and global trading opportunities. It offers new possibilities for the financial markets in expanding access, improving transparency and enhancing settlement efficiency through smart contracts. This interface will have the capability to tokenize financial assets and settlements using wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC),” Malhotra said at Global Fintech Fest 2025. He said that early results from the inaugural pilot has shown an encouraging signs of improving market efficiency. The governor said that there was a need to develop the digital public infrastructure for data integration to widen and deepen financial inclusion. “The Account Aggregator (AA) framework is one such endeavor. It is empowering individuals to share their financial data safely with regulated entities,” Malhotra said. They can also enrol as Financial Information User (FIU) which is an entity registered with and regulated by any financial sector regulator. “RBI is in the process of introducing standards designed to improve customer on boarding processes, enhance user interfaces, strengthen data security and increase transparency and awareness in consent management and data sharing under the account aggregator framework,” the governor said. However, its success will depend on two critical things – integrating with more financial information, especially information which is vital for assessing the financial status of an individual, and the interoperability across account aggregators. Developed in-house as a SLM trained extensively on payment data, UPI HELP currently supports English, with plans to expand to multiple domestic languages. Banking Connect platform will address long-standing net banking challenges, including cumbersome navigation, fragmented integrations, and inconsistent merchant on boarding, settlement, and dispute resolution processes. By removing these hurdles, customers can transact with greater ease and speed across online merchants using own bank app. UPI Reserve Pay will enable users to set aside (or block) a part of your credit card/pre sanctioned credit line limit to simplify repeat purchases across e-commerce platforms, food delivery apps, and cab aggregators by creating a seamless and native UPI experience.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum experienced strong ETF inflows this week, even as the ETH price USD pulled back from recent highs. Bulls are eyeing new highs — but is $5,000 within reach for ETH or an impossible ceiling? On October 7, Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) recorded a combined inflow of approximately $420.9 million, with BlackRock contributing $437.5 million — the largest single-day addition among all issuers. This marks one of the strongest daily accumulation events for ETH since ETF trading began, signaling continued institutional demand despite short-term market volatility. A sustained hold above this range could confirm a short-term reversal pattern and potentially open the way for another test of the $4,750–$4,800 resistance. Failure to maintain this support, however, may trigger a deeper correction toward $4,100–$4,000, where significant order blocks and historical demand exist on the daily timeframe. The recent ETH retracement coincided with Bitcoin's dip below $121,000, while continued its upward momentum (with a recent ATH), drawing short-term market focus toward the BSC ecosystem as traders rotated capital across large-cap altcoins. Despite near-term weakness, on-chain indicators continue to support a constructive long-term outlook for Ethereum. Data from CryptoQuant shows that total exchange reserves have declined to approximately 16.1 million ETH, representing a 25% reduction since 2022. This consistent downtrend in exchange-held supply suggests that investors are moving coins off centralized platforms and into staking contracts, self-custody wallets, and institutional-grade custodians. Such behavior typically signals reduced short-term selling pressure, as coins held outside exchanges are less likely to be used for immediate liquidation. The rise of liquid staking solutions such as Lido and Rocket Pool has also contributed to this dynamic, with staked ETH now accounting for a steadily increasing share of circulating supply. Ethereum's short-term outlook hinges on whether buyers can defend the $4,400 support area. ETF inflows remain a key bullish factor, but technical momentum has weakened in the near term.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin's latest breakout is being fueled by institutions and steady on-chain demand rather than speculation, according to new data from Glassnode. The move pushed bitcoin into fresh price discovery before consolidating near $122,500 on Wednesday. Glassnode said more than $2.2 billion flowed into U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs within a single week, marking one of the strongest waves of institutional buying since April. The firm noted that the fourth quarter has historically been bitcoin's most favorable season, as professional investors often rebalance portfolios toward higher-risk assets such as crypto and small-cap stocks. Sustained ETF demand, it added, could continue to anchor prices as year-end approaches. These accounts have apparently steadily increased their balances while larger whales have taken moderate profits, creating what the firm described as a “more organic accumulation phase.” The report highlighted the $117,000–$120,000 zone as a key area of on-chain support, with roughly 190,000 BTC last transacted there — a price range where new buyers may step in if markets pull back. While Glassnode described market conditions as “robust but maturing,” it cautioned that futures open interest and funding rates have both risen sharply. Overall, Glassnode said bitcoin's structure remains sound, underpinned by institutional demand, deep liquidity, and broad-based accumulation. Combined spot and derivatives trading on centralized exchanges surged 7.58% to $9.72 trillion in August, marking the highest monthly volume of 2025 XLM climbed back above $0.39 after a brief sell-off, with rising open interest signaling renewed institutional confidence.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that can facilitate instant money transfers, streamline bank-to-bank transactions and, potentially, be used by North Dakotans in daily life down the road. Unlike bitcoin, stablecoin is not subject to volatile price swings because it's backed by conventional financial assets, overwhelmingly the U.S. dollar. North Dakota's state-owned bank is partnering with Fiserv, a Fortune 500 financial technology company, to introduce stablecoin into the state's banking system, officials announced at a conference in Bismarck. “We have a 106-year history of commitment to North Dakota agriculture, commerce, and industry through our financial institution partnerships,” Morgan said in a statement. “As one of the first states to issue our own stablecoin backed by real money, North Dakota is taking a cutting-edge approach to creating a secure and efficient financial ecosystem for our citizens,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong, who chairs the Industrial Commission, said in a statement. Stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology, similar to bitcoin. That's why stablecoin is not subject to the volatile price swings of bitcoin and other popular digital assets. This digital currency is issued, or minted, on demand as the need arises. The Bank of North Dakota is envisioning stablecoins to primarily be used in bank-to-bank transactions, said Rick Geloff, the bank's executive vice president. Customers are unlikely to notice any significant differences in their banking experience as a result of the Roughrider coin's implementation, Geloff said, because most of the changes will take place behind the scenes. While stablecoins are used elsewhere in the world in daily transactions with a merchant or retailer, that's not the goal of North Dakota's Roughrider coin initially. “This would be more of the back end, helping banks facilitate payments to each other,” Geloff said. That could change in the future if retailers and other businesses begin accepting stablecoin as a form of payment. Dan McGonegle, senior manager of the digital assets team at accounting and consulting firm Crowe, said one advantage to stablecoin from a merchant's perspective may be significantly lower transaction fees. Stablecoin potentially offers a cheaper alternative, he said. “If I'm a large merchant, then I may have real incentive to encourage my customers to transact in stablecoins,” McGonegle said. “I think it still remains to be seen how that could all play out.” Earlier this year, Wyoming took a different approach and launched its own stablecoin known as the Frontier Stable Token. Geloff said this is an example of stablecoins being marketed for use by the public. Stablecoin has been more widely adopted in countries where the traditional currency is volatile, such as Venezuela and Argentina, Geloff said. The Bank of North Dakota began exploring stablecoin after federal legislation, called the Genius Act, was signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. This law created 80% of the federal regulatory framework for stablecoin, Geloff said, providing certainty and safeguards that have made it possible for mainstream financial institutions to begin considering using it. It's a new financial tool that offers a lot of potential, but can be daunting to begin using, said Kelvin Hullet, the bank's chief business development officer. The Bank of North Dakota is working with Fiserv to create the Roughrider coin, hosted on Fiserv's digital asset platform, for use in bank-to-bank money transfers. If the plan is approved, the Bank of North Dakota will roll out a pilot project with a handful of local financial institutions as partners. The train is leaving the station, and we need to be not only on the train, but we need to bring our local financial institutions along with us, so that they are able to utilize this new technology as it moves forward,” Hullet said.

But Lev is confident that his scrappier startup can challenge the giants. “There will be a net new winner who was built natively on this technology.” Coinflow addresses a core problem for many businesses: Even if a customer swipes their card to make a payment, it can often take hours or even days for the merchant to receive the money. By using stablecoins as the intermediary layer, Lev says they can get that time down to seconds. He argues that Coinflow is creating the next evolution for digital dollars. Stablecoin advocates argue that blockchain technology improves both, with companies like Coinflow allowing pay-ins and pay-outs through fiat so that merchants never even have to deal with stablecoins themselves. It also works across different blockchains, including Solana and Ethereum, though Lev says that most customers are agnostic about the options, caring more about speed and fees. “But now it's consensus that this is a superpower for moving money.” This exposed more merchants to the technology and, combined with the Trump administration's embrace of crypto and Congress's passage of the Genius Act in July, meant that non-blockchain companies felt more comfortable exploring it. “It has not stopped compounding since,” says Lev, who added that most of Coinflow's growth is now from non-crypto companies. The bigger challenge for Coinflow will be staving off Stripe, which has delved further into stablecoins since its acquisitions, including launching a new product last week that allows companies to create their own stablecoins. With around 25 employees, Coinflow is significantly smaller than the $106.7 billion behemoth, but Lev argues that his company's in-house talent and existing relationships across the banking and infrastructure sectors make it competitive. And as companies explore different PSPs to manage payments, he's confident the best option will win out. FORTUNE may receive compensation for some links to products and services on this website.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum digital asset treasury (DAT) Bit Digital announced on Wednesday that it had added 31,057 ETH, bringing the digital asset treasury's total to 150,244 ETH, which is valued at about $675 million. The company said that it utilized the net proceeds from its recently completed $150 million convertible note offering to fund its latest round of Ethereum purchases. Last month, it proposed a convertible note offering to purchase more ETH. Kraken Financial, Jump Trading Credit, and Jane Street Capital participated in the offering, Bit Digital said Wednesday. "The structure of our convertible notes allowed us to raise capital at a premium to mNAV, and we have deployed those proceeds directly into ETH," Bit Digital CEO Sam Tabar said in a statement. "Our guiding principle is to grow NAV per share, with the goal of creating long-term value for shareholders." NAV, or net asset value, helps measure how leveraged a DAT is by taking its total crypto assets held, minus liabilities, and then dividing the assets by the company's shares. An adjusted NAV, or mNAV, takes into account discounts and restrictions on tokens purchased. Tabar told The Block last week that many companies building Ethereum treasuries are using "extremely risky" debt to acquire ETH. He said DATs should consider using unsecured debt financing over secured debt financing as a better hedge against a bearish market. Founded in 2015, Bit Digital pivoted from a bitcoin mining operator to becoming "a pure-play" Ethereum staking and treasury company in July.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's a huge change from the old way of doing things. If the SEC achieves its goal, we could see more innovation like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), which aims to transform the original digital currency. It's designed to give companies building in DeFi, tokenization, and other new financial areas some breathing room. They'll receive temporary relief from specific SEC rules, which means they can test out their ideas without incurring substantial expenses on lawyers or facing constant litigation. This direct observation will help them create better, more sensible rules for the future. If we're being real, Bitcoin is the king of crypto, but it's not exactly a speed demon. It's like a secure, digital vault, but you wouldn't use it to buy a coffee because transactions are slow and can be pricey. It's a groundbreaking new project that has already raised $22 million, designed to address this problem by building a Layer-2 network directly on top of Bitcoin. Think of it like a new high-speed lane on the Bitcoin highway. This new lane allows for super-fast, super-cheap transactions without compromising Bitcoin's rock-solid security. It's a game-changer that could finally make Bitcoin useful for everything from quick payments to cool new decentralized apps and games. Bitcoin Hyper utilizes the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to power its Layer 2 network. This means you get Bitcoin's top-tier security with speeds that feel like Solana. To use it, simply send your Bitcoin through a Canonical Bridge, which essentially locks it up and provides a wrapped version for use on the new, faster network. Now, this wrapped $BTC is ready to party. You can use it for fast transactions and explore various DeFi projects. If that comes to fruition, you'd be looking at returns of 2345% on today's price if it can reach our end-of-2025 price prediction of $0.32.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Created by the mysterious individual or team known as Satoshi Nakamoto which remains unknown to the public to this day, BTC is the biggest and most valuable asset, currently with a $2.4 trillion market cap and a price of $121,740 per coin as of October 8. However, despite being the most important cryptocurrency ever created, Bitcoin is heavily outdated as of 2025, at least when it comes to its technology. Its technical limitations were clear to many since the early days, as they noticed that Bitcoin's network is slow, capable of processing only a handful of transactions per second, which eventually led to the high cost of transfer fees. Over the years, there have been several attempts to create scalability solutions that would speed things up, and while they saw different degree of success, Bitcoin is about to see a new arrival that many view as the next crypto to explode, and that might change things for its entire network - Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER). It was designed to break through Bitcoin's core limitations, namely slow transactions, high fees, and the lack of programmability, by introducing an L2 chain that would solve these problems. It can achieve this by integrating the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), which will bring smart contracts to Bitcoin's system through a decentralized Canonical Bridge, thus enabling seamless and secure transfers between Bitcoin's base layer and Bitcoin Hyper. With this solution, Bitcoin Hyper can reimagine what is possible to do on the BTC network, and it believes that this will change it entirely, even going as far as to say that 2025 will be remembered as the year when Bitcoin Hyper changed everything. Given its potential, Bitcoin Hyper is now widely considered among many investors as the next crypto to explode. It features a total public supply of 21 billion HYPER tokens, which are split to satisfy several needs. 15% will be granted to users in the form of staking rewards As mentioned, the presale is still active, and so far, Bitcoin Hyper has managed to raise over $22.87 million, becoming one of the most successful ICOs in 2025. Its token, HYPER, is currently selling for $0.013085 per token, but its price will slowly increase as the presale continues to move from one stage to the next, until it finally sees listing. After that, its price will be at the mercy of market trends, demand, usage, and other similar factors that typically make crypto prices move. The channel's experts recently reported on the progress of Bitcoin Hyper's ICO, pointing it out as the next 1000x crypto, and recommending to their subscribers to buy it now, especially in light of Bitcoin already pumping. This includes privileged access to dApps, presales, and early-stage features. Holders will also be able to participate in community incentive programs and token distribution events. In other words, HYPER does not lack when it comes to utilities, and it will even act as the governance token of the Bitcoin Hyper network, allowing users to vote on various decisions and contribute to shaping the project's future. For now, however, HYPER is still in presale, available at a very low price, representing a unique opportunity to add it to your portfolio before its value skyrockets. However, investors should still do their own research before buying, and only purchase the token if they find that they share the opinions of the experts, since there are no guarantees in the crypto sector, and if you decide to buy an asset, you should always know exactly why you are doing it. This is not financial advice; always do your research.

This innovative approach not only boosts security and privacy but also gives users the reins over their personal data. By harnessing blockchain technology, it creates an open and permissionless financial ecosystem. Forget about middlemen; DeFi allows users to interact directly with financial services. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become all the rage, serving as unique digital assets that can represent everything from art to virtual real estate. The Imperia NFT collection serves as a prime example of how NFTs can be harnessed for identity verification in DeFi. By linking NFTs to decentralized identifiers (DIDs), users can attach verifiable identity data points, creating a solid framework for identity verification that is both auditable and privacy-preserving. This decentralization cuts reliance on centralized authorities, making the verification process more efficient. Security and Privacy: Blockchain technology guarantees that identity credentials are stored securely. Cryptographic protection helps minimize fraud and identity theft while keeping sensitive information under the user's control. Regulatory Compliance Meets Privacy: Users can store verified KYC credentials in their wallets, allowing them to share selective identity data. This helps DeFi platforms adhere to AML/KYC regulations without sacrificing user privacy. Trust and Transparency: The public verification of identity data linked to the Imperia NFTs builds trust among users, creators, and platforms, which is crucial for secure digital transactions. Integrating decentralized payroll tools and complying with regulatory frameworks can be challenging. However, the emergence of crypto-friendly payroll platforms and decentralized banks offers startups a chance to innovate. By employing NFTs and decentralized identifiers, this approach overcomes the shortcomings of traditional systems, paving the way for a more inclusive and effective digital identity ecosystem. As DeFi keeps evolving, the Imperia NFTs stand as a testament to what blockchain can achieve in redefining identity verification and empowering users in the digital age.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) opposed the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA), arguing in a letter to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday that it would pose significant risks to workers and the financial system. He added that the bill will enable the crypto industry to “operate in wider and deeper ways in our financial system without sufficient oversight or meaningful safeguards.” Related: Crypto execs meet US lawmakers, discuss Bitcoin reserve, market structure bills He added that rather than insulating workers from the crypto volatility, the bill “would increase workers' exposure by greenlighting retirement plans like 401(k)s and pensions to hold this risky asset.” Calemine also claimed that the taxpayer-backed Deposit Insurance Fund, which protects consumer bank deposits, would be subject to greater risk if banks were allowed to custody crypto. He also said that the legislation “codifies the tokenization of securities and assets” such that private companies have a pathway to “create a shadow public stock” outside of Securities and Exchange Commission oversight. The AFL-CIO compared these potential risks to those that caused the 2008 financial crisis, which was high-risk lending by commercial banks. Calemine concluded with a call to oppose the Responsible Financial Innovation Act, which is still a discussion draft and not yet formally introduced.
