                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kent, Wash.-based Stoke Space Technologies today revealed that it has raised $510 million in fresh funding to accelerate development of its fully reusable medium-lift Nova rocket. The Series D funding round, let by Thomas Tull's US Innovative Technology Fund, comes in conjunction with a $100 million debt facility led by Silicon Valley Bank. ‚ÄúThis funding gives us the runway to complete development and demonstrate Nova through its first flights,‚Äù Stoke co-founder and CEO Andy Lapsa said in a news release. If all goes according to plan, the first Nova rocket is expected to lift off next year from Launch Complex 14 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The company was founded in 2019 by Lapsa and Tom Feldman, a fellow veteran of Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space venture. SpaceX has pioneered reusability for its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy first-stage boosters, and Blue Origin has designed the booster of its New Glenn rocket to be reusable. But recovering and reusing the second stage of an orbital-class rocket is a tougher nut to crack. Stoke Space has developed a liquid-cooled heat shield that could open the way for second-stage reusability, which would lower the cost of access to space. The prospect of cheaper launches is why the startup has attracted nearly a billion dollars in funding from investors including Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Industrious Ventures and Y Combinator. In today's announcement, Tull praised the Stoke team's vision and said he was ‚Äúproud to support their mission in defining the next chapter of U.S. aerospace.‚Äù Stoke also plans to invest in its supply chain, its Boltline software for project management, and the infrastructure that will be needed for high-cadence launch operations. While SpaceX and Blue Origin are focusing on heavy-lift rockets such as Starship and New Glenn, Stoke is targeting the medium-lift launch market. Even though Stoke Space hasn't yet launched a rocket to orbit, it was added to the U.S. Space Force's list of providers for national security launches this year. ‚ÄúWe've designed Nova to address a real gap in launch capacity, and the National Security Space Launch award, along with our substantial manifest of contracted commercial launches, affirms that need,‚Äù Lapsa said. Stoke Space brings in $260M for further development of its fully reusable rocket Stoke Space reportedly raising another massive round of funding for its Nova rocket program Stoke Space scores a success in first test firing of engine for reusable Nova booster</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last week, OpenAI released Sora 2, the latest version of its AI video creator, along with a new Sora app for making and sharing those videos. The new tool has led to an explosion in realistic AI videos on social media, including plenty of fresh discussion about intellectual property rights. But one of the oddest things to emerge with Sora 2 is a new crop of videos showing AI protesters. Specifically, supporters of President Donald Trump appear to be making videos of protesters being brutalized by the federal agents and troops who have been sent to U.S. cities. Trump has most recently tried to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago, and while those deployments have been delayed by the courts, those cities are still crawling with ICE agents terrorizing immigrant communities. ‚ÄúWhat's your name, soldier?‚Äù the AI protester yells repeatedly. The video has been shared on several platforms, including TikTok and X, where many people don't seem to understand it's AI. The actor James Woods, a Trump supporter who frequently shares right-wing memes on X, wrote on Tuesday about the video, ‚ÄúCouldn't get better than this. Another video that's become popular on Facebook, Instagram, and X shows AI protesters shouting ‚Äúno queso, no cheese,‚Äù apparently a racist riff on the common protest chant ‚Äúno justice, no peace.‚Äù The AI protesters in the video are also sprayed with a chemical agent. The video has gotten over 1.5 million views on X alone, with the caption, ‚ÄúLmfao, that was beautiful and before you ask I voted 100 for this! The phrase ‚ÄúI voted for this‚Äù has become a common thing for far-right supporters of Trump to say when something particularly brutal has happened to their political opponents. Lmfao, that was beautiful and before you ask I voted üíØ for this!! But unfortunately, that kind of watermark isn't enough for most people these days to differentiate between fake and real content. The shorter Sora videos are also being compiled into larger compilations of AI-generated fakes, like in this one on X that includes jokes about the protesters being paid. It's a common right-wing accusation that all the people protesting Donald Trump are actually paid to be there, often by liberal activists like George Soros. The most curious thing about all of these fake protester videos is that there are plenty of real videos to share. David Black stood in front of a Chicago-area ICE facility and began to pray. Another one of several videos showing protesters getting brutalized while doing nothing wrong was recently captured in Portland. A woman is seen simply talking with police before she's sprayed for absolutely no discernible reason. Outside the Portland ICE facility, a man and a woman were standing and talking to a pair of cops with shields when one of them draws his pepper spray and unloads it into her face. ‚Äî Dispatches and drama from Seattle protest scene (@bennetthaselton) October 3, 2025 But real videos of a pastor or a woman getting treated with unnecessary violence don't really fit the narrative that President Trump and his fascist goons are trying to sell. Trump has claimed the reason he's sending agents and troops to U.S. cities is that they're overrun with crime. In reality, violent crime is near a 50-year low, and Trump is simply trying to strike fear into the hearts of ordinary Americans as his thugs disrupt countless lives. Perhaps that's why we're seeing so many fake videos of protests on social media right now. They need a pretext to justify their brutal crackdown on working people. Trump has even shared an AI video of himself promoting a magical ‚Äúmed bed‚Äù that can cure all diseases. Remember when the president saw a photoshopped image of the letters ‚ÄúMS-13‚Äù on someone's hand back in April and insisted it was real? And his followers are even dumber, as they spread AI slop far and wide, creating an alternative reality where sadistic troops dole out punishment to the left on American streets. Unfortunately, you don't need AI to see so much brutality right now. And if Trump has his way, you're going to see a lot more of it very soon. Turns out a lot of people's creativity is limited to what someone else has already made. Valuations appear stretched especially for AI companies, the bank said. The AI company's latest report provides more info on how it detects misuse of its chatbots. The surge in new AI data centers has sparked concern among environmentalists and public health experts alike.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If there's one thing an A-series Pixel device is known for, it's giving you a lot for a little less. In keeping with that A-series reputation, the Pixel Buds A-series were a good value when they were released in 2021. For $99, they're fairly feature-rich and leaned into a design that was comfortable and provided enough passive noise cancellation to satisfy lots of people who bought them. There was one thing they didn't have, though: active noise cancellation, better known as ANC. That may have been fine for the time, but this is 2025, and while companies might've been able to get away with ANC-less wireless earbuds a few years ago, even today's more budget-friendly picks come with the ability to cancel noise both actively and passively. Clearly, Google knows that, which is why the Pixel Buds 2a add ANC and still manage to keep the price down. That price hike, while not ideal, does come with some notable improvements, including ANC. It's hard to overstate how important ANC is in a pair of wireless earbuds nowadays. It's one of those things where, if you've never had a pair of ANC buds, you might not get it, but once you have ones that cancel noise, non-ANC buds feel untenable. For the Pixel Buds 2a, Google claims that its ANC is actually 1.5 times better than the ANC on the Pixel Buds Pro (first-generation), meaning you're actually getting more in that department than Google's Pro-series. Having used both the Pixel Buds Pro and the Pixel Buds 2a, I can confirm; Google is giving you more ANC than you might expect here. At my office, I was able to tune out plenty of noise to the point where I couldn't even hear my coworkers chatting. I can still hear some train noise with the Pixel Buds 2a in, but not what I would describe as a disruptive amount. They're nowhere near the same level of ANC as high-end options like Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds (2nd Gen), but those wireless earbuds also cost $299, so that comparison is a little unfair. I did experience multiple moments where it felt like ANC dropped off momentarily, but it's hard to say why; it was noticeable in louder environments like riding the subway or walking down the street past construction. For reference, the Pixel Buds 2a don't have adaptive ANC, nor do they have Adaptive Sound, which is a feature in the Pixel Buds Pro 2 that adjusts the volume in loud environments. The issue wasn't enough to scare me away from the Pixel Buds 2a, but it is something that I noticed in my testing. If there is some kind of issue, it's something that could most likely be fixed in a software update. Overall, my impression is that you're getting a good amount of ANC for the value, and the overall package feels even greater once you start factoring in the fit and feel. As nice as some wireless earbuds, like Nothing's Ear series can look, sometimes the stems have a tendency to feel unwieldy and have a much higher chance of looking wonky once they're in your ears if they aren't aligned on each side. The Pixel Buds 2a, on the other hand, fit snugly in your ear and maybe even more so than other generations, both Pro and non-Pro. The wireless earbuds feel even more planted in your ears as a result, and inserting them requires less futzing. I'm fairly sure that they contribute to some passive noise cancellation, too, both because it makes ensuring the buds are snug an easy feat, and then it also creates a bolstered seal on the outside, which probably blocks more noise. The pair I tested came in an ‚ÄúIris‚Äù color, which is a light purple that some may describe as lilac. Iris, and the Pixel Buds 2a, are a proper antidote to AirPods‚Äò homogeneous white that's both iconic and a little boring at this point. If there's one thing I hate, it's feeling like my pockets are clogged up with an unnecessarily thick charging case. This generation of A-series buds has 7 hours of ANC playback, which is up from 5 hours in the previous generation. Anything around 6 hours of ANC playback is better than average in my experience, and obviously much better than 5 hours, which is frankly not up to par. There is one caveat here, though, and that's in the case. The Pixel Buds 2a case is rated for 20 hours of battery if you're using ANC and 27 hours with ANC off, and chances are, you're going to be using ANC most of the time. The first-gen Pixel Buds A-series are rated for 24 hours of battery life, though there was no ANC in the equation to compare against. In my testing, listening to the Pixel Buds 2a in hour increments over the course of a few days, I found those estimates to be accurate, which slots them in the upper range for battery life among other wireless earbuds in this price range. When it comes to sound, I've never been particularly impressed with the Pixel sound (that goes for the Pixel Buds Pro, too), but I don't dislike it either. For the Pixel Buds 2a, I'd say that general attitude still applies. These aren't particularly bass-y buds, which I'm fine with, but they're solid all-around performers. I listened to Daft Punk's ‚ÄúDa Funk,‚Äù and I find the soundstage on the Pixel Buds 2a is generally smaller and less bombastic than competitors like OnePlus Buds 4, which really crank up the bass and low end in particular. No matter what the reason is, my take is that Pixel Buds 2a are serviceable in the sound department, but they didn't blow me away. If you're a hi-fi audio kind of person and pay attention to which frequencies you can hear and how well, these probably aren't the pick for you, even at this price point. I wouldn't say that the Pixel Buds 2a are overflowing with features, but you've got a lot of your bread and butter here. There's a transparency mode for when you want to use the wireless earbuds without ANC; there are tap controls for activating a voice assistant, play/pause, and track skipping; there's also hands-free Gemini and Gemini Live if either of those is your thing. I used Gemini Live a bit to explore an album I was listening to (Pavement's ‚ÄúTerror Twilight‚Äù) by summoning a live chat with the command, ‚ÄúHey Google, let's talk live,‚Äù and then asking when the album I was listening to came out. First off, props to Gemini for even knowing what I was talking about; it understood that I was listening to a song on Spotify and wanted more context. Tastefully, Gemini recommended Mudhoney and not Nirvana or Pearl Jam. Overall, Gemini Live can be kind of fun, though I don't think I'll be springing for a chat with a chatbot too often. And if that's your thing, it's nice to have such easy access built right into the Pixel Buds 2a. ¬© Raymond Wong / GizmodoAs always, the Pixel Buds 2a work best with Android devices, especially if you're going to use the Pixel Buds app, which you still cannot download on iOS. There's also spatial audio, which is increasingly a thing on lots of wireless earbuds, though I'm not super certain that anyone cares to use it for most things. As a bonus, you also get a very comfy and nice-looking pair of wireless earbuds that, while not winning any superlatives from me, still hold it down in the sound department. So, to answer the question we started with, ‚ÄúAre the Pixel Buds 2a a good deal?‚Äù Let's just say I would not try to stop you from buying a pair. Even with AI, Google's third-gen foldable can't clear the Z Fold 7 bar. Trump admin believes their aim is to stifle startups. You'll have to pay through the nose for it.</p>

It features support for up to 160Hz at 4K or a rapid 320Hz refresh rate at 1080p, thanks to dual mode support. That means you can use it for higher-fidelity gaming and rapid-response shooters, the preferred mode of engagement for competitive players. ASUS' ROG Strix XG27UCG is a 27" Fast IPS LCD monitor with dual mode support ‚Äî it supports 4K resolution at 160 Hz, or 1080p resolution at 320 Hz. This makes it a great buy for gamers who enjoy both competitive titles that require twitch reflexes as well as single-player games with lush visuals. The 27-inch display will offer great pixel density, HDR 400 brightness, DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.1, and USB-C. - Stephen Warwick We love a good M.2 SSD deal here at Tom's Hardware, and my personal favorite this week is the excellent Samsung 4TB EVO Plus. You can obviously save more by choosing less capacity, but in terms of value, I don't think you can do better if you can grab one at the $200 mark. That's a whopping 39% discount and the lowest-ever price we've seen on this model. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus 4TB is an interesting drive with PCIe behavior that skirts the border between Gen 4.0 and Gen 5.0. With sequential read and write speeds of up to 7,250/7,250 MB/s, this is a fast drive. You might want a bit more performance from something like a Samsung 9100 Pro or indeed the 990 Pro, but you'll pay considerably more for either. But if you're looking for a bargain (and your desk or wall has the space for it), LG's 48-inch 2025-model C5 OLED TV just might be the best gaming screen bargain during Prime Day. It's currently on sale for its lowest-ever price of $899, and can go as high as 144 Hz refresh in gaming mode. I speak from experience when I say that much screen real estate, a 4K resolution, and inky blacks are tough to pass up. This 2025 model of LG's 48-inch 4K OLED TV tops out at 144 Hz for gaming, has a max rated brightness of 1,400 lumens, and would make a great (big) gaming and productivity monitor. You'll either want a deep desk so you can sit far enough from the screen or, as I've done, you'll want to wall mount your screen so it's right up against the wall. I don't have to do any squinting when reading text on my 55-inch display.If you want a big screen without having to pay the most money, I'd highly recommend using a TV as your monitor for gaming and work. And at $899, LG's 48-inch C5 OLED is my pick for the best high-end gaming monitor deal during this Prime Day. I'm tempted to buy one to replace my 2021 model which, yes, does have slight burn-in (not from gaming or work, but oddly from my Amazon Fire Stick's home screen), but I don't want to step "down" to a 48-inch screen or pay the $400 more that the 55-inch C5 LG OLED costs. This is a deal that I can personally stand behind, because I bought the Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphone back in December 2024, and it wasn't this cheap! A compact set of dual microphones that work with any Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android or iOS device. They offer superb audio clarity and active noise cancellation to focus on the conversation and not the background noise. I just clip the microphone to my shirt using the magnetic back and I am ready to go. Did I leave one on my jumper and put it back in the wardrobe? I bought these microphones with content creation in mind. The Hollyland Lark M2 Wireless Lavalier Microphones come with a kit bag full of extras. When not in use, the two microphones and the receiver are contained in a plastic case with onboard LiPo battery charging, just like Airpods. When you are done with them, throw them in the box and they charge ready for the next interview. I genuinely love these microphones, they are much easier to use than clunky wired mics, and I can use them across many different devices without the need for drivers. Despite the fact that most laptops moved to USB-C charging years ago, PC makers still ship systems with bulky power bricks and permanently attached cables. If you don't have a gaming laptop, a MacBook Pro, or something else that needs more than 45W for full-speed charging, this slim unit from Baseus might be your best option ‚Äì especially while it's on sale for just $30. This pocket-friendly charger is just 0.66 inches thick, with fold-down prongs and two USB ports. Smaller than a deck of cards, with fold-down prongs so you can slip it in pretty much any pocket, it's great for traveling. And its long, thin frame does a better job than most chargers of staying in loose hotel-room power outlets. But even if you're just commuting to work or school, this charger is appealing even just for its slim profile and light weight. Its USB-C port can deliver up to 45W for your laptop, while its USB-A port can deliver up to 20W for your smartphone or other portable device. I'd personally prefer to see two USB-C ports for charging, but then you'd have to remember which one was the higher-power port for your laptop. We have a plethora of electronics in our home, and typically being the "IT person" in the family we are called upon to do all manner of tasks. This year I've recovered lost photos from a hard drive, and repaired a few smartphones for clumsy family members. This is where a kit, like the Strebito Electronics Precision Screwdriver Set comes into its own. Torx, Slot, Phillips, Pozi, Hex and many other obscure bits are included in this great set. Spudgers, picks, cleaning cloths, brushes and tweezers are all wrapped up on a travel case ready for the next fix. There are also Petalobe, Tri-Wing and nut drivers for those special tasks. This small kit has all the tools to get you started with your first / next PC build. You get a precision screwdriver with 48 different bits (slot, Phillips, Pozidrive, Petalobe, Tork, Stand-off driver, Gamebit (for Nintendo consoles), Torx / Torx security and many others. If you don't want / need the full 142 piece set, for $9 there is the 64 piece kit which breaks it down to the essentials and folds into a rather lovely hard plastic case. A go-to screwdriver set for the office, workshop and your go-bag. With all the bits you will need to fix a multitude of problems. I personally own this and have done for the last year. Along with my larger HOTO NEX 01 PRO, these two screwdrivers do 80% of the hard work in my office / workshop. If you are taking stuff apart, or putting it back together, the HOTO precision electric screwdriver will make short work of it. If you're questing after an OLED panel, maximum pixel count, and sky-high refresh rates, your monitor will put a huge dent in your wallet. And it's back down to just $219, an all-time low price that we haven't seen since July. This 34-inch ViewFinity monitor from Samsung comes with a 100Hz refresh rate, WQHD (3440 x 1440) resolution, AMD FreeSync, and more. The ViewFinity S50GC uses a VA panel, which should help deliver good black levels and contrast. But don't expect great off-angle viewing or the best gaming experience. This monitor is more of an all-rounder than a budget gaming screen -- though the 100 Hz refresh and FreeSync support will help keep things smooth while gaming.The 21:9 aspect ratio is nice for productivity, letting you put documents or websites side-by-side while you work. And the 300 nits brightness rating, while certainly not stellar, should be fine for work or play so long as you aren't next to a big window. Unlike a lot of ultrawide monitors, this one is a flat panel, rather than curved, which I personally prefer for everything other than gaming.If you're upgrading from an old 24-inch screen or you need a second or third display for work and occasional gaming, this looks to be a great option for the price. It's easy to forget about the little things that make up your setup. Prime Day and other sales events are a great time to pick up and refresh that old mouse pad and, more importantly, if you use a keyboard every day for work or gaming, a nice wrist rest. Many people either don't have wrist rests or settle for the included rock-hard slabs of plastic that come attached to many gaming keyboards, and these often don't provide much comfort or support over long typing sessions. If you spend a significant amount of time on a keyboard, you're risking the chance of developing musculoskeletal disorders and other health issues without support, so do grab a wrist support of some kind; they needn't be expensive. A cloth covering and EVA foam interior provide comfortable, long-lasting wrist support. This wrist rest combo comes in a multitude of different color combinations. A wooden base and leather-wrapped memory foam upper, plus non-slip silicon pads, make up this wrist support. A soft memory foam wrist rest with stickers that you can use to attach the wrist pad to your keyboard if you so wish. An ABS-plastic base with non-slip pads, a soft leather surface, and high-density sponge filling. We've spotted a range of wrist rest deals around the sales events, so if you're current wrist rest is looking a little bedraggled or dirty, check out some of these deals, and you might find a cheery little replacement. Whether it's a Steam Deck, a Switch 2, or just your smartphone, we've all had handheld devices die on us while we'd still prefer to be using them. Baseus' 100W charging cable makes that a little bit easier, with its flat top and angled USB-C port, flat braided cable, and 100W, 5A charging capabilities. Unexpectedly, I've found the cable's flat design and braided texture to be one of its best features. Want to use your mobile device while it's charging without having to contort your fingers around the USB-C port? Baseus has you covered with its angled, flat-topped braided charging cable. It supports up to 100W and is available in 3.3 or 6.6-foot lengths. Available in both 3.3-foot and 6.6-foot lengths, the cable can make charging and gaming (or just scrolling on your phone) a lot more comfortable. The shorter model is better if you're charging off a battery pack nearby, but I'd definitely opt for the 6.6-foot model (which costs about $5 more) if you're going to use the cable from a charger plugged into a wall.After taking the Baseus cable on a few trips with long traveling days and plane rides, though, the most handy feature about it for me is that I can always identify it by touch when it's buried in my bag (and often surrounded by other cables). And the flatness means it doesn't tangle or easily get wrapped around other wires or whatever random stuff I've shoved in my backpack while traveling.If that sounds useful to you, I'd highly recommend this cable, especially if you're mobile gamer, as the flat, angled charging end does make holding and using your device while it juice up a lot more comfortable. Just note that the large top of the USB-C port can block adjacent ports or vents on gaming handhelds, so it may not be ideal for your particular use case, so consider port placement before buying. Also, as with most charging cables, this one isn't great for data. While the cable does technically support data transfers, they're capped at pokey USB 2.0 speeds. There's no better way to instantly up your audio game than by switching from a headset mic to a standalone USB gaming microphone, and now's the perfect time to do it: the HyperX QuadCast S, one of our long-time favorite gaming mics, is currently on sale at Amazon for $79.99 ‚Äî a 50% discount off MSRP, and the lowest price we've ever seen it at. It features four selectable polar patterns, a built-in shock mount, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute feature, and it will make you sound practically professional right out of the box. The QuadCast S features bright, customizable RGB lighting and records sound at 48 kHz / 16-bits. It features four selectable polar patterns ‚Äî cardioid, stereo, bidirectional, and omnidirectional ‚Äî so it's great for capturing one person's voice but can also be used to capture multiple voices and/or ambient noise, in a pinch (though you'll still want multiple mics if you're regularly capturing multiple voices). It features on-mic controls, a 3.5mm headphone jack for direct, zero-latency monitoring, and HyperX's excellent tap-to-mute implementation. Read our full review of the QuadCast S here. Read our full review of the QuadCast here. The router is now priced at just $79, which represents a 20 percent savings. It even includes four WAN ports for your wired needs and a USB 3.0 port. The sub-$100 pricing is achievable partly because the Archer BE3600 is a dual-band router, rather than a tri- or quad-band like more premium Wi-Fi routers. However, if you don't have many 6 GHz devices in your home, or you simply don't want to pay at least twice the price for a tri-band router, you can't go wrong with TP-Link's entry-level offering.The router features a 2.5 GbE WAN port, one 2.5 GbE LAN port, and three GbE LAN ports. The Alienware AW3423DWF has perennially been one of our favorite gaming monitors, and for good reason. The monitor has a suggested retail price of $899, but this price has steadily decreased since its introduction three years ago. When we last visited the monitor just over a month ago in late August, it was selling for $549. However, for Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days, the price is even lower at just $521.99. The Alienware AW3423DWF is available at Amazon for its lowest price to date, which is half its launch price. It has a 34-inch curved QD-OLED panel and is AMD FreeSync Premium Pro certified. The AW3423DWF is one of our top-rated gaming monitors, and features a 34-inch QD-OLED panel with a 3440 x 1440 resolution, 165 Hz refresh rate, a 0.1 ms response time, 1800R curve and support for AMD FreeSync Pro/Nvidia G-Sync. The monitor also comes equipped with two DisplayPort 1.4 ports, one HDMI 2.0 port, and a 4-port USB 3.2 hub. Anker is no stranger to the charger market, offering a wide variety of product lines to meet your every need. Recently, at IFA 2025, the company launched a new line of Nano charging bricks, and they are already seeing some healthy discounts for those in the market. A 4.9-foot braided USB-C cable is also included in the box. However, there's a reason for its extra girth: it has a built-in, retractable USB-C cable that extends to 2.3 feet. The charger also has a second, run-of-the-mill USB-C port. Both chargers feature Anker's usual attention to detail and high-quality construction, along with folding power plugs to save even more space in your travel bag. Netgear offers an extensive range of Wi-Fi 7 mesh routers that we've covered extensively. They offer good overall performance, a variety of ports, and solid software. However, our primary hangup has been regarding pricing. With Amazon's latest Prime Day at hand, the pricing concerns are being tackled head-on. The company's mainstream Orbi 770 series is now up to 36 percent off, making it a more palatable choice for enthusiasts seeking a tri-band system. You'll get 11 Gbps aggregate speeds and a total of four 2.5 GbE ports on the main router. You'll get 11 Gbps aggregate speeds and a total of four 2.5 GbE ports on the main router. I've needed a keyboard for my new standing desk for several weeks, but I held out to find a steal during Prime Big Deals Day. This year hasn't disappointed, with several models available at deep discounts. This version is wireless and doesn't have a keypad. Its customizable dual-actuation OmniPoint 2.0 hall effect switches, OLED display, bright per-key RGB lighting, and flexible connectivity help it stand out from the pack. I just pulled the trigger on this ten-keyless Apex Pro model with HyperMagnetic switches so I can get a taste of that Hall Effect action. This model scored four out of five stars in our in-depth review. This system allows one key to trigger two different actions, depending on how far down you press it, all of which are completely user-configurable in software. The board also touts up to 40 hours of on-battery use. The company also includes a braided seven-foot USB-C to USB-A cable for charging. This wired keyboard has Cherry MX Red switches and features 8000Hz Hyper-Polling. This version is wired and has a numpad. Its customizable dual-actuation OmniPoint 2.0 hall effect switches, OLED display, bright per-key RGB lighting, and flexible connectivity help it stand out from the pack. The full size wired version, which includes a keypad, is also on sale right now. Also, if you're looking for other more standard fare, there's a competitively-priced K70 RGB Pro from Corsair, which touts Cherry MX Red switches and 8000 Hz polling, on offer for $105, or 28% off. If the imminent loss of Windows 10 support (in a matter of just a few days now) is closing in on you, then you might be on the hunt for a productivity-focused laptop. You also get a 512GB SSD, a far superior mini LED display, and far more ports than the MacBook Air. This 13-inch MacBook Air uses Apple's latest chip, M4, without a fan for silent operation. These latest Windows and Mac machines also all feature the much-touted AI feature sets, with Copilot+ for Windows PCs and Apple Intelligence for Macs. This Samsung monitor was a popular item when it was on sale last year, and it is now back at a shockingly good price on Amazon. This 27-inch 1080p Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best. Amazon says this gaming monitor is on a limited sale, so you'll have to act soon if you want to get a relatively large sized VA panel at this exceptionally low pricing. Get the Creality K2 at its lowest-ever price of just $1,049. Print in four colors and get great features like auto bed levelling and dual AI cameras for advanced monitoring. Now you can buy one on Amazon at an all-time low price of $1,409, fully 25% off MSRP. Our number one 3D printer is a color FDM number with a PEI Spring Steel Sheet platform and fully automatic bed leveling. We love it for its large volume and enclosure for high-temperature printing, as well as the auto bed leveling. It'll print in four colors and is an easy-to-use printer right out of the box. But it does command a premium price for the privilege. It's an excellent choice if you seek the highest capacity currently available. This card is available at the major U.S. retailers, thus offering greater convenience compared to some other brands. Additionally, Lexar's limited lifetime warranty enhances the product's appeal by ensuring that your investment is consistently safeguarded. These benefits come at a higher price, though. The 256GB and 512GB models for this microSD Express card are also on sale, too. We have a feeling this deal won't last long, so if you're a new Switch 2 owner, the time to act is now. Not only is the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K discounted during Prime Day, but the Ultra 7 265K also just got a hefty discount, and is now just $246. Often overshadowed by AMD, the Intel Core range starts to make a lot more sense with a hefty discount. Get a 20-core CPU with eight performance cores and 12 efficiency cores, with clock speeds of up to 5.5GHz and a 36MB cache. As you can see, the Core 7 sits below a lot of rivals in general gaming performance, including some older 14th-gen Intel gear. However, general multi-threaded performance is considerably better, and single-threaded performance on Windows 11 is some of the best we've ever tested, behind only the aforementioned Core 9 285K. So if you're looking for an LGA 1851 build but don't want to fork out on a Core Ultra 9, then this might be the processor for you this Prime Day - Stephen Warwick If you're looking for a little extra storage for your Nintendo Switch 2 handheld gaming console, then here are two deals on microSD Express cards that are available at the moment. The PNY fast flash memory cards have near SSD speeds with up to 890MB/s read and 550MB/s write. PNY's flash card has fast PCIe 3x1 storage speeds with up to 890MB/s read and 550MB/s write, perfect for loading games off of to play on the Nintendo Switch 2. Grab half a terabyte of storage with this 512GB microSD Express card from Addlink. Ample speeds of 880MB/s read and 750MB/s write mean more time playing games and less time loading, with smoother game streaming. With PCIe 3 x 1 speeds of 880MB/s read and 750MB/s write, this card has the speeds to be able to play games directly off of the card, a requirement for SD cards on the Switch 2. It's hard to find a cheap graphics card that's actually worth buying these days, but the Intel Arc B570 pulls it off. It's recently been possible to find these cards for Intel's $219 MSRP, but Amazon will do you even better during its Prime Big Deal Days event. It's knocking $10 off Sparkle's Guardian OC Edition Arc B570, bringing this card down to just $209. Intel's Arc B570 is one of the only cheap graphics cards worth buying, and at just $209 from Amazon during Prime Big Deal Days, it's even more attainable than ever. The Arc B570 can manage a solid 60 FPS experience even at 1920x1080 and ultra settings in some of today's most popular games, but we'd really recommend dialing settings back to high presets and enabling XeSS where it's available for the smoothest ride. This Arc card's 10GB of VRAM is nice insurance against more VRAM-hungry games in this oft-neglected segment of the GPU market. Just make sure your system supports Resizable BAR, and you'll enjoy a fine gaming experience on the cheap. Elegoo's Centauri Carbon is a capable and low-cost Core XY 3D printer that is both a work horse and detailed 3D printer. In our review, we loved the speed and precision that such a low-cost Core XY printer provided. But going further than the review, I can attest that this is a great printer because I put it through its paces to 3D print an entire NAS case for an Intel N100 powered file server. The Elegoo Centauri Carbon worked great, every single time! The Elegoo Centauri Carbon is a fully enclosed 3D printer, which means it can print filaments such as PETG and ABS without fear of warping. The brass-hardened steel nozzle can hit 320C and the extruder moves at 500mm/s and accelerates at 20,000mm/s¬≤, with a flow rate of 32mm¬≥/s. From common PLA to tougher Polycarbonate filament, the Elegoo Centauri Carbon can handle it. Sending prints to the Elegoo Centauri Carbon is simple, using Elegoo Slicer, a fork of Orcaslicer our computer connects to the printer via Wi-Fi, and we slice and send the prints over to the printer and then sit back and relax. Prints are then stored on the Centauri Carbon and can be selected via the rather lovely and intuitive touchscreen. Seasoned 3D printer users will be calling out the lack of multi-color printing. Elegoo has announced that a mutli-color print attachment is coming soon, and it will connect directly to the Centauri Carbon, making this printer an expandable, low cost workhorse that produces excellent prints, in very little time. If you're on the hunt for a new gaming controller for your PC and or Xbox, then take a look at this deal on GameSir's G7 Pro controller. At a price point that pales in comparison to the official Xbox controllers, like the Elite Series 2 Core Wireless gaming controller ($129), the GameSir G7 Pro in a shadow ember color looks gorgeous with its semi-translucent shell, TMR joysticks, and hall effect triggers. Available for sale at Best Buy in their Techtober sale, the GameSir G7 Pro controller for Xbox and PC is reduced to $69.99. You're able to save $10 off the list price of $79.99, which you can then put towards a game to use your new controller on. Features like TMR joysticks eliminate issues such as ‚Äústick-drift,‚Äù and compared to hall-effect sticks, they suffer less from interference, have smaller magnets, and also use less power, whilst keeping the same levels of precision. The triggers use analog hall-effect switches that feature clicky micro-switch trigger stops. There are even four rumble motors, one in each handgrip and one in each trigger, plenty of haptic feedback for in-game events. Hall-effect trigger switches, micro switches on the D-Pad, and ABXY buttons, plus tri-mode connectivity with 1000Hz polling on wired and 2.4GHz connections. A handy charging dock keeps your controller powered up for the next gaming session. Use the convenient physical mode switch to select wired, 2.4GHz, or Bluetooth, and experience a 1000Hz polling rate on PC via both wired & 2.4GHz connections. I build a lot of PCs for work, and I also do a fair bit of home improvement work around my apartment. I also own a much slimmer Wowstick, but have found Hoto's NEX O1 Pro to be more useful thanks to its extra (variable) torque. It's great for loosening those factory-installed screws on PC cases that just don't want to let go, and also great for assembling furniture.The Hoto won't replace my DeWalt impact driver or drill for bigger, tougher jobs. But for everyday tasks, it's powerful enough, easy to charge over USB-C, and even looks good on my workbench. Hoto's wireless screwdriver has three torque settings, charges over USB-C, and looks surprisingly good. I reach for the Hoto screwdriver so often, that I recently give it prime placement on my Mulitiboard tool wall, across from my work bench. I've used it while up on ladders and dropped it multiple times over the last 2.5 years, and it's continued to work without issue for the past 2.5 years since I've owned it, which is more than I can say for some of the tech I use regularly. The Olight IMINI2 EDC flashlight doesn't have many features. This compact and easy to use flashlight provides 50 Lumens of light, without the need to fiddle around for a button. Put the flashlight into any USB Type A port and it will charge up. The magnetic base of the flashlight also means it can be stuck to any ferrous metal, like a PC case, to give you hands-free illumination while you carry out a task. It is so handy and I have used it heavily for PC tasks, home DIY and taking the trash out on dark nights. Sure it doesn't have a means to focus the light, but it just works and gets me out of a pinch without any hassle. With modern Wi-Fi, there are plenty of speedy options these days for fast wireless networks. But of course, nothing beats wired connectivity for stability and getting around (rather than through) pesky things like concrete, stone, metal, and brick. And thanks to this deal at Amazon, you can connect your packet-hungry devices up to super-fast 10 Gigabit Ethernet for an all-time low price of $199. Unlike some cheaper switches that advertise 10Gb speeds, all five of the ports here are the full 10 Gigabits, letting you sling your packets as fast as possible to several devices on your network. But this is the lowest price we've seen it sell for on Amazon, by $30. Some of those are also on sale, with a Trendnet model selling for $69 and TP-Link's own TX401 selling for $74.Of course, you'll also likely need to run new CAT6 cables, especially if you're upgrading from Gigabit Ethernet, so consider that part of the expense and effort. No one said upgrading to the fastest home Ethernet tech was going to be easy, but once it's all up and running at a theoretical max speed of 1.25 gigabytes per second, you'll be glad you didn't cheap out and go for something comparatively pokey, like 2.5GbE. Bambu Lab's first foray in to low cost budget 3D printers is a knockout!The A1 Mini is what it says, mini. The 180 x 180 x 180mm build volume is much smaller than the norm, but that is not a bad thing. Check out our review of the Bambu Lab A1 mini. No, the original $299 price tag was good, but now at $249 it is excellent. It arrives 95% assembled, with just a few screws to remove before you get started. Ease of use?The touchscreen is simple to use and is only really used when loading new filament or when printing an object from micro SD. Typically, your 3D prints are sent to the A1 mini via Bambu Lab's custom slicer, Bambu Slicer, which is a fork of OrcaSlicer. Details were sharp, little or no layer lines were present, and stringing was at a minimum, especially for TPU. Our reviewer, Denise Bertacchi ran a "speed benchy", a small tug boat toy that tests detail, overhangs, cooling and printer tolerances. In her test, Bertacchi recorded a 19m 15s benchy, that is really fast. My Elegoo Centauri Carbon manages 15 minutes, my older Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro, 44 minutes!The build volume may be small, but this little printer is fast and produces great looking prints. We no longer need to slide a piece of paper under different areas of the build plate to guesstimate the Z-offset! Should you need to replace the nozzle, it is a cinch to remove the nozzle heat break and cooling fins which are held in place with magnets. Put the new unit in and you are good to go. Here we have two Samsung monitors, the 49" Odyssey G9 Gaming Monitor with a refresh rate of up to 240Hz and the decidedly smaller, yet more affordable 32-inch Odyssey G30D 180Hz Gaming Monitor. This 49" curved gaming monitor is certified by AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. This 27-inch Samsung gaming screen isn't much more expensive than an office monitor. It's a VA panel, which generally means better contrast and deeper blacks than TN or IPS, but viewing angles likely aren't the best. Head to our Best Prime Day gaming monitor deals 2025 article for even more options that are on sale at deep discounts. MSI has some great bundles on offer, and this AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, MAG X870 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard, and 2TB MSI Spatium M480 Pro SSD are all available as a bundle for just $738.99. Also, you don't have to select the SSD, so you can trim off around $100 and bring this bundle down to $639.99. This deal won't last long, so make sure to jump on it if you're after the fastest CPU for gaming. We've been diving in deep on the Best Amazon Prime Big Deal Day Hard Drive deals this year, and this deal on the 24TB Seagate BarraCuda is the epitome of 'cheap and deep' storage. The BarraCuda is designed for desktop HDD use, so it's tailored to offer the fastest performance possible with a 7,200-RPM spindle speed that's augmented by 512MB of cache. Pair that with a two-year warranty, and your PC will be off to the races. Ok, maybe not the F1 races, as that's what you use an SSD for, but you'll certainly do well in a dump truck competition, where capacity beats speed every time. Handheld gaming consoles like the Steam Deck or Xbox ROG Ally (X) demand copious amounts of storage for the latest game titles, so they're hungry for more storage. We found three of the diminutive 2230 M.2 SSDs on sale for Prime Big Deals Day, and two of them are even on our list of the best SSDs for the Steam Deck and other gaming handhelds. The SN770M, our "portable gaming king" at the time of its four-star review, is a very attractive option for those shopping for tiny storage. Bringing TLC memory to the 2230 form factor, the SN770M is a shockingly fast little thing that outshines almost any other 1TB drive in its class. You can read more details about these drives here. The fact of the matter is that 8GB of VRAM simply doesn't suffice for some of today's most demanding titles, so upgrading to a 16GB model is always optimal if you have the budget to spare. That makes the ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB a tasty upgrade, especially with $50 off during Newegg's Fantastech II sale. This mid-range RX 9070 card comes armed with the RDNA 4 architecture, 4,096 shader cores, 2.97GHz boost clock, 64 MB of L2 cache, and 16GB of VRAM that communicates across a 256-bit interface. The RX 9070 16GB delivers solid gaming performance at 1080p and 1440p, often outperforming the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 in our suite of rasterized benchmarks, with an 11% lead across our test suite at 4K. You can read more about the pitched battle in our Nvidia RTX 5070 vs AMD RX 9070 Face Off. This drive is a favorite on our list of Best SSDs, and it has now dropped to $515.98, which is a mere six cents per gigabyte of storage. The WD_Black SN850X 8TB is a high-speed PCIe 4.0 SSD with outstanding performance. It offers a combination of speed and capacity, making it an excellent choice for a primary or secondary drive. With peak sequential read/write speeds reaching 7,200/6,600 MB/s and performance in 4K random workloads weighing in at up to 1.2 million read/write IOPS, this drive has both copious throughput for file transfers and the agility to load games and applications quickly. The WD_Black SN850X offers up to 4,800 TB of write endurance, which should be enough for all but professional users, and comes with a five-year warranty. The refresh rate wars in the gaming monitor segment show no signs of subsiding, with manufacturers now pushing out 600+ Hz offerings for those who are frame rate-obsessed. However, the emergence of these new overachievers means that slightly less performant, but more mature models, are seeing some notable price reductions‚Äîcase in point: the 24-inch Alienware AW2524HF. The AW2524HF tops out at ‚Äúonly‚Äù 500 Hz, which should be more than enough for even the most discerning eSports gamers. And best of all, the monitor is priced at just $399.99 direct from Dell, which is $200 off its regular asking price. This super-high refresh rate monitor can display up to a 500Hz refresh rate in games that can support it, and of course, if you have a graphics card capable of pumping those numbers. This monitor is marketed toward serious esports players who prefer the faster frames in games like Counter-Strike, Apex Legends, and Valorant. That price gets you a solidly built monitor, a colorful Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS panel, and excellent responsiveness to satisfy your quick-twitch movements when hunting your prey online. On the connectivity front, you'll find two DisplayPort 1.4 connectors along with a single HDMI 2.1 port. You won't find integrated speakers on the AW2524HF, but it does have an integrated USB 3.2 hub with four downstream ports. We gave the Alienware AW2524HF 4.5 out of 5 stars when we reviewed it back in October 2023, and our overall assessment of the monitor holds true to this day. When we recently reviewed the GeForce RTX 5050, we thought its performance was reasonable enough in many of today's most popular games at 1080p, but we felt it needed to be somewhat cheaper in order to be a good buy compared to the more capable RTX 5060. Newegg is getting us some of the way there today by cutting MSI's Shadow take on the RTX 5050 to $239, or $10 off Nvidia's MSRP. Get $10 off MSI's Shadow GeForce RTX 5050 graphics card and enjoy solid gaming experiences at 1080p. This is a rare opportunity to purchase an Nvidia Blackwell-powered card for less than MSRP. Every dollar counts in budget PC builds, and $10 saved on the graphics card can reduce the bottom line of a parts list or contribute to a component upgrade elsewhere. For your cash, you're getting a reasonably power-efficient graphics card with solid baseline performance at 1080p in most of today's most popular games, plus access to Blackwell-exclusive features like Multi-Frame Generation that can boost your experience even further‚Äîat least as long as you can stay within this card's 8GB of VRAM. We'd be happy to have it in a cost-conscious gaming build. If you've been holding onto an old flash drive, modern models have come a long way, both in terms of performance and capacity. And it delivers about the best performance you get over a 10 Gbps connector, as we saw when we tested the 1TB model. The Tube T31 may look like a flash drive, with its integrated USB-A port, and it is our favorite flash drive. Combine that with a record-low price for this 2TB model, and this is a great deal for those needing speedy, convenient storage. As you can see in our benchmark chart above, the Tube T31 was the fastest flash drive we tested back when we reviewed it in 2024, and it remains one of our top picks today. But since then, the company has rectified the issue, and it's now on sale at Amazon in that roomy capacity. If you're looking for a speedy, pocket-friendly drive at a great price, the Tube T31 is easy to recommend -- especially at this $118 sale price. You can grab one for cheap right now at Amazon thanks to this deal. This 24-core processor has 8 P-cores and 16 E-cores with 24 threads. The 5.7 GHz P-core and 4.6 GHz E-core boost clocks enable it to perform at the top end in gaming and multithreaded applications. As you can see, at full price it's very hard to justify, but a friendlier price tag goes someway to alleviate that. Last week, Logitech graced us with the return of the MX Master, its flagship productivity mouse, back for its fourth iteration. New for 2025 are haptic feedback and an "Action Ring" menu. A huge 25% off the brand new MX Master 4 to rival Amazon Prime Day, replete with haptic feedback, adjustable sensitivity, and a Magspeed scroll wheel. AI data centers are swallowing the world's memory and storage supply, setting the stage for a pricing apocalypse that could last a decade. Tariffs and geopolitical issues also threaten to push prices higher in the coming months. That means prices will go up significantly over the coming months. Luckily, for now, there are significant discounts available on 4TB and 8TB SSD models, which continue to offer prices of 5 cents per GB on the best-value drives. There are many more 4TB SSDs on sale, as well as plenty of 8TB SSDs, which you can find in our constantly updated 4TB and 8TB SSD deals post.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The holy grail of personal computing has always been a single, seamless experience that follows you from your pocket to your desk. For decades, this dream has been a graveyard of ambitious failures. Google's effort isn't just another Chromebook; it's a full-fledged effort to scale the world's dominant mobile operating system into the laptop form factor. Google's Android PC initiative represents a direct assault on the traditional Windows PC market and a strategic challenge to Apple's carefully segregated ecosystem. However, to succeed where others have so spectacularly failed, Google must learn from the ghost of its most notable predecessor: Microsoft's Windows 8. To understand why Google's new venture has a fighting chance, one must first diagnose the fatal flaws of Microsoft's attempt at a unified OS with Windows 8 and the Windows Phone. Microsoft's strategy was to take the dominant desktop OS, Windows, and shrink it to fit on a phone, while simultaneously forcing its touch-centric ‚ÄúMetro‚Äù interface onto a billion mouse-and-keyboard users. It was a bold, top-down strategy that backfired for two critical reasons. Developers for mobile were overwhelmingly focused on iOS and Android, and they had little incentive to rebuild their apps for the sliver of the market using Windows Phone. The platform became a wasteland of missing apps ‚Äî no Snapchat, no native Gmail, and a constant stream of major services pulling their support. The Metro UI, with its live tiles, was actually quite innovative for a phone. Google's smartphone-first strategy holds a fundamental advantage: It already has absolute victory in the app war. The Google Play Store contains virtually every application and service a consumer could want. The challenge is not attracting developers from scratch but instead encouraging them to optimize their existing Android apps for a larger, landscape-oriented screen with keyboard and mouse input ‚Äî a far simpler task. Billions of people are intimately familiar with Android's navigation, notification system, and settings menus. An Android PC would feel like a natural, more powerful extension of the device they already use for hours every day. For all its engineering prowess, Google's history is littered with the corpses of brilliantly engineered products that were crippled by inept marketing and a confusing brand message: Google+, Stadia, Allo, and the convoluted early branding of its Pixel phones. Microsoft never articulated a clear, compelling reason for consumers to abandon their iPhones or Android devices for a Windows Phone. Without a massive, clear, and sustained marketing campaign that highlights a unique value proposition ‚Äî perhaps seamless app continuity with your phone, unlike anything else ‚Äî these devices could easily get lost in a crowded market, repeating the mishaps of the past. If Google can overcome its marketing hurdles, an Android PC could accelerate the inevitable blurring of lines between smartphones and personal computers. The rise of Android PCs as a smartphone-first computing platform exposes a strategic vulnerability for Apple, which maintains three largely separate operating systems ‚Äî iOS, iPadOS, and macOS ‚Äî on hardware that increasingly uses the same silicon, resulting in redundant development and creating a less-than-seamless user experience. Google, whose revenue is driven by advertising and services, doesn't care what device you use as long as you are logged into its ecosystem. An army of affordable, capable Android PCs powered by efficient Qualcomm chips directly attacks the heart of the Windows laptop market. To mitigate this, Microsoft must ultimately refine its own Windows on Arm experience, ensuring seamless performance and compatibility with legacy apps. More importantly, it must lean into its core strengths: the deep integration with enterprise and the unparalleled library of powerful, professional software that will not be coming to Android anytime soon. Google's venture into Android PCs with Qualcomm is the most credible attempt yet at creating a unified computing platform. The smartphone-up strategy is fundamentally sound, leveraging an unbeatable app ecosystem and a user base of billions. However, the project's success hinges on Google's ability to do something it has historically struggled with: market a product with clarity, passion, and persistence. If it can, this initiative won't just create a new category of laptops; it could fundamentally reshape our concept of a ‚Äúpersonal computer,‚Äù putting immense pressure on both Apple and Microsoft to adapt or risk being rendered obsolete by the tiny computer in everyone's pocket. For years, digital artists have been caught in a frustrating compromise. Do you choose the slick, consumer-friendly experience of an Apple iPad, with its beautiful screen but glossy, imprecise drawing surface? With the release of Wacom's MovinkPad 11, that compromise is officially over. This device isn't just another tablet; it's a focused, masterfully engineered tool that sets a new benchmark for portable digital creation. The MovinkPad's OLED screen is a different class entirely for artists. Because each pixel is its own light source, it can achieve perfect, absolute blacks. This creates a level of contrast and color vibrancy that makes digital paintings pop with a depth and accuracy an iPad simply cannot match. Wacom's MovinkPad 11 pairs an OLED display with pro-level pen input, offering digital artists a portable creative tool without compromise. This isn't the slick, glass-on-glass feeling of an iPad; it provides a satisfying, paper-like resistance that gives artists the tactile feedback needed for precise linework. Paired with Wacom's latest Pro Pen 3, which uses battery-free EMR technology and boasts an imperceptible level of latency, the drawing experience is second to none. An iPad is a general-purpose computer that can also be used for artistic purposes. For that price, you are getting a display technology and a pen experience that far surpasses what Apple offers for creative work. It is, without a doubt, the ultimate portable canvas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google announced on Wednesday that its AI feature that lets users virtually try on clothes is expanding to Australia, Canada, and Japan. Now, users can visualize how different pairs of shoes would look on them. While Google had already offered virtual try-on technology before, the earlier features focused on showing items on a diverse range of models' bodies. In June, the tech giant launched an experimental app called Doppl that uses AI to visualize how different outfits might look on you. While both the virtual try-on feature, which now includes shoes, and Doppl are powered by the same generative AI technology, Doppl is designed to let shoppers dive even deeper into virtual try-on, helping them curate their personal style. Plus, Doppl can create AI-generated videos so users can get a better sense of how the outfit would look on them in real life. Google isn't the only company to launch virtual try-on technology, as both Amazon and Walmart have introduced similar features.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. Right as Google's Wear OS is hitting its stride‚Äînow feature-rich with robust smartwatches that can go toe-to-toe with the Apple Watch‚Äîluxury watchmaker TAG Heuer has decided to ditch the operating system altogether for its latest Connected Calibre E5 smartwatch. Instead, it runs a proprietary ‚ÄúTAG Heuer OS‚Äù (still based on Android). But unlike many of the latest Wear OS smartwatches designed only for Android phones, this one is compatible with iPhones. That's likely one of the biggest reasons for the switch, as Google seems to have abandoned making its smartwatch platform compatible with Apple's hardware (Apple never made it easy, though this could change). It also allows the Swiss watchmaker to be less dependent on the whims of Google, but ultimately, it means TAG's smartwatch will not have access to the wealth of apps found on Google and Apple's respective platforms. I spent a few days with the 45-mm Calibre E5 (there's also a new 40-mm variant), and this fifth-generation smartwatch feels polished, despite the software change. It's also striking in its design, unlike any other smartwatch, with premium materials like a ceramic bezel, domed sapphire crystal, and snazzy band options. Unsurprisingly, the version I tried will cost you a punchy $2,000 when it goes on sale this month (and goes up to $2,800 for other variations), though the smaller 40-mm Calibre E5 starts at $1,800. Comfortable and premium: the new TAG smartwatch sports a ceramic bezel, flat or domed sapphire crystal, titanium and DLC, depending on what model you choose. You can get a black diamond-like carbon (DLC) grade-2 titanium sandblasted case, white and green indices, or a domed sapphire crystal over the display, exclusive to the new 40-mm case. Still, I was able to pop on a 22-mm pin buckle strap from one of my other watches without issues. Despite being weighty, I didn't mind wearing this smartwatch to sleep, though you may want a more comfortable strap. However, when I woke up the next morning, I spent a few minutes hunting for my sleep results, only to learn they don't exist. TAG says it plans to add sleep tracking, likely in December via a software update, which is important considering this is a staple feature on most smartwatches these days. It's fairly simple to customize these on the watch itself, too, choosing different accent colors, backgrounds, and complications. There are also two pushers above and below the crown. I was able to receive all the notifications from my paired Android phone, and there's a fair amount of actions you can take. I deleted emails, marked them as read, and even ‚ÄúLiked‚Äù messages. These boilerplate responses didn't always show up on every message, either. The Calibre E5 is limited in that sense‚Äîyou can't open WhatsApp and respond to a friend. You can't open up the Google Home app and check your Nest security camera. There is no cellular version of this smartwatch, so you'll need your phone nearby to receive notifications. It would've been nice to have the option for contactless payments. Maybe it's good that you can't respond to your coworker's Slack message. Also, if you press and hold the bottom button, it activates your phone's voice assistant. Weirdly, it doesn't really do anything on the watch‚Äîmy phone lit up and Gemini turned on, and its responses came entirely through my phone. The E5 has up to two days battery life, or three days in low-power mode, but with the always-on display, WIRED's unit needed to be recharged after a day and a half. Some of this functionality may be even more restricted on iPhone, but TAG has received official Made-for-iPhone certification with the Calibre E5, which means it can offer a better-than-expected experience with improved Wi-Fi connectivity and notifications. As for battery life, TAG claims up to two days (three days with low-power mode), but with the always-on display, my unit needed to be recharged after a day and a half. Fitness and health are a focus on the Calibre E5, or at least, that's what TAG is spending a lot of time talking about. You can track steps, calories burned, active time, and heart rate. When the update for sleep tracking arrives later this year, it'll also enable blood-oxygen measurements, breathing rate, and heart-rate variability, though this is largely for the benefit of sleep analysis. However, during an indoor rowing workout, the Pixel Watch and Apple Watch were far more aligned on my average beats per minute, with the Calibre E5 undercounting by 10 beats. I'll need to see how it fares over a longer period, and perhaps without the metal bracelet, which is not fun to exercise with (TAG didn't send me the sportier bands for this hands-on experience). Also, indoor rowing wasn't available to track on the Calibre E5, and there's no auto-workout tracking. You have the basics such as walking, running, cycling, hiking, swimming, treadmill‚Äîand of course ‚ÄúGolf‚Äù, a feature TAG has leaned into with its smartwatches‚Äîbut you'll need to use ‚ÄúOther‚Äù to track anything else. There is dual-band GPS here, but I didn't get a chance to test it. Along with this, there are running plans to choose from, and that Golf mode has a course map display that will automatically adjust as you advance, with over 40,000 course maps worldwide. The watchmaker will continue to offer the battery replacement service for anyone worried that their $2,000 smartwatch's battery will degrade after two or three years‚Äîhead to a TAG Heuer boutique for a $100 refit. As I wrote five years ago, a luxury smartwatch isn't going to last forever. You can (and will) argue that spending $2,000 on a smartwatch is silly, but this misses the point. The Calibre E5 will attract a demographic of people who want a smartwatch that can match their other dressy watches, while still delivering functional information, like heart rate and notifications. Instead, like your TAG Heuer Carrera or Formula 1 watches, it's another option to put on your wrist, for those days when you want something a little more than a pretty face.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Measures of risk premia across many risky asset classes have tightened further since the last FPC meeting in June 2025. This, when combined with increasing concentration within market indices, leaves equity markets particularly exposed should expectations around the impact of AI become less optimistic.Actually, the quoted 'sudden correction' is not referring specifically to AI, but the market in general[1] https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-r... In fact, the further we go into debt - the more we are implicitly betting our society on an AI hail mary. I see this sentiment a lot, they are not equivalent. Increasing taxes can reduce GDP, which needs to increase to outgrow the debt, there is an optimal tax rate, more doesn't always help. Increasing taxes can reduce GDP, which needs to increase to outgrow the debt, there is an optimal tax rate, more doesn't always help. How it gets done is separate from that. Given that the only demographic that can comfortably weather a recession is also starting to collect social security, paid for by younger generations who would be meaningfully affected by a recession, "old people are scamming us" may actually be an effective message. I don't live in a costal state, but when I do consulting work typically at charity rates alongside my standard full-time job, I have to pay 24% federal tax, 15.3% FICA, and 7.85% state tax. God himself only wanted 10%, so it seems a government playing God is awfully expensive.You can't raise taxes any further before I'm done, and I don't think I'm alone, businesses and consultants are already crushed in taxes. But if I don't consult because it isn't worth it, are small businesses suddenly going to afford an agency or a dedicated software developer? But if I don't consult because it isn't worth it, are small businesses suddenly going to afford an agency or a dedicated software developer? They'd still have to pay for Medicare, but it knocks 12.4% off their estimated taxes for consulting.If they're single, then the math is different. It's always frustrating when people whine about taxes but giving insufficient information to evaluate their complaint. If they're single, then the math is different. It's always frustrating when people whine about taxes but giving insufficient information to evaluate their complaint. They stop paying taxes and work off the books instead but you don't announce that publicly for obvious reasons.The incentive to do this increases with tax pressure. The willingness of people to pay for tax-free work equally increases because you'll pay less.There's also an increasing asymmetry of what the government gains from a tax hike versus how oppressive it becomes that becomes unfavorable as tax rates go up.

I think that we will raise more revenue, yes, by squeezing more from the Fortune 500; but you will absolutely crush small business and consultancy work further. It's kind of like how an 80% tax rate on everyone making over $100K would do a fantastic job of raising revenue, but it's fundamentally stupid and would kill all future golden geese. (On that note, I see this comment a lot about how we had huge tax rates, 91% in the 1950s; but this is misleading. The effective tax rate for those earners was only 41%, due to the sheer number of exemptions, according to modern analysis. We have never had an actual effective 91% tax rate, or anywhere close to it. (On that note, I see this comment a lot about how we had huge tax rates, 91% in the 1950s; but this is misleading.

We have never had an actual effective 91% tax rate, or anywhere close to it. As always, the question with economists is "why aren't you rich?". You would get much better answers about macro-economic counterfactuals by going to a macro-trading firm like Bridgewater and asking the employees "what do you think would happen if..." By definition, the curve is determined from external factors and economic measurements, none of which currently resemble 2012. You say you consult at charity rates and then point to taxation as the sole reason it isn't worth your time... So all the entities that want to hold the debt (social security administration, mutual funds, pension funds etc) where should they go instead? Probably the closest US bond equivalent would be debt from well-run Asian countries. The surface way it's wrong is that investors could have invested in Nvidia 10 years ago instead of gold. Because they didn't, their investments "eroded" even more.The deeper way it's wrong is that people who say this almost always have the unstated premise that gold is "real" money, that every price should be measured against it. When it dropped to $100, the dollar didn't become worth twice as much. So gold is not a fixed measuring stick, against which all other things are measured.

When it dropped to $100, the dollar didn't become worth twice as much. So gold is not a fixed measuring stick, against which all other things are measured. You see it everywhere in things they can't inflate. The price of houses and gold most obviously, but you see it in commodities that can't expand production quickly as well. The solution is to buy assets of course. It's no longer the early 20th, there are other competitive & well-run jurisdictions for creditors to dump their money in if they lose faith in the US. Where, pray tell are these competitive and well-run jurisdictions?China has capital controls so that probably won't work. The EU might work if they ever get their sh*t together and centralise their bonds and markets, otherwise no.Like, I too believe that the US is on an unsustainable path, but I just don't see where all that money is gonna go (specifically referring to the foreign investment in the US companies/markets here).

Like, I too believe that the US is on an unsustainable path, but I just don't see where all that money is gonna go (specifically referring to the foreign investment in the US companies/markets here). Plus, even worse-run higher yield jurisdictions become more appealing as the US fails. I feel like eurobonds or remnibi bonds are the only options, but both don't work for various reasons. Freezing their foreign reserves was not well received. Hence we now have China trading in their own currency with their trading partners happy with that.Soon we will have a situation where there is no 'exorbitant privilege' (reserve currency, which can only ever end up with massive deficits), instead the various BRICS currencies will be anchored to valuable commodities such as rare earth metals, gold and everything else that is 'proof of work' and important to the future. So that means no more 'petro-dollar', the store of value won't be hydrocarbons.This sounds better than going back to a gold standard. The money printed by Uncle Sam to end up in the Magnificent Seven means that it will be relatively easy to write this money off. The day when the American people elect a fiscally prudent government, for Americans to work hard, pay their taxes and get that deficit to a manageable number is never going to happen.

Either way, the BRICS trading system wasn't a serious thing until this year. And what really kicked it out was Trump. But from what I see of the economy around me here, people just dont have the spare funds for LLM luxuries. It feels like 15+ years of wage deflation, and company streamlining, has removed what little spare spending power people had here. Not forgetting the inflation we have seen in the euro zone.Even if the bet is now an 'all in' on AGI, I see that more as an existential threat than an economic golden egg bailout. If you have to pick between Disney+ for your kids and a chatbot subscription, it's a pretty easy choice.More and more people are making choices like that. Their comments carry a lot of weight and do impact government policy.Not enough central banks were making comments about the sub-prime bubble that led to the 2008 crisis. Getting warnings about a possible AI bubble by a central bank is both significant and, in performing the functions of monetary and financial stability for a country, the prudent thing to do.

Getting warnings about a possible AI bubble by a central bank is both significant and, in performing the functions of monetary and financial stability for a country, the prudent thing to do. In 1996 Fed Chair Alan Greenspan warned about irrational exuberance, in 1999 he warned Congress about "the possibility that the recent performance of the equity markets will have difficulty in being sustained". The crash came in 2000.The warning seems to have gone unnoticed. Offering commentary on which particular sectors they feel are a 'bubble' is outside their purview and not particularly productive IMO, the state is not very good at picking winners. The glaring issue with it back then was that unlike an LLM that can be understanding of what you try to explain and bit more consistent the diffusion models ability to read and understand your prompt wasn't really there yet, you're more shotgunning keywords and hope the seed lottery gives you something nice.But recent image generation models are significantly better in stable output. Something like qwen image will   care a lot more about your prompt and not entirely redraw the scene into something else just because you change the seed.Meaning that the UI experiments already exist but the models are still a bit away from maturity.On the other hand, when looking at how models are actually evolving I'm not entirely convinced we'll need particularly many classically trained artists in roles where they draw static images with some AI acceleration. I expect people to talk to an LLM interface that can take the dumbest of instructions and carefully adjust a picture, sound, music or an entire two hour movie. Where the artist would benefit more by knowing the terminology and the granular abilities of the system than by being able to hold a pencil.The entertainment and media industry is worth trillions on an annual basis, if AI can eat a fraction of that in addition to some other work-roles it will easily be worth the current valuations.

That's the lowest of the low and even you accept it doesn't work (yet), how can LLMs be worth 50% of the last years of gdp growth if it's that bad. Do you think customer support represents 50% of newly created value ? Maybe if companies would wire up their "oh a customer is complaining try and talk them out of canceling their account offer them a mild discount in exchange for locking in for a year contract" API to the LLM? For every line of code it writes it also writes some BS paragraph in a business plan, a report, &c. The search capabilities are interesting but the falsehoods that come from LLM questions undermine it.The programming and visual art capabilities are most impressive to me... but where's the companies making killings on those? Where's the animation studio cranking out Pixar-quality movies as weekly episodes? Where's the animation studio cranking out Pixar-quality movies as weekly episodes? I work in the industry and I know that ad agencies are already moving onto AI gen for social ads.For VFX and films the tech is not there yet, since OpenAI believes they can build the next TikTok on AI (a proposition being tested now) and Google is just being Google - building amazing tools but with little understanding (so far) of how to deploy them on the market.Still Google is likely ahead in building tools that are being used (Nano Banana and Veo 3) while the Chinese open source labs are delivering impressive stuff that you run locally or increasingly on a rented H100 on the cloud.

No idea where my money might be safe. And I don't have enough experience in markets or confidence to make a bet on it, so I will go with everyone else's sentiment and make the ‚Äòsafe' bet of being long the market. But like‚Ä¶ something feels weird to me about how much money is being poured into this? But I can't say for sure whether it is overvalued or not.‚ÄùThose are two wildly different things. But I'm not sure what to do about that other than being fairly conservatively invested which makes sense for me at this point anyway. FWIW, I do think AI is overvalued for the relatively near term. But I'm not sure what to do about that other than being fairly conservatively invested which makes sense for me at this point anyway. The whole "double-your-money-or-infinite-losses" aspect of shorting is not a game I'm into. It's going to be a gruesome train wreck. It's very possible that human beings today are already doing the most intelligent things they can given the data and resources they have available. This whole idea that there's a magic property called intelligence that can solve every problem when it reaches a sufficient level, regardless of what data and resources it has to work with, increasingly just seems like the fantasy of people who think they're very intelligent. Humans can, because our intelligence operates at a qualitatively different level.As humans, we can easily visualize and reason about 2D and 3D spaces, it's natural because our sensory systems evolved to navigate a 3D world. But can we truly conceive of a million dimensions, let alone visualize them? Our brains are not built for that kind of complexity.Now imagine a form of intelligence that can directly perceive and reason about such high dimensional structures. Entirely new kinds of understanding and capabilities might emerge. If a being could fully comprehend the underlying rules of the universe, it might not need to perform physical experiments at all, it could simply simulate outcomes internally.Of course that's speculative, but it just illustrates how deeply intelligence is shaped and limited by its biological foundation.

Of course that's speculative, but it just illustrates how deeply intelligence is shaped and limited by its biological foundation. It likely couldn't, though, that's the problem.At a basic level, whatever abstract system you can think of, there must be an optimal physical implementation of that system, the fastest physically realizable implementation of it. They aren't implementations of simple abstract ideas like adders or matrix multipliers, they're chaotic systems that follow no specifications. On what basis do we think it is likely that there exists a computer circuit that can simulate their outcomes before they happen? They aren't implementations of simple abstract ideas like adders or matrix multipliers, they're chaotic systems that follow no specifications. On what basis do we think it is likely that there exists a computer circuit that can simulate their outcomes before they happen? The issue is that most physical systems are arguably the optimal implementation of whatever it is that they do. They aren't implementations of simple abstract ideas like adders or matrix multipliers, they're chaotic systems that follow no specifications. On what basis do we think it is likely that there exists a computer circuit that can simulate their outcomes before they happen? I guess where my speculation comes in is that "simulation" doesn't necessarily have to mean perfect 1:1 physical emulation. Maybe a higher intelligence could model useful abstractions/approximations, simplified  but still predictive frameworks that are accurate enough for control and reasoning even in chaotic domains.After all, humans already do this in a primitive way, we can't simulate every particle of the atmosphere, but we can predict weather patterns statistically. So perhaps the difference between us and a much higher intelligence wouldn't be breaking physics, but rather having much deeper and more general abstractions that capture reality's essential structure better.In that sense, it's not "magical thinking", I just acknowledge that our cognitive compression algorithms (our abstractions) are extremely limited. A mind that could discover higher order abstractions might not outrun physics, but it could reason about reality in qualitatively new ways.

Your example doesn't entirely contradict the argument that it takes time and experimentation as well, that intellect isn't the only limiting factor. And that a redundant message, cannot convey more information than the compressed version of itself. Nor can a bit convey any information about a quantity, with which it has correlation exactly zero, across the probable worlds you imagine.> But nothing I've depicted this human civilization doing, even begins to approach the theoretical limits set by the formalism of Solomonoff induction.This is also a commonplace in behavioral economics; the whole foundation of the field is that people in general don't think hard enough to fully exploit the information available to them, because they don't have the time or the energy.‚Äî‚ÄîOf course, that doesn't mean that great intelligence could figure out warp drives. (...)> The creation of such a bubble requires exotic matter‚Äîsubstances with negative energy density (a violation of the Weak Energy Condition). Casimir effect experiments have hinted at the existence of negative energy in quantum fields, but practical production at the required scale remains speculative.‚Äî‚ÄîCancer, however, is clearly curable, and indeed often cured nowadays. It wouldn't be terribly surprising if we already had enough data to figure out how to solve it the rest of the time. We already have complete genomes for many species, AlphaFold has solved the protein-folding problem, research oncology studies routinely sequence tumors nowadays, and IHEC says they already have "comprehensive sets of reference epigenomes", so with enough computational power, or more efficient simulation algorithms, we could probably simulate an entire human body much faster than real time with enough fidelity to simulate cancer, thus enabling us to test candidate drug molecules against a particular cancer instantly.Also, of course, once you can build reliable nanobots, you can just program them to kill a particular kind of cancer cell, then inject them.Understanding this does not require believing that "intelligence that can solve every problem when it reaches a sufficient level, regardless of what data and resources it has to work with", which I think is a strawman you have made up. It doesn't even require believing that sufficient intelligence can solve every problem if it has sufficient data and resources to work with. It only requires understanding that being able to do the same thing regular humans do, but much faster, would be sufficient to cure cancer.‚Äî‚ÄîThere does seem to be an open question about how general intelligence is. And most of them aren't instinctive activities even in humans‚Äîmany didn't exist 1000 years ago, and some didn't exist even 100 years ago.So humans clearly have some fairly flexible facility that these other species lack. "Intelligence" is the usual name for that facility.But it's not perfectly general. For example, it involves some degree of ability to imagine three-dimensional space. Some of the humans can also reason about four- or five-dimensional spaces, but this is a much slower and more difficult process, far out of proportion to the underlying mathematical difficulty of the problem. And maybe there are other problems that some other sort of intelligence would find easy, but which the humans don't even notice because it's incomprehensible to them.

In reality, we are surrounded by chaotic physical systems that operate on raw hardware. They are, in fact, quite fast, and probably impossible to simulate efficiently. For instance, we can obviously never build a computer that can simulate the behavior of its own circuitry, using said circuitry, faster than it operates. But I think there's a lot of physical systems that are just like that.Being data-limited means that we get data slower than we can analyze and process it. It is certainly possible to improve our ability to analyze data, but I don't think we can assume that the best physically realizable intelligence would overcome data limitation, nor that it would be cost-effective in the first place, compared to simply gathering more data and experimenting more. It is certainly possible to improve our ability to analyze data, but I don't think we can assume that the best physically realizable intelligence would overcome data limitation, nor that it would be cost-effective in the first place, compared to simply gathering more data and experimenting more. It may very well be true that you could cure cancer even faster or more cheaply with more experimental data, but that's irrelevant to the claim that more experimental data is necessary.It may also be the case that there's no "shortcut" to simulating a human body well enough to test drugs against a simulated tumor faster than real time‚Äîthat is, that you need to have enough memory to track every simulated atom. But a human body only contains on the order of 10¬≤‚Å¥ atoms, so you can just build a computer with 10¬≤‚Å∏ words of memory, and processing power to match. It might be millions of times larger than a human body, but that's okay; there's plenty of mass out there to turn into computronium.

Human intelligence must be deterministic, any other conclusion is equivalent to the claim that there is some sort of "soul" for lack of better term. Failures to date can be attributed to various factors, but the gist is that we haven't yet identified the principles of intelligent software.My guess is that we need less than 5 million years further development time even in a worst-case scenario. With luck and proper investment, we can get it down well below the 1 million year mark.

We might very well be accelerating towards a brick wall, there is absolutely no guarantee we'll hit AGI before hitting the wall No, not all processes follow deterministic Newtonian mechanics. It could also be random, unpredictable at times. Yes, there are random quantum processes in every atom, and there are atoms in the brain.Yes, this is no less materialistic: Humans are still proof that either you believe in souls or such, or that human level intelligence can be made from material atoms.

But also, LLMs are not anywhere close to becoming human level intelligence. Easy peazy.Just like cracking any encryption: you just brute force all possible passwords. it has been educational to see how quickly the financier class has moved when they saw an opportunity to abandon labor entirely, though. that's worth remembering when they talk about how this system is the best one for everyone.
