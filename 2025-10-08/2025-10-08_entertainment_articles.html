                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nas Reacts to Fans Using Jay-Z Beef to Fuel NYC Casino Competition: 'No One Has Any Control Over Things Like That' Taylor Swift, The Life of a Showgirl (Republic): For most of the last decade, it seemed not only unbeatable, it seemed un-nearable. From the time Adele set the modern-era single-week sales record in late 2015 with a jaw-plummeting 3.378 million, up until this very week, no other artist had even gotten in her general neighborhood — with only one artist even clearing the one-million mark in sales over that time period, doing so with four separate albums. (The “modern era” begins in 1991, when Luminate — then SoundScan — began electronically tracking data.) She was getting closer, but she still wasn't particularly close — that TTPD mark may have been several times bigger than any sales week posted by any other artist this decade, but it only got her about 57% of the way to 25. Adele's mark still looked safe for the foreseeable future. On Saturday, Billboard reported that Swift's new album, The Life of a Showgirl, had debuted with 2.7 million in sales in just its first day— already blowing well past Tortured Poets, and getting 80% of the way to 25. Those numbers have steadily increased over the course of the week, and as of Billboard's latest update, have swelled to 3.2 million — fewer than 200,000 copies away from passing an Adele mark no other artist could even see with a telescope, with two days still to go in the tracking week. One related all-time mark of Adele's has already fallen to Swift this week: Showgirl has posted 3.5 million in equivalent album units (EAUs), a mark which also factors in streaming equivalent albums (SEAs) and track equivalent albums (TEAs) — though because none of the album's songs were available for digital purchase individually, Showgirl has not amassed any of the latter. Because 25 was not initially available in full on streaming — only its lead single, “Hello,” was on DSPs at that point — its debut EAU number (3.482 million) was only 104,000 higher than its sales number, with that difference largely coming from TEAs. It could be close: While in the 25 era, a greater number of debut-week purchases were still made in-store, in 2025, a much higher percentage comes from pre-orders, with fans purchasing multiple different variants of the album. (A full 23 of those were available pre-release, across vinyl, CD, CD boxed set and cassette, some including additional collectibles, with two of the boxed sets even coming with a cardigan and a crewneck, respectively.) Hence, while Adele's 3.378 million number was picked up a little more gradually throughout its week — she was only up to 2.433 million by day four — Swift's Showgirl number is much top-heavier, “only” growing by 500,000 over the four days of reporting following that first-day number. Still, it seems likely that Showgirl will ultimately get past the 3.378 million mark. It's already gotten a mid-week boost from four new CD variant releases, only available for a limited time, which each included unique cover art and two unique alternate versions of tracks from the original album. As Swift continues on the promotional trail, appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and Apple Music's The Zane Lowe Show in the past couple days, it would not be surprising to see more appearances to come, and possibly more new variants to be released, over the next last couple days of the week, as Adele's record appears more vulnerable than we'd ever imagined it would be again.

When director Joachim Rønning came on board “Tron: Ares,” the third film in the Disney sci-fi series that began in 1982 with “Tron,” he knew there was one set piece that absolutely had to deliver. “I've been in love with them since the first movie.” The light cycle vehicles are at the center of spectacular set pieces in both the original “Tron” and its 2010 sequel, Joseph Kosinski's “Tron: Legacy,” both of which were cinematic touchstones for Ronning. “I think Kosinski created such an amazing action sequence. In the previous “Tron” films, the high-tech action was limited to grids that existed inside computers, where everything but the programs (played by human actors like Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner) was electronic. “The light cycles still needed help from [effects house] Industrial Light and Magic, but I was able to build real assets so that I could put my cameras on them,” Rønning said. “We shot for six weeks of nights for a 15-minute sequence, and it was logistically very hard to do because we had to shut down 10 blocks at a time.” Shooting real vehicles on real city streets had the advantage of providing Ronning with inspiration just by taking cues from his environment. “ I remember I wanted to have a break in the middle of the sequence where it all goes quiet and we're building suspense,” Rønning said. “I was walking all over Vancouver trying to come up with an idea for how to do it, looking for a location that could inspire me. I found this old parking garage with a spiral driving ramp, and I just designed it out of that, making it a little homage to ‘Terminator 2' and the T-1000. Even scenes that one might think were entirely computer-generated were done practically, thanks to some ingenious solutions engineered by Rønning's special effects department. The light cycles leave trails of light behind them that can block or slice other vehicles, and at one point, Ares' cycle drives right down the middle of a cop car, cutting it in half. According to Rønning, this was all done in-camera by building police cars that were pre-cut in half, then stitched back together. “It's being pulled by a truck on a 100-yard wire to get up to speed, and it's remote-controlled,” Rønning said. “When you do these big movies, you have amazing support and some of the best actors in the world,” he said. So the daunting aspect is thinking that it all comes down to me to fill these big shoes of the first two films. Disney opens “Tron: Ares” in theaters on Friday, October 10.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Paramount Television Studios has signed a first-look deal with Jessica Biel and Michelle Purple's Iron Ocean, the first such pact for Paramount's recently revived television studio. While on assignment, CIA Case Officer Erica Ambler (Biel) suffers a devastating injury, waking up without her memories in custody at a supermax prison for the world's deadliest spies. Erica must figure out who she is and who she can trust, while piecing together the clues that will prevent a lethal attack on American soil. NBCUniversal Lands 'Jason Bourne' And 'Treadstone' Rights From Author Robert Ludlum Following Massive Bidding War The Ambler Warning will be produced by Paramount TV Studios, Iron Ocean and Captivate Entertainment. Biel and Purple were originally in talks with Skydance Television for The Ambler Warning and a first-look deal. Following Skydance's August acquisition of Paramount Global, the conversations migrated to Paramount TV Studios, the new streaming-focused studio comprised of Skydance Television and Showtime/MTV Entertainment Studios. It is run by former Skydance TV President Matt Thunell. “We are so excited to be partnering with Matt Thunell and the team over at Paramount Television Studios. We have been long time fans of Skydance, which is where our conversations with Matt first started, and now to be bringing that deal to our previous home at Paramount Television Studios feels full circle,” Biel and Purple in a joint statement. “We can't wait to get started creating content with a team that is as passionate about Iron Ocean's mission as we are. Biel and Purple's Iron Ocean, launched by the duo in 2007 with a mission to amplify female voices, had two back-to-back first-look deals at the previous incarnation of Paramount TV Studios, which was shut down in 2024. The remainder of their second pact finished up at CBS Studios, which at the time absorbed PtvS' slate, with a 7th Heaven reboot stemming from the deal still in development there. Iron Ocean's series credits include USA Network's The Sinner, Hulu's Candy, and Prime Video's recent hit thriller The Better Sister — all of them starring Biel — as well as Facebook Watch's Limetown and Freeform's Cruel Summer, which is eying a revival with a third installment in development. “I have always admired the incomparable Jessica Biel and Michelle Purple, and the high-quality, audience-pleasing series they make” said Thunell, President of Paramount TV Studios. “We are thrilled to welcome Iron Ocean to Paramount Television Studios and launch our partnership with Ambler Warning as the first project.” His estate brought in an author and an editor to finish it, and the sky thriller novel was published by St. Martin's Press in 2005. Captivate Entertainment and the Robert Ludlum Estate are repped by WME. Biel earned an Emmy nomination for her starring role in Season 1 of The Sinner anthology series. Outside of scripted series, Iron Ocean has produced the film The Book of Love, starring Biel, Jason Sudeikis and Maisie Williams, and Investigative Discovery's Fatal Destination true-crime docuseries. Biel next stars opposite John Cena in Sam Hargrave's action-adventure Matchbox from Apple Original Films, Skydance, and Mattel Films. Biel is also repped by Yorn Levine Barnes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Life of a Showgirl surpasses a major 10-year-old consumption record held by Adele, and continues to near the modern-era single-week album sales record. Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl has now earned 3.5 million equivalent album units in the United States, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate, since the album's release on Oct. 3. The modern-era single-week sales record is held by the opening week of Adele's 25, when it debuted with 3.378 million copies sold in 2015. (None of the tracks from The Life of a Showgirl are available to purchase individually, so the album does not have any track sales contributing to its total thus far.) While the Billboard 200 has incorporated streams and track purchases since Dec. 2014, Billboard continues to publish weekly album sales-only charts, including the overall Top Album Sales chart (which ranks both current and older/catalog titles), and Top Current Album Sales. Luminate's sales, streaming and airplay data powers Billboard's charts. All numbers cited in this story are for the U.S. only. Life of a Showgirl's first-week numbers (equivalent album units, total traditional album sales and streaming figures) are expected to be announced by Billboard on Sunday, Oct. 12, along with its assumed large debut on the multi-metric Billboard 200 albums chart (dated Oct. 18). PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 7): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl has reached 3 million in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases), across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. On the album's first day of release (Oct. 3), it cleared 2.7 million sold. After Showgirl's first day, it captured the second-largest sales week for an album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. The largest week, by equivalent album units, for any album, in that span of time, was registered by the debut week of Adele's 25, which launched with 3.482 million units on the Dec. 12, 2015 chart. Showgirl got a mid-week boost with the release of four new CD variants of the album, exclusively sold through Swift's official webstore. Available for a limited time, each CD had alternate cover art, the album's 12 songs, plus two unique bonus tracks for each CD (alternate versions of songs from the album). These four CDs join 23 previously available physical versions of the album (across vinyl, CD and cassette) and two digital download editions (a standard wide version, and iTunes-exclusive version with a bonus video). Swift herself has been on the promotional trail, chatting up the album on radio programs and sitting down for an interview on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (Oct. 6). As for Showgirl's streaming start – its 12 songs generated over 300 million on-demand official streams in its first two days in the U.S. (Oct. 3-4). The most-streamed song on Showgirl in its first two days is “The Fate of Ophelia,” with more than 48 million official on-demand steams. 1 album, lifting her past Drake and JAY-Z for the most No. 1s, have more, dating to when the chart began publishing on a regular, weekly basis in 1956. All 14 of Swift's full-length studio albums and re-recorded projects from 2008's Fearless (her second album) through 2024's The Tortured Poets Department have debuted at No. PREVIOUSLY (OCT. 4): Taylor Swift's The Life of a Showgirl album is off to a sparkling start in the United States. On its first day of release, Oct. 3, the set sold 2.7 million copies in traditional album sales (physical and digital purchases) across all versions of the album, according to initial reports to data tracking firm Luminate. That marks Swift's biggest week ever, and the second-largest sales week for any album in the modern era — since Luminate began electronically tracking data in 1991. That breaks the single-week record, set by Swift in 2024, when her last album, The Tortured Poets Department, sold 859,000 copies on vinyl in its first week. Further news of first-week building sales and streaming activity for the album, as provided by Luminate, will be reported in the coming days. The Life of a Showgirl was announced on Aug. 12, and Swift's official webstore began taking preorders for the album soon after. The set was issued as a widely available streaming edition and in three widely available versions to purchase across all participating retailers (a standard CD, vinyl and digital download album). There is a plethora of further variants of the album to purchase, with more details on the assorted versions later in this story. Sales Story: The 2.7 million-sales number registered for Showgirl is inclusive of both over-the-counter and download purchases of the album made on Oct. 3, in addition to what is assumed to be a large number of pre-orders of the physical album through Internet retailers (such as Swift's webstore, Amazon, Target, etc.) shipped to customers for arrival on release day, as well as pre-orders of the digital download album that were redeemed on release day (via the iTunes Store and other similar sellers). The Life of a Showgirl's sales are bolstered by its availability across 23 different physical configurations: 12 CDs, eight vinyl LPs, two deluxe CD boxed sets containing branded clothing and a CD, and a cassette. Four of the physical editions were exclusively sold by Target stores in the U.S. (three CDs and one vinyl), while two (a standard CD and vinyl) were available to purchase at all participating retailers. Of the remaining 17 physical iterations, all were exclusively sold via Swift's webstore, and most were sold for limited windows of time since the preorder launched in August. On the digital download side, there is a standard digital download available to purchase through all download sellers, as well as an iTunes Store-exclusive version that comes with a short bonus video. To compare, Swift's last studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, had 19 different physical iterations available in its first week (nine CDs, six vinyl LPs and four cassettes) and two digital download versions (the standard 16-song album, and the surprise deluxe 31-song Anthology edition). Swift herself previously held the record with 859,000 copies of Poets sold in its first week. It stands behind only the opening week of Adele's 25, which bowed with 3.378 million sold in 2015. Showgirl is the eighth Swift album to have sold at least 1 million copies in a single week, following the debuts of Poets, 1989 (Taylor's Version), Midnights, reputation, the original 1989, Red and Speak Now. She is the only act with eight different albums to each sell at least 1 million copies in a single week in the modern era. One of those albums, Adele's 25 sold more than 1 million in three separate weeks. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Four-time Academy Award nominee Saoirse Ronan (Brooklyn) has inked a deal to play Linda McCartney, the first wife of The Beatles' Paul McCartney, in Sam Mendes'  The Beatles — A Four-Film Cinematic Event, multiple sources tell Deadline. Linda McCartney was a photographer, musician and animal rights activist who rose to prominence in the 1960s with her portraiture of The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and The Doors. The first female photographer to have her work on the cover of Rolling Stone, she married Paul McCartney in 1969 and worked alongside him as part of his band Wings in his post-Beatles career. A passionate advocate for vegetarianism and animal welfare, she launched her own company, Linda McCartney Foods, in 1991 and passed away from cancer in 1998. Mendes will direct from scripts written by Jez Butterworth, Peter Straughan and Jack Thorne, as we told you first, though it's unclear which projects each is tackling. A collaboration between Sony Pictures Entertainment and Mendes' Neal Street Productions, the films will be produced by Mendes, Pippa Harris and Julie Pastor of Neal Street, as well as Alexandra Derbyshire, in association with Apple Corps for Sony Pictures. In addition to distributing, Sony Pictures is the financier of these projects. An Irish actress known for her work in prestige pictures like Brooklyn, Lady Bird and Little Women, Ronan has most recently been seen in Nora Fingscheidt's The Outrun and Steve McQueen's Blitz. Up next, she'll be seen starring in Bad Apples, a dark comedy from filmmaker Jonatan Etzler that's coming off its world premiere at TIFF. As we first reported, she's also set to star opposite Austin Butler in Deep Cuts, a music-themed A24 love story from The Iron Claw's Sean Durkin, adapting the debut novel by Holly Brickley.

There's a new “Girls” in town, as HBO has dropped the official trailer for its upcoming series, “I Love LA.” Like that Lena Dunham series but with a decidedly more hedonistic spin given this first footage, the series centers on a friend group navigating relationships, career, success, and party-going. It comes from comedian turned creator/star Rachel Sennott, best known onscreen for her performances in “Bottoms” and “Shiva Baby.” The new series also draws comparisons to Issa Rae's Los Angeles-set “Insecure.” Set to premiere November 2 on HBO and HBO Max, the series also stars Odessa A'zion (poised to break out big with a role in Josh Safdie's upcoming “Marty Supreme“), Jordan Firstman, True Whitaker, and Josh Hutcherson.

Emma Barrie, Aida Rodgers, Max Silvestri, and Lorene Scafaria also executive produce, with episodic directors on the series including Sennott herself, plus Lorene Scafaria, Bill Benz, and Kevin Bray. Sennott earned a 2024 Best Screenplay nomination at the Film Independent Spirit Awards for the lesbian high school comedy “Bottoms,” co-written and directed by “Shiva Baby” filmmaker Emma Seligman. “I Love LA” isn't exactly Sennott's HBO debut, as she had a supporting role as Lily-Rose Depp's assistant and BFF in the critically derided one-off series “The Idol.” She also recently starred in Sony's 2024 film “Saturday Night” as “SNL” writer Rosie Shuster.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During a deeply emotional appearance on Good Morning America on October 6, the 39-year-old became tearful as he shared that Sharon is still learning to navigate life after losing her partner of more than 40 years. “You know, when people have been asking me that question, I say, ‘She's OK, but she's not OK,'” Jack said. “I know she feels the love, and that has been such a level that none of us could ever really… You know, every child sits there and kind of has this thought about one day that parents won't be there, and what will that be like. Ozzy died on July 22 at age 76, just 17 days after performing his farewell Back to the Beginning concert in Birmingham, England, alongside his Black Sabbath bandmates. Speaking to GMA's Chris Connelly, Jack recalled the emotions he felt watching that final show. “I was with my brother, and we both were just crying,” he said. Reflecting on the bittersweet moment, Jack added, “In hindsight, it kind of was a living wake if you think about it.” Sharon, 72, was front and center at the July 5 charity show, which she helped organize for Ozzy. On July 30, she was seen stepping from the funeral procession to lay flowers at the Black Sabbath Bridge and Bench in Birmingham, where fans gathered to pay tribute to the rock legend. She remained silent on social media until September 12, when she shared a video from a day out with her daughter, Kelly Osbourne. As the Osbourne family continues to navigate their grief, their strength, unity, and connection to fans remain a touching reminder of the love that defined Ozzy's legacy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Tuesday, October 7, viewers who tuned into the FOX series “Murder in a Small Town” watched the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner in his final performance before his death. The beloved actor, who was best known to many as Theo Huxtable on “The Cosby Show,” passed away in July after getting caught in an ocean current. “We were really delighted when Malcolm agreed to join us as a guest star — and completely thrilled by the experience of working with him,” he told People. Warner plays a father named Richard Bannister, who is fiercely protective of his teen daughter. Many other characters and subplots were unfolding during the episode, but Warner made it feel like he was in a starring role. “He was so dynamic in the role,” producer Kim Roberts told TV Insider. “It was actually not meant to be a huge role, and he found a way of bringing that character to life beyond any of our expectations. “And I think he did an amazing job at doing both — that is, that we really cared for him and understood the dilemma, while at the same time… [he was] someone who was definitely a suspect in the murder,” Roberts continued. I think he really touched all of the crew, just because he is genuinely the person that you see, like he's just so — was, unfortunately — just so full of life, so full of goodness, and said really, really positive things to everyone, and it's very sad,” co-producer, Tina Pehme added. After his passing, many people, both expected and unexpected, came forward to talk about how he had changed them. His publicist, Jordyn Palos, claimed that he was responsible for her career. Others, like Anthony Mackie, Viola Davis, and Keshia Knight Pulliam shared the impact he had on their lives. He had protectively kept both out of the spotlight, but Tenisha broke her silence on Instagram two months after his death. “Tomorrow marks our anniversary —and my heart is wide open,” she wrote.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zach Bryan is clarifying his intentions with his song “Bad News,” a snippet of which he posted to Instagram last week. He, himself, is on “neither of these radical sides,” the country singer promised. In the statement shared to his Instagram Story (via Deadline), Bryan explained that he had written the song months ago and even shared a snippet online months ago, presumably to deny having shared the latest snippet in response to any one particular current event. He doesn't seem to want his song swept up in any “divisive” narrative (though surely he realized name-dropping ICE was going to cause a stir). Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are. We need to find our way back,” the Navy veteran wrote. To be clear I'm on neither of these radical sides. To all those disappointed in me on either side of whatever you believe in just know I'm trying my best too and we all say things that are misconstrued sometimes. In a statement to Newsweek littered with references to the artist's music (we'll say it again, it's fan behavior), a White House spokesperson said, “While Zach Bryan wants to Open the Gates to criminal illegal aliens and has Condemned heroic ICE officers, Something in the Orange tells me a majority of Americans disagree with him and support President Trump's great American Revival. The controversy comes after a summer of Bryan making headlines for beefing with other country artists. In a follow-up post to his statement, the singer-songwriter admitted the heightened scrutiny has been difficult, “and it's so hard to see where my bearings even are anymore,” he wrote. “I am SO proud to have served in a country where we can all speak freely and converse amongst each other without getting doxxed or accosted on the internet or worse; the violence and heartbreak we've faced in the last few months!” he concluded.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The right-wing information sphere on social media is shaped by large, often anonymous influencer accounts that are then amplified to even wider audiences by prominent conservatives. Two such accounts are Defiant L's and Resist the Mainstream, both offering takes on American politics, often alleging corruption and election fraud by Democrats, to a combined over 2 million followers. Republican lawmakers like Mike Lee, Nancy Mace, Andy Biggs, Eli Crane, and Dan Crenshaw, along with major political figures like Elon Musk, share the accounts' posts on X, some claiming that “illegals” or undocumented immigrants are fraudulently voting in American elections. The owner and operator of both accounts, however, is not only a man who has by his own admission never stepped foot in the United States but has donated over $3,000 in an American election. Defiant L's and Resist the Mainstream are two major players in the right-wing influencer space on X and cover American politics almost exclusively. Defiant L's in particular enjoys a major reach on the platform thanks to elected officials and Musk, who called Defiant L's “one of the best accounts on X” last year. South Carolina Congresswoman Nancy Mace has shared multiple posts from the account, and even replied to Defiant L's last month, on a post about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar that asked, “What's the first thought that comes to mind when you see Ilhan Omar?” “Censure,” Mace replied. Utah Sen. Mike Lee often shares Defiant L's posts, and in March tagged FBI Director Kash Patel and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino in one reshare. Lee also interacts with Resist the Mainstream, at least five times this year based on a review by Rolling Stone. Naumovski wrote this year that “Defiant L's” is “one of our accounts” in an opinion piece for The Daily Wire. The two accounts are listed as “affiliates” of each other on X, a paid feature that allows a business to link more than one account with verified affiliate badges. Naumovski was reported at the time as being Watkins' largest single donor that quarter — but that was years before it became known that Naumovski wasn't just of Macedonian origin, but has never had residential status in the U.S., or even been to the U.S., according to his Daily Wire op-ed. Website ID'ing People as Charlie Kirk's ‘Murderers' Rebrands — Then Vanishes People Are Losing Their Jobs for Criticizing Slain ‘Free Speech' Advocate Charlie Kirk Jimmy Kimmel Shuts Down MAGA Rumors: ‘I'm Not Moving to Italy' Friends here offered an easy solution — fake vaccination cards cost less than $50 in Macedonia. But I refused to begin my American journey with a lie. How long could waiting honestly really take?” He then tried for an E-2 business visa, but was rejected after repeated interviews by embassy staff, he claims in the piece, and to this day has never even been to the U.S. “Foreign nationals are categorically barred from spending money in our elections, whether it's directly, via PACs or even SuperPACs,” Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform at the Campaign Legal Center and former counsel at the FEC, tells Rolling Stone. Ghosh says that foreign donation schemes often happen via straw donors, or fake names, which are also prohibited, and that a foreign national donating under their own name is rare. Filings from a 2024 copyright lawsuit brought by a photojournalist who alleged Resist the Mainstream repeatedly stole his work show that Naumovski claims 100 percent ownership of the Florida company that operates the two X accounts, Raww Digital LLC. The two Watkins donations both list the St. Petersburg, Florida, registered agent's office where Raww Digital Inc. is located and Raww Digital LLC as Naumovski's employer. Watkins has long denied being “Q.” Watkins lost the Arizona Republican primary to Eli Crane, who has himself since amplified Naumovski's content at least seven times. After Naumovski donated to Watkins, Watkins boosted Resist the Mainstream's Telegram channel a week later, according to a screenshot obtained by Media Matters. Within minutes of learning that I contacted the campaign, which is immediately refunding my payment. I love America and would never intentionally violate any measure. Watkins told Rolling Stone in an email that he does not recall Naumovski's donations. “My 2022 Arizona campaign was very busy and ended more than three years ago. According to the FEC guidelines, federal campaign records have a three year retention period. It has been more than three years since the campaign ended, the three year retention period for campaign records has passed, and I do not personally remember details about specific donations. Some X users have alleged that they were approached by Naumovski to post his content for payment. Naumovski did not respond to follow-up questions from Rolling Stone about whether he offered Watkins or other influencers payments to promote his company's content, nor did he respond to questions about how he learned his donations were illegal. A major booster of Naumovski's career is former Fox News executive Ken LaCorte. LaCorte admitted to The New York Times in 2019 that he hired Macedonian teenagers from Veles, Naumovski's Macedonian hometown, to write for several conservative content sites he ran beginning in 2017. Since then, I've been both a friend and an adviser, helping him build his business and encouraging him through the U.S. immigration system,” he wrote on his Substack in February, a few days after Naumovski himself admitted he's never been to the U.S. He could have easily gamed the system — faked paperwork, overstayed a tourist visa, or ‘lost' his passport. Naumovski has enjoyed connections with other Republican activists, such as Roger Stone, who endorsed him in 2023 on X: “I highly recommend that you follow @RumenNaumovski, the founder of Resist the Mainstream on Twitter. Before this year's revelations, Naumovski himself repeated a similarly vague biography: “I was born overseas but have devoted my life to spreading the virtues of American freedom,” he wrote on X. It's Time for ‘Call of Duty' to Take a Break The issue of foreign interests influencing American politics through anonymous X influencer accounts is an ongoing one. Last year, federal prosecutors alleged that the conservative media company Tenet, which pays a network of major right-wing influencers like Benny Johnson and Tim Pool, was secretly being paid by Russian state operatives to disseminate propaganda to a large American audience. Johnson, Pool, and other Tenet content creators maintain they were unaware of the alleged Russian influence campaign and were victims of deceptions. Interfering in American elections financially, however, is still one of the campaign finance violations that's taken seriously and prosecuted, Ghosh says. “This is one of our bedrock campaign finance laws, to keep American elections working toward the goals of American public welfare, and not the opposite.”</p>

For his critically acclaimed portrayal of playwright William Shakespeare in Chloé Zhao's fall film fest darling Hamnet, Paul Mescal will be promoted this awards season for best supporting actor — as opposed to best actor — honors, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. There has been widespread speculation about which path would be pursued by Mescal — a best actor Oscar nominee in 2023 for 2022's Aftersun — and his backers, including Hamnet distributor Focus Features.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>And it was faced, in the late '90s, by a few people who could be loosely be defined as working in the loosely defined realm of popular culture: directors like Wes Anderson, who would answer that query by widening his scope (and budget, color palette, ensemble, and number of carefully-constructed establishing shots and costumes); bands like Wilco, who would make the ambitious masterpiece that made their career, albeit one that ironically also got them dropped by their label for not being, to their ears, marketable; artists like Cat Power's Chan Marshal, who would release one of the best covers after one the best two-chord songs ever; and writers like Kenneth Lonergan, who would use the Off-Broadway buzz he got from This Is Our Youth to make a remarkable debut film. But if there was one perfect series from this time—and one that had started and ended all too quickly and thus felt fully formed and consistently “complete”—it would have to be Freaks And Geeks, a beautifully bookended, “this-is-mine“-worthy obsession in a medium that, just by its nature (so many episodes, tight schedules, voices in the room, years over its run), doesn't—can't—have a lot of those. Club‘s Danette Chavez put in her One-Season Wonders on the 1999 NBC show: “Freaks And Geeks was a beacon to anyone whose high-school experience was awkward, boring, humbling, or painful—basically, anything other than the sexy and stylish depictions that had dominated teen-centered movies and shows.” “And so when Undeclared started, when I was trying to find a way to get Amy [Poehler] involved,” explained Apatow in 2011 at the Paley Center For Media in Beverly Hills during a reunion of the show's cast, “and I wanted to try retain as much of Freaks And Geeks as I could, I thought: Well, how old would they be next?” And thus a series, which you would not be wrong describing in a boiled-down-to-the-basics, caveman-uttered sort of way as “Freaks And Geeks but college but sitcom,” was born. And you really can't talk about Undeclared, which kicked off its one and only season on Fox in September 2001, without talking about Freaks, if only because they share so much DNA. Geeks creator Paul Feig helmed the show's fantastic second episode, “Oh, So You Have A Boyfriend?” (a half hour that, interestingly, had two versions—an initial one titled “Full Bluntal Nugety” had a whole lot more Ted Nugent—and involved reshoots, which you can read about in Erik Adams' recaps); Seth Rogen, who was hired at just 18 years old, wrote for the show and starred as a main character; and director Jake Kasdan, who directed the most episodes of Freaks, also returned. In front of the camera, there were a ton of familiar faces, including Freaks And Geeks titular players such as Jason Segel, Busy Philipps, Martin Starr, and Samm Levine (very amusing as the frat president Books here), as well as Natasha Melnick, Steve Bannos, David Krumholtz, and Mark Allan Staubach (who played Sam's dream-girl cheerleader Cindy Sanders, a stressed-out math teacher, Neal's brother who's enjoying college far more than high school, and that “Yeah, Ken, smash me a piece of that!” pot dealer, respectively) and drop-ins like Mike White (who was also a writer on Freaks). Unlike its spiritual predecessor, Undeclared is not a perfect show. It is, however, a great and very funny one—under or outside of the shadow of that cult darling that came before it—with a confident and reliable comedic rhythm that's easy to both get sucked into and casually enjoy, like you're lounging on that futon and sipping a can of Hamm's while chuckling along to a story in your friend's dorm room. Apatow's series didn't exactly conjure critical hosannas that it was “tender [and] achingly real,” to lift a pull quote from the back of Freaks‘ Shout! In his review of Undeclared: The Complete Series for The A.V.Club, Scott Tobias accurately summed it up as, comparatively, “a more easily digestible comedy about campus life.” This one doesn't make you cry like, say, when Sam (John Francis Daley), after learning that his friend's dad is cheating, hugs his own father (played by the late, great Joe Flaherty). That doesn't mean it's not moving or doesn't touch on pain, and you may just well up just a bit when an insane diva of a boyfriend and his college-freshman girlfriend break up (a scene that, for some reason, hit harder during the rewatch for this piece). But Undeclared is definitely both literally and figuratively sunnier than Freaks, moving from the Michigan suburbs in the early '80s to the “University Of Northeastern California” in modern times, with the occasional palm tree and steady sunshine that comes with filming parts of a TV show at UCLA. There's Steven (Jay Baruchel, who, like Sam in Geeks, looks refreshingly and accurately quite young and acts, at first, accordingly awkward), a former high-school nerd and our POV character who is trying to reinvent himself as a cool, confident guy in college (and whose idea of flirting is, relatably, asking “Do you know this guy was in Election?” on what he thinks is a date); Lloyd (Charlie Hunnam, current star of Monster: The Ed Gein Story), a handsome British theater major who is actually a cool, confident guy (and who everyone wants to sleep with); Ron (Rogen), a bespectacled, overanalyzing smartass of a business major and Maxim magazine enthusiast; and the goofy Marshall (Timm Sharp), who is studying music unbeknownst to his parents, loves Beck, and (at least for this writer, who was also a college freshman in the fall of 2001) is the most reminiscent of dorm guys—or at least the ones you'd want to be around—of this time. And down the hall, there's Lizzie (Carla Gallo), Steven's love interest who's girly and has that aforementioned crazy and clingy boyfriend; and Rachel (Monica Keena), Marshall's kinda-but-not-really secret crush who is introduced as prone to panic attacks in the pilot but quickly becomes the saner and more independent voice of reason of the pair. As Gallo pointed out in that reunion, the show had only two female writers: Jenni Konner (who would go on to co-showrun the twentysomething, post-college series Girls, which was executive-produced by Apatow) and Alexandra Rushfield (who would collaborate with Apatow again as a scribe on the thirtysomething, more-into-the-real-world show Love). And the women's storylines here—on the freshman 15, a bad dye job, ladies' night, and the fight that erupts from replaying that 1996 OMC hit—often don't have the gravity, perspective, or lived-in verisimilitude of those of their fellow co-eds on the floor, although there is a funny bit in which Rachel's overstrict mother discovers a stuffed animal filled with her daughter's condoms, smokes, and booze. Sure, it “ain't the same fuckin' ballpark” as 2003's Old School, in which the only female-focused storyline that springs to mind is a blowjob class, but it's worth noting—as is, come to think of it, that Adam Sandler (playing himself) sleeps with Lizzie. Of this main freshmen cast, the MVP goes to Sharp, who has an affable everydude vibe and is quite funny whenever Marshall is into the spotlight—by playing his awful Beck-esque song to a crowd, buying a pet bird as a fashion accessory in the midst of a bender, or getting death's-door sick just so he can spend time with holistic-medicine proponent Rachel. But one of the big and constantly enjoyable strengths of this sitcom is its incredibly stacked cast for characters outside that main crew: Segel, for this staffer's money, has never been as laugh-out-loud funnier as he is here as a Lizzie's rage-prone, oft-screaming older BF and copy-shop employee, Eric; Poehler, who also made her SNL debut in September 2001 (and hosts this weekend's edition), brings a manic energy, lighting up each scene she's in as an unstable head RA; Loudon Wainwright is hilarious as Steven's boundary-less father, who announces that his wife separated with him on his son's first day of college—and proceeds to play drinking games with his roommates and pass out; and the great Kevin Rankin plays Lucien, the childlike, sweet, and oblivious floor RA with a lisp. There are some very fun guest stars, too (Will Ferrell's speed-freak townie, Fred Willard's reenergized veteran professor, Kevin Hart's religious student), but the best of the bunch is Ben Stiller as a longhaired ex-addict and former stepfather of Eric. But those guest spots don't work without a solid base, and this group of tossed-together teens has the necessary comfortable chemistry, as seen in this bit from “Truth Or Dare” (an episode written by Rogen and directed by Superbad‘s Greg Mottola), wherein the guys write a literal script and perform it in order to coax the girls into the titular game: Perry (Jarrett Grode, with some characteristically wonderful dry delivery): Yes, I saw that as well. Steven: The truth is, you really should tell. “We were really trying to figure out: How funny can we make one of these half hours?” recalled Apatow in 2011. “It was really weird to do a single-camera comedy, so [network executives] would say, ‘Where are we gonna put it on the schedule? There's no other [show] like it on TV—it feels weird against a sitcom. '” And just like Freaks, it was canceled for low ratings. Three years later, Apatow took the same stage in Beverly Hills, this time to receive the 2014 PaleyFest Icon Award. “Everything I've done, in a way, is revenge for the people who canceled Freaks And Geeks,” he remarked. But if that spite led to a show this delightful—not to mention had a hand in an industry-changing R-rated-comedy boom, some of which was pretty great—then there's a solid case to be made that those bad impulses did some good.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In April 2023, moments after being reinstated to his office in the Tennessee legislature after Republicans booted him in retaliation for his gun control activism, Justin J. Pearson told reporters that despite their best efforts: “You can't expel hope. Two years later, Pearson is looking to leave the Tennessee House on his own terms, announcing Wednesday that he's challenging longtime Democratic incumbent Steve Cohen for his seat in the U.S. House, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District. “[Cohen] has been at it for 20 years, and still one in three children in this district are living below the poverty line,” he adds. “One in five people are living underneath the poverty line. Pearson, only 30 years old, has spent half of his life in politics. At the age of 15 he appeared before the Memphis-Shelby County Schools Board to lobby for textbooks at his public high school. His university career was defined by a focus on education reform and public policy. In Pearson's view, making a bid for an office in D.C. isn't about having outgrown his local seat, but about strengthening the connection the underrepresented in his community have to the nation's halls of power. Dem Says Mike Johnson Is Delaying Her Swearing-In to Prevent Epstein Vote Supreme Court Architect Is Pumping Money Into the Midterms Vulnerable Republicans Are Claiming They Love Medicaid After Voting to Gut It “A lot of people in Congress are pretending as though they're not constituents of places that they're supposedly representing, and that is harmful to the body politic,” he adds, pointing to Cohen, who is 76, as a longtime offender. “Cohen sent out a letter saying he held two town halls this year. What makes you think we should be celebrating mediocrity? Polling this summer showed that Democrats in the U.S. House have a record-low approval rating as they struggle to counter the Trump administration. “Democrats are the opposition party, and that's a title we need to hold with a level of seriousness, because the opposition party has a responsibility of holding the people in power even more accountable for their actions or inaction,” Pearson says. “There's not been any check and balance against this executive authoritarian regime of Donald Trump. Congress as a whole has failed to do his constitutional responsibility.” “There is no playbook that we are using from the past that could work in the present, and so we've got to stand up. And that's what representation does, it organizes power in the places where congressional folks are from.” The authoritarian tactics of Trump's administration have made their way to Pearson's own community. The president has been targeting prominent Democratic cities — and cities with large populations of Black and Latino residents — as staging grounds for his shock-and-awe, militarized crackdowns. The president has targeted Memphis as the next city to unleash federal forces into, following incursions in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.  Crime in Memphis recently hit a 25-year low, according to local authorities. “That they are continuing to use [crime] as a reason for overreach into local government and taking over law enforcement in our communities, but there is no conversation about crime without a conversation about poverty,” he adds. Usamah Andrabi, communications director at Justice Democrats — which has already endorsed Pearson — tells Rolling Stone that he “embodies the sort of leadership that we are looking to transform the Democratic Party with, and that Democratic voters are demanding to see more of in the halls of power.” There is “often a gap between our current Democratic representatives and the people who vote for them. I think Justin has shown exactly how you can do that at all times.” Andrabi adds, noting that there are so many “base Democratic voters who are ready to see a new generation of leadership come into the Democratic Party.” Other groups, including Leaders We Deserve, the progressive organization founded by Parkland survivor and gun control activist David Hogg, have also endorsed Pearson and pledged $1 million in spending on behalf of his campaign. “Justin J. Pearson has repeatedly shown the kind of backbone needed to confront powerful special interests, from big oil to the gun lobby,” Leaders We Deserve President and Co-Founder David Hogg said in a statement provided to Rolling Stone.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The veteran comedy superstar “doesn't give a f***” what anyone thinks of his recent trip to Saudi Arabia: “If it affects my career, I've been to LAX enough in my life, I'll f***ing sit home for a little bit.” Conan O'Brien and the crew from his SiriusXM podcast took over Hollywood's Fonda Theatre on Sunday night for a special live recording of Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend. After an introductory segment featuring co-hosts Sona Movsesian and Matt Gourley, the Fonda's lights dimmed as O'Brien readied to reveal his surprise guest — Bill Burr. “Hi, I'm Bill Burr and I feel wonderful about being Conan O'Brien's friend,” said the veteran actor-comedian from a podium to rousing applause from the capacity crowd, which included The Hollywood Reporter. “It's been fucking fantastic,” he quipped after taking a seat. Defends Performing at Riyadh Comedy Festival: "Feels Like a Good Opportunity" Lesbian Stand-Up Comedian Jessica Kirson Expresses "Sincere Regret" for Riyadh Comedy Festival Performance O'Brien was quick to note that his longtime friend and frequent guest had “been in the news” that week, an observation that likely did not come as a surprise to anyone in the room. Taking place from Sept. 26 to Oct. 9, the event welcomed a who's who to the country for stand-up sets, a roster that included Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Kevin Hart, Pete Davidson, Whitney Cummings, Andrew Schulz, Aziz Ansari, Jim Jefferies, Jo Koy, Sebastian Maniscalco, Mark Normand, Tom Segura, Bobby Lee, Jeff Ross and more. It caused a firestorm of controversy as word spread of its lineup, leading people like Marc Maron, David Cross and Atsuko Okatsuka to speak out against it, given the kingdom's history of oppression and human rights abuses. Burr was quick to counter the criticism on his podcast — the episode dropped Sept. 30 as the online heat was still boiling — by saying what a great experience it was for him to travel to Saudi Arabia and perform in both Bahrain and Riyadh. Burr's tone had changed by Sunday night as he unleashed on his critics with a barrage of expletives, slamming the online outrage as being stirred up and inflamed by bots and reiterating that the festival itself was a sign of forward progress for the Middle East. “The general consensus is, ‘How dare you go to that place and make those oppressed people laugh, you fucking piece of shit. I can't believe you went to that place. “It's one thing to wear clothes made by sweatshop labor. If anything, he delivered a warning that recent events in the United States have indicated “we're moving towards them.” “Jesus Christ, we're fucking grabbing moms and dads and sticking 'em in a van for making illegally made fucking tacos to go to Alligator Alcatraz,” Burr said of the ICE raids. And someday they're gonna be out of brown people to put in those vans, they're still gonna have the vans, so you shouldn't be feeling comfortable about it, thinking that you're not gonna be in it.” “All of these sanctimonious cunts out there … who don't really sincerely give a shit,” he said. “If you actually give a fuck about those people and how they're living over there, there's gonna have to be these types of things to pull them in. And I will tell you, the Cheesecake Factory in Riyadh, it's incredible. Though he didn't mention her by name, Burr gave a nice shout-out to fellow comedian Jessica Kirson, who was on the Riyadh Comedy Festival bill. “Openly gay, went over there and just did her fucking act. And she was in the middle of her act and two of the diplomats got up and she said to them, ‘What, are you guys going to go get on Grindr? “Dude, 33 years of comedy, that's the biggest balls of anyone I've ever seen.” But then she received backlash from “hardcore psycho gays,” Burr said, adding, “Fucking lunatics, man.” After the outrage, Kirson apologized in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter and revealed she would be donating her fee to a human rights organization. Burr said he had “no fucking idea” the festival would inspire such controversy from people that aren't able to locate Saudi Arabia on a map. “One time I did Abu Dhabi and somebody [texted me], ‘Oh, you're going over there to get that blood money, right?' And I go, ‘Hey, just for the record, I'm also doing London, England, on that tour, which is arguably the bloodiest fucking money out there,'” he said. I will actually tell you LAX is slightly sadder than Saudi Arabia.” “I've been going through this bullshit the whole week. “He heard me on the podcast, saying what I said here, that I had a good time and it was a positive thing so he thought that was the mindset that I was in through the week.” He was in contact with his tour manager, who shared with him some of the feedback he was getting. “One of my favorite things is this scumbag club owner texted my tour manager because he heard I was over there [in Saudi Arabia]. So I wrote back to him, ‘Why don't you concentrate on not ripping off comedians? In closing, Burr said that events like the Riyadh Comedy Festival “have to happen” in order to push progress forward. I don't know what to tell you. The live episode is out now for SiriusXM Podcasts+ subscribers and will be available widely on Oct. 15. Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>
