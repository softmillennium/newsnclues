If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. Trump has been at odds with Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, both of whom have opposed the president's plan to increase Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Chicago and deploy the National Guard there. “Chicago Mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers! He has, for example, said he is considering invoking the Insurrection Act to send U.S. military troops to Democratic-run cities across the country. Trump has relentlessly attacked Democrats in general, sharing a meme last week, for instance, that referred to the Democratic party as the party of “hate, evil and Satan.” He has also threatened to use military force to quell protests of his policies, describing protesters as “terrorists” and people with leftist views as “the enemy from within.” “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested,” Johnson wrote on X. “I will not back down,” Pritzker said in his response. “Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?” According to independent monitors, Trump's descent into authoritarianism has indeed escalated in recent months. Protect Democracy, a nonprofit that describes itself as an “anti-authoritarianism group,” surveys around 1,000 scholars daily on their views regarding freedom levels in several countries, including the U.S. According to an Economist/YouGov poll published this week, only 37 percent of Americans are in favor of Trump deploying the military to U.S. cities, while 52 percent are opposed.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to one source, the number is between seven and nine, another source put it between 10 and 15. One of the sources said the assessments are based on Israeli intelligence reports, as well as messaging from Hamas and mediators in recurring rounds of negotiations. There are 20 hostages who are believed to be alive, with grave concerns for the well-being of two of them. The three Israeli sources say Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his cabinet have known for months that Hamas does not know the whereabouts of some of the deceased hostages and may therefore be unable to meet that demand. CNN has asked the Israeli government for comment. The United States has also known about the issue for some time, with negotiators in the Biden administration aware that some hostages were held by factions in Gaza over which Hamas does not exert full control. “It's far more likely they can recover all of the living hostages,” she said. It is unclear how this uncertainty could affect the current round of crucial talks in Egypt. One Israeli source said that Israel's official position is that Hamas is responsible for all the deceased hostages and the Israeli government expects all of them to be returned. The source said that Hamas might use the uncertainty over its ability to return all the dead hostages to draw out the implementation of any ceasefire arrangements, and to insist that it would not return all remaining hostages until Israel agrees to a full military withdrawal from Gaza. Another Israeli source expressed concern that Netanyahu might use the uncertainty as a pretext to derail talks. Critics of the Israeli prime minister, including opposition leaders and families of hostages, have repeatedly accused him of deliberately undermining negotiations to end the war, alleging he imposes new conditions for political reasons, particularly when agreements appear close. However, other sources say that given the heavy American and regional pressure to secure a deal, Netanyahu is more likely to use the issue as leverage over the final details of an agreement, rather than torpedoing the entire framework under US President Donald Trump's 20-point proposal. The uncertainty about deceased hostages is particularly sensitive in Israeli society, as it resonates with previous unresolved cases of missing soldiers. His body has never been handed over, and is now counted among the 48 living and dead hostages Israel demands be returned. Goldin's family has campaigned for years for his return, citing Israel's commitment to the principle of leaving no-one behind in conflict. Ron Arad, an Israeli Air Force navigator, was captured when his jet was shot down over Lebanon in 1986. Nearly four decades later, his unresolved disappearance remains one of Israel's most painful symbols. One of Netanyahu's closest confidants, Natan Eshel, wrote a message to a group of journalists last week, referring to the Gaza negotiations and saying “there will be some Ron Arads” – an indication that senior figures in the Israeli political establishment believe that some hostages' bodies will never be returned.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump on Wednesday called for the imprisonment of Brandon Johnson, Chicago's mayor, and JB Pritzker, the Illinois governor, accusing them of failing to protect US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers. “This is not the first time Trump has tried to have a Black man unjustly arrested” Johnson said on Wednesday in response to Trump's remarks. Pritzker also responded on social media, saying: “I will not back down. Trump is now calling for the arrest of elected representatives checking his power. What else is left on the path to full-blown authoritarianism?” As of Wednesday morning, national guard troops from Texas had arrived at Elwood army reserve center, an army training center about 50 miles outside Chicago, as the Trump administration pushes ahead with an aggressive policy toward big-city crime and its mass deportation efforts.. The president has called Chicago a “hellhole” of crime, although police statistics show significant drops in most crimes, including homicides. The official reportedly said the troops were not going to assume law enforcement duties but would protect federal immigration agents and facilities. Trucks marked “Emergency Disaster Services” dropped off portable toilets and other supplies. A court hearing on their lawsuit is scheduled for Thursday. Mayor Johnson also signed an executive order on Monday barring federal immigration agents and others from using city-owned property as staging areas for enforcement operations. Pritzker  has accused Trump of using troops as “political props” and “pawns”. At a news conference on Tuesday, Pritzker said that Trump was attempting to “justify and normalize the presence of armed soldiers under his direct command”. However, Trump has said he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act, which allows a president to dispatch active-duty military in states that are unable to put down an insurrection or are defying federal law. Since starting his second term, Trump has sent or talked about sending troops to at least 10 cities, including Baltimore; Washington DC; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles, arguing that the military presence is needed to combat crime and protect Ice officers. Data shows that most violent crime around the US has declined in recent years. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found that most Americans oppose the deployment of troops without an external threat. An earlier version said that in Chicago homicides were down 31% to 278 through August.</p>

MOSCOW, October 8. /TASS/. Russian lawmakers voted at a plenary meeting to denounce the agreement with the United States on the disposition of weapons-grade plutonium which is no longer used for defense purposes.

Apart from the intergovernmental agreement reached between Moscow and Washington in 2000 and ratified in 2011, the bill submitted by the Cabinet proposes that all protocols associated with it be denounced, too.

The accompanying materials read that the US side did not fulfil a single condition under the document. Moreover, the United States has taken more anti-Russian steps "that radically change the strategic balance that existed when the agreement was signed and pose additional threats to strategic security."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European arms company Thales has raised concerns over the number of unidentified drones spotted recently over its Belgian facility producing 70 mm rockets, Politico reported on Oct. 8. The news comes as suspicious drone activity has caused alarm across Europe, with some cases having been linked to Russia. The company's Belgium-based facilities have been ramping up the production of 70 mm rockets that can be used against drones, supplying both European countries and Ukraine. Arms demand is growing in the European market amid Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and fears of a potential clash between NATO and Moscow, exacerbated by recent drone incursions. Polish forces shot down several Russian drones that entered their airspace during an attack on Ukraine in September. Days later, a Russian drone breached Romanian territory, though Bucharest chose not to engage it. Estonia also reported that three Russian MiG-31 briefly violated its airspace on Sept. 19. The incidents prompted calls for a more forceful response to such incursions, including downing Russian aircraft and drones if necessary. The plan to phase out Russian oil and gas by January 2028 has received broad backing from most member states, though Hungary and Slovakia continue to oppose it, a source told Reuters. "The strong momentum created in Anchorage toward reaching agreements has been largely exhausted due to the efforts of opponents... primarily among Europeans," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. European arms company Thales has raised concerns over the number of unidentified drones spotted recently over its Belgian facility, which produces 70 mm rockets, Politico reported on Oct. 8. Babis also repeated ANO's earlier suggestion that NATO could oversee the initiative instead. The move comes as Ukraine's continued drone strikes on Russian oil refineries strain domestic fuel supplies. "The Ukrainian side is acting in accordance with Polish law," Ukraine's Ambassador to Poland Vasyl Bodnar said. Lithuanian authorities emphasized that Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya remains an official guest of the state and that Vilnius's stance toward the Belarusian regime led by Alexander Lukashenko remains unchanged. According to Ukraine's Air Force, Russian forces launched 183 Shahed-type attack and decoy drones overnight.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israeli and Hamas officials are set to hold talks at the Red Sea city of Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt.The Associated Press With U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point plan appearing closer than any previous bid to halt the war, delegations were upgrading their presence at the indirect talks, launched on Monday in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. Also joining the discussions was the prime minister of longstanding mediator Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, according to Egyptian sources. Here's what you need to know about Gaza and the Israel-Hamas war, including ceasefire talks, famine and the Israeli ground offensive. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the mediated negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas had made “a lot of headway” and that a ceasefire would be declared if they reached a positive outcome. Trump also expressed optimism about progress toward a deal on Tuesday, and European, Arab and other states will meet in Paris on Thursday to discuss Gaza's post-war transition, with Washington likely to be represented, diplomatic sources said. Gaza authorities say more than 67,000 people have been killed and much of the enclave has been flattened since Israel began its military response to the Hamas attack two years ago. Hamas said it had handed over its lists of hostages and Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged in a swap, and was optimistic about the talks so far. The list of Palestinians Hamas wants freed is expected to include some of the most prominent prisoners ever jailed by Israel, whose release had been off limits in previous ceasefires. Both are serving multiple life sentences for involvement in attacks that killed Israelis. The group has so far refused to discuss Israel's demand that Hamas give up its arms, which the Palestinian source said Hamas would reject as long as Israeli troops occupy Palestinian land. The Israeli military said its forces had killed several militants in Gaza City, Gaza's main urban hub, who it said were on their way to attack Israeli soldiers. “We hope from God that a ceasefire would take place as soon as possible, because people can't bear the suffering anymore,” said Jehad al-Shagnobi, whose house was destroyed in the Sabra district of Gaza City. Another participant in the talks was Turkish spymaster Ibrahim Kalin, Egyptian sources said. Opinion: An Israel-Hamas deal makes sense for both sides – but huge obstacles remain Trump's plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza's post-war administration. Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen. There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007. Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries. It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a U.N. inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel calls its actions self-defence after the 2023 Hamas attack. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roy Cooper is shattering fundraising records to turn the North Carolina seat blue Democrats do not have a path to winning back the Senate without taking North Carolina, and they cannot win North Carolina without a massive war chest. Not only has the former governor never lost an election in his almost 40-year political career, but his campaign recently revealed it had broken fundraising records for a Senate race. Just weeks after he formally began his run before the 2026 mid-terms, Mr Cooper has raised more than $14.5m: the largest ever single-quarter haul for a Senate seat challenger. Michael Whatley, the Republican challenger, has been decisively out-raised thus far, and some believe the GOP's only chance to hang onto North Carolina is to saturate the state in outside money. North Carolina Senate races have been shattering records for decades, with some $25m being spent in the bitterly-fought 1984 contest between Jim Hunt and Jesse Helms. Now, a member of Mr Cooper's campaign quoted in Politico believes it could be the first $1bn Senate contest. The reasons for that are twofold according to R Bruce Thompson, a North Carolina fundraiser who served on Hillary Clinton's finance committee for her presidential run nine years ago. First, North Carolina is a politically-divided state where contests are closely fought between Republicans and Democrats and often turn on tiny margins. “These elections become nationalised because of the fact that there is so much riding on them,” Mr Thompson told The Telegraph. Democrats, who have 45 senators plus two independents who caucus with them, would have to flip four seats in next year's mid-terms for a majority. But they have been buoyed by Mr Cooper's campaign launch. In many ways, the former governor, who began his political career while Ronald Reagan was still in the White House, is a political throwback. He's nice to people he doesn't get along with, doesn't agree with, and that's not something you see a lot in politics anymore.” When he announced his Senate run in July, Mr Cooper steered clear of personal attacks. Mr Trump and Mr Whatley did not get mentioned by name, while the lone reference to Republicans was for his work reaching across the aisle as governor to expand Medicaid, the health insurance programme for low-income Americans. The key message was affordability: reviving the middle-class dream for Americans, stopping mounting federal debt, and blocking attacks on Medicaid and Medicare. But the odds are Mr Cooper will go to Washington after all. Mr Whatley, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who in his time has drummed up hundreds of millions of dollars for candidates, brought in less than half than his rival: $5.8m. Mr Cooper, whom polling shows has a healthy lead in the contest and high name recognition, has conspicuously avoided naming Mr Whatley, a former backroom fixer who is much less well-known. Occasionally, he refers to him as a “DC insider”. That's not hard money to raise,” Mr Thompson said of the former RNC boss. “When you're running against somebody who has the kind of name recognition and approval that Roy Cooper does, you have to raise a lot. Super Political Action Committees (Pacs) can spend unlimited amounts on advertising and are much less tightly regulated than direct contributions to candidates. “Just one billionaire can have an outsized impact on the democratic process,” he said. The biggest billionaire of them all is Mr Musk, who spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars to back Mr Trump and other Republican candidates in last year's elections. The Tesla boss, who is projected to become the world's first trillionaire, has recently said he intends to take a step back from politics as his relationship with the president spectacularly, and publicly, fell apart. Exactly who directs its day-to-day operations is unclear, but it could be used to support specific Republican candidates. Political strategists who spoke to The Telegraph expect the North Carolina race to morph into a “brutal” war of attrition. But so far, Mr Cooper's popularity is intact. “You don't see a lot of figures in politics these days who are popular,” Mr Wrenn said. ', most of them are going to say, ‘Oh, I dislike him.' “Independent voters like him… and they're the ones that really matter in terms of who wins.” The bad news is that it takes a popular former governor and hundreds of millions of dollars to get there. Winning another Senate seat, let alone winning enough to take back the Senate, will be more of a challenge.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. James Curran is Professor of Modern History at Sydney University. Australia, like many U.S. allies, is struggling to deal with President Donald Trump. Although China is by far Australia's most important trade partner, it is also the country that Australia's national security establishment perceives as its greatest threat. Australia's fear of China is more than a century old and runs deep through every defense strategy that Australia has developed since the signing of the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS) in 1951 and the resolution of its postwar relationship with Japan later that decade. Parts of the agreement—including cooperation in quantum computing; artificial intelligence; cyber-, hypersonic, and undersea technology; and more—are moving ahead more or less as planned. But a key component of AUKUS could be in serious trouble. Australia is supposed to begin receiving a small fleet of nuclear-powered submarines from the United States in 2032, and then the three countries are supposed to jointly design and produce a new class of submarine. Its findings are expected later this October, coinciding with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to Washington for his first substantive meeting with Trump. AUKUS has become emblematic of the U.S.-Australian alliance as a whole, and it is now at risk of being weighed down by unfulfilled expectations on both sides. Whereas Australia wants constant reassurance from the U.S. administration that the agreement is moving ahead as planned, the United States wants firm pledges that any submarines it transfers to Australia will participate in a potential conflict with China. At its core, the AUKUS agreement is about nuclear-powered submarines. Australia's current fleet of six diesel-powered submarines is aging and needs to be replaced soon; nuclear-powered submarines are faster and can conduct operations of longer duration. As part of the AUKUS deal, the United States committed to transfer three to five Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines to Australia by 2032, as long as Washington determines that their sale does not degrade U.S. undersea capabilities and that it remains in the American national interest. For reasons never adequately explained, this vessel will be more than 25 percent larger in size than the Virginia-class submarine and will require more crew. As Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said in late 2023, when the U.S. Congress authorized key provisions of the agreement, AUKUS “will transform our ability to effectively deter, innovate, and operate together.” The agreement was a public relations coup when it was first signed, showcasing strong American support at a time of deep tension between Australia and China. In 2020, Conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government had openly challenged Beijing's “wolf warrior” diplomacy and called for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19. In response, China slapped sweeping trade restrictions on Australia. Unbowed, Australia styled itself as the “tip of the spear” as it condemned China's assertive behavior in Asia and pushed back against Beijing's economic coercion. After coming into office in May 2022, Albanese dramatically improved Australia's relations with China, abandoning his predecessor's megaphone diplomacy and emphasizing stability and, more recently, “constructive engagement” with Beijing. Yet he has still plowed ahead with AUKUS, worried that any sign of slipping support for the deal will be interpreted by political opponents as weakness on national security and a sign that his Labor Party cannot manage the U.S. alliance. Albanese himself tends to talk more about the local employment opportunities of AUKUS than about the strategic benefits, and Foreign Minister Penny Wong barely mentions the deal in public and is known to oppose it in private. Washington, meanwhile, typically sees Australia's close economic relations with China as reason to doubt its commitment to the alliance with the United States. In June 2022, a few months into its term, the Albanese government sought to assuage Washington's concern by secretly dispatching a special envoy to the White House to reassure the Biden administration of Australia's steadfastness. President Joe Biden's Asia policy chief, Kurt Campbell, told European officials privately in late 2022 that AUKUS had been about “getting Australia off the fence.” With the deal signed, he said, “we have them locked in now for the next 40 years.” But officials in the Trump administration are not so convinced, interpreting Albanese's attempts to patch up relations with China as disregard for the security challenges that Beijing poses. Speaking at the British think tank Policy Exchange last year, he asked, “Why are we giving away this crown jewel asset when we most need it?” Canberra worries about the United States' reliability as a security partner, fearing that Australia may be left with no submarine capability at all if AUKUS fails. Prominent critics of the agreement, including former Prime Ministers Paul Keating and Malcolm Turnbull, along with various former submarine commanders and experts, have also raised practical concerns, including questions about Australian industry's capacity to assume responsibility for building a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines by the early 2040s and, in the meantime, about whether a naval port under construction in Western Australia will be ready to host British and American nuclear-powered submarines when they are due to arrive on a military rotation in 2027. And according to recent opinion polling, public approval for AUKUS is wobbly: a Lowy Institute survey this year found that only around half of Australians think the deal will make Australia safer, and a Guardian Essential poll revealed that 60 percent of Australians think it unlikely that United States will ever deliver Virginia-class submarines. So far, Albanese has been adamant that his government will raise Australian defense spending only to roughly 2.3 percent of GDP by 2032, an increase of less than half a percentage point, which will not be nearly enough to cover the additional expense of AUKUS. For at least the next several years, therefore, the Australian military could be unprepared to respond to any potential conflict. Indeed, it could do little more than what is has traditionally done: send a small deployment to operate alongside U.S. forces. It could determine that Australia has paid into the U.S. industrial base sufficiently and that the benefits of access to joint intelligence and military facilities across Australia are valuable enough to allow the deal to proceed. Washington could conceivably prefer to lose a few submarines—sending them to Australia rather than reserving them for American use in a fight with China over Taiwan, for instance—rather than upset Canberra, which the United States needs on board if it is to use Australia as a base for U.S. force projection in the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea. Preserving the terms of AUKUS, however, would not resolve Australia's problems. The submarines may not arrive by 2032, a failure that would cast an ominous cloud over U.S.-Australian relations, feeding doubts about whether the Trump administration and its successors remain committed to keeping a firm military footprint in Asia. Canberra would, in effect, be paying an eye-watering cost to provide auxiliary forces for the U.S. Navy, not gaining sovereign defense capabilities that it can command as it wishes. Such an outcome would make AUKUS seem like an immense strategic blunder: Australia would have spent years backing (and funding) the United States without receiving what it expected from the deal. Australia's faith in the United States' reliability as an ally, already rocked by Trump, would be shaken even more, and the tremors would be felt in Manila, Seoul, Taipei, and Tokyo, too. Australia's existing fleet of submarines is aging and requires costly, time-consuming refits to extend its service; only one of six vessels is currently operational. Submarine suppliers are few, and Canberra has already burned its bridges with one of them—the French firm that Australia publicly dumped before AUKUS was announced. Whether AUKUS succeeds or not, the debate about its future has revealed a fundamental disconnect between Australia and the United States. Washington has long assumed, but left unsaid, that Australia would join the United States in a potential war with China over Taiwan by providing bases for intelligence gathering and by conducting other military activities. Australian officials do have an interest in Taiwan's future, to be sure. Beyond concern about Taiwan itself, Australia does not want China further emboldened to assert itself all over East Asia and Southeast Asia. Yet Australia has a strong interest in avoiding war, too, given that any conflict could entail severe economic disruption because of the country's dependence on the China market. They worry, however, that Australia's much-prized access in Washington is slipping as Trump prioritizes great-power politics. For now, Australia is experiencing this loss as a trauma.

As the government shutdown approaches its eighth day, senators are weighing in on the White House's new threats to refuse to back pay furloughed federal workers, increasing the pressure on Democrats to find a way out of the shutdown.

On Oct. 7, The Epoch Times confirmed that the White House Office of Management and the Budget (OMB) has drafted a legal memorandum which calls into question whether “non-essential” federal employees who are furloughed and do not work during the shutdown are entitled to back pay.</p>
