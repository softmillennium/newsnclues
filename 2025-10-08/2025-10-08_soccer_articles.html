Egypt Return to the World Cup



The Egyptian national team will play in a World Cup once again, eight years after their last appearance, after sealing their qualification for the 2026 World Cup, which will be held in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, with a dominant 3-0 victory over Djibouti on Wednesday.





It was a commanding win led by Mohamed Salah, the Liverpool superstar and the symbol of the Pharaohs, who was determined not to miss another global tournament after being left out of the Qatar 2022 World Cup.

The Egyptian forward opened the scoring in the 14th minute, finishing with his trademark precision after a through ball from Trezeguet to make it 2-0, effectively sealing the match early on. Salah completed his stellar performance with a second goal in the 84th minute, striking first-time from a long pass by Marwen Ateya to seal the final 3-0 scoreline.

With this victory, Egypt confirms its return to the elite of world football and will take part in the World Cup finals for the fourth time, after previous appearances in Italy 1934, Italy 1990, and Russia 2018, where they failed to advance past the group stage.

Meanwhile, Ghana has yet to secure its spot in the 2026 World Cup, despite strengthening its hold on first place in Group I with a convincing 5-0 win over the Central African Republic. The Ghanaian team, featuring Villarreal midfielder Thomas Partey, who scored one of the goals, also needed a stumble from Madagascar, which ultimately defeated Comoros 2-1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Xabi Alonso has taken a different approach to his predecessor Carlo Ancelotti in press conferences NurPhoto There are plenty of positives for Real Madrid under Xabi Alonso going into this international break. And they have some big injury concerns before the first Clasico of the season on October 26, with both of their senior right-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dani Carvajal in a race against time to be fit for the game against Barca at the Bernabeu. We asked you to pose your questions to our Real Madrid correspondents, Mario Cortegana and Guillermo Rai, about the campaign so far and much more besides — including Alonso and Carlo Ancelotti's contrasting communication styles, Antonio Rudiger's future and where the club stand on playing games abroad. By contrast, my feeling with his predecessor Carlo Ancelotti was that he listened more actively only at the start, then started to think quickly about his answer and even cut you off if it was a topic he was not comfortable with — for example on issues related to the lack of opportunities he gave to young players. But Ancelotti was a master at handling tense or uncomfortable situations. Alonso is comfortable communicating and has an intellectual background, with lots of cultural interests. Another point is that Alonso likes to talk in depth about football. That said, my feeling is we have yet to see the real Alonso. We are now, as Ancelotti would say, in a honeymoon phase. But there will be criticism, some bad results and potentially more player drama to come… A few months ago, reports elsewhere suggested Madrid were going to bypass their unwritten rule with players more than 30 years old by offering the German an extension longer than a year — but, to the best of my knowledge, this is not accurate. I also do not think it is accurate that he will leave as a free agent next summer, as has been reported recently. He has also not been helped by the club failing to sign a centre-back in the summer of 2024, and how much Ancelotti had to play him given the dearth of other options. Rudiger made a huge effort to help the team in a difficult campaign last term, even delaying necessary knee surgery and playing through the pain. I do not think we have seen the last of Rudiger at a high level in this team. Twenty-year-old Guler has shone this season, with three goals and four assists in 10 appearances, while Bellingham has just returned from shoulder surgery, featuring five times. In principle, following the international break, the Englishman will have a more prominent role and take up attacking positions, just as Guler has been doing from the start of this season. But Alonso regularly uses a 4-4-2 system, which makes it possible for both of them to play together. It is worth remembering they also have to contend with another attacking midfielder in Franco Mastantuono, who has played 538 minutes so far and is seen as another hugely promising young player. Alonso himself has said in several press conferences that there is a lot of competition for attacking positions. But, if Madrid face a weaker opponent and Alonso's team suffer injuries, we may see the three attacking midfielders playing together. Thanks for your question — we will be publishing an article on Endrick's situation later this week to explain in depth what has been going on with the Brazilian this year. Endrick was only available against Getafe after returning from a relapse of the hamstring tendon injury in his right leg that he suffered in May, so in reality it would be five games — although that is still significant. Sorry that we cannot provide more details at this point, but stay tuned! Sources involved in the proposed European Super League project — who, like all those cited in this article, asked to remain anonymous to protect relationships — say Perez continues to support it. At these meetings, A22 proposed a new format for the Champions League in which the top 18 teams (according to UEFA rankings) face each other in the first eight matchdays, to come into effect in 2027. UEFA's response so far has been that they do not plan to change their premier competition. This week, UEFA reluctantly approved European matches being staged abroad — meaning Villarreal's ‘home' game against Barcelona in December is close to going ahead in Miami. Madrid have strongly opposed that idea publicly and privately, even publishing a statement against it in August. Madrid also have the support of Spain's High Sports Council (CSD, which forms part of the Spanish government). That body wants all domestic sports competitions to be held in Spain, along with as many international tournaments as possible (the country will co-host the 2030 World Cup with Portugal and Morocco, while the 2031 Ryder Cup will take place on the Costa Brava, near Barcelona.</p>

Ferguson was a doubt heading into camp with an ankle injury that meant he was an unused substitute in Roma's Serie A win over Fiorentina last weekend. Parrott returned to action for the first time since August after recovering from a knee injury when he came off the bench in AZ Alkmaar's Eredivisie win over Telstar. "Evan took part in pretty much all the training today, so really good," O'Shea said. On Parrott, O'Shea added: "There's every chance, but you also have to respect the kind of injuries he's had.

Barcelona chief Deco has had scouts posted to the U20 World Cup over the past fortnight.

Deco is eager to uncover one or two young gems to bring to La Masia next year.

Mundo Deportivo says there's several surprising names on the shortlist that Deco has requested his scouts following over the month-long tournament.

Internacional whizkid Pedrinho tops Barca's shopping list, along with Brazil teammate and Chelsea striker Deivid Washington.

Benfica winger Gianluca Prestianni, of Argentina, and Kawasaki Frontale's whizkid Yuto Ozeki are  being watched.

Meanwhile, also on Deco's radar of Real Betis defender Elyaz Zidane, the son of Real Madrid legend Zinedine Zidane. Elyaz is part of France's squad.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pochettino greets Pulisic during a game against Panama in Austin, Texas, last year Logan Riely/USSF Mauricio Pochettino keeps it to a minimum. I reached the conclusion a while back that Mauricio Pochettino's modus operandi — an intended consequence of what he says and what he does — is to have the USMNT treading on eggshells. Nobody knows where they stand, which, in a roundabout way, means everybody knows where they stand; no concessions, and no sacred cows. History will judge the extent to which Pochettino's manner is shrewd, but as one of football's warmer characters historically, it cannot be by accident that he's transitioned into bad cop in the United States. Valid questions about the absence of Yunus Musah and Joe Scally from his latest roster were met with typically enigmatic quotes, summed up in plain English as: I pick the squad, and that's that. When Christian Pulisic was on the receiving end of similar comments before and after this year's Concacaf Gold Cup, it caused a stir for the glaring reason that Pulisic was a player who might have been afforded special treatment by Poch. But we shouldn't have been shocked because, as I learned from reading this piece by Paul Tenorio and Henry Bushnell, Pochettino doesn't really speak to anybody outside of USMNT camps. For weeks and months, he exists at arm's length. Paul's insight got me thinking about whether that's a good or bad thing. And it's easily forgotten that when the sacking of Gregg Berhalter provoked the deepest introspection on the part of U.S. Soccer, a perceived flaw in the old regime was that life was too cuddly and cosy; all carrot, no stick. Is Poch's communication strategy a savvy switch of tone, then? Because far from softening it, he's doubling down. When Pochettino spoke last week, he made a point that probably isn't stressed enough in international football: that players should intrinsically know if they've earned a call-up. You get tricky, borderline decisions, sure, but most omissions speak for themselves. Musah, for instance, has clocked up less than an hour in Serie A with Atalanta this season. Pochettino's assistant, Jesus Perez, told us there's a reluctance on Poch's part to interfere with players while they're in the thick of club duty, but you wonder if this is more about a total reset of attitude within the USMNT: as if the entire dressing room is starting again. It's Ecuador and Australia in the days ahead — two meaningful friendlies against confirmed World Cup qualifiers — and Poch would love this to be year zero because his experience as head coach until now has been punishing and inept. It just can't keep yielding occasional results. Professional athletes will often hear it said that they're a long time retired; that once their career is gone, it's gone. Better to outstay your welcome than give it all up too soon. Except life in pro sport demands sacrifices, as Darlington Nagbe found out. The Columbus Crew midfielder is about to call it a day, aged 35, and having read this top Felipe Cardenas interview with him, he's a player I wish I'd followed more closely, and someone I was pleased to learn more about (albeit arriving very late to the party). All the same, I like where his head's at. One of the most popular stories in TAFC last year concerned Mikel Arteta hiring a bunch of pickpockets to teach Arsenal's players to be alert at all times. Never one to sit still, he's gone a step further in his search for psychological balance by enlisting help from the Royal Air Force (RAF). I get that some of his patter might induce an eye-roll, but Dan Sheldon spoke to a couple of RAF employees (including Justin Hughes, above) and in truth, what they said made sense: that in a high-pressure environment, keywords and signals can improve performance. Pickpockets and pilots haven't quite paid off for Arteta insofar as the Premier League title keeps eluding him, but he's plainly convinced by the quality of mindfulness, and Arsenal are back in the hunt again, top of the table after seven games. Their manager just needs his Top Gun ending. Proof that players know the value of their own profiles comes from Cole Palmer. The Chelsea midfielder (not exactly scraping by on minimum wage) has enhanced his earning potential by trademarking the term ‘Cold Palmer'. What this means is that Palmer-themed mobile phone covers, Christmas crackers, bath salts and underwater vehicles — huh? — could be coming our way before long; all the things you've been missing from your lives. He is now lead writer of The Athletic FC newsletter. He previously worked for the Yorkshire Evening Post as its chief football writer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rebranded European Football Clubs meets in Rome this week at an annual assembly of officials whose collective power negotiating with FIFA and UEFA over elite competitions was never greater. The ECA was created in 2008 to bring more cooperation, democracy and money to storied teams after their decade of confrontation with international soccer bodies. There is peace today — restored after the deep rift with UEFA four years ago when an ECA-led group of rebel clubs driven by Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus tried, and failed, to launch the breakaway European Super League. Good relations with European clubs and their chairman, now Nasser al-Khelaifi from Paris Saint-Germain, can seem more important to UEFA and its president, Aleksander Ceferin, than dealing with FIFA. UEFA, and Ceferin personally, were burned by then-ECA leader Andrea Agnelli plotting the breakaway Super League that was intended for just 20 teams. “Together with EFC,” Ceferin said Wednesday, “We will make sure that our club football is inclusive and that everybody has a chance to win their best competitions.” “I admire the UEFA president because he has got values and courage,” said the clubs' leader, who also heads Champions League rights holder BeIN Media Group and is a member of Qatar's government. They were frustrated at being frozen out of decision-making by FIFA and UEFA who earned billions from the World Cup and European Championship where national teams got free use of club-employed players. In 2005, G-14 helped directly challenge FIFA in legal action by Belgian club Charleroi, which lost Abdelmajid Oulmers to long-term injury playing with Morocco. When Michel Platini became UEFA president in 2007 talks accelerated to replace G-14 with a broader-based group of clubs. UEFA and ECA leaderships paired Ballon d'Or winners with a shared World Cup history: Platini and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, then the Bayern Munich CEO. They steered through the Financial Fair Play monitoring of spiraling spending by clubs who played in UEFA competitions. “We will cooperate in the future with UEFA, there is no doubt about that,” Rummenigge said in 2016, one year before handing over to Agnelli. UEFA's next president was Slovenian lawyer Ceferin who aligned with Agnelli and became godfather to one of his children. Persistent rumors fueled leverage over UEFA in regularly scheduled talks to amend Champions League entry rules and prize money formulas — usually favoring wealthy clubs and leagues. The ECA in March 2009 dismissed Super League rumors “spread by three major European newspapers.” Years later, fresh speculation was dismissed as “a fever dream” by one Italian official. The project failed within 48 hours amid a backlash from fans and governments. PSG had not joined the rebels and Al-Khelaifi, already seated on UEFA's executive committee, took over ECA to rebuild its credibility. The ECA origin story is getting money from FIFA. FIFA will give $355 million from 2026 World Cup income and now will reward hundreds more clubs whose players were selected for all qualifying games. ECA pushed FIFA to create an insurance fund paying some salary of players injured with national teams. National teams no longer have one-game breaks in February and August. FIFA's match calendar has less long-haul travel for players with fewer international breaks. Al-Khelaifi also played hardball with FIFA to drive up prize money guarantees for playing in the revamped, $2 billion Club World Cup this year. This season's Champions League prize money fund is nearly 2.5 billion euros ($2.92 billion) compared to 583 million euros ($681 million) in ECA's debut season. Clubs have since 2017 had two seats on UEFA's executive committee. A 2012 renewal of the ECA-UEFA working accord guaranteed “Referral Right” on all club football decisions. That sweetheart deal for England, Spain, Germany and Italy led to lower-ranked nations getting the third-tier Conference League. UEFA also gave ECA more influence in managing competitions which became a formal commercial joint venture, called UC3. That gave clubs even more say on decisions, including picking United States-based agency Relevent to sell future Champions League broadcast and sponsor deals through 2033. ECA took no public position on multi-club ownership — investors having stakes in multiple teams — that is widely unpopular with fans and UEFA itself said poses threats to integrity in its competitions and the transfer market. How will the Champions League evolve or be replaced?</p>
