                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The IRS on Wednesday said that it was furloughing nearly half of its workforce due to the ongoing government shutdown. About 34,000 IRS workers are being furloughed, according to the tax agency. "Due to the lapse in appropriations, most IRS operations are closed," the agency said in a message to employees on Wednesday. "An IRS-wide furlough began on October 8, 2025, for everyone except already-identified excepted and exempt employees," the message said. "Employees who are not exempt or excepted are furloughed and placed in a non-pay and non-duty status until further notice; however, all employees should plan to report to work for their next tour of duty." Furloughed IRS workers were told in a letter that they will receive back pay when the shutdown ends. That letter came a day after an internal draft memo suggested that the Trump administration might question its obligation to give back pay to some furloughed employees. The furloughs come as the tax agency was already dealing with the effects of mass layoffs that reduced its workforce by about 25%, from around 100,000 workers to about 75,000 now. The layoffs were implemented after President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January. We want to hear from you. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With the new serverless reinforcement learning service, there's no need to worry about adding or removing computing power, because it happens automatically. Tests indicated that when developers use CoreWeave's new service, they can train models faster with 40% lower costs in comparison with running Nvidia H100 graphics processing units locally, "with no impact on model quality," according to a statement. Reinforcement learning is a decades-old approach that involves evolving systems through trial and error to improve outcomes over time. The launch comes five months after CoreWeave paid $1 billion to acquire Weights and Biases, a startup targeting developers with software for training and evaluating AI models. The deal is an effort to complement CoreWeave's existing business of renting out Nvidia graphics processing units to companies that need infrastructure to operate models. In the cloud, CoreWeave competes with leading providers such as Amazon Web Services, although some companies will want to keep GPUs in their own data centers. Two weeks ago, CoreWeave said OpenAI agreed to expand a multi-year deal by up to $6.5 billion, and last week, the cloud company said Meta committed to spending $14.2 billion. In July, it announced plans to buy data center infrastructure provider Core Scientific, a longtime partner, for $9 billion. Some Core Scientific shareholders are seeking a more favorable deal and are recommending that it be voted down in its current state. A revision to the acquisition offer does not appear likely. "Really, under no circumstances will we readdress the bid that we put out," Mike Intrator, CoreWeave's co-founder and CEO, told Bloomberg on Tuesday. New Jersey-based CoreWeave went public on Nasdaq in March.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal authorities announced Wednesday that they have arrested and charged a Florida man with maliciously starting the deadly Palisades Fire, one of the most destructive blazes in Los Angeles history. Jonathan Rinderknecht, 29, is charged with destruction of property by means of fire, according to a release from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, which is prosecuting him. Right after allegedly igniting the inferno early New Year's Day, Rinderknecht "listened to a rap song, which has a music video that includes things being lit on fire," the U.S. Attorney's Office said. The Palisades Fire in early January burned thousands of homes and killed 12 people as flames spread rapidly in heavy winds up to 100 miles per hour. If Rinderknecht is convicted, he could face a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison and a statutory maximum sentence of 20 years. Authorities said that witness statements, video surveillance, cellphone data, and analysis of fire dynamics and patterns at the scene showed that Rinderknecht maliciously set the Lachman Fire just after midnight on January 1 on land owned by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority, an organization that received federal funding. A week later, the same fire – which by then had become known as the Palisades Fire – burned federal property. "The complaint alleges that a single person's recklessness caused one of the worst fires Los Angeles has ever seen, resulting in death and widespread destruction in Pacific Palisades," Acting L.A. U.S Attorney Bill Essayli said in a statement. "While we cannot bring back what victims lost, we hope this criminal case brings some measure of justice to those affected by this horrific tragedy," Essayli said. In a post on X, Essayli said evidence was found from Rinderknecht's digital devices that showed "an image he generated on ChatGPT depicting a burning city." The destructive fire started on the evening of Dec. 31, when Rinderknecht had been working a shift as an Uber driver. According to the release, two passengers he drove in separate rides later told law enforcement that they recalled Rinderknecht as "agitated and angry." After Rinderknecht dropped off a passenger in the area, he drove to Skulls Rock trailhead, where he parked his car and tried to get in touch with a former friend, authorities said. He then walked up the trail and used his iPhone to take videos. Shortly after midnight on Jan. 1, environmental sensing platforms indicated the Lachman Fire had started. In the following minutes, Rinderknecht called 911 several times, but since he was out of cellphone range was unable to get through, according to the release. A resident had already reported the fire at that point. Authorities said he then turned around and sped up to follow the fire engines to the scene, where he recorded more videos of the scene from his phone. "But geolocation data from his iPhone carrier showed that he was standing in a clearing 30 feet from the fire as it rapidly grew," according to the news release.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk and X Corp have reached a settlement in a lawsuit by four former top executives at Twitter, including former CEO Parag Agrawal, who claim they were not paid $128 million in promised severance pay after Musk acquired the social media company and fired them. The terms of the settlement, which was first announced in a filing in San Francisco federal court last week, were not disclosed. A federal judge on October 1 pushed back filing deadlines and a hearing in the case so the settlement can be finalized. X in August agreed to settle a separate lawsuit by rank-and-file Twitter employees who lost their jobs during mass layoffs and claimed they were owed $500 million in unpaid severance. The cases are among a series of legal challenges that Musk, the world's richest person, has faced after he acquired Twitter for $44 billion in 2022, cut more than half of its workforce and renamed it X. X and lawyers for the former Twitter executives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The plaintiffs are Agrawal; Ned Segal, Twitter's former chief financial officer; Vijaya Gadde, its former chief legal officer; and Sean Edgett, its former general counsel. The former executives say that Musk falsely accused them of misconduct and forced them out of Twitter after they sued him for attempting to renege on his offer to purchase the company. Musk then denied the executives severance pay they had been promised for years before he acquired Twitter, according to the lawsuit. Musk and X have denied wrongdoing and said the executives were fired over their performance. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesday that the U.S. is "not far ahead" of China in the artificial intelligence race, and that the country needs a "nuanced strategy" to stay on higher ground. Huang has been walking a tense line between the two countries and has praised China's AI models, including DeepSeek, Alibaba, and Baidu. The CEO courted China in July with several trips following U.S. chip restrictions and warned that Chinese chip systems from companies like Huawei should not be discounted. President Donald Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping on a call in September and announced plans for the pair to meet at the APEC South Korea summit at the end of October. Here are five key things Huang said about the AI race on CNBC's "Squawk Box." However, these large investments in computing power require a massive amount of energy, which China far outpaces the U.S. in production. China generated a total of 10,000 terawatt hours, or one trillion watt hours, of electricity in 2024, over double the U.S.'s output, according to the Energy Institute. While the U.S. may be leading in advanced chip designs, including Nvidia's Blackwell processor, China's tech giant Huawei has been adding pressure with its plans to launch its new computing systems to power its in-house Ascend chips as soon as next year. China reportedly prohibited tech companies from using Nvidia chips, instead focusing on advancing domestic chips to challenge Nvidia processors. Alibaba and Baidu reportedly began using internally designed chips to train AI models. Huang said that China's under-regulation at the industrial level makes the country "quick in adopting new technology." According to a China State Council directive, the country is aiming for AI adoption to reach 70% of the population by 2027 by imbuing various agents and other applications across core industries. "I hope that American companies in American society are going to be fast in adopting AI applications, because ultimately this industrial revolution wins at the AI application layer, at the diffusion layer," Huang said. The country's stocks have seen a strong rally as confidence climbs in its chip progression and AI development. China's market has seen a huge boom as tech companies see share prices grow over triple digits in the past year. Huang pointed to developing the American tech stack to win AI developers and markets globally and warned the U.S. would fall behind if American technologies are not allowed to "diffuse and be proliferated around the world." The CEO referenced comments from White House AI advisor David Sacks about the tech landscape in five years. Huang also referred to companies like Azure, CoreWeave, and Anthropic AI as playing a key part in revolutionizing the entire tech stack.

Residents in at least 41 states and Washington, D.C., are experiencing increased electric and natural gas bills now or will see increases in 2026, according to a new report from the Center for American Progress. The good news is that, depending on which state you live in and your electricity provider, you might be able to lower your bill through energy conservation. Data centers accounted for 4.4% of electricity consumption in the US in 2023, according to a report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Existing regulations will allow much of those costs to be recovered from a utility's entire customer base. Similar battles are unfolding before utility regulators in states across the country. "It's really creating tremendous stress for a huge segment of the population that struggles to pay those bills," said David Conn, head of business development and policy at Exceleron, an energy management software company. While the amount of energy you use is supposed to be the largest part of the bill, utilities often tack on charges and service fees that don't have anything to do with individual consumption. The bottom line: If you're a customer of a utility that also serves data centers, your bill is probably going to rise no matter how much energy you use. "It's one of those things where consumers are fighting against an 800-pound gorilla, and that's a challenge," said Larry Paulhus, head of electric consulting at RINA North America. Experts say that despite rising costs, there are steps consumers can take to make energy bills more manageable. Utility customers who live in one of the 14 states with a deregulated energy market can use Arbor's free app to find a different energy provider. Switching providers could shave 10% to 20% off monthly utility bills, said Owen Quinlan, Arbor's head of data. The company offers prepay programs for 75 utilities, including major providers like Georgia Power and Salt River Project in Arizona. Prepay programs allow utility customers to pay their bills in advance, making them eligible for refunds later on if they consume less energy than they originally paid for. It is difficult to know exactly how much money programs like these can save customers. There are many line items on an electric bill — such as costs for new transmission lines — that are out of an individual customer's control. "It's probably going to be less than that, but every little bit helps," he said. Curbing reliance on gas fuel can help lower energy bills in the long term, said Cooper Marcus, founder of QuitCarbon, who advises homeowners on energy management. Replacing a gas boiler with an electric heat pump and installing solar panels on a home's roof can lead to significant long-term savings. For people struggling to manage higher rates now, long-term solutions don't offer much relief. "It's really understandable that people want some control over their expenses, and there are things that people can do to bring down those bills. It's just not realistic for so many people," said Sylvie Ashford, an analyst at The Utility Reform Network. Ashford noted that in California, where TURN is based, 40% of the population are renters who can't install solar panels to reduce costs. TURN is lobbying for utilities in the state to have spending caps tied to inflation, among other initiatives aimed at lowering consumer electricity bills. "Legislators are paying attention, and a lot of them are reporting that the number one issue their constituents call them about is their rising utility bills," she said.</p>

And while top commentators like Ken Griffin see the rally as a sign of a more concerning trend in markets, the positive momentum doesn't appear to be waning—for now. Bank of America recently examined gold's colossal rally, laying out the possible risks that a correction could be looming. BofA analyst Paul Ciana noted that gold prices have been rising steadily for seven consecutive weeks, a phenomenon that has occurred 18 times since 1970. However, they see this as a potential problem, as during past rallies that went on for that long faded in the weeks after, with gold eking out more gains in the following five weeks just 28% of the time. "Since the start of 2024, gold prices have approximately doubled from +/- $2,000 to +/- $4,000." During previous price rallies, gold typically reached its peak when it started trading 25% above the SMA. He added that while the bank sees two possible scenarios where gold prices keep rising, both suggest that a material correction is likely looming. Finally, the 14-month RSI (Relative Strength Index), which measures short-term momentum, implies that gold is highly overbought, a thesis that Adam Turnquist, Chief Technical Strategist for LPL Financial, echoed amid the latest jump to all-time highs. "We recommend adding exposure on weakness given the degree of overbought conditions. Silver could also be another option in the space as it continues to gain relative strength over gold," Turnquist said. When RSI passes 70, it typically means that an asset is overbought. This data implies that gold prices have been overbought for over the last month</p>

Since announcing the policy, Ford has sent some employees emails telling them that they are not badging in enough and warning that they could face termination if they do not improve their attendance, three current and former Ford employees told Business Insider. Two said they had received these emails despite complying with updated office attendance policies and having previous work-from-home arrangements signed off by their managers. While many of Ford's Michigan-based teams have been in the office three days a week since late 2024, other divisions maintained a more flexible approach to working from home, two current and former employees said. "We have done everything we can to make sure our employees understand the in-office policy, and we have given everyone time to adjust their schedules and work with their managers to make sure they are in compliance," a Ford spokesperson told Business Insider. In an all-hands for a team within Ford's Enterprise Technology division — which oversees Ford's IT services and internal digital tools — on September 9, human resources director Homer Isaac said the emails were designed to instigate a "change of behavior" around remote working. He added that workers who are complying with the new four-day-a-week rules should not be concerned about losing their jobs. "The letters up to this point, quite honestly, were based on a window where our standard wasn't the same as everybody else's standard. The communications are standard, and I will pledge to this team, we have asked for those to be changed or modified — we have failed in that," he said. In the days after Ford announced the return-to-office mandate on June 25, some employees received an email saying that their badge data indicated their "on-site presence since April 2025 has averaged less than one day a week," and was not in line with company expectations that hybrid workers come in three days a week. These initial automated emails warned that not meeting these new expectations would be considered a "policy violation," according to copies of the emails viewed by Business Insider. One former Ford employee told Business Insider that despite their pre-June remote working arrangements being approved by senior management and complying with the three-day-a-week requirement, they continued to receive automated emails saying their on-site presence had not improved. These subsequent emails warned that failure to comply with the new policy of four days a week on-site from September would result in "discipline up to and including termination." "We need to work across time zones, and the new policy makes that impossible. Another current Ford employee told Business Insider they had also received a similar email warning that failing to comply with the new remote working rules could result in termination, despite going into the office the required number of days. I just want to do my job and help the company, but upper management is constantly making that harder to do, and then telling me I'm the problem," they said. Like many companies, Ford's return to office hasn't been entirely smooth. Employees Business Insider spoke to mentioned teething problems and overcrowding, with one calling an RTO trial run in August "a little bit disastrous" due to a lack of desks and parking. Hybrid IT employees were told to start coming into Ford's Dearborn site three days a week on August 6, according to interviews with employees and an email viewed by Business Insider. In comments posted on an internal Ford forum on that day, employees said the site's Rotunda center had run out of parking and that police had shown up to ticket workers parked illegally. A Ford employee BI spoke to confirmed that police had attended. The company says it will have capacity for 4,000 employees. The Detroit Free Press reported that a number of meeting room displays at the company's Dearborn site began displaying a crossed-out image of CEO Jim Farley with an explicit anti-RTO message.</p>

Big Tech companies filed permits for 54 new data centers in the state in the first nine months of 2025, according to a Business Insider tally. The number represents the state's single largest spike in planned data centers in any one year, and a 16% increase from Virginia's 2024 total. The new planned data centers in Virginia would grow Amazon's fleet to 205, a 15% increase. The new Virginia permits also reveal how Big Tech companies are increasingly building larger, more power-intensive data centers. Business Insider previously identified 322 "hyperscale" facilities built or under construction nationwide at the end of 2024 that consume an estimated 40 megawatts of electricity or more each. All but one of Amazon's new planned data centers are among the largest in Business Insider's analysis. These giant data centers can consume as much power as a small city and up to several million gallons of water a day. An Amazon spokesperson said Business Insider's methodology for estimating electricity use is "flawed and can lead to inaccurate conclusions." (See more about Business Insider's methodology, and Amazon's response, here.) This recent explosion of Virginia data center construction comes amid unprecedented nationwide investment in AI infrastructure. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are pouring cash into the rush to build even more. The tech giants' combined capital expenditures could reach an estimated $320 billion this year, primarily for AI infrastructure, an analysis of financial statements by Business Insider found. Data centers in the state have emerged as one of the largest flashpoints in a national wave of grassroots resistance from residents worried about their impact on housing, the environment, and quality of life, even as they have promised to bring new tax revenue. Overall, the 54 new planned data centers drive Business Insider's electricity estimate another 26% higher. Collectively, Business Insider estimates that if Virginia's 383 data centers already built or in construction as of September 2025 all come online, they will use between 66.5 terawatt-hours and 106.4 terawatt-hours annually. To investigate data center expansion across the country, Business Insider filed requests with all 50 states and Washington, DC, for the air permits that regulate backup generators at every data center. As of 2010, there were 311 data centers nationwide, Business Insider previously found.</p>

The $9 billion cybersecurity company Tanium is cracking down on its return-to-office policy this year in an unconventional way: It is withholding a form of compensation from those who don't comply. As of this summer, Tanium employees who violate the RTO policy risk not getting an "equity refresh," according to three people familiar with the matter. Tanium employees typically receive shares as part of their compensation package when they first join the company, and they may be eligible for an "equity refresh" or additional equity after a specified period of time at the company. While Tanium CEO Dan Streetman has said at companywide meetings that going to the office was important, leadership hasn't verbally or in written communication announced to the company that RTO may be tied to equity grants, sources said. Not receiving additional equity grants can significantly reduce a startup employee's compensation package. Tanium did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. Many companies across the US, including AT&T, Microsoft, and Amazon, have been attempting to reduce remote work. Some companies have terminated employees who don't comply with their policies. Withholding a form of compensation for those who don't return to the office is relatively rare, experts say. "Most companies will say, 'Look, you need to come in,'" said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford economics professor who conducts research on remote work. Bloom said he had not heard of companies denying employees additional equity for balking at RTO mandates. He said that some law firms have cut pay for those who don't come into the office. It offers a range of cybersecurity products for securing and managing devices on an organization's network, serving customers from large businesses to government agencies. Tanium first announced its RTO policy in late 2023, stating that employees within a 50-mile radius of an office are required to work there on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with a third day to be determined by their team leaders. Initially, this policy was loosely enforced, said people familiar with the matter. In 2020, Business Insider reported that Tanium used a "clawback clause" to buy back employees' equity in the company, whether they wanted to sell or not. Bloomberg had also previously reported that Tanium fired employees right before their stock vested. In recent years, the culture has shifted to an in-office-first approach. New hires are expected to be within commuting distance of the office, three current and former employees said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gold prices smashed past $4,000 per ounce late Tuesday, hitting an all-time high that signals investors may be bracing for turbulence ahead. ET on Wednesday, extending a rally fueled by a potent mix of safe-haven flows, expectations of imminent Fed rate cuts, and rising geopolitical anxieties. "Despite their recent resilience to macro data surprises, we think investors may be positioning themselves for a pullback," the World Gold Council wrote in a Tuesday report. "This has likely helped support gold demand, as investors look to add safe-haven assets," the WGC added. Equities have been on a tear this year, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq notching record highs, powered in part by the AI boom and expectations of easier monetary policy. The rally has appeared unstoppable despite a wall of macroeconomic uncertainty, from President Donald Trump's new tariffs on trading partners to expectations of the Federal Reserve's rate cuts and the ongoing US government shutdown. The foundation for this week's milestone was laid in September, when global physically backed gold ETFs recorded their largest monthly inflow, resulting in the strongest quarterly inflow on record of $26 billion. Gold rallies were typically led by Eastern buyers in China and India who hoarded the yellow metal as a store of value and for cultural reasons. This time, the rally is driven overwhelmingly by Western investors. "Flows reflected both protection and momentum as investors sought a purchasing-power hedge and leaned into the breakout," wrote WGC. In September, global gold trading volumes jumped 34% from August, averaging $388 billion a day — the second-strongest month of the year. Gold's stunning 2025 rally has now sent spot prices up about 53% year-to-date, reigniting the "fear trade" that had cooled in previous years. On Monday, Goldman Sachs raised its December 2026 gold forecast to $4,900 per ounce from $4,300, citing strong inflows into Western gold ETFs and central bank demand. Some prominent investors have been sounding the same note. Wall Street gurus, including Ray Dalio and David Einhorn, have urged investors to hold gold as a hedge against both inflation and policy volatility. On Monday, Citadel CEO Ken Griffin told Bloomberg he was uneasy about the flight to gold as a safe-haven asset because it reflects a broader derisking from the dollar, a traditional haven currency. Meanwhile, Bank of America analysts cautioned that gold's parabolic rally could be nearing exhaustion.</p>
