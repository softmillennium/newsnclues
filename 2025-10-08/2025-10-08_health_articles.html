                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) copolymers (PLGAs) are biodegradable, biocompatible synthetic materials widely used across pharmaceutical applications. Derived from lactic and glycolic acids, these copolymers break down into non-toxic metabolites, making them particularly well-suited for drug delivery systems and resorbable implants. One of PLGA's key advantages lies in the precise control over composition and microstructure during manufacturing, allowing their properties to be finely tuned for specific therapeutic needs. However, the broad diversity of PLGA-based materials also presents challenges in ensuring consistent quality. Variability in polymer structure can directly impact performance and safety, making reliable characterization essential. Despite their established use in many approved drug products, PLGAs have only recently been included in major pharmacopeias, and even then, only a limited number of variants are covered.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD) principles call for a deeper, more systematic understanding of all factors that influence the performance of analytical procedures in quality control. By embedding science and risk management into the core of method development, AQbD promotes the creation of “living” procedures, where every variable is well-characterized, controlled, and continuously monitored. While the holistic approach introduced by AQbD can be complex, it offers clear benefits: improved method robustness, greater quality assurance, and increased flexibility. Notably, it also introduces the concept of platform procedures, which can be adapted across multiple applications with minimal revalidation. In this context, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) emerges as a powerful tool to support AQbD. Grounded in absolute physical principles, NMR simplifies the management of analytical procedures and fully leverages the platform concept. This whitepaper explores how to design and implement such a platform for quantitative applications using Bruker's compact, cryogen-free benchtop NMR spectrometer, the Fourier 80. It begins with key considerations for risk assessment in quantitative NMR (qNMR) procedures and then presents practical control and mitigation strategies. Real-world examples illustrate how to define a Method Operable Design Region (MODR) using the Fourier 80, offering a practical roadmap for labs seeking to adopt flexible, streamlined qNMR methods.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even in later life, eating well pays off; researchers reveal that healthier diets can dramatically extend the lifespan of frail adults and cut their risk of early death. Frailty is a known risk factor for premature death in the elderly, but its interrelationship with diet quality is poorly known. A recent paper in Nutrients examines the interaction of frailty and nutritional quality in lifespan and mortality after middle life. The world's population is growing older and living longer. This emphasizes the need to ensure healthy aging. Frailty is a significant risk factor for disability and death. Frail people are more likely to fall, be hospitalized, suffer bone breaks, become disabled, develop multiple acute or chronic illnesses, and die earlier than expected. Poor diet quality deprives the consumer of many nutrients at adequate levels and prevents the proper utilization of available resources. Many different dietary scores have been devised, but there are so many options with high variability that comparability is difficult. However, their combined use might yield the most useful results in framing dietary recommendations. The study used UK Biobank data from 151,628 participants, chosen because they had undergone one or more dietary evaluations. The FP used criteria like weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slow walking, and little physical activity. Those with three or more of these were frail, while the pre-frail had one or two criteria. Diet quality was assigned using a variety of eating scores: Diet quality scores were then classified into tertiles, from unhealthy to healthy. Frailty and diet quality were analyzed together after adjusting for deprivation, medical conditions, unhealthy habits, and a family history of cancer or cardiovascular disease. The study period lasted a median of 12.2 years. That is, frail individuals with a poor diet quality had about double the risk of death when assessed by the FI and nearly triple the risk when assessed by the FP, compared to non-frail individuals with a healthy diet. Conversely, at all frailty levels, better diet quality reduced the risk of death and increased expected lifespan in direct proportion to the health-promoting content of the diet. For females, the reduction ranged from six months to 2.4 years. When the FP was used, the reductions in life expectancy among frail men and women ranged between 2.1 and 4.5 years, vs 1.6 to 5.1 years, respectively. These findings are impressive as they embraced a spectrum of dietary assessments, which probably included various nutrients within multiple foods. Moreover, the effects held steady across both sexes and were independent of the effects of drinking, smoking, other medical conditions, medication use, and socioeconomic factors. In contrast, using multiple other conditions in the FI tends to partly obscure the effect of frailty and diet. Biologically, healthy diets are, at their core, the same. Frailty may increase individual vulnerability to poor diet quality in multiple ways. An unhealthy diet is pro-oxidant, worsening oxidative stress and frailty. Again, inadequate food intake by frail people leads to nutrient deficiency. The association of poor nutrition and frailty with weakened immunity and increased infection rate increases the risk of death. The findings emphasize the universal benefit of a healthy diet even as physical frailty increases and show that the negative effects of frailty can be mitigated, but not necessarily reversed, through healthier dietary habits. Importantly, the research underscores that it is never too late to adopt healthier dietary habits.” However, there could be a two-way relationship between diet and frailty, and frail people should be encouraged to switch to a healthy diet. To achieve this, they may require help to overcome functional, logistical, or medical restrictions, which indicates the need for integrated strategies to detect frailty and provide care, as well as nutritional programs. The authors also noted limitations of the research, including that dietary data came from self-reported 24-hour recalls, which may introduce reporting errors, and that the UK Biobank cohort is not fully representative of the general UK population, which could affect generalizability. A healthier diet appears to reduce, rather than fully compensate for, the presence of frailty. This highlights the importance of improving diet quality to ensure better quality of life while aging. “Evidence suggests that it is never too late to adopt healthier dietary habits for significant health benefits.” Dr. Liji Thomas is an OB-GYN, who graduated from the Government Medical College, University of Calicut, Kerala, in 2001. She has counseled hundreds of patients facing issues from pregnancy-related problems and infertility, and has been in charge of over 2,000 deliveries, striving always to achieve a normal delivery rather than operative.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Calorie labeling, which became law in April 2022 in England, is associated with only a small (2%) average reduction in the energy content of food that is available away from home, finds research published in the open access journal BMJ Public Health. And these changes are primarily due to swapping in slightly lower calorie items, rather than reformulating existing ones, with no changes observed in continuously available items. Eating at restaurants, fast food outlets, and ordering takeaways, collectively known as out-of-home food outlets, is common and associated with poorer dietary quality, weight gain, and obesity, explain the researchers. Calorie labeling aims to try and counter this and improve public health by providing consumers with calorie information at the point of sale, they add. In England calorie labeling regulations require large (at least 250 employees) food and non-alcoholic drink outlets to display kilocalories on their offerings. To strengthen the evidence base, they compared changes in the energy content of menu items before and after the introduction of calorie labeling, stratified by food group and food business (chain) type. They used the MenuTracker database to find out what changes had been made to the average energy content (Kcal values) of new, removed, and continuously available food items, and to assess the proportions of menu items exceeding recommended energy intake (above 600 kcal) per meal. MenuTracker collects the food item name and description, serving size, energy, macronutrients, fibre, salt, allergens, special dietary information and menu section (children's or sharing items, for example). The final analysis included 31,045 menu items from 78 chains in both time periods. A significant average reduction per item was observed for non-alcoholic and soft drinks of 36 kcal, equivalent to a drop of nearly 16.5% in energy content. And the average energy content of burgers fell by 103 kcal (11% reduction), and by 30 kcal for mains (4% reduction). But, overall, only a small reduction of 9 kcal (2% reduction) in average energy content per item was observed after the regulations had come on stream. But changes were driven primarily by the removal of higher (average 458) kcal items and the addition of lower (average 434) kcal new items. And there was no significant change in energy content for continuously available items, indicating limited evidence of reformulation, say the researchers. The researchers acknowledge various limitations to their findings, including that MenuTracker only includes menu information from chains that posted kcal information online before and after the policy. The calorie labeling regulations also allow kcal information to be within plus or minus 20% and permit several different methods for estimating energy content, they add. "We found more evidence of menu change rather than reformulation, with items removed from menus being higher energy than continuous items. Thus, the impact of a calorie labeling policy on food may differ from other policies like the Soft Drinks Industry Levy, which created an economic incentive for, and was associated with, substantial reformulation," point out the researchers. Reformulating drinks may be easier for manufacturers to do than reformulating foods, and previous research indicates that large outlets are reluctant to reduce portion sizes because of how customers might perceive this, they acknowledge. But they suggest: "The small reduction in average kcal of items available on menus we found is likely to have modest to limited impact on population health."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The findings were published today in Nature Communications. They offer an unprecedented level of detail and advance our understanding of the brain by allowing researchers to link specific functions, behaviors, and disease states to smaller, more precise cellular regions-providing a roadmap for new hypotheses and experiments about the roles these areas play. This new, detailed brain parcellation solely based on data, and not human expert annotation, reveals previously uncharted subregions of the mouse brain. At the heart of this breakthrough is CellTransformer, a powerful AI model that can automatically identify important subregions of the brain from massive spatial transcriptomics datasets. Now, CellTransformer allows scientists to define brain regions and subdivisions based on calculations of shared cellular neighborhoods, much like sketching a city's borders based on the types of buildings within it. "Our model is built on the same powerful technology as AI tools like ChatGPT. Both are built on a 'transformer' framework which excels at understanding context," said Reza Abbasi-Asl, Ph.D., associate professor of neurology and bioengineering at UCSF and senior author of the study. "While transformers are often applied to analyze the relationship between words in a sentence, we use CellTransformer to analyze the relationship between cells that are nearby in space. It learns to predict a cell's molecular features based on its local neighborhood, allowing it to build up a detailed map of the overall tissue organization." This model successfully replicates known regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus; but more importantly, it can also discover previously uncatalogued, finer-grained subregions in poorly understood brain regions, such as the midbrain reticular nucleus, which plays a complex role in movement initiation and release. This new brain map depicts brain regions, versus cell types; and unlike previous brain maps, CellTransformer's is entirely data-driven, meaning its boundaries are defined by cellular and molecular data rather than human interpretation. With 1,300 regions and subregions, it also represents one of the most granular and complex data-driven brain maps of any animal to date. "By comparing the brain regions automatically identified by CellTransformer to the CCF, we were able to show that our data-driven method was identifying areas aligned with known expert-defined anatomical structures," said Alex Lee, a PhD candidate at UCSF and first author of the study. "Seeing that our model produces results so similar to CCF, which is such a well-characterized and high-quality resource for the field, was reassuring. The potential of this research to unlock critical insights reaches beyond neuroscience. CellTransformer's powerful AI capabilities are tissue agnostic: They can be used on other organ systems and tissues, including cancerous tissue, where large-scale spatial transcriptomics data is available to better understand the biology of health and disease and fuel the discovery of new treatments and therapies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GLP-1 receptor agonists are now widely prescribed for individuals with type 2 diabetes and weight loss, with a 700% increase in usage reported in the United States between 2019 and 2023. These medications alter glucose metabolism, gastric motility and sympathetic tone, which may lead to unique uptake patterns on PET-CT. Previous case reports have shown increased FDG uptake in skeletal muscle, myocardium and brown adipose tissue, findings that may be mistaken for malignancy or inflammatory disease. Researchers from Alliance Medical Ltd. performed a retrospective case series review of oncologic FDG PET-CT scans in patients taking GLP-1 agonists. They observed several atypical patterns of tracer uptake that could be misinterpreted as pathology if a patient's medication history is not considered. We found that these altered patterns are increasingly common, yet there is currently no national or international guidance in the UK addressing this emerging issue." Misinterpreting these uptake patterns can lead to unnecessary investigations, inappropriate cancer staging and delays in treatment, which may cause stress and uncertainty for patients. At present, the researchers do not recommend altering patient preparation or stopping GLP-1 agonists prior to FDG PET-CT scans. Instead, they advise that imaging teams carefully document patients' medication histories to inform interpretation while formal guidance is developed. Current UK guidelines do not address this issue, although Australian guidance suggests continuing treatment, fasting from midnight, scheduling morning scans and ensuring good glucose control. The research group intends to extend their data collection across additional imaging centers to provide a stronger evidence base for future national guidance. They also aim to establish international collaborations so that patients everywhere benefit from consistent and reliable PET-CT interpretation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adherence to exercise snacking throughout the day was high, the findings indicate, and this approach could counter perceived lack of time and low motivation-frequently cited barriers to fulfilling the recommended weekly quota of physical activity for health-say the researchers. A growing body of evidence indicates that exercise snacks, such as stair climbing or weights, have the potential to improve health and counter the deleterious effects of prolonged sitting. But most of these studies have relied on quasi-experimental designs or qualitative analyses, they add. To fill this gap, the researchers set out to evaluate the effects of exercise snacks on cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular endurance, and cardiometabolic factors, such as blood fats and body fat distribution, to see if this might be a practical and scalable approach to curbing physical inactivity and its associated effects on health. They scoured research databases for relevant clinical trials published up to April 2025, and found 11 from Australia, Canada, China and the UK that were suitable for pooled data analysis. Exercise snacks were defined as bursts of moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity lasting 5 minutes or less, excluding warm-up, cool-down, and intermediate recovery periods, and done at least twice a day for between 3 and 7 days a week for 4 to 12 weeks. They mainly consisted of stair climbing, either as continuous bouts or at repeated intervals, for young and middle aged adults. Leg focused strength exercises and tai chi were the dominant forms among older adults. Synthesis of the data showed that exercise snacking significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness in adults (moderate certainty of evidence), although the evidence in support of its impact on muscular endurance in older adults (69-74 year olds) was limited. Nor was exercise snacking associated with any significant effects on leg strength or cardiometabolic factors, including body composition, blood pressure, and blood fat profiles. They acknowledge various limitations to their findings, chief among which was the limited number of studies with limited sample sizes included in their data synthesis. Nevertheless, they conclude: "The time efficient nature of exercise snacks may help overcome common barriers to physical activity, such as perceived lack of time and low motivation. "Exercise snacks may enhance adherence to regular physical activity by providing short, flexible exercise bouts that are easier to integrate into daily routines."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Women who have Cesarean births at an advanced stage of labor are about eight times more likely to develop scars in the womb which are known to increase the likelihood of premature births in future pregnancies, UCL researchers have found. More than 40 per cent of all births in high-income countries including England are now by Cesarean. In some cases, doctors may need to intervene and perform a Cesarean procedure for safety reasons. An earlier study by the same team of UCL researchers found that when this internal scar was close to the cervix, the risk of the woman having a preterm birth (before 37 weeks) in future pregnancies was significantly increased. In their new study, they wanted to better understand the factors that influence where in the womb these scars are located by scanning women after a Cesarean birth. They found that women who had a Cesarean at an advanced stage of labor (when the cervix was almost fully (around 8cm) or completely open) were about eight times more likely to have scars that formed within or near the cervix. They say their findings will help better plan follow-up care for women in future and ways for them to avoid preterm births with future pregnancies. They are calling for more research into the impact of Cesarean scars on gynaecologic symptoms and future pregnancies and to help develop techniques to improve Cesarean-scar healing. We knew that having a Cesarean birth can damage the cervix. These fresh insights can help shape the future care for women having advanced labor Cesarean births, helping doctors better prepare women for giving birth and hopefully also leading to improved surgical techniques which reduce the risk of future complications that Cesarean delivery scars can cause." Dr. Maria Ivan, Lead Author, UCL EGA Institute for Women's Health Ninety-three women who had a Cesarean delivery during active labor (defined as the cervix being at least four centimetres dilated) took part in the study. The researchers examined them using transvaginal ultrasound between four and 12 months after birth to see if the Cesarean operation had left a scar and if so, where it was in the womb. Almost all of the 93 women – 90 – were found to have a visible internal scar. From this, the researchers worked out that having an advanced labor Cesarean birth was associated with an eightfold higher risk of the scar being located near or within the cervix compared to Cesarean births at an earlier stage of labor. Indicators of impaired scar healing included the presence of a scar "niche" – a gap or defect in the wall of the womb at least two millimeters deep. These niches form a pouch where blood can accumulate and may be associated with infertility, irregular menstrual bleeding or complications in future pregnancies. Based on these indicators, they found that scars which formed close to or within the cervix did not heal as well as scars higher up the womb, posing a greater risk of complications in future pregnancies. Co-author Professor Anna David, EGA Institute for Women's Health,National Institute for Health Research University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre and Deputy Director of charity Tommy's National Centre for Preterm Birth Research, said: "Cesarean birth in advanced labor is known to be linked with preterm birth. Dr Jyotsna Vohra, Director of Research, Programmes and Impact at Tommy's, the pregnancy and baby charity, said: "Unplanned Cesarean births can be very stressful, especially when carried out in an emergency to make sure baby arrives safely. Women who have experienced this may already be feeling anxious going into their next pregnancy, and to be then told they're at increased risk of giving birth early will only add to the anxiety. "This new research paves the way for better prediction and prevention of preterm birth following a previous Cesarean birth. We're working closely with healthcare professionals to make sure this research breakthrough translates to improvements in care for women and birthing people whose babies are most at risk of being born too soon."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whole genome sequencing offered to breast cancer patients is likely to identify unique genetic features that could either guide immediate treatment or help match patients to clinical trials for over 15,000 women a year, say scientists at the University of Cambridge. Despite significant progress in recent years, it remains challenging to accurately identify the best treatments for individual patients and to predict cases with poorer prognosis. Whole genome sequencing is a powerful technique that involves analysing the DNA of both the patient and their tumour to look for genetic changes, or mutations. It can also provide valuable information to guide treatment, for example by identifying vulnerabilities in the tumour's makeup or spotting signs that a patient might be resistant to a particular treatment. Although the technology is rapidly becoming cheaper – Ultima Genomics has recently announced that it can sequence a human genome for US$100 – it is not widely used across the NHS. It is becoming increasingly possible to use whole genome sequencing to inform cancer management, but it's arguably not being used to its full potential, and certainly not for some of the more common types of cancer. To help address these challenges, Professor Nik-Zainal and colleagues used data from almost 2,500 women from across England housed within the National Genomic Research Library – one of the world's largest and most valuable data assets of its kind and run by Genomics England. The researchers found that 27% of breast cancer cases had genetic features that could help guide personalised treatment immediately, either with existing drugs or recruitment to prospective or current clinical trials. This equates to more than 15,000 women a year in the UK. Among those features identified were: HRD (homology-directed repair deficiency), a DNA repair issue found in 12% of all breast cancers; unique mutations that could be targeted with specific drugs; signs of resistance to hormone therapy; and mutational patterns that suggest weaknesses in the cancer that treatments could exploit. The team identified an additional 15% of cases that had features that could be useful for future research, such as problems with other DNA repair pathways. This would equate to more than 8,300 women a year. For example, in the most common subtype of breast cancer, known as ER+HER2- breast cancers, which account for approximately 70% of diagnoses, there were strong genetic indicators of how aggressive the cancer might be. For example, major structural DNA changes were linked to a much higher risk of death, as were APOBEC mutational signatures (a type of DNA damage pattern) and mutations in the cancer gene TP53. These genetic markers were more predictive than traditional measures like age of the patient, stage of their cancer, or tumour grade. Using the results, the researchers created a framework to help doctors identify which patients need more aggressive treatment and which might safely have less treatment. It also suggested that around 7,500 women a year with low-grade tumours may benefit from more aggressive treatment. Now that we have population-level evidence of how impactful whole-genome sequencing could be, we have the potential to make a difference to thousands of patients' lives every year, helping tailor their care more precisely, giving more treatment to those who need it and less to those who don't." As well as being used to tailor treatments to individual patients, whole genome sequencing data could help transform how we recruit for and run clinical trials, speeding up the development of much needed new treatments.Professor Nik-Zainal added: "At the moment, we test patients for just a small number of genetic mutations and may invite them to join a clinical trial if the patient has a mutation that matches the trial's target. But if we have their entire genetic readout instead, we will no longer be restricted to single trials with a specific target. We could massively open up the potential for recruitment, to multiple clinical trials in parallel, making recruitment to clinical trials more efficient, ultimately getting the right therapies to the right patients much faster." Professor Nik-Zainal is an Honorary Fellow at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge, and an Honorary Consultant in Clinical Genetics at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (CUH). The University of Cambridge and Addenbrooke's Charitable Trust (ACT) are fundraising for a new hospital that will transform how we diagnose and treat cancer. Cambridge Cancer Research Hospital, set to be built on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus, will bring together clinical excellence from Addenbrooke's Hospital and world-leading researchers at the University of Cambridge under one roof in a new NHS hospital.
