                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran's president warned on Sunday that any U.S. strike would trigger a “harsh response” from Tehran after an Iranian official in the region said at least 5,000 people – including about 500 security personnel – had been killed in nationwide protests. Iran indicated on ⁠Sunday it might go ahead with execution of people detained during the unrest, and with its clerical rulers facing mounting international pressure over the bloodiest unrest since the 1979 Islamic revolution, is seeking to deter Trump from stepping in. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian on X warned that Tehran's response “to any unjust aggression will be harsh and regrettable,” adding that any attack on the country's supreme leader is “tantamount to an all-out war against the nation.” No sign of further protests in Iran as senior cleric calls for executions, threatens Trump U.S.-based rights ‍group HRANA said on Saturday the death toll had reached 3,308, with another 4,382 cases under review. On Friday, Trump thanked Tehran's leaders in a social ‌media post, saying they had called off scheduled executions of 800 people. A day later, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei branded Trump a “criminal,” acknowledging “several thousand deaths” that he blamed on “terrorists and ​rioters” linked to the U.S. and Israel. “A series of actions have been identified as Mohareb, which is among the most severe Islamic punishments,” Iranian judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir told a news conference on Sunday. Mohareb, an Islamic legal term meaning to wage war against God, is punishable by death under Iranian law. One resident in Tehran said that last week he had witnessed riot police directly shooting at a group of protesters, who were mostly young men and women. Videos circulating on social media, some of which have been verified by Reuters, have shown security forces crushing demonstrations across the country. Three sources told Reuters on Jan. 14 that armed Kurdish separatist groups sought to cross the border into Iran from Iraq in a sign of foreign entities potentially seeking to take advantage of instability. Faizan Ali, a 40-year-old medical doctor from Lahore, said he had to cut short his trip to Iran to visit his Iranian wife in the central city of Isfahan as “there was no internet or communication with my family in Pakistan.” “I saw a violent mob burning ‌buildings, banks and cars. I also witnessed an individual stab a passerby,” he told Reuters upon his arrival back in Lahore. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jake Lang's anti-Islam, anti-Somali and pro-ICE rally near City Hall outnumbered by hundreds of counterprotesters Hundreds of counterprotesters on Saturday drowned out a far-right activist's attempt to hold a small rally in support of the Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. Conservative influencer Jake Lang organized an anti-Islam, anti-Somali and pro-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstration, saying on social media beforehand that he intended to “burn a Quran” on the steps of City Hall. But it was not clear if he carried out that plan. Only a small number of people showed up for Lang's demonstration while hundreds of counterprotesters converged at the site, yelling over his attempts to speak and chasing the pro-ICE group away. Lang appeared to be injured as he left the scene, with bruises and scrapes on his head. Lang later announced that he was running for the US Senate in Florida. Maj Andrea Tsuchiya, a spokesperson for the guard, said it was “staged and ready” but yet to be deployed. The operation in the deeply liberal Twin Cities has claimed at least one life: Renee Good, a US citizen and mother of three, was shot by an ICE officer during a 7 January confrontation. Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey echoed that sentiment Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, saying: “I never thought in a million years that we would be invaded by our own government.” On Friday, a federal judge ruled that immigration officers cannot detain or teargas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, including while observing officers during the Minnesota crackdown. Video of federal officers breaking down Garrison Gibson's front door with a battering ram on 11 January has become another rallying point for protesters who oppose the crackdown. He has remained in the country legally under what's known as an order of supervision. Then Gibson was taken back into custody for several hours Friday when he made a routine check-in with immigration officials. Gibson's cousin Abena Abraham said ICE officials told her White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller ordered the second arrest. Gibson was flown to a Texas immigration detention facility but returned home following the judge's ruling. “I don't leave the house,” Gibson said at a news conference. “We will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country,” Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant homeland security secretary, said. Gibson said he has done everything he was supposed to do: “If I was a violent person, I would not have been out these past 17 years, checking in.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian officials welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on NATO allies over Greenland, with Kremlin economic negotiator Kirill Dmitriev claiming on Jan. 17 that the move signals the "collapse" of the transatlantic alliance. "The transatlantic alliance is over," Dmitriev wrote on X, mocking European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and urging European leaders not to "provoke" Trump. He threatened the tariffs just days after European forces from France, Germany, and other countries began arriving for exercises in Greenland. Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, known for provocative outbursts, also welcomed Trump's rhetoric, framing it as evidence of deepening divisions within NATO. "The U.S. is preparing to attack Greenland, choosing the island itself rather than some kind of Atlantic solidarity," Medvedev said, adding that European countries would be "punished with tariffs" for relying on U.S. protection. Medvedev has previously mocked Western unity and urged Trump to move quickly to annex Greenland, reflecting Moscow's interest in exploiting rifts among the U.S. and its allies. Greenland, home to about 56,000 people, already hosts a U.S. military base and has grown in strategic importance as Arctic competition intensifies. Several EU countries have publicly backed Denmark since Trump renewed his threats, signaling alarm in Europe over the potential consequences for NATO cohesion. Trump has insisted that NATO would become "more formidable and effective" if Greenland were under U.S. control, a claim European leaders have rejected. Cyprus, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, announced that EU ambassadors will hold an emergency meeting on Jan. 18 to assess the situation and discuss a response. Tim Zadorozhnyy is the reporter for the Kyiv Independent, specializing in foreign policy, U.S.-Ukraine relations, and political developments across Europe and Russia. Tim is fluent in English, Ukrainian, and Russian. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told participants that Russia shows no readiness to end the war. "The transatlantic alliance is over," Kremlin economic negotiator Kirill Dmitriev said. Disconnecting Ukraine's nuclear power plants would take the crisis one step further — Ukrainians would be fully cut off from electricity and heating in subzero temperatures. The strikes came as Ukraine faces severe cold and ongoing disruptions to heat and electricity supplies following repeated attacks on the energy sector, which prompted a state of emergency earlier this week. The Atesh partisan group sabotaged an electrical substation in Russia's Bryansk Oblast, disrupting power supply to "key" components of Russia's war machine, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Jan. 18. American officials have put forward the idea of expanding the Gaza 'Board of Peace' to include other countries affected by war and conflicts, including Ukraine and Venezuela, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Jan. 16. French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and other officials voiced support for Denmark, Greenland, and principles of international law in statements denouncing Trump's tariffs on Jan. 17.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Democratic Party has a deeply motivated base and a clear advantage on the generic congressional ballot ahead of this fall's midterms despite dismal impressions of its current leaders in Congress, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Democratic registered voters are far more motivated right now than Republicans. While the party has a 5-point edge on the generic ballot, among those who say they're deeply motivated to vote, that advantage expands to a massive 16 points. Democrats enter this year with a chance to capitalize on public dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled government in Washington. The generic congressional ballot measures which of the two major parties voters would rather support in an upcoming election. While it does not capture how voters may ultimately respond to the candidates whose names appear in their district, the generic ballot can be an early indicator of which party holds the upper hand nationwide. In 2022, when Republicans won a narrow majority during former President Joe Biden's administration, voters were about evenly split between the two parties. Both figures are little changed from last April. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, broad majorities say Democrats in Congress have done too little to oppose Trump and have been ineffective at resisting Republican policies they oppose. They see their party's caucus as falling particularly short compared with rank-and-file expectations for resisting Republican policies: Seventy-one percent say Democrats in Congress have been ineffective on that score, up 20 points from the 51% who expected a less than effective effort last January when the current Congress convened. That discontent with the party's efforts could affect how primary challenges to sitting members of Congress play out in the coming months. Among the group that feels that way, which tilts Democratic, “a change in political leadership” is as popular a remedy as bringing down inflation. Among independents, the two sets of party leaders are viewed about equally badly, with roughly three-quarters disapproving of each side. The public is broadly split over whether the country would be better off or worse off if Democrats won control of Congress this November. Republicans largely consolidate around saying worse off (84%), with Democrats slightly less likely to say the country would be better off (79%). Independents tilt toward the positive, 35% better off compared with 27% worse off, but a sizable 37% say a change in control would make no difference. This tepid sentiment doesn't hurt Democrats on generic ballot preferences, though, as many of those who aren't convinced that Democratic control of Congress will make a difference are willing to gamble on a change regardless: Registered voters in this group favor the Democrats over the Republicans on the generic ballot by a roughly 2-to-1 margin. A 61% majority of Americans say Republicans in Congress have been at least somewhat effective in passing new laws, lower than the 76% who expected them to be effective at doing so a year ago, when they took full control of the federal government for the first time in six years. While about half of the public overall says congressional Republicans are too supportive of Trump, and a similar share that Trump has been bad for the Republican Party, those sentiments aren't shared within the GOP. A 56% majority of Republican-aligned adults say the GOP caucus is doing the right amount to support Trump, with 33% saying they aren't supportive enough, and just 11% that they're too supportive. Even amid recent high-profile pushback on Trump from some Republicans, the share of the party's base that sees the caucus as insufficiently supportive has risen by 9 points since last February. Two-thirds of GOP-aligned adults say Trump has had a good effect on the Republican Party, with just 15% saying he's had a bad effect on the GOP. Among Republicans and Republican-leaners, 9 in 10 self-identified members of the “Make America Great Again” movement say Trump has had a good effect on the party, with just 1% seeing his influence as a negative. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS online and by phone from January 9-12 among a random national sample of 1,209 adults, including 968 registered voters. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points; it is 3.5 points among registered voters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>María Corina Machado idolises Margaret Thatcher and hopes to win over the US president with policies similar to those of the late British PM When María Corina Machado told Hugo Chávez, the former president of Venezuela, he was a liar on live television, she may have been embodying Margaret Thatcher's devastating handbagging moves. The Venezuelan opposition leader idolises the late British prime minister – and appears to view herself as something of a protégé. “People told me my ideas would never be widely accepted. Now Ms Machado, who has been described as Venezuela's Iron Lady, is tasked with trying to convince Donald Trump to back her, a conservative ally, to take over from the communist regime that has ruined her country. Instead, Delcy Rodríguez, Mr Maduro's deputy, replaced him, keeping the repressive regime intact. Undeterred by Mr Trump's comments, Ms Machado this week took her cause to the Oval Office in an effort to prove she could be more useful to the administration than a propped-up repressive regime. Ms Machado said Ms Rodríguez is a “communist” who counts Russia, China and Iran as her closest allies, but if there is a transition to democracy in Venezuela, the country will become “the best ally the United States has ever had in the Americas”. In the coming weeks and months, Ms Machado will pitch herself to Mr Trump and his key allies as the conservative face of a capitalist, free-market Venezuela. It was no coincidence that Ms Machado chose to deliver her press conference at The Heritage Foundation, which in 1997 hosted her anti-communist idol, Mrs Thatcher, when she delivered a speech on the principles of conservatism. “When María Corina started speaking at the Heritage Foundation, she described Delcy Rodríguez as a very convinced communist,” said Fabio Valentini, a coordinator for Vente Venezuela, who was part of Ms Machado's team in Washington DC. Ms Machado has carefully read Mrs Thatcher's autobiography in Spanish, taking notes on it, he added. He has since given her a copy in English, which she plans to read. “Sometimes in private sessions or meetings with her team, she would refer many, many times to Thatcher's leadership, or sometimes she would quote her,” Mr Valentini added. “This meeting [with Mr Trump] was quite important, because María Corina needed to play Donald Trump's game and at the same time show Donald Trump that she is a leader and that she is eventually ready to play a role within the larger chess board of Venezuela”, said Carlos Solar, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. She used the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour the US president has set his sights upon for years, as a “political weapon”, he said. “I think people are not seeing that she's playing the long game,” he added. Ms Machado is understood to have a good relationship with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, who is among a handful of US officials communicating with Ms  Rodríguez and the Venezuelan regime. She also has “a very good team of advisors who are Washington insiders,” said Chris Sabatini, senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House. “I actually think that meeting was more productive than it first appeared,” Mr Bolton told The Telegraph. “The best way to Trump's heart is to make sure whatever you're proposing that he does works to his benefit, and she went, obviously, above and beyond that by giving him her Nobel Peace medal. And I think that does have an impact on Trump,” he said. “Clearly she has found a comfort zone and a lot of support positioning herself on the Right, and probably further to a hard Right, both within Latin America and outside of Latin America”, Mr Solar said. Mr Valentini said Mr Trump had truly recognised Ms Machado's “position not only as part of this movement, but also as an important key to restore democracy in Venezuela”. In private conversations between friends, members of Vente Venezuela would say how the world needed another Ronald Reagan and Mrs Thatcher to take control of the situation. Mr Valentini said he “absolutely” sees Ms Machado as the Mrs Thatcher of today. “Many people say María Corina is the Iron Lady of Latin America”, he said. Now, Ms Machado just has to win over the US president.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Korey LaVergne, 37, jailed Friday evening on three counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile, according to officials Authorities in south-west Louisiana recently arrested a Roman Catholic priest on accusations of behaving indecently with a child, igniting a new scandal in the diocese where the US church's reckoning with clergy abuse began – an institution that just disclosed it could lose up to $162m over pending litigation. Korey LaVergne was jailed Friday evening on three counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile, according to Acadia parish sheriff KP Gibson, whose agency arrested the priest. LaVergne had presided over mass at St Edward church in Richard – where the Lafayette diocese had assigned him as pastor – hours before he was booked into the Acadia lockup. Details about the allegations against LaVergne weren't immediately available, with Gibson saying on Saturday that his office intended to issue a news release later “as the investigation allows”. A spokesperson for the Lafayette diocese said LaVergne's arrest occurred after a report of “possible misconduct by [the] cleric” but didn't elaborate. LaVergne, 37, had previously served as the Lafayette diocese's official courier. In that role, he had drawn news headlines for bringing thousands of pages of documents to the Vatican outlining the cause for sainthood for Charlene Richard, who died from acute lymphatic leukemia at age 12 in 1959 and became known for offering her suffering up to God as well as others. Richard, nicknamed the Little Cajun Saint, is buried at St Edward. LaVergne's arrest comes at a relatively fragile time for the Lafayette diocese, which was founded in 1918 and tends to a congregation of about 150,000 Catholics. In a financial report posted in November, the diocese disclosed its “total range of potential loss on [pending litigation] claims with a reasonably possible likelihood of unfavorable outcome is $88,187,500 to $162,450,000”. A Lafayette diocese priest named Gilbert Gauthe effectively brought the decades-old, worldwide Catholic clergy abuse crisis to the US by pleading guilty in 1985 to molesting several boys. The Lafayette diocese subsequently sought to strike down a law passed by Louisiana's state legislature in 2021 that enabled survivors of long-ago sexual molestation to pursue civil damages in court. “This arrest is heartbreaking – not because it is shocking, but because it confirms that child sexual abuse in the church is still happening,” said the statement from Letitia Peyton, whose son was molested by a Lafayette Catholic priest in a case that later sent the cleric to prison. “Accountability must be immediate, transparent and enforced – anything less allows harm to continue.” Generally, under Louisiana law, indecent behavior with a juvenile can carry up to seven years in prison. Online video of the mass LaVergne presided over shortly before his arrest showed him welcoming visiting students of an elementary Catholic school from nearby Crowley, Louisiana.</p>

MOSCOW, January 18. /TASS/. Ukrainian forces lost around 1,210 personnel in the special military operation zone over the past 24 hours, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.

According to the ministry, Ukrainian troops lost more than 175 servicemen in the area of responsibility of Russia's North battlegroup, and up to 200 servicemen in the area of responsibility of West battlegroup, more than 135 and more than 455 servicemen as a result of the actions of the South and Center battlegroups, respectively. Ukrainian forces also lost more than 205 soldiers in the East battlegroup's area of responsibility and up to 40 troops in the area of the Dnepr battlegroup.

Russian forces also carried out strikes on facilities assembling unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as on energy and transport sites operating in the interests of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

"Operational-tactical aviation, strike unmanned aerial vehicles, missile forces, and artillery units of the Russian Armed Forces hit facilities assembling long-range unmanned aerial vehicles, energy and transport infrastructure used in the interests of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as well as temporary deployment points of Ukrainian armed formations and foreign mercenaries in 149 areas," the Russian Defense Ministry reported.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Atesh partisan group sabotaged an electrical substation in Russia's Bryansk Oblast, disrupting power supply to "key" components of Russia's war machine, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Jan. 18. Power disruptions also affected nearby enterprises, including a locomotive repair depot as well as fuel storage facilities in the area, the group claimed. The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims. The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks on Russian territory and in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine. Over the past year, agents of Atesh have claimed to have sabotaged key railway hubs, a locomotive, as well as a Russian air defense factory, among other targets. Bryansk Oblast, located in Russia's far-west, borders Ukraine's Chernihiv and Sumy Oblast, and has been the target of various Ukrainian strikes. Dmytro Basmat is a senior news editor for The Kyiv Independent. Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told participants that Russia shows no readiness to end the war. "The transatlantic alliance is over," Kremlin economic negotiator Kirill Dmitriev said. The 330-kilovolt power line, damaged and disconnected by military activity on Jan. 2, is vital for supplying the plant with external electricity. Disconnecting Ukraine's nuclear power plants would take the crisis one step further — Ukrainians would be fully cut off from electricity and heating in subzero temperatures. The strikes came as Ukraine faces severe cold and ongoing disruptions to heat and electricity supplies following repeated attacks on the energy sector, which prompted a state of emergency earlier this week. The Atesh partisan group sabotaged an electrical substation in Russia's Bryansk Oblast, disrupting power supply to "key" components of Russia's war machine, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Jan. 18. American officials have put forward the idea of expanding the Gaza 'Board of Peace' to include other countries affected by war and conflicts, including Ukraine and Venezuela, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Jan. 16. French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and other officials voiced support for Denmark, Greenland, and principles of international law in statements denouncing Trump's tariffs on Jan. 17.</p>
