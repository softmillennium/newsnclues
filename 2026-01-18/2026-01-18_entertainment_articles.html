                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order to block out an exclusive window for the Army-Navy Game, an effort to preserve its date and its lack of competition from other games. His post on Saturday comes amid proposal to expand the College Football Playoffs, a potential conflict to the Army-Navy Game. Trump wrote on Truth Social, “The Army-Navy Game is one of our Greatest American Traditions — Unmatched Patriotism, Courage, and Honor! This incredible Tradition is now at risk of being pushed aside by more College Playoff Games, and Big TV Money. I will soon sign a Historic Executive Order securing an EXCLUSIVE 4 hour Broadcast window, so this National Event stands above Commercial Postseason Games. No other Game or Team can violate this Time Slot!! Stellan Skarsgård Reacts To Trump's Greenland Demands: "What's Happening Is Absurd" - European Film Awards 'Saturday Night Live' Opens With Donald Trump And Cabinet Boasting Of ICE Raids, Venezuela Invasion And More Chaos To Come: "Midterms Are Canceled" Stations enjoy a lesser degree of First Amendment protection than other forms of media, but the Supreme Court has ruled that restrictions have to be “narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest.” That has given the agency the legal ability to regulate such things as indecency and obscenity, as well as commercials in children's programming. Meanwhile, sports rights have been migrating to streaming platforms, which are outside the FCC's oversight. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr reposted Trump's message on X, but did not comment. Trump's comments — made amid ongoing ICE raids in Minneapolis, and the president's announcement of tariffs on European countries that don't agree to the U.S. taking control of Greenland — may merely be a way of pressuring college football officials into backing off of any plan to schedule games in the traditional Army-Navy timeslot.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tina Fey and Robert Carlock (co-creator with Sam Means) are among executive producers of the comedy about a disgraced football star hoping a documentary will change his life. I don't mean to tell Hollywood's creative forces what to do, but the pace of sports mockumentary production has fallen well behind the pace of sports documentary production. The latter is a genre that — as much as I watch it vociferously — is always in need of a little ego deflation. There are great sports mockumentaries, like the HBO Sports tennis comedy 7 Days in Hell or the When We Were Kings-inspired “How They Threw Rocks” episode of Documentary Now!. It's harder to do a sports mockumentary as an ongoing series, but the American Vandal guys tackled e-sports fairly well (at times) in Paramount+'s Players. Netflix Reveals 'Enola Holmes 3' First Look, Lewis Pullman's 'Remarkably Bright Creatures' Release Date Tracy Morgan's New NBC Sitcom Has an Especially Distasteful '30 Rock' Easter Egg Preview: Sunday, January 18, after the NFL Playoffs (NBC)Time period premiere: Monday, February 23 (NBC)Cast: Tracy Morgan, Daniel Radcliffe, Erika Alexander, Bobby Moynihan, Precious Way, Jalyn HallCreators: Robert Carlock and Sam Means Like so many of Tina Fey and Robert Carlock‘s comedies, including 30 Rock, The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins doesn't start with full confidence in its overall voice or characters, settling to get most of its laughs from familiar cutaways and asides. Instead, Reggie accidentally confessed to an extensive gambling problem and became a national disgrace. Two decades later, Reggie is still doing surprisingly well, economically, thanks to the management of his ex-wife Monica (Erika Alexander). But what he really wants is to be universally loved again. And what he really, REALLY wants is to be reinstated into the NFL so that he can go into the Hall of Fame. Reggie's solution is to hire Arthur Tobin (Daniel Radcliffe), an Oscar-winning documentarian, to make an adulatory film about him, changing public perception and opening new doors. Monica doesn't think either documentary is a good idea. He is, unsurprisingly, a Tracy Morgan archetype — a perpetual man-child prone to malapropisms, naïveté and unexpected bursts of wisdom, capable of misjudgments in the moment, but generally lovable. He attributes the ongoing opulence of his lifestyle to Monica's business savvy, but this is the sort of thing you don't want to think very hard about — either in terms of how few rough edges Reggie has for a degenerate gambler or any awareness Monica must have had about his proclivities. Morgan has always been a unique comic voice, and few people know how to channel that voice better than Carlock and Fey. He's got a good match in Radcliffe, who has spent the decade+ since that boy wizard franchise proving time and time again what an eager and generous comic foil he is. Once she isn't a wet blanket she becomes a real character, and Alexander, who Hollywood has only periodically found ways to fully utilize since Living Single, is great. Moynihan gets better as the series finds a way to expose the loneliness behind his goofball exterior, just as Precious Way begins to pop when Brina isn't just being put out there as a future trophy wife. So far, Carmelo has had the least chance to develop a real character, but the fourth episode, in which Monica considers dating an agent, gives hints of what Hall can do with stronger material. (Why is the camera crew filming extended conversations about Monica's dating life? Is the documentary aesthetic really being consistently applied at any point? These are questions you'll have to assume will either be answered or smoothed over.) The series hasn't really built an ensemble yet. Arthur's crew seems to be one cameraman, entirely off-camera. Monica has an inept assistant played by Unstable scene-stealer Rachel Marsh, who might be good for regular laughs but so far she's only recurring.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>John Mayer delivered an emotional rendition of “Ripple” as well as a heartfelt eulogy for the late Bob Weir at a public memorial for the Grateful Dead guitarist on Saturday in San Francisco. Taking the stage at the Civic Center Plaza celebration in front of thousands of Dead Heads, Mayer opened his eulogy by noting that he and Weir, his friend and Dead & Company band mate, were born on the same day (October 16) 30 years apart (1947 and 1977). “In the 30 years that preceded me, Bob had become a countercultural icon. “Bob learned early on that spirit, heart, soul, curiosity, and fearlessness was the path to glory. Mayer then talked about joining Dead & Company, and how that gig turned into a friendship with the Weir family. He staked his entire reputation on my joining a band with him. He gave me musical community, he gave me this community.” Mayer then broke into tears as the Deadheads saluted him.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A lot of performers make some noise about being nervous over the prospect of hosting an episode of Saturday Night Live, and while it wouldn't be fair to call these claims broadly disingenuous, some are easier to believe than others. Any confessions of nerves from Finn Wolfhard strike me as eminently plausible. He seems to be interested in the show, given that two of his highest-profile movie roles have been in the Jason Reitman orbit of two Ghostbusters revival sequels and an actual SNL docudrama, and though he has experience performing music live, he's young enough to still register as vaguely inexperienced (or at least maybe kind of a limited actor?) There's plenty of reason to think it would mean a lot to him if his hosting gig, the first of 2026, went well. Wolfhard certainly made for an endearing host out of the gate, goofing on himself and the very slight aging of his fresh kid-actor face in the monologue, but his first appearance on the episode also set an immediate pattern of calling for back-up: It featured Stranger Things co-stars Galen Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin, who later turned up a second time for a proper parody of their show and shared the episode by fellow cameos Sabrina Carpenter and musical guest A$AP Rocky in the Snack Homiez sketch, plus Jason Momoa incongruously jumping aboard a Harry Potter bit. In aggregate, it all feels like what the show would do to pad out a sports star who has to uneasily play himself in most of the sketches. I don't mean to sell any of those cameos short by laundry-listing through them like that. Seeing the Stranger boys do a Sex And The City riff was cute, and I genuinely love that Sabrina Carpenter was down enough with the Snack Homiez to join the ranks of SNL hosts with their own recurring characters. (Her schedule may not permit it, especially if SNL has to split her sktech-comedy time with their old felt nemeses The Muppets, but doesn't it seem like she has to come back every time they do it now?) Snack Homiez is the perfect example: When that sketch grabbed the leadoff position for its second appearance, I thought, oh, right, of course, perfect place to put an actor who (despite having grown up on camera) still reads as young and might be self-conscious about it. But there wasn't all that much room for Wolfhard to dive into the group dynamic there, with Carpenter hitting the ground running and A$AP Rocky turning up for the guest spot. (Much as I enjoyed his musical performances tonight—and his work in Highest 2 Lowest, for that matter—he was probably one element too many in this sketch.) As for the sketches that did lean more heavily on Wolfhard, he fared the best in a deeply silly sci-if-show sketch (lots of fake-streamer pretenses in this week's bits, huh?) where a toady (Mikey Day) insistently feeds an intergalactic ruler (Wolfhard) exotic space snacks, distracting from his imperious menacing. I'm all for the idea that comedy sketches can weasel out of punchline-y “proper” endings (Monty Python did this all the time!) but it's probably best to find a better joke to exit on than one as mild as another guy volunteering to eat what the imperious ruler has rejected. Even so, it was a home run compared to another sound premise sketch with arguably even better performances, where Wolfhard played a son confessing to his parents (Ashley Padilla and James Austin Johnson) that he wants to tour with his indie band rather than follow in his dad's pop-star footsteps. Johnson and Padilla are probably the two best pure sketch actors in this cast, and they were hitting all of their marks, taking everything perfectly seriously; Wolfhard didn't recess from the scene so much as fail to heighten as far as his co-stars, including the additional cast members stepping in as Johnson's fellow boy-banders. An admittedly tall order for Wolfhard, granted, but for whatever reason, a reasonably well-written and quite well-performed sketch seemed to more or less die in the room. Wolfhard's generic indie bandmates read more as mid-'90s alterna-rock (complete with obligatory Pixies influence), which of course warps the timeline further, although Jane Wickline's completion of the runner where boy-band members flirt with Padilla's character was aces. This installment still managed to get by on broad charm, two engaging A$AP Rocky numbers, and keeping the worst stuff to a minimum. But if the idea was to propel Finn Wolfhard out of the Stranger Things promo tour, he might need a little more assistance to make that happen. If Snack Homiez is going to be a three-times-a-season recurring bit from now until Chloe Fineman leaves the show (so… somewhere between four and sixteen months? The show can use a youth-culture-spoofing hangout sketch, even if skews a little closer to Jarret's Room than Wayne's World. Look, Veronika Slowikowska has an energy about her that seems very right for SNL. But her showcase this week as a girlfriend who goes into grotesque overdrive trying to be one of the guys was so aggressively one-note. Points for the complexity of that note: overfamiliar in the broad strokes, yet distended enough by her distinctive vocal style to not really play as a classic high-concept run-through. It felt like a belated audition in the worst way. For the show's first post-Bowen Yang outing, no one really stepped up. Teyana Taylor is this season's designated Oscar-season get (unless Jessie Buckley makes it a double in March, closer to her likely victory and/or the release of The Bride!). I also see that I have one (1) week to get on board with Geese or risk sounding monumentally old.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen did not try to hide his emotions after the season ended Saturday night. Following Buffalo's overtime loss to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round, Allen broke down in tears during his postgame press conference, offering a rare and vulnerable moment from one of the NFL's biggest stars. The clip spread quickly across social media, where fans, fellow athletes, and celebrities reacted not with mockery but with support. His voice cracked as he described the bond he shares with his teammates and how much the season meant to him. Still, turnovers played a key role in the loss, and Allen did not shy away from accountability. According to Sporting News, Allen emphasized that wins and losses start with him, a sentiment that resonated with fans and analysts alike. Several Bills players later spoke about Allen's leadership and commitment, noting that his emotional response reflected how much he cares about the team and the city of Buffalo, as reported by Buffalo Rumblings. While Allen's tears highlighted a difficult professional moment, they also revealed a softer, more personal side of an athlete who has increasingly crossed into pop culture territory. Allen is married to actor and singer Hailee Steinfeld, whose own career has long placed her in the entertainment spotlight. Steinfeld, known for roles in films like “Pitch Perfect 2” and series such as “Hawkeye,” has spoken in past interviews about balancing public life with private support. Though she did not publicly comment on the loss, fans online praised the couple's ability to remain grounded amid constant attention. Allen's emotional moment sparked renewed conversations about masculinity in sports and the importance of emotional openness, especially among high-profile figures whose lives often unfold in front of cameras. For entertainment audiences, the moment humanized a quarterback often defined by stats and strength. The video of Allen wiping away tears did more than trend. In a media environment that often rewards stoicism, Allen's honesty stood out. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Nicole Kidman, his wife of 19 years, filed for divorce on September 30, 2025, fans were shocked, and now there is a report about Urban dating someone new. Sources have revealed that Urban is dating Karley Scott Collins, Daily Mail reports. The reports have not been confirmed, but sources revealed that Urban and Collins are in a relationship and it is “serious,” Daily Mail reports. Collins is 26, and “People think they are even living together,” the source said. “Look, teen girls love their dads, so there's a reason they're making it three against one.” The source claims that this is why Urban's two daughters, Sunday Rose and Faith, appear to be publicly supporting Kidman during this difficult time. Collins has 62,000 followers on Instagram, and she is a rising country music star. On May 21, 2025, Collins teased the release of her album for September that year. “The dream of putting out my first real record where I get to share the story of my life, loves + heartbreaks with you guys is one that has kept me up at night since I picked up a guitar when I was 11 years old,” she wrote in the caption. Collins shared that she had completed her “number one bucket list thing” when she posted a video on Instagram on November 1, 2025, showing her shark-cage diving. In the caption, she shared her thoughts, writing, “this was my #1 bucket list thing for my whole life, I might still be in shock.” On January 15, Collins took part in the viral social media trend of posting pictures from ten years ago. “2016… so much has changed, and yet so little has I drew on everything from my clothes to my arms (because people definitely thought a Sharpie looked like a real tattoo), my hair was about a foot longer (which I do miss), I wore some questionable outfits, and I always had a guitar in my hand.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Keith Urban has reportedly moved in with a new girlfriend following his high profile divorce from Nicole Kidman. “I hear he [Urban] has someone, which is why the girls are publicly supporting Mom,” a source told the Daily Mail in comments published on Saturday — referencing the former couples' daughters, Sunday, 17, and Faith, 15. “Look, teen girls love their dads, so there's a reason they're making it three against one.” She posted pictures of them all taking part in a ‘turkey trot' running race on Thanksgiving which is really unusual, she's generally more private than that.” “Each time you see them they are linking arms or holding hands. It looks ‘us against the world,'” they explained. Meanwhile Urban — who was married to the “Big Little Lies” star, 58, for 19 years before their shocking split over the summer — is said to be working on a breakup album in Nashville, where he's reportedly renovating a music studio in Music Row. According to the Daily Mail, “everyone is adamant” that Urban, 58, is involved with someone new, and that it's “serious” — speculation about Urban's current girlfriend is centered on country star Karley Scott Collins, 26. The outlet noted that “there is no suggestion they had an affair.” By clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. Page Six confirmed last September that the “Eyes Wide Shut” star and Urban were separating after 19 years of marriage. The famous duo reportedly had been living apart since the beginning of summer 2025, and subsequent rumors that Urban was involved with guitarist Maggie Baugh were shut down by a friend who called them “absolutely not true.”</p>
