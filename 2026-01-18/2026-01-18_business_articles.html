                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At least 5,000 people have been killed in protests in Iran, including about 500 security personnel, an Iranian official in the region said on Sunday, citing verified figures and accusing "terrorists and armed rioters" of killing "innocent Iranians." Nationwide protests erupted on Dec. 28 over economic hardship and swelled over two weeks into widespread demonstrations calling for the end of clerical rule — resulting in the deadliest unrest since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if protesters continued to be killed on the streets or were executed. In a social media post on Friday, he thanked Tehran's leaders, saying they had called off scheduled executions of 800 people. "We will not drag the country into war, but we will not let domestic or international criminals go unpunished," Khamenei said, acknowledging "several thousand deaths" that he blamed on "terrorists and rioters" linked to the U.S. and Israel. Iran's judiciary indicated that executions may go ahead. "A series of actions have been identified as Mohareb, which is among the most severe Islamic punishments," Iranian judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir told a press conference on Sunday. Mohareb, an Islamic legal term meaning to wage war against God, is punishable by death under Iranian law. Trump said in an interview with Politico on Saturday: "It's time to look for new leadership in Iran." U.S.-based rights group HRANA said on Saturday the death toll had reached 3,308, with another 4,382 cases under review. The Iranian official said the verified death toll was unlikely to "increase sharply", adding "Israel and armed groups abroad" had supported and equipped those taking to the streets. One resident in Tehran said he had witnessed riot police directly shooting at a group of protesters, who were mostly young men and women. Videos circulating on social media, some of which have been verified by Reuters, have shown security forces violently cracking down on demonstrations across the country. Kurdish separatists have been active there and flare-ups have been among the most violent in past periods of unrest. Three sources told Reuters on January 14 that armed Kurdish separatist groups sought to cross the border into Iran from Iraq in a sign of foreign entities potentially seeking to take advantage of instability. "I am against this regime and have taken part in protests, but I witnessed some armed individuals disguised as protesters shooting at civilians. They were not ordinary protesters; they carried guns and knives," an Iranian in a northwestern town told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Getting information out of Iran has been complicated by internet blackouts, which were partly lifted for a few hours early on Saturday. Faizan Ali, a 40-year-old medical doctor from Lahore, said he had to cut short his trip to Iran to visit his Iranian wife in the central city of Isfahan as "there was no internet or communication with my family in Pakistan". "I saw a violent mob burning buildings, banks and cars. I also witnessed an individual stab a passer-by," he told Reuters upon his arrival back in Lahore.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers in Alaska to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota, the site of large protests against the government's deportation drive, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Sunday. President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to use the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces if officials in the state do not stop protesters from targeting immigration officials after a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Even without invoking the act, a president can deploy active-duty forces for certain domestic purposes such as protecting federal property, which Trump cited as a justification for sending Marines to Los Angeles last year. In addition to the active-duty forces, the Pentagon could also attempt to deploy newly created National Guard rapid-response forces for civil disturbances. The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on the order, which was first reported by ABC News. "If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT," Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. The soldiers subject to deployment specialize in cold-weather operations and are assigned to two U.S. Army infantry battalions under the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, the officials said. Confrontations between residents and federal officers have become increasingly tense in Minneapolis, Minnesota's most-populous city, after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three, on January 7 as she was driving away after being ordered to exit her car. Trump, a Republican, has sent nearly 3,000 federal agents from ICE and Border Patrol to Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul since early last week, as part of a wave of interventions, mostly to cities run by Democratic politicians. He has said troop deployments in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Memphis and Portland, Oregon, are necessary to fight crime and protect federal property and personnel from protesters. But this month he said he was removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, which have faced legal setbacks and challenges. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, against whom the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation, has mobilized the state's National Guard to support local law enforcement and emergency management agencies, the state Department of Public Safety posted on X on Saturday. Trump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending in immigration agents. The president and administration officials have singled out the state's community of Somali immigrants. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's "very unlikely" that the Supreme Court will overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. "I believe that it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will overrule a president's signature economic policy," Bessent said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "They did not overrule Obamacare, I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos." In June, the Supreme Court upheld a key Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients. Bessent's comments come one day after Trump said he would impose a new slate of tariffs on goods coming from Europe until "a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland." Trump did not specify in his Truth Social post which statute he was invoking to impose the tariffs, though the move appears to mirror the "liberation day" duties he has imposed on dozens of nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. They will then escalate to 25% on June 1, Trump said. The Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump's use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs before the end of its term, but a decision could come as soon as this week. IEEPA gives the president wide latitude to use economic tools in response to an "unusual and extraordinary threat." Bessent said Trump's new tariffs on Europe regarding Greenland are a response to an emergency. Trump has long sought to acquire Greenland, the Arctic territory of Denmark, and has ratcheted up his pressure campaign for a U.S. takeover of the island in recent weeks. Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe have widely rejected Trump's demands to take over the island. European leaders of countries targeted by the new tariffs responded on Sunday. "Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response," the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind," the statement read. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Motzfeldt at the White House last week in a meeting that Rasmussen described as "frank but constructive." The Trump administration claims that a U.S. acquisition of Greenland is critical to national security to counter the expansion of Russia and China in the region. CNBC has reached out to the White House and the Treasury Department to clarify what statute Trump is using to impose the new European tariffs.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Indiana University wins the 2026 College Football Playoff National Championship on Monday, fans will owe some thanks to one of the football program's biggest financial donors: billionaire Mark Cuban. He's a longtime donor to his alma mater, including $5 million for a sports media center in 2015 and $6 million for IU's rugby team in 2024. While Cuban hasn't disclosed the size of his recent donations to IU's athletic department, it was a "big number," the billionaire told CBS in October 2025. The team's recent success under head coach Curt Cignetti, hired in 2024, inspired Cuban to open his checkbook again: The school is "happier this year than last year" after his latest donation, Cuban told Front Office Sports on Jan. 7. Now, Cignetti's team is just one win against the University of Miami away from a national championship and Cuban says it's because the coach understands the most important aspects of building a successful organization. DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agents "I've been part of championship organizations and putting together a team isn't easy," Cuban told Bloomington, Indiana's The Herald-Times on Jan. 10. Cuban discussed team-building strategy with Cignetti and came away impressed, he said. The coach assured Cuban that the team would use his donations to recruit a well-rounded roster of players, rather than putting the money toward chasing after just a few high-profile recruits, said Cuban. "It's about getting players that know their roles, work as a team, continue to improve and work in the system," Cuban told the newspaper. That's why I've been so excited to support them." Cuban has previously spoken about how good leaders build successful businesses through hiring the right people. Leaders should avoid hiring people who don't fit their company culture, "because you can't have conflict on what the vision of the company is," he said on a March 2021 episode of the "Starting Greatness" podcast. Every winning team, or successful business, needs those employees who excel in their specific roles, like the "glue guys" on a basketball team, Cuban added on "Starting Greatness." Culture and competency are the two biggest considerations for leaders when building a team, Cuban said during a MasterClass course released in February 2024. He's credited his time at the school for exposing him "to all kinds of different people [and] ideas" while nurturing his early entrepreneurial skills: Cuban opened and ran a local bar as an undergraduate, and picked up extra cash teaching dance lessons. "What it gives me is far more than anything I could give to IU. No one would know who the hell I am if it wasn't for Indiana University."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Everyday living costs play a major role in how much money you need to retire. A new state-by-state analysis from personal finance website GOBankingRates shows that the estimated total savings needed to retire at 65 can differ by as much as $1.46 million depending on where you live. In Hawaii, retirees need about $2.2 million to stop working at 65 and cover essential living expenses for 25 years, including housing, groceries, transportation, utilities and health-care costs. That is the highest estimated minimum of any state. From there, GOBankingRates subtracted average Social Security payments and estimated the savings needed to cover the remaining expenses using an annual 4% withdrawal rate. The resulting figures represent a baseline for covering essential costs and don't factor in discretionary spending such as travel, dining or entertainment. Additionally, the estimates don't account for factors such as inflation, lifestyle changes or unexpected costs. Housing is the biggest factor in annual retirement costs, as it varies by roughly $30,000 annually between states. Want to get ahead at work with AI?

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That is largely due to a new temporary senior "bonus" or deduction of up to $6,000 per qualifying individual that was enacted when President Donald Trump signed the "big beautiful bill" package into law last July. The $6,000 senior deduction is in effect from tax years 2025 through 2028. It applies to taxpayers 65 and over, regardless of whether they itemize their tax returns or take the standard deduction. Retirees may not have made full use of the break since it was implemented partway through last year, experts say, but the next three years of planning could be key. "This three-year window is an incredible, valuable opportunity," said Miklos Ringbauer, a certified public accountant and founder and principal of MiklosCPA Inc., an accounting and tax strategy firm in Southern California. "It's three times $12,000, plus adjusted for inflation," Ringbauer said. However, because it is not a tax credit, they will not necessarily receive those sums back in their refunds. "That's four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs," Sweeney said. Seniors must have a modified adjusted gross income under certain thresholds to qualify for the full deduction — up to $75,000 if single or $150,000 if married and filing taxes jointly. Yet because the law was passed by a legislative process known as reconciliation, Republican lawmakers could not directly make that change. Instead, the new senior deduction is aimed at replacing the income that any federal taxes on Social Security benefits may take away. Federal taxes on Social Security benefits that are still in effect make it so beneficiaries may face levies on a formula called combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, nontaxable interest and half of Social Security benefits. Up to 50% of Social Security benefits are taxable for individuals with $25,000 to $34,000 in combined income, and married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000. Up to 85% of benefits are taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income and married couples with over $44,000. The "big beautiful" tax package includes other tax changes that individuals ages 65 and over may take advantage of — a higher standard deduction and state and local tax deduction, a deduction of up to $10,000 per taxpayer for interest on new auto loans, plus no tax on tips or overtime pay for those who are still working. "With tax changes come tax planning opportunities," said Joe Elsasser, a certified financial planner and president of Covisum, a Social Security claiming software company. Notably, the new $6,000 senior deduction applies to individuals 65 and over, whether they have claimed Social Security benefits or not, Elsasser said. "Don't just focus on the temporary additional senior deduction as a reduction of Social Security tax," Elsasser said. "Instead, think of it as a four-year additional deduction that could be applied against any kind of income." Yet some individuals may not have been mindful of their taxable income for the year with the new senior deduction in mind, according to Ringbauer. For example, if taxpayers ages 65 and over had a very successful year in the stock market in 2025, they may be phased out of the full deduction that could have been available to them, Ringbauer said. For tax years 2026 and beyond, older individuals may want to focus on how to stay within the deduction's income limits, he said. Individuals who are age 65 and up and still working may be able to reduce their taxable income by contributing to a retirement plan. Older taxpayers may also consider reducing their taxable income through charitable contributions. Individuals ages 65 and older also want to be aware of other potential sources of income — such as required minimum distributions or Roth conversions — that may affect the size of their taxable income and therefore eligibility for the senior deduction, Ringbauer said. The new senior deduction will reduce taxes on other income, not just Social Security, according to Elsasser. Consequently, for taxpayers who have financial flexibility, it may make sense to withdraw money from IRAs or other retirement accounts while the temporary deduction is in place, he said. Those withdrawals may also help reduce required minimum distributions later, which can also help limit retirees' future income subject to taxes. Notably, that strategy may also help individuals ages 65 and over to delay claiming Social Security retirement benefits. Those who have already claimed Social Security retirement benefits and who have reached full retirement age may consider voluntarily suspending their monthly checks while the senior bonus is in effect to let their future monthly benefit checks grow, Elsasser said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Investors contended with bank earnings and geopolitical tensions this week, but the ongoing volatility may help uncover a few attractive stock picks. Stock ratings from top Wall Street analysts can help inform investors as they search for opportunities in the market. These experts arrive at their recommendations following a thorough analysis of the macro and micro factors affecting a company. Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is Broadcom (AVGO), a semiconductor and infrastructure software provider. The company's custom chips or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, are seeing strong demand amid the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Following an investor meeting with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom's semiconductor solutions group, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated a buy rating on Broadcom stock with a price target of $475. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $393. The meeting made Rasgon conclude that investor concerns about the impact of rising competition and customer-owned tooling on Broadcom's AI positioning are "hugely overblown and that the company is unlikely to be dethroned in the ASIC space anytime soon." While Broadcom acknowledges that Nvidia (NVDA) is innovating faster than anyone else, Rasgon noted that the company is confident about being the only partner that can help XPU customers keep up. With innovation related to 3D chip stacking and 400G SerDes to a massive supply chain and in-house substrate production, Broadcom is progressing in a way that no one can match, the five-star analyst noted. Broadcom is also expected to benefit from the growing demand for Alphabet-owned Google's ($GOOGL) tensor processing units, or TPUs, given its partnership with Google in developing these chips. Rasgon highlighted Kawwas' commentary about TPU v7 (ironwood) shipments rising from hundreds of thousands of units in 2025 to "many many millions" in 2026. Also, Rasgon noted that the $73 billion order figure given at AVGO's earnings release is substantially higher today. Travel stock Airbnb (ABNB) is next on the list. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Airbnb stock with a price target of $153. Walmsley expects room nights (a key metric in the hospitality industry) growth to reaccelerate, driven by Airbnb's strategy to add hotels to its supply; book now, pay later expansion; and easier comparisons in the domestic market. "We see Airbnb's forthcoming AI product as a call option and see better prospects here than with other OTAs [online travel agents] given the product-focused leadership," said Walmsley. The five-star analyst contends that investors are underappreciating Airbnb's prospects and its potential to reaccelerate room nights growth. Walmsley believes that the company's strength will become more evident this year when it rolls out its hotel strategy in three test markets and expands into more cities, possibly in late 2026. The analyst also expects Airbnb's decision to add hotel inventory to broaden the company's addressable market beyond traditional short-term rentals. Walmsley also named social media giant Meta Platforms (META) as one of his top ideas in the internet space for 2026. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an "outperform" rating on META stock with a price target of $753. Walmsley expects META stock to rise from current levels, given that Wall Street's estimates have already priced in the company's high costs and capital spending. He expects upside in revenue and the company's progress on the AI front to reduce investors' fears about elevated spending. "We believe Meta shares work on positive revisions and multiple expansion as the company better demonstrates returns on its massive AI investment," Walmsley said. The analyst highlighted that his industry contacts indicated better advertising ROIs, or return on investment, on the platform. Moreover, Walmsley is optimistic about Meta Business AI and the monetization of WhatsApp. Also, he sees strength in AI/ML, or machine learning, engagement and ad targeting benefits to bolster revenue growth in 2026. Walmsley expects Meta Platforms to roll out improved quality for large language model and product capability, which he believes will quell investors' concerns about the company's high investments. The analyst is also encouraged by the company's cost management efforts and focus on optimizing Reality Labs expenses. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>European leaders have hit back at U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose fresh tariffs on them if they oppose his attempt to buy Greenland, describing the ultimatum as "completely wrong" and "unacceptable." Trump announced on Saturday that eight European allies would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb.1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal is not reached so Washington can "buy" the Arctic territory, which is semi-autonomous and part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Eight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs "until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland," Trump stated on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday. European leaders were quick to react to the latest threat with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer commenting Saturday that "applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong," while French President Emmanuel Macron described them as "unacceptable." "Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld," Macron stated on social media platform X on Saturday. Reuters quoted a source close to Macron as saying he was pushing for the activation of the Anti-Coercion Instrument, which could limit access to public tenders in the EU or restrict trade in services in which the U.S. has a surplus with the bloc. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President of the European Council Antonio Costa issued a statement Saturday in which they said the EU "stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland." It added that it was committed to further dialogue following talks between Denmark, Greenland and top U.S. officials last week, which ended without a diplomatic breakthrough. Nonetheless, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump's tariffs threat had come "as a surprise" following the "constructive meeting" with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The European Union has called an emergency meeting which will take place at 16:00 p.m. London time on Sunday, Reuters reported. Finnish President Alexander Stubb, who, like British PM Keir Starmer is known to have a good relationship with Donald Trump, called for cool heads and further talks. He warned further tariffs — which would come on top of the 15% tariff on EU exports to the U.S., and the 10% levied on U.K. exports -- would be damaging, however. We emphasize the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty. Tariffs would undermine the transatlantic relationship and risk a dangerous downward spiral." Trump's demands now threaten the EU-U.S. trade agreement struck in August. Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank said: "Trump wants to force Denmark and its European backers to sell Greenland to the U.S. by imposing tariffs. He estimated that an additional 10% levy on goods from affected countries could raise U.S. consumer prices by up to 0.15%. But "in the unlikely case" that the EU-U.S. trade deal is not implemented, "the damage to US consumers could then be almost three times as bad in the end," Schmieding told CNBC in a note. Denmark and its European neighbors have made repeated efforts to dissuade Trump from looking to acquire Greenland, particularly after the president said earlier this month that he would consider all options to obtain the mineral-rich island, including using military force. Trump says acquiring Greenland is critical for U.S. national security. He has also said that U.S. ownership would prevent Russia and China from gaining a foothold in the territory. Greenland itself has repeatedly rejected Trump's advances and while a majority of its population would like independence from Denmark, according to opinion polls, most Greenlanders would not like to become a part of the U.S., either. Protests were held in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, on Saturday, with demonstrators holding placards reiterating the position of the island's leadership, and that of Denmark, that "Greenland is not for sale."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Australia's social media ban for children under the age of 16 has grabbed global attention, and governments worldwide are considering implementing similar policies, with the U.K. seen as likely to be next. The Australian government's Online Safety Amendment Act came into effect on December 10, and included major social media platforms, including Reddit, X, Meta's Instagram, Alphabet's YouTube, Bytedance's TikTok. Although teenagers, tech giants, and experts have had mixed reactions since the ban came into force, governments globally are drafting bills to implement an Australia-style ban. "This is a global issue, and governments everywhere are under pressure to respond," Daisy Greenwell, co-founder of U.K.-based Smartphone Free Childhood, told CNBC. SFC is a grassroots campaign urging parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access. Other countries that are considering an under-16s social media ban include the U.K., France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Italy and Greece. The U.S. is trailing behind on this front with a national ban being unlikely, however there is certainly state and local interest, according to Ravi Iyer, a managing director of the University of Southern California Marshall School's Neely Center. "I'm more confident at the state level and I believe we will see a few U.S. states enact such a policy in the next couple years." But governments looking to implement such bans could face resistance from the tech giants. Following Australia's move, community-focused forum Reddit launched a lawsuit, arguing that the new law goes too far by restricting political discussion online. Facebook and Instagram owner Meta urged Canberra to reconsider the ban. And in a statement to users explaining how the restrictions work, Elon Musk's X said: "It's not our choice – it's what the Australian law requires." Meanwhile, calls for a social media ban for under-16s in the U.K. have grown rapidly at the beginning of this year. Greenwell's SFC launched an email campaign this week, which saw more than 100,000 emails sent to local U.K. lawmakers. "We consistently see that the more time children spend on smartphones and social media, the worse their mental health outcomes tend to be. If these platforms are no longer available, the network effects collapse – and young people can reconnect with each other and with the real world," Greenwell told CNBC. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has even backed the idea saying "we need to better protect children from social media" and that he's studying Australia's ban. "All options are on the table in relation to what further protections we can put in place - whether that's under-16s on social media or an issue I am very concerned about, under fives and screen time," Starmer said last week. "Children are turning up age four at reception [the first year of school] having spent far too much time on screens," he added. Meanwhile, U.K. health secretary Wes Streeting asked The Anxious Generation author Haidt to address his officials at an event to push for stricter limits on young people. France is also a strong contender as it debates two bills, one backed by French President Emmanuel Macron, to prevent social media access for under 15s, France24 reported last week. France's public health watchdog ANSES outlined that social media's negative effects are "numerous" and well documented. USC's Iyer said that if a teen ban becomes a global norm, it alleviates the pressure on young people to self-police. "One of the primary goals of the law is to change the norm, such that teens don't feel pressure to use social media because all their friends are doing so" Iyer said. "It's not really a realistic choice to abstain if you feel that all your friends are using a particular platform. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>
