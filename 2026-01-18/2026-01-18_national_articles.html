A 'Fox News Sunday' panel debates whether President Donald Trump's restrained tone on Iran signals caution or preparation as protests continue, the latest on the death toll and more. The World Economic Forum is facing calls to freeze out members of the Iranian regime from a summit in Davos this week. The Iran watchdog group United Against Nuclear Iran sent a letter to WEF President Borge Brende on Friday urging the group not to invite any officials from the Islamic Republic of Iran. WEF did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital. UANI CEO Mark Wallace, who previously served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, cited human rights group reports regarding the mass slaughter of Iranian civilians by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime. World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab speaks at the annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. "Just this month, the Iranian regime has carried out what some believe to be the largest massacre in its history," Wallace wrote to Brende. "Araghchi is a member of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which reportedly issued an order to use live fire on Iranian civilians protesting. Estimates suggest the regime killed at least 12,000 and up to 20,000 Iranians over the course of a few days in January as they exercised their fundamental rights to demonstrate against the Ayatollah and his tyranny." "Hosting Iranian regime officials, such as Araghchi, who whitewash this record is deeply offensive and would be wholly inappropriate to platform at a Forum whose theme this year is 'A Spirit of Dialogue.' Instead of dialogue, the Islamic Republic offered bullets to these brave Iranians," Wallace continued. People gather during a protest against the Iranian regime on Jan. 8, 2026, in Tehran. Iran's supreme leader publicly acknowledged for the first time Saturday that thousands of people were killed during recent anti-government protests, according to reporting from the BBC. Protesters burn images of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a rally held in solidarity with Iran's uprising in London Jan. 11, 2026. U.S.-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency estimates that more than 3,000 people were killed over roughly three weeks of unrest, though Iranian authorities have not released an official death toll and other estimates have been higher. Videos authenticated by BBC Persian and BBC Verify show Iranian security forces firing on demonstrators during the unrest. Trump told Politico on Saturday that "it's time to look for new leadership in Iran," after being read a series of hostile posts from Khamenei's X account accusing the president of responsibility for the violence. Iran protests death toll spiked in recent days as human rights groups say thousands of people have been killed. "Leadership is about respect, not fear and death."

Ilhan Omar described the Minneapolis protester shot by an ICE agent as 'peacefully waving cars to get by' as new videos emerge of the incident and tensions escalate. President Donald Trump lashed out at Minnesota Democrats on social media Sunday, saying they were using the ongoing federal operations to distract from the state's massive fraud issue. Trump made the statement on his Truth Social media platform, saying federal agents in Minneapolis and St. Paul were targeting "violent criminals." "ICE is removing some of the most violent criminals in the World from our Country, and bring them back home, where they belong. Do they really want murderers and drug dealers to be ensconced in their community? The thugs that are protesting include many highly paid professional agitators and anarchists. Trump went on to call out Gov. Tim Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., saying they "don't mind because it keeps the focus of attention off the 18 Billion Dollar, Plus, FRAUD, that has taken place in the State!" Tim Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar on Sunday. Federal prosecutors are investigating both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for allegedly impeding law enforcement efforts in the blue state. U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News the duo's anti-ICE rhetoric was teetering on a federal crime. "When the governor or the mayor threaten our officers, when the mayor suggests that he's encouraging citizens to call 911 when they see ICE officers, that is very close to a federal crime," Blanche said. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced that he would not be seeking reelection Monday January 5, 2026 at a press conference at the State Capitol in St.Paul, Minn. (Jerry Holt/The Minnesota Star Tribune via Getty Images) Bondi added on X, "A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law." "Two days ago, it was Elissa Slotkin. Before that, Mark Kelly," Walz wrote in an X post. "Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar speaks at a press conference with other members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus on funding for and efforts to reform the Department of Homeland Security. Frey also weighed in on social media, asserting he "will not be intimidated." "This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city," Frey wrote on X. My focus remains where it's always been: keeping our city safe. Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

More than half a dozen European countries warned in a joint statement on Sunday that tariff threats over Greenland undermine transatlantic relations as the White House seeks to pressure allies into a deal to acquire the Arctic island. The statement, issued by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, said the countries remain committed to strengthening Arctic security and are prepared to engage in dialogue grounded in respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. "Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. "We are committed to upholding our sovereignty." The statement comes after President Donald Trump threatened on his Truth Social platform to impose a 10% tariff on the eight countries unless a deal is reached for what he called the "complete and total purchase of Greenland." European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned Trump's post Saturday on social media. Kristersson wrote on X that allies would not be "blackmailed." "Only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland," he said, adding that other European Union (EU) countries were discussing a coordinated response. Young people carry placards reading "Greenland is not for sale!" during a large protest against President Donald Trump's proposal to acquire Greenland, near the U.S. Consulate in Nuuk, Greenland, on Jan. 17, 2026. Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, also voiced concern over Trump's remarks, warning that Russia and China were "having a field day" and stood to benefit from divisions within NATO. "If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO. "We also cannot let our dispute distract us from our core task of helping to end Russia's war against Ukraine." Trump has repeatedly said the United States needs Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory, for "national security" purposes. Greenland's natural resource wealth has also long-drawn strategic interest, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a January report, noting the territory is rich in iron ore, graphite, tungsten, palladium, vanadium, zinc, gold, uranium, copper and oil. Houses are seen in the village of Narsaq, Greenland, on June 24, 2009. Greenland's leaders, however, have firmly rejected any suggestion the territory's future or sovereignty is open to negotiation. Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Facebook Thursday that the territory is "not for sale" and will not be owned or governed by the U.S. "Greenland does not want to be a part of the United States," Nielsen argued.

A routine parking lot project at Dinosaur National Monument has unearthed dinosaur fossils at the site for the first time in more than a century. Park staff identified the remains on Sept. 16 and immediately halted construction to allow paleontologists to assess the find. Park officials said staff members, a Utah Conservation Corps crew, volunteers and construction workers helped excavate the remains. Dinosaur Monument staff work on excavated dinosaur fossils in the Quarry Exhibit Hall parking lot between September and October. The material is now being cleaned and studied at the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum in Vernal, where visitors can watch the preparation process in the museum's fossil lab. The site had not been excavated since 1924, when fossil removal efforts ended after a series of early 20th-century digs led by the Carnegie Museum, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and the University of Utah. Dinosaur National Monument was established in 1915. In this undated photo, a full-size model of a Diplodocus is seen in the Dinosaur Garden at the Natural History Museum in Vernal, Utah. The exhibit hall is the park's most popular attraction and sits atop the original Carnegie quarry, where visitors can view about 1,500 dinosaur fossils still embedded in rock. A Diplodocus skeleton looms over the fossil hall at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., on June 08, 2019. The species lived 152 million years ago. Following the excavation, crews completed the parking lot and road improvement project, which included new concrete and asphalt work and accessibility upgrades around the exhibit hall.

White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller explains how federal law applies regarding Minnesota and illegal immigration on 'My View with Lara Trump.' President Donald Trump's administration is preparing 1,500 troops for potential deployment to Minnesota, a senior U.S. official confirmed to Fox News. The official says the U.S. Army's 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska and specializes in cold-weather and mountain warfare, has given prepare to deploy orders. "The Department of War is always prepared to execute the orders of the Commander-in-Chief if called upon.," Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement to Fox News. Trump on Thursday threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy U.S. military forces to Minnesota if state officials do not start cracking down on anti-ICE agitators. President Donald Trump is reportedly weighing the deployment of 1,500 U.S. soldiers to Minnesota. "If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT," Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. Minneapolis and St. Paul are already hosting some 3,000 federal agents deployed there after a massive fraud scandal rocked the state late last year. Protesters across the Twin Cities have followed and harassed federal agents as they carry out operations, leading to confrontations and the killing of activist Renee Nicole Good by federal agents in the opening days of January. Aliya Rahman is detained by federal agents near the scene where Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by an ICE officer, on Tuesday, Jan. 13, 2026, in Minneapolis. Trump toned down the pressure in a statement on Friday, saying he did not see at that point a reason to invoke the Insurrection Act. "I believe it was Bush, the elder Bush, he used it, I think 28 times," Trump told reporters while departing the White House. The Insurrection Act reportedly has not been invoked since the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which began after four police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King. Despite Trump's threat, some Republicans are resistant to the idea of using the centuries-old law. Members of law enforcement work the scene following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good on Jan. 7, 2026, in Minneapolis. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., seemed to downplay Trump's threat, placing his hope in local law enforcement's ability to "settle things down." "Hopefully the local officials working with not only the federal law enforcement, ICE and other agencies, but also the local law enforcement officials, will be able to settle things down," Thune told reporters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Having troops on standby does not mean a deployment is imminent or guaranteed, the Trump administration source said. ABC News first reported the preparations for a possible deployment. Two battalions from the Alaska-based 11th Airborne Division are on prepare-to-deploy orders in Minnesota, according to a US defense official. It is unclear what tasks they would take on, though the official said it could include crowd control or support for law enforcement, similar to the role active-duty forces played in Los Angeles last summer. Military officials tell CNN they have options prepared for President Donald Trump. The Minnesota National Guard “are not deployed to city streets at this time, but are ready to help support public safety,” Minnesota's Department of Public Safety said in a social media post which included pictures of Guard members gathering bags of equipment alongside a row of trucks on a snowy road. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey responded to reports of the active-duty soldiers being placed on standby Sunday on CNN's State of the Union “This act was clearly designed to intimidate the people of Minneapolis,” Frey said, calling the administration's actions “ridiculous” and “completely unconstitutional.” “I never thought in a million years that we would be invaded by our own federal government,” Frey said. On the prospect of state National Guard and local police facing off against ICE agents and active-duty troops in Minneapolis, Frey said, “We can't have that in America.” Trump previously raised the prospect of invoking the Insurrection Act, a centuries-old law, which would allow the deployment of US troops to Minnesota – which Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche voiced support for on Sunday. On Saturday, crowds of bundled-up protesters faced tense standoffs with federal immigration officers and a confrontation between anti- and pro-ICE demonstrators near City Hall. Protests intensified after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, in her car earlier this month. Her killing has sparked protests across the country and fueled outrage at President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, which has seen armed and masked agents employing aggressive tactics in targeted campaigns across US cities. Demonstrators chanted and waved signs in downtown Minneapolis and outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building on Saturday despite brutally cold weather. Extra measures were put in place in downtown Minneapolis with blocked roads and at least one hotel bolstering security due to the protests. At the Whipple federal building, a large group of federal officers clad in riot gear moved toward protesters, who responded with chants of expletives and boos. Some protesters urged restraint, calling on the crowd to stay together. CNN observed several protesters detained by federal law enforcement near the building. Personnel from the Hennepin County Sheriff's Department were also present but told CNN in the evening they did not detain or arrest anyone at Saturday's protests. Sheriff's deputies' vehicles were used to block parts of the street from demonstrators and deputies appeared to mostly remain in their cars. Earlier in the day, conservative influencer Jake Lang led a small group supporting ICE in what was dubbed the “March Against Minnesota Fraud” near City Hall but was outnumbered and chased away by a much larger group of counter-demonstrators, CNN affiliate KARE reported. The Minneapolis Police Department told CNN Saturday evening they gave a dispersal order but made no arrests and the crowd “eventually dispersed without incident.” Lang, who recently announced plans to run for US Senate in Florida, is among the January 6 defendants granted clemency by President Trump. Minneapolis family, six children tear gassed after they were caught in clash between ICE and protesters Federal agents cannot arrest or detain peaceful protesters or deploy certain crowd-control measures against them, according to US District Judge Katherine Menendez's ruling. Menendez also said agents can no longer stop and detain drivers when there is “no reasonable articulable suspicion” they are forcibly obstructing or interfering with federal operations, noting, “The act of safely following” the officers “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop.” Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino issued a similar statement on X, alleging “agitators” in Minneapolis have assaulted and thrown objects at officers and rammed law enforcement vehicles. “We will continue enforcing the law, making arrests, and keeping Minneapolis safe. Unapologetic,” Bovino said, without specifically references the judge's ruling. Frey said Sunday he has not received a subpoena or any official notice about the investigation and is not aware of specific allegations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What was once a place of worship filled with precious objects packed with meaning now sits in heavy layers of dark soot, burdened by the pungent smell of smoke after someone set fire to Mississippi's largest and oldest synagogue. A baseball player and honor student: What we know about the teen who confessed to burning Mississippi's oldest synagogue Part of that hard work includes finding important religious artifacts, some dating back decades, that were damaged or destroyed in the alleged arson and trying to revive them or to retire them respectfully. On the outside of the Beth Israel synagogue, which serves some 150 families, boards cover windows that stretch nearly from floor to ceiling, and soot stains concrete. Inside, the fire's wrath spared nothing, marking nearly every surface with smoke residue. “First thing I did when I got here after the fire was remove our Torahs and wrapped them up and put them in my truck for safekeeping,” he said. The holy texts were moved to a church, Shemper said, where they've been unrolled to air out from the smoke. The Torahs will be stored until a master sofer – a highly skilled scribe qualified to repair Torahs – can evaluate and return them to kosher status, explained Sheila Hailey, the congregation's executive director. To be kosher, a Torah cannot have any damage and its letters must all be legible, Hailey said, adding it also must be on parchment sewn together and rolled onto wooden spindles. The fire ignited in the synagogue's library – where religious texts had filled wooden, built-in bookshelves highly susceptible to fire – and left extensive damage, Charles Felton, chief of investigations for the Jackson Fire Department's arson division said. Inside the Mississippi synagogue destroyed in alleged arson attack Jewish custom calls for holy texts to get a respectful burial, rather than simply being tossed out. So, after the temple is remediated, the prayer books and what's left of their pages will be collected, commemorated with a funeral and interred, Shemper said. Along a library wall, an ornate cabinet with glass doors known in Judaism as an Ark held two Torahs that were almost completely incinerated, he showed CNN this week. “As you can see by everything,” Shemper said, pausing, “it's totally destroyed.” I'm disgusted,” Shemper said as he surveyed the damage. “I've never had to deal with something like this. Also damaged was a decades-old sculpture of Moses, one of Judaism's greatest prophets who is often credited with receiving the Torah from God and writing it down. Repairing this holy space could take at least a year, until which several churches have opened their doors to Beth Israel, Shemper said. Amid the devastation, the synagogue's congregation is committed to maintaining Jewish community in Jackson and is ready to rebuild, Michele Schipper said, one of temple's past presidents. Digging through rubble, Shemper searched for a Jewish musical instrument called a “shofar” that's used on holy days like Rosh Hashanah. He knew the piece, made from an animal horn, had been on a nearby shelf. But after sifting through soot on the floor, Shemper could not find it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Taiwan national flag flutters near the Taipei 101 building at the National Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall in Taipei, Taiwan, May 7, 2023. TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A journalist in Taiwan was detained on allegations of bribing army officers to provide military information to people from mainland China, as the self-ruled island cracks down on potential infiltration from Beijing. Taiwan's Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office said in a statement that a district court ordered the detention of a television reporter and five current and retired military officers. Meanwhile, CTi TV separately said one of its reporters, Lin Chen-you, has been detained and that it wasn't aware of the case details, urging a fair judicial process. Prosecutors accuse Lin of paying amounts ranging from several thousand to tens of thousands of Taiwan dollars (tens to hundreds of U.S. dollars) to current military officers in exchange for their providing information to “Chinese individuals.” The office didn't specify who the Chinese people were or whether they were linked to the Chinese government. Authorities raided the premises of the reporter and nine current and retired military personnel on Friday as part of an investigation into violations of Taiwan's national security and corruption laws and disclosure of confidential information. CTi said that its offices were not raided. According to Lin's Facebook page, he is a political reporter and anchor covering the island's legislature.

While Taiwan regularly pursues espionage cases within the government and military, allegations against journalists are unusual. CTi News has been an online news outlet since Taiwan's National Communications Commission refused to renew its cable television license in 2020, citing repeated violations and increasing complaints. Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to take control of the island by force if necessary, has been increasing military pressure against the island. Last month, China's military launched large-scale drills around it for two days after a Washington announcement of large-scale arms sales to Taiwan. China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when the Communist Party rose to power in Beijing following a civil war.</p>

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen (17) leaves the field after an NFL divisional round playoff football game against the Denver Broncos, Saturday, Jan. 17, 2026, in Denver. DENVER (AP) — Josh Allen knows all about heartbreaking losses in the playoffs. After yet another one Saturday, he stood at a microphone and wiped away tears. He's heard that, too, and after he committed four of Buffalo's five turnovers in a 33-30 loss to Denver in the divisional round of the AFC playoffs, he had to answer questions about coming up short yet again. “Extremely difficult,” Allen said, while choking back tears. Only Bo Nix and the top-seeded but unproven Denver Broncos. Denver turned all those turnovers into 16 points, including the game-ending 23-yard field goal by Wil Lutz. He will watch as the Broncos move on to face either New England or Houston without Nix, who broke his right ankle late in overtime and will have surgery that will sideline him for the rest of the playoffs. Allen's eight playoff wins are most for any QB in the Super Bowl era who hasn't played in a Super Bowl. The thought could be dawning on Allen and Bills fans that it's no longer inevitable that he'll hoist a Lombardi Trophy someday. “I haven't been doing a lot of talking other than I love my teammates,” said Allen, who threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns while running for 66 yards. Bills coach Sean McDermott defended Allen, who lost a fumble on a scramble in the closing seconds of the first half to set up a long field goal by Denver to make it 20-10. Yeah, there are plays we all want back.” One of the plays that had McDermott miffed after the game occurred midway through overtime, when Allen's long pass to Brandin Cooks was wrestled away by Broncos cornerback Ja'Quan McMillian for an interception. McDermott thought Cooks had possession and down by contact. McDermott called timeout to get the officials to at least take a longer look at the play. “And if it is ruled that way, then why wasn't it slowed down, just to make sure that we have this right. That would've made a lot of sense to me. To make sure we have this thing right. What went on is not how it should go down.” Referee Carl Cheffers explained to a pool reporter: “The receiver has to complete the process of a catch. The defender gained possession of it at that point. After the pick, the Broncos drove the ball deep into Bills territory courtesy of a pair of pass-interference calls, one on Taron Johnson and another from Tre'Davious White, who also drew an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty. Those flags got the Broncos so close that Lutz's game-ending kick was a formality. “It's going to stick with me for a long time,” Allen said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>where Hamas militants are searching for the remains of hostages, Monday, Dec. 1, 2025. CAIRO (AP) — A dividing line, at times invisible, can mean life or death for Palestinians in Gaza. Those sheltering near the territory's “yellow line” that the Israeli military withdrew to as part of the October ceasefire say they live in fear as Israeli soldiers direct near-daily fire at anyone who crosses or even lingers near it. Among them were teenagers and young children, The Associated Press found. No one dares to get close” said Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Jahal, noting that the markers are less than 100 meters (110 yards) from his house — instead of the roughly 500 meters (546 yards) outlined in a map put out by the Israeli military. It said its troops are complying with the rules of engagement in order to counter militant groups, and are informing Palestinians of the line's location and marking it on the ground to “reduce friction and prevent misunderstandings.” Under the ceasefire, Israel withdrew its troops to a buffer zone that is up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) deep and includes most of Gaza's arable land, its elevated points and all of its border crossings. That hems more than 2 million Palestinians into a strip along the coastline and central Gaza. People of all ages, some already dead, have been showing up almost daily at the emergency room of Gaza City's Al-Ahli hospital with bullet wounds from straying near the line, said hospital director Fadel Naeem. He recounted picking his way through undamaged paths during a recent visit to the southern city of Khan Younis. According to a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military rules, troops issue audible warnings and then fire warning shots whenever someone crosses the line. Many civilians retreat when warning shots are fired, though some have been killed, the official acknowledged. Zaher Shamia, 17, lived with his grandfather in a tent 300 meters (330 yards) from the line in northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp. On Dec. 10, he was playing with his cousin and some friends near the line, according to video he took before his death. Suddenly, shots rang out and the video stopped. A neighbor eventually found Zaher's body, which had been crushed by the bulldozer, said Zaher's grandfather, Kamal al-Beih: “We only recognized him from his head.” Two doctors, Mohamed Abu Selmiya and Rami Mhanna, confirmed that the teen had been killed by gunshots and then run over by a bulldozer. Maram Atta said that on Dec. 7, her 3-year-old daughter, Ahed al-Bayouk, was playing with siblings outside of their tent, which was near the yellow line along Gaza's southern coast. Atta was preparing lentils when she heard aircraft overhead, then shots. A stray projectile whizzed close to her and struck Ahed, who was dead before they reached the clinic. “I lost my daughter to what they keep calling a ‘ceasefire'” said Atta, crying. Neither matches the line troops appear to be marking on the ground, according to Palestinians and geolocation specialists. Chris Osiek, an open source intelligence analyst and consultant, has geolocated a number of yellow blocks based on social media videos. He found at least four urban areas where troops set the blocks several hundred meters deeper into Gaza than the military map-specified yellow line. “This is basically what you get when you simply let Trump make an image and post it on Truth Social and let the IDF make their own,” he said, using the acronym for the military. “If it's not a proper system, with coordinates that make it easy for people to navigate where it is, then you leave the ambiguity free for the IDF to interpret the yellow line how they basically want.” But to Palestinians hemmed in by widespread destruction and displacement, every few meters lost is another house that can't be sheltered in — another they doubt will ever be returned. Almost all of the city of Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt, has been razed over the past year. Since November, troops have leveled a swath of Gaza City's Tuffah neighborhood extending some 300 meters (330 yards) outside the Israeli-held zone, according to Oct. 14 and Dec. 18 satellite photos provided by Planet Labs. Abu Jahal moved back to his damaged house in Tuffah at the ceasefire's start. He said he frequently saw new yellow barrels appear and the military forcing out anyone living on its side of the markers. On Jan. 7, Israeli fire hit a house near him, and the residents had to evacuate, he said. Abu Jahal said his family — including his wife, their child, and seven other relatives — may also have to leave soon. “The line is getting very close,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Baltimore Ravens head coach John Harbaugh speaks during a press conference after an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Sunday, Dec. 14, 2025, in Cincinnati. John Harbaugh agreed Saturday to become coach of the New York Giants, finalizing the big-market, longstanding franchise's all-out pursuit of its top candidate. Owners John Mara and Steve Tisch made the hire official less than 72 hours after a lengthy interview and dinner with Harbaugh that sealed the deal. The sides began working on a contract Wednesday night when it was clear Harbaugh was a fit and he canceled meetings with other teams. “I come from a football family, and I have deep respect for the history and tradition of this organization.” Schoen and the Giants pounced, bringing on a proven winner. Harbaugh was flown in on co-owner Steve Tisch's private plane earlier this week, spent several hours at the team facility in East Rutherford, New Jersey, spoke with young quarterback Jaxson Dart and got wined and dined at nearby Elia Mediterranean Restaurant. Todd Monken could follow him from Baltimore to be offensive coordinator, unless he takes a head-coaching gig in Cleveland or elsewhere. “Joe Schoen presented us an outstanding group of candidates, which allowed us to be deliberate and confident in this decision,” Mara said. The chance to work for stable ownership and Dart made New York an attractive landing spot over places such as Tennessee, Atlanta and Miami. “John is a proven winner whose teams are disciplined, resilient, and prepared,” Tisch said. “His passion for the game, his ability to connect with players, and his experience leading at the highest level made him an outstanding fit for us, and we're excited to move forward together.” The Giants have talented pieces in place on either side of the ball, including running back Cam Skattebo, receiver Malik Nabers and left tackle Andrew Thomas on offense, plus pass rushers Brian Burns and Abdul Carter and nose tackle Dexter Lawrence on defense. Counting playoff games, the seven coaches who followed 2007 and '11 Super Bowl champion Tom Coughlin have gone 45-105-1, a winning percentage of .300. He spent the previous 10 seasons as an assistant with Philadelphia, mostly as special teams coordinator and then defensive backs coach. Schoen, after finding out from Tisch and co-owner John Mara that he was returning for a fifth year as GM, said the search would not be limited to just offensive- or defensive-minded options. While Harbaugh comes from a special teams background, he provides the kind of all-around coaching Schoen was believed to be looking for, along with a championship pedigree and a reputation that should garner him immediate respect within the locker room. This is Schoen's second hire after bringing Brian Daboll with him from Buffalo, where both were assistants with the Bills, in January 2022. Mike Kafka coached out the string as the interim replacement after being promoted from offensive coordinator, and the team lost five in a row before winning its final two games to finish with a 4-13 record. Kafka interviewed but was never a serious candidate for the full-time job. Almost no one was compared with Harbaugh, giving the Giants an off-field win that might be their biggest of any kind in several years. “Throughout our conversations, John stood out for his clarity, competitiveness and approach for building a sustainable winning program,” Schoen said. “He has a strong track record of developing players, building cohesive staffs, and setting a clear standard of accountability.</p>
