            The Democratic Party has a deeply motivated base and a clear advantage on the generic congressional ballot ahead of this fall's midterms despite dismal impressions of its current leaders in Congress, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS.
    


            Democratic registered voters are far more motivated right now than Republicans. While the party has a 5-point edge on the generic ballot, among those who say they're deeply motivated to vote, that advantage expands to a massive 16 points.
    


            Democrats enter this year with a chance to capitalize on public dissatisfaction with President Donald Trump and the Republican-controlled government in Washington. CNN's poll found a majority of Americans consider the first year of Trump's second term to be a failure, with just 29% of independents approving of his job performance.
    


            The generic congressional ballot measures which of the two major parties voters would rather support in an upcoming election. While it does not capture how voters may ultimately respond to the candidates whose names appear in their district, the generic ballot can be an early indicator of which party holds the upper hand nationwide.
    


            In 2018, when Democrats won back the US House in Trump's first term, Democrats had a similar 5-point edge among registered voters at around the same point in the year. In 2022, when Republicans won a narrow majority during former President Joe Biden's administration, voters were about evenly split between the two parties.
    


            Approval for congressional Democratic leaders stands at just 28%, below the 35% figure for their Republican counterparts. Both figures are little changed from last April.
    


            Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, broad majorities say Democrats in Congress have done too little to oppose Trump and have been ineffective at resisting Republican policies they oppose. They see their party's caucus as falling particularly short compared with rank-and-file expectations for resisting Republican policies: Seventy-one percent say Democrats in Congress have been ineffective on that score, up 20 points from the 51% who expected a less than effective effort last January when the current Congress convened.
    


            Extremely motivated Democratic-aligned voters are more likely than those who are less motivated to say Democrats in Congress aren't doing enough to oppose Trump and aren't effectively opposing Republican policies. They're also more likely to say they don't feel represented at all by the government in Washington. That discontent with the party's efforts could affect how primary challenges to sitting members of Congress play out in the coming months.
    


            As in other recent election cycles, the overall public mood at the start of 2026 remains generally bleak. Most call the economy poor. Among the group that feels that way, which tilts Democratic, “a change in political leadership” is as popular a remedy as bringing down inflation.
    


            Roughly three-quarters of Republicans approve of the GOP's congressional leaders, while just 48% of Democrats approve of their party's leaders in Congress. Among independents, the two sets of party leaders are viewed about equally badly, with roughly three-quarters disapproving of each side.
    


            The public is broadly split over whether the country would be better off or worse off if Democrats won control of Congress this November. Republicans largely consolidate around saying worse off (84%), with Democrats slightly less likely to say the country would be better off (79%). Independents tilt toward the positive, 35% better off compared with 27% worse off, but a sizable 37% say a change in control would make no difference.
    


            This tepid sentiment doesn't hurt Democrats on generic ballot preferences, though, as many of those who aren't convinced that Democratic control of Congress will make a difference are willing to gamble on a change regardless: Registered voters in this group favor the Democrats over the Republicans on the generic ballot by a roughly 2-to-1 margin.
    


            A 61% majority of Americans say Republicans in Congress have been at least somewhat effective in passing new laws, lower than the 76% who expected them to be effective at doing so a year ago, when they took full control of the federal government for the first time in six years.
    


            While about half of the public overall says congressional Republicans are too supportive of Trump, and a similar share that Trump has been bad for the Republican Party, those sentiments aren't shared within the GOP.
    


            A 56% majority of Republican-aligned adults say the GOP caucus is doing the right amount to support Trump, with 33% saying they aren't supportive enough, and just 11% that they're too supportive. Even amid recent high-profile pushback on Trump from some Republicans, the share of the party's base that sees the caucus as insufficiently supportive has risen by 9 points since last February.
    


            Two-thirds of GOP-aligned adults say Trump has had a good effect on the Republican Party, with just 15% saying he's had a bad effect on the GOP. Among Republicans and Republican-leaners, 9 in 10 self-identified members of the “Make America Great Again” movement say Trump has had a good effect on the party, with just 1% seeing his influence as a negative. Among the rest of the party, that margin is smaller, but the 51% who say he's had a good effect still roughly doubles the 25% who see him as a negative influence.

  The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS online and by phone from January 9-12 among a random national sample of 1,209 adults, including 968 registered voters. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points; it is 3.5 points among registered voters.

Live Updates


• Greenland tensions: European nations warned that President Donald Trump's threat to hit his allies with tariffs unless a deal is reached for the US purchase of Greenland risks a “dangerous downward spiral.” Separately, NATO chief Mark Rutte said he spoke today with Trump about the “security situation in Greenland and the Arctic.”
    


• ICE in Minnesota: Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back on the Trump administration's escalation of federal law enforcement after more than 1,500 active-duty soldiers were told to prepare for possible deployment. “This act was clearly designed to intimidate the people of Minneapolis,” he told CNN.
    


            • Iran unrest: Trump called for new leadership in Iran yesterday following comments from Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blaming the US president for the killing of thousands of protesters.
    


            Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is widely expected to make a run for the presidency in 2028, said today President Donald Trump's moves to bring surges of federal agents into cities, and his threat to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota, undermines trust in local police.
    


            “I think what the president has done with his rhetoric about invoking the Insurrection Act, with sending (Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents) into a community where the mayor and the governor have specifically requested they not be there, ends up undermining the trust that exists between a community and law enforcement,” Shapiro told Fox News.
    


            Protests erupted in Minneapolis after the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, and Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, which gives a president extraordinary powers to dispatch the military, to quell demonstrations.
    


            “I think what is critically important now is to bring down the temperature and bring up the level of trust, and I frankly think the president's actions have made it harder to find that level of trust between the community and law enforcement,” Shapiro said Sunday.
    


            When asked whether Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has “raised the temperature” by speaking out against a surge of ICE agents in his state, Shapiro said he “can't opine as to how others are doing it in their states,” but added, “in Pennsylvania, we respect law enforcement.”
    


CNN's Kaitlan Collins and Samantha Waldenberg contributed to this report.



            NATO chief Mark Rutte said a short while ago that he has spoken to US President Donald Trump about Greenland.
    


                    “Spoke with @POTUS regarding the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic,” Rutte wrote in a post on X. “We will continue working on this, and I look forward to seeing him in Davos later this week.”
                





Some context: Several NATO member states have suggested that Trump's pursuit of owning Greenland threatens the entire NATO alliance.
    


            Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in an interview published today that if the US were to use force to acquire the Arctic island, “it would be the death knell for NATO.”



            Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said today that internal review procedures are being followed over the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who fatally shot Renee Good in Minnesota.
    


            “I would not listen to Gov. (Tim) Walz, he has a very bad track record,” Noem said when asked on CBS' “Face the Nation” about whether the agent had been placed on administrative leave or was being investigated, after the Minnesota governor claimed that the federal agent was the only person not under review.
    


                    “The protocol, and the advice and the guidance within that handbook and within our policies is being followed exactly like it has been for years,” Noem said.
                





            CNN reported earlier that the Department of Homeland Security has opened an internal investigation into whether the agent followed department procedures.
    


            “Every law enforcement officer knows that when they take the oath to step up and to protect the public and put their lives on the line. They absolutely know that everything that they do will be analyzed and investigated,” she added.
    


            Noem then accused Democrats of unfairly targeting law enforcement officers pointing to what she described as criminal activity in Minneapolis she said has been allowed to continue.
    


            Asked whether ICE agents are adequately trained for what the administration has described as dangerous conditions in the state, Noem said:
    


                    “They are absolutely trained for the situations that they're put in. We would never put an officer in a situation that they would be beyond their training and skill set. And so, these are highly trained individuals.”
                





            Federal agents and officers have shifted their tactics in response to recent clashes during demonstrations, Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons said today.
    


            Asked by host of “Fox News Sunday” Maria Bartiromo if he believes the attacks on ICE agents “have changed the way agents are doing their job,” Lyons responded, “You're right in the fact that it does change the mindset of the men and women of ICE.”
    


            He said that's why the agency has to provide agents with “so much support.”
    


                    “You hear about the 3,000 federal officers and special agents that deployed to Minneapolis. Majority of those, if not most, are to protect the men and women that are out there trying to make those arrests. And that has definitely changed our tactics, where we would go and have five to six officers on an arrest team, now you have to go with 10 to 15 just to protect those individuals that are trying to arrest the bad guy,” Lyons said.
                





            He went on to say, “In my 30 years of law enforcement, I never thought we would have to send law enforcement to protect law enforcement.”
    


            Lyons said he believes that if political leaders allowed local and state law enforcement to work with ICE, there might be fewer problems.
    


            Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, today said he supports US military action in Iran, but only after all non-military steps against Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have been exhausted.
    


            “I think the US should be taking every step possible to end this regime,” Cruz said on Fox News' “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo.”
    


            He said the US has a number of steps it can take before resorting to military force, and urged more measures to support mass protests on the ground in Iran.
    


            “I hope and believe that America is doing everything we can to support the protesters. There are lots of steps we can and should be taking short of a bombing strike,” Cruz said.
    


            President Donald Trump yesterday called for “new leadership” in Iran after Khamenei labeled him a “criminal” and cast blame on Trump's support of protesters for fueling the recent anti-government protests. Khamenei said Trump had “openly encouraged” the unrest by promising support from the US military.
    


            Cruz pointed to Trump's call for new leadership as an important step, saying it marked a shift.
    


            “In the last two days a really important step occurred where President Trump came out unequivocally and said it is time for new leadership in Iran,” Cruz said, describing that development as “massively important.”
    


            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed back on the Trump administration's escalation of federal law enforcement in his city Sunday morning, after more than 1,500 active-duty soldiers were told to prepare for possible deployment to Minnesota.
    


            “This act was clearly designed to intimidate the people of Minneapolis,” Frey said on CNN's State of the Union, calling the administration's actions  “ridiculous” and “completely unconstitutional.”
    


                    “I never thought in a million years that we would be invaded by our own federal government,” Frey said.
                





            Minnesota officials have also mobilized the National Guard amid a surge in immigration enforcement and ongoing protests around Minneapolis.
    


            On the prospect of state National Guard and local police facing off against ICE agents and active duty troops in Minneapolis, Frey said, “We can't have that in America.”
    


            Calm will be restored to Minneapolis once the ICE agents are gone, and the city can get back to daily life, Frey said.
    


            In reaction, the White House Rapid Response account wrote, “The Trump administration is not going to surrender to the Radical Left and let Minneapolis “get back to” rampant fraud, theft, and sanctuary for criminals.”
    


            The Department of Justice is investigating Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz over possible obstruction of federal law enforcement, according to sources familiar with the matter.
    


            Frey said Sunday he has not received a subpoena or any official notice about the investigation and is not aware of specific allegations.
    


            Asked whether he would comply with the Department of Justice's demands if a subpoena was issued, Frey told ABC News, “We have done nothing wrong, so of course we will comply in it, but at the same time, we need to be understanding how wild this is.”
    


            Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine and Republican Sen. Rand Paul are exploring options to rein in President Donald Trump's efforts to annex Greenland, after their resolution seeking to limit Trump's unilateral military actions in Venezuela failed last week.
    


            Appearing jointly with Paul on NBC's “Meet the Press” today, Kaine said the pair are considering three options: writing a new war powers resolution regarding Greenland, challenging the president's move yesterday to announce new tariffs on European countries who don't embrace the US taking control of Greenland and relying on a law stating the president can't withdraw from NATO without congressional approval.
    


            Kaine added that Trump's rhetoric on Greenland is “not helpful” because it's “pushing allies away from us, rather than forging the stronger relationships with allies that we need.”
    


            The question of the boundaries of the president's authority – and Congress' role in authorizing military action abroad – roiled Capitol Hill in recent months, as the Trump administration escalated its military campaign in South America. It culminated in Senate Republicans blocking a war powers resolution to curb the Trump administration's moves in Venezuela.
    


            Paul, the Republican backer of the effort to pass a war powers resolution on Venezuela, said he doesn't believe the president would garner enough Republican support to vote for any military action in Greenland, if he sought it.
    


            “I've heard of no Republican support for that, even though most hawkish members of our caucus have said they won't support that,” Paul said. “So, I think it's going to be very difficult. I think he keeps rattling the cage saying that.”
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Europe will “understand” America's proposed takeover of Greenland as part of a broad defense against China and Russia gaining a greater foothold over the Arctic.
    


            “I believe the Europeans will understand that the best outcome is for the US to maintain or receive control of Greenland,” Bessent said today on NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            Bessent described Greenland as “essential” to national security, while noting the importance of building of a “Golden Dome,” an ambitious missile defense shield proposed by the Trump administration. He also noted that President Donald Trump “is looking beyond next year to what could happen for a battle in the Arctic … America has to be in control here.”
    


                    “Make (Greenland) part of the United States. And there will not be a conflict because the United States right now: we're the hottest country in the world, we're the strongest country in the world. Europeans project weakness; the US projects strength,” said Bessent.
                





            On Saturday, Trump announced new 10% tariffs on eight European countries — Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom — until “a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.”
    


            “The European leaders will come around, and they will understand they need to be under the US security umbrella,” Bessent said when asked about if Greenland or NATO are more important to national security.
    


            A top Trump administration official voiced support for President Donald Trump's potential use of the Insurrection Act as the Pentagon has ordered approximately 1,500 active duty soldiers to prepare for a potential deployment to Minnesota.
    


                    “President Trump has promised to keep the American people safe, and the fact that the local law enforcement, because their leadership is not doing their jobs, there may come a time when the president has to order that,” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on “Fox News Sunday.”
                





            After a federal judge ruled Friday that immigration agents can't deploy certain crowd control measures against peaceful protesters, Blanche said the administration is “still looking at whether to appeal what the judge did,” reiterating support for ICE tactics and claiming that protesters on the ground have not been peaceful.
    


            Demonstrations observed by CNN on Saturday have been largely peaceful.
    


            Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney backed Greenland's sovereignty and reaffirmed his commitment to NATO's responsibility for security in Greenland in the face of escalating demands from the Trump administration.
    


                    “It's a serious situation and we're concerned, we're concerned about this escalation. To be absolutely clear we always will support sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries wherever their geographic location,” said Carney during a press briefing in Doha, Qatar, on Sunday.
                





            He added that the security of both Greenland and Denmark falls within the responsibilities of NATO and that Canada would work with NATO allies to further enhance Arctic security.
    


            When asked what he will say to US President Donald Trump about Greenland when they meet in the coming days at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Carney replied, “everything I just said.”
    


            Canada and Greenland share one of the longest maritime borders in the world and cooperate on indigenous issues across the Arctic. Despite unprecedented trade disputes between the US and Canada, Carney has developed a working relationship with Trump and the two often call and text.
    


            Carney also confirmed that he will be joining the Trump administration's Board of Peace for Gaza, but said the details of the board, including financial ones, were yet to be worked out.
    


                    “I will do what I can do, we will do, as Canada, what we can do to achieve those for humanitarian objectives. With respect to the specifics of the Board of Peace we haven't even gone through, we haven't gone through all the details of the structure how it's going to work what financing,” said Carney, responding to Trump's claims that each participating nation would be asked to contribute $1 billion.
                





            Former Vice President Mike Pence said today he doesn't support Delcy Rodríguez as the leader of Venezuela, framing her as “not the right leader for Venezuela going forward,” even as he backed broader US goals in the Latin American country.
    


            “I'm grateful that president Trump unleashed our elite armed forces, Delta Forces, to take Maduro down to bring him to the United States to face justice,” Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
    


            “I think that was a historic and an important step forward towards restoring freedom in that country. But what comes after is just as important,” he said. “I want to say, Delcy Rodríguez is not the right leader for Venezuela going forward.”
    


            Pence acknowledged that a transition period may be necessary but said the US should swiftly work to restore democratic norms in the country.
    


            “I think it should be the objective of the United States to move forward as quickly as possible to restore basic liberties, to restore free-market principles. Do that through free and fair elections,” Pence said. “And I have no doubt in my mind whether it's María (Corina) Machado, or someone else, that the people of Venezuela will choose freedom.”
    


            As millions of Venezuelans wait to see what will become of their economically and politically ravaged country, two female leaders remain at the center of the debate over the nation's future and the United States' role in shaping it.
    


            Trump has shown support for Rodríguez, a longtime regime insider, over opposition leader Machado, who met with the president last week and gifted him her Nobel Peace Prize medal.
    


            Arizona Sen. Ruben Gallego joined fellow Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy in calling for the restriction of ICE funding until the agency is reformed.
    


            “We cannot vote for anything that actually adds more money and doesn't constrain ICE,” Gallego told CNN's Jake Tapper on State of the Union.
    


            Gallego said the agency needs to be “torn down” and rebuilt into a security force focused on deporting criminals rather than “suppressing US citizens, racially profiling in all parts of our country, bringing violence to, you know, to areas you don't need.”
    


            Gallego stopped short of saying he would help shut down the whole government over ICE but did say he would be willing to shut down “the portion of ICE that is causing this kind of harm, racially profiling people, terrorizing our cities. I know the implications of that. I know the political implications potentially of that, but we cannot keep funding this, you know, type of goon squads.”
    


            President Donald Trump last night urged Louisiana Rep. Julia Letlow to enter the Republican primary in Louisiana for Senate this year, saying she would have his “complete and total endorsement” if she were to run in a race that would pit her against incumbent Sen. Bill Cassidy.
    


                    “I am hearing that Julia is considering launching her Campaign for the United States Senate in Louisiana,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I know Julia well, have seen her tested at the highest and most difficult levels, and she is a TOTAL WINNER! A Proud Mother of two children, Julia is a wonderful person, has ALWAYS delivered for Louisiana, and would continue doing so in the United States Senate.”
                





            The endorsement is in line with Trump's broader moves to seek challenges against Republican senators who signal any opposition to the his agenda.
    


            Cassidy voted to convict Trump of incitement of insurrection after January 6, 2021, and has at times been a thorn in the president's side, despite walking a political tightrope to keep the president from endorsing any of his primary opponents. He has been careful to not directly criticize the president or Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, despite expressing concern at some CDC and HHS actions.
    


            Trump's endorsement comes amid speculation that Letlow is considering challenging Cassidy. She has not confirmed whether she will run, but reposted Trump's message on X later in the evening, saying she is “honored” by the endorsement and emphasizing her focus on “conservative leadership that will not waver” for Louisiana.
    


            Cassidy, in a statement to CNN's Jake Tapper today, said, “I'm proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana. I am confident I will win if Congresswoman Letlow decides to run.”
    


            Former US Vice President Mike Pence said today that he supports the United States purchasing Greenland, but raised concerns about the way President Donald Trump is pursuing that goal.
    


                    “I think it's a question right now, Jake, not of what the president is trying to accomplish, but how?” Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
                





            Pence said he is troubled by Trump's pressure of European allies, adding: “and I have concerns about using what I think is a questionable constitutional authority, imposing unilateral tariffs on NATO allies to achieve this objective.”
    


            At the same time, the former vice president made clear he supports the underlying aim.
    


                    “I think is absolutely in the interest of the United States of America,” Pence said, noting that “it was Abraham Lincoln's secretary of state who negotiated the purchase of Alaska, who first suggested that the United States also purchased Greenland.”
                





            Pence suggested the administration consider other steps, including a US investment and a greater military presence.
    


                    “I think one of the things that the administration could do is simply deploy forces into the region, because the threat that we are faced with continued arctic incursions by China and Russia is real,” Pence said.
                





            We've just seen a joint statement from the eight European countries threatened with fresh tariffs by President Donald Trump unless a deal is reached for the US purchase of Greenland.
    


            Here's how they responded in the hours after Trump issued his threat yesterday.
    


This post has been updated to include reaction from German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. CNN's Michael Rios, James Frater, Benjamin Brown and Inke Kappeler contributed to this reporting.



            Germany's role in a multinational European reconnaissance mission in Greenland — part of a broader effort by NATO — has concluded as planned, the country's Ministry of Defense (MoD) said Sunday.
    


            Soldiers from Germany who were sent to the Arctic island amid threats by US President Donald Trump to annex the territory were able to gather “important insights,” a statement from the ministry said.
    


            Based on the findings, potential measures to strengthen security in the Arctic region will now be “coordinated” with Germany's partners within the military alliance, it added.
    


For context: Several European NATO allies deployed small numbers of military personnel to Greenland earlier this week to participate in joint exercises with Denmark and explore opportunities for future cooperation.
    


Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated the progress of the European reconnaissance mission in Greenland .



            We're hearing more reaction to US President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on eight European countries unless a deal is reached allowing the US to purchase Greenland.
    


            Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has had positive relations with the president, has called the move a “mistake” that she doesn't agree with.
    


                    “I wanted to say that the prediction of an increase in tariffs against those nations that choose to contribute to the security of Greenland is, in my opinion, a mistake and obviously I don't agree with it,” Meloni said in a video posted to social media today.
                





            Meloni said that she had spoken to Trump a few hours before talking to reporters, adding that she “told (Trump) what I think” about the matter.
    


                    “I believe a meeting has been called at core level for now for the European Union, but I believe that at this stage it is very important to talk to each other and that it is very important to avoid an escalation, because we can work together to achieve an objective that is useful and necessary for everyone,” she said.
                





            “The right path is not to discuss among ourselves but to work together to respond to a concern that involves us all,” Meloni told reporters.
    


            The eight European countries threatened with fresh tariffs by President Donald Trump have just released a joint statement warning of a “dangerous downward spiral” if this action goes ahead.
    


                    “Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral,” Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in the statement.
                





            The countries Trump threatened all participated in joint exercises in Greenland in the last few days, something Trump called a “very dangerous situation.”



            “As members of NATO, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise ‘Arctic Endurance' conducted with Allies, responds to this necessity. It poses no threat to anyone,” the European statement said.
    


                    “We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,” the statement added.
                





            The countries “will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,” they said. “We are committed to upholding our sovereignty.”
    


            Aside from President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs against several European allies unless a deal is reached for the US purchase of Greenland, there have been a number of foreign policy developments in the last week.
    


Here's a roundup of these developments and more:



CNN's Aleena Fayaz, Hira Humayun, Ben Wedeman, Kevin Liptak, Paula Newton, Sharon Braithwaite and Alejandra Jaramillo contributed reporting. 



            The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers to prepare for deployment to Minnesota, a Trump administration source told CNN, as Minnesota officials have also mobilized the National Guard.
    


            The source cautioned having troops on standby doesn't mean any deployment is imminent or even going to happen at all.
    


            Military officials tell CNN it has options prepared for President Donald Trump.
    


            “The Department of War is always prepared to execute the orders of the Commander-in-Chief if called upon,” Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement.
    


            The Minnesota National Guard “are not deployed to city streets at this time, but are ready to help support public safety,” Minnesota's Department of Public Safety said in a social media post that included pictures of Guard members gathering bags of equipment alongside a row of trucks on a snowy road.
    


            The National Guard is “staged and ready to respond,” Minnesota National Guard spokesperson Army Maj. Andrea Tsuchiya said in a statement to CNN, noting the troops will help provide “traffic support to protect life, preserve property, and support the rights of all Minnesotans to assemble peacefully.”

MOSCOW, January 18. /TASS/. Ukrainian forces lost around 1,210 personnel in the special military operation zone over the past 24 hours, the Russian Defense Ministry reported.

According to the ministry, Ukrainian troops lost more than 175 servicemen in the area of responsibility of Russia's North battlegroup, and up to 200 servicemen in the area of responsibility of West battlegroup, more than 135 and more than 455 servicemen as a result of the actions of the South and Center battlegroups, respectively. Ukrainian forces also lost more than 205 soldiers in the East battlegroup's area of responsibility and up to 40 troops in the area of the Dnepr battlegroup.

Russian forces also carried out strikes on facilities assembling unmanned aerial vehicles, as well as on energy and transport sites operating in the interests of the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

""Operational-tactical aviation, strike unmanned aerial vehicles, missile forces, and artillery units of the Russian Armed Forces hit facilities assembling long-range unmanned aerial vehicles, energy and transport infrastructure used in the interests of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as well as temporary deployment points of Ukrainian armed formations and foreign mercenaries in 149 areas,"" the Russian Defense Ministry reported.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

MOSCOW, January 18. /TASS/. Moscow and Washington have not halted negotiations on Ukraine following an attack on the state residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, head of the Other Ukraine movement and ex-leader of the banned Opposition Platform - for Life party Viktor Medvedchuk said in an interview with TASS.

""As far as I know, negotiations on Ukraine have not been officially suspended, while talks between Russia and [Vladimir] Zelensky's Ukraine, in essence, never even began. The attack on the state residence of Russian President Vladimir Putin shows that official Kiev does not want peace and is trying at any cost to derail the peace process,"" he said.

On January 15, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that dialogue with US negotiators is ongoing.

As Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reported earlier, Kiev carried out an attack using 91 unmanned aerial vehicles on Putin's state residence in the Novgorod Region on the night of December 29, 2025. All of the drones were destroyed. According to the minister, there were no reports of casualties or damage caused by falling UAV debris.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Jake Lang's anti-Islam, anti-Somali and pro-ICE rally near City Hall outnumbered by hundreds of counterprotesters 

Hundreds of counterprotesters on Saturday drowned out a far-right activist's attempt to hold a small rally in support of the Trump administration's latest immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.

Conservative influencer Jake Lang organized an anti-Islam, anti-Somali and pro-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstration, saying on social media beforehand that he intended to “burn a Quran” on the steps of City Hall. But it was not clear if he carried out that plan.

Only a small number of people showed up for Lang's demonstration while hundreds of counterprotesters converged at the site, yelling over his attempts to speak and chasing the pro-ICE group away. They forced at least one person to take off a shirt they deemed objectionable.

Lang appeared to be injured as he left the scene, with bruises and scrapes on his head.

Lang was previously charged with assaulting an officer with a baseball bat, civil disorder and other crimes before receiving clemency as part of Donald Trump's sweeping act of clemency at the beginning of his second presidency for January 6 Capitol attackers. Lang later announced that he was running for the US Senate in Florida.

In Minneapolis, snowballs and water balloons were also thrown before an armored police van and heavily equipped city police arrived.

Meanwhile, Minnesota's national guard said in a statement that it had been “mobilized” by Democratic governor Tim Walz to support the state patrol “to assist in providing traffic support to protect life, preserve property, and support the rights of all Minnesotans to assemble peacefully”.

Maj Andrea Tsuchiya, a spokesperson for the guard, said it was “staged and ready” but yet to be deployed.

The announcement came more than a week after Walz, a frequent critic and target of Trump, told the guard to be ready to support law enforcement in the state.

There have been protests every day since the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) ramped up immigration enforcement in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St Paul by bringing in more than 2,000 federal officers in early January.

During the daily protests, demonstrators have railed against masked immigration officers pulling people from homes and cars and other aggressive tactics. The operation in the deeply liberal Twin Cities has claimed at least one life: Renee Good, a US citizen and mother of three, was shot by an ICE officer during a 7 January confrontation.

“We're out here to show Nazis and ICE and DHS and [Trump's Make America great again movement] you are not welcome in Minneapolis,” protester Luke Rimington said. “Stay out of our city, stay out of our state. Go home.”

Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey echoed that sentiment Sunday on CNN's State of the Union, saying: “I never thought in a million years that we would be invaded by our own government.”

On Friday, a federal judge ruled that immigration officers cannot detain or teargas peaceful protesters who are not obstructing authorities, including while observing officers during the Minnesota crackdown.

During a news conference on Saturday, a man who fled civil war in Liberia as a child said he had been afraid to leave his Minneapolis home since being released from an immigration detention center following his arrest last weekend.

Video of federal officers breaking down Garrison Gibson's front door with a battering ram on 11 January has become another rallying point for protesters who oppose the crackdown.

Gibson, 38, was ordered to be deported, apparently because of a 2008 drug conviction that was later dismissed. He has remained in the country legally under what's known as an order of supervision. After his recent arrest, a judge ruled that federal officials did not give him enough notice that his supervision status had been revoked.

Then Gibson was taken back into custody for several hours Friday when he made a routine check-in with immigration officials. Gibson's cousin Abena Abraham said ICE officials told her White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller ordered the second arrest.

The White House denied the account of the re-arrest and that Miller had anything to do with it.

Gibson was flown to a Texas immigration detention facility but returned home following the judge's ruling. His family used a dumbbell to keep their damaged front door closed amid subfreezing temperatures before spending $700 to fix it.

“I don't leave the house,” Gibson said at a news conference.

The DHS said an “activist judge” was again trying to stop the deportation of “criminal illegal aliens”.

“We will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country,” Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant homeland security secretary, said.

Gibson said he has done everything he was supposed to do: “If I was a violent person, I would not have been out these past 17 years, checking in.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Korey LaVergne, 37, jailed Friday evening on three counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile, according to officials

Authorities in south-west Louisiana recently arrested a Roman Catholic priest on accusations of behaving indecently with a child, igniting a new scandal in the diocese where the US church's reckoning with clergy abuse began – an institution that just disclosed it could lose up to $162m over pending litigation.

Korey LaVergne was jailed Friday evening on three counts of indecent behavior with a juvenile, according to Acadia parish sheriff KP Gibson, whose agency arrested the priest. LaVergne had presided over mass at St Edward church in Richard – where the Lafayette diocese had assigned him as pastor – hours before he was booked into the Acadia lockup.

Records showed LaVergne made bail in the amount of $15,000 less than 90 minutes after he was jailed to secure his release from custody pending the outcome of the case.

Details about the allegations against LaVergne weren't immediately available, with Gibson saying on Saturday that his office intended to issue a news release later “as the investigation allows”. A spokesperson for the Lafayette diocese said LaVergne's arrest occurred after a report of “possible misconduct by [the] cleric” but didn't elaborate.

“The diocese will continue to assist law enforcement and requests prayers for all who are involved,” the church statement said.

LaVergne, 37, had previously served as the Lafayette diocese's official courier. In that role, he had drawn news headlines for bringing thousands of pages of documents to the Vatican outlining the cause for sainthood for Charlene Richard, who died from acute lymphatic leukemia at age 12 in 1959 and became known for offering her suffering up to God as well as others.

Richard, nicknamed the Little Cajun Saint, is buried at St Edward.

LaVergne's arrest comes at a relatively fragile time for the Lafayette diocese, which was founded in 1918 and tends to a congregation of about 150,000 Catholics.

In a financial report posted in November, the diocese disclosed its “total range of potential loss on [pending litigation] claims with a reasonably possible likelihood of unfavorable outcome is $88,187,500 to $162,450,000”. That range derived from an estimate conducted by its legal counsel, which had “reviewed the lawsuits in order to evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome”, the diocese's 39-page report said.

A Lafayette diocese priest named Gilbert Gauthe effectively brought the decades-old, worldwide Catholic clergy abuse crisis to the US by pleading guilty in 1985 to molesting several boys. He served 10 years in prison, now lives in Texas, and has continued to be named in lawsuits from victims who are seeking damages over their abuse at his hands.

The Lafayette diocese subsequently sought to strike down a law passed by Louisiana's state legislature in 2021 that enabled survivors of long-ago sexual molestation to pursue civil damages in court. But the state's supreme court upheld the law as constitutional in June 2024 despite the Lafayette diocese's arguments to the contrary.

Elsewhere in Louisiana, about 135 miles (217km) east of Lafayette, the Catholic archdiocese of New Orleans agreed in December to pay about $305m to roughly 600 survivors of clergy molestation.

The New Orleans archdiocese took that step more than five years after filing for federal bankruptcy protection as it tried to limit the financial fallout of its involvement in the global church's clergy abuse scandal.

News of LaVergne's arrest prompted a statement from the executive director of TentMakers of Louisiana, a non-profit group dedicated to supporting Catholic clergy sex abuse survivors.

“This arrest is heartbreaking – not because it is shocking, but because it confirms that child sexual abuse in the church is still happening,” said the statement from Letitia Peyton, whose son was molested by a Lafayette Catholic priest in a case that later sent the cleric to prison. “Accountability must be immediate, transparent and enforced – anything less allows harm to continue.”

Generally, under Louisiana law, indecent behavior with a juvenile can carry up to seven years in prison.

The state defines the crime as “any lewd or lascivious act … in the presence of any child under the age of 17”. Messages – including texts – and actions alleged to be grooming can constitute the offense, according to Louisiana's law.

Attempts to contact LaVergne weren't immediately successful. He was ordained into the priesthood in 2018, a biography on the St Edward church's website said. The biography said he had been appointed the pastor of St Edward in July 2021.

Online video of the mass LaVergne presided over shortly before his arrest showed him welcoming visiting students of an elementary Catholic school from nearby Crowley, Louisiana.

“You're always welcome here to the home of the Little Cajun Saint, and we're happy that you've come to hear her story and to learn more about the life … that she led,” LaVergne could be seen saying on the video of the service.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:theguardian.com","JD Vance: ‘despicable toady for Trump'","https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/18/jd-vance-profile-trump-presidency","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:13:00 GMT","

Vice-president has emerged as key defender of Maga flame – and is backed by big tech billions. Is this the heir apparent?

“We did not have a lot of money,” said JD Vance, placing hand on heart as he recalled his childhood in Middletown, Ohio in the 1990s. “I was raised by a woman who struggled often to put food on the table and clothes on her back.”

There was an earnest cry from the audience. “Mamaw!” shouted a man.

Smiling at the reference to his grandmother, the US vice-president said: “Everybody loves Mamaw. Most of all me.” But there was also a political point to the story: despite the hardships, Vance insisted, Mamaw never had to worry about violent crime until Democrats sabotaged law and order.

The 41-year-old used this routine appearance in Concord, North Carolina last September to present himself as a hardline warrior with a heart. It was a snapshot of a man who has emerged as both the most aggressive defender of Donald Trump and a 2028 candidate in stealth mode.

It is a delicate balancing act that sees Vance trying to preserve the populist bombast of his boss while carving out a distinct persona of his own. In this he is aided by the one centre of power in which his connections surpass Trump's: Silicon Valley, where AI investments are driving the US economy and shaping the future.

On the eve of his first anniversary as first in line to the presidency, the vice-president now finds himself promoting views he once opposed. On foreign intervention, free speech and government transparency, Vance has quietly reversed course, shrugged off inconsistencies or simply ignored them – all while positioning himself as the heir to Trump's movement.

Joe Walsh, a former Republican congressman turned Democrat, said: “He's absolutely risen to the occasion: he's a thoroughly despicable, dishonest toady for Donald Trump, and he's doing it wonderfully.

“He's the clear frontrunner because he's utterly shameless and he's done and said everything that Trump wants him to do and say. He's done a great job and positioned himself to be the guy.”

Vance has become ever more prominent in recent months. He embarked on a high-stakes diplomatic mission to Israel to secure a fragile ceasefire with Hamas. He was Trump's enforcer on issues such as redistricting and a record long government shutdown. He provoked criticism when said he hoped his wife, Usha Vance, who is of Indian heritage and raised in a Hindu family, would ultimately convert to his own Catholic faith.

Vance was the face of the administration's response to the assassination of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk, escorting Kirk's casket from Utah to Arizona on Air Force Two and guest-hosting Kirk's podcast from his ceremonial office. Once a staunch defender of controversial speech against “censorship”, he demanded retribution against anyone perceived as celebrating the murder.

Although the vice-president was conspicuous by his absence from a makeshift situation room at Mar-a-Lago where Trump directed an attack on Venezuela, he was back at his boss's side for a White House meeting with oil executives to effectively carve up the country's resources. When Trump stepped away to admire the site of his future ballroom, Vance grinned widely and shot an amused glance at secretary of state Marco Rubio, a potential 2028 rival.

That same week Vance had put himself front and centre of the White House's reaction to the fatal shooting of Renee Good, a 37-year-old poet and mother, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) officer in Minneapolis. He berated the media and blamed the victim: “I can believe that her death is a tragedy, while also recognizing that it's a tragedy of her own making and a tragedy of the far left who has marshalled an entire movement – a lunatic fringe – against our law enforcement officers.”

Vance is running a shadow presidential campaign in all but name. In March he was appointed finance chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC), a role unprecedented for a sitting vice-president that allows frequent interactions with mega-donors. For the past 12 months he has been quietly travelling the country, building contacts and defining himself as both adjacent to but distinct from Trump.

In September's stop at an airport hangar in North Carolina, he wore a dark blue suit, white shirt and red tie unmistakably reminiscent of the president. Hundreds of people had come to see him. Levi Baldwin, 62, a former pharmaceutical industry worker, said: “He's one of us. He didn't come up in the ruling class. He struggled and living through that helped him build a lot of character. It's a wonderful story. It's kind of the American story.”

Wally Wallace, 78, a military veteran from Harrisburg, North Carolina: “He's got backbone and not afraid to speak up. That's what I like. I don't like a wimp. The thing that he and Trump have is they know how to connect to people. They're real. It's not a bunch of fake stuff. It's not like it's canned.”

Ben Venskus, 42, a management consultant wearing a red Make America Great Again cap, had brought his 11-year-old son. He said: “Vance has an opportunity to do something that Trump won't be able to do because of the amount of hate from the public against Trump. Vance has an opportunity to grow the Republican party into something greater than Maga because he wasn't originally a Maga guy.”

Vance spoke from a lectern flanked by officers in uniform and against a backdrop of armoured police vehicles and giant US flags. He championed law and order and defended hardline immigration enforcement. He falsely claimed that Democrats had failed to denounce the killing of rightwing activist Charlie Kirk. He spoke of the American dream and “the sacred obligation” of passing on a better life to the next generation.

Vance also joked about how “cussing” would upset conservatives in the room. He complimented “a beautiful baby”, posed for photos with a boy who was skipping school and looked at ease fielding questions from reporters.

Reflecting on the stabbing to death of a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee on a light rail train in North Carolina, he told the crowd: “I have three little kids, and my youngest is a baby girl, three years old. She is the apple of my eye. As dads will know, daughters get away with more stuff, don't they?”

He went on: “But I look at this [Ukrainian] girl, who is 23 years old … If you are man – I don't care what skin colour you are, rich or poor – but if you are a man and you see the pleading eyes of a girl looking up for protection, we have to protect our girls and our women in this country.”

Vance also railed against Democrats and the “fake news” media. He said: “If you want to stop political violence, stop attacking our law enforcement as the Gestapo. If you want to stop political violence, stop telling your supporters that everybody who disagrees with you is a Nazi. If you want to stop political violence, looking in the mirror.”

There was some irony in the reference to Nazis. During the 2016 presidential election, Vance wrote that he goes “back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical a–hole like Nixon who wouldn't be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he's America's Hitler”.

In her book, 107 Days, former vice-president Kamala Harris describes Vance as a “shape-shifter” and “a shifty guy”. Gregg Nunziata, executive director of the Society for the Rule of Law, posted on X in 2025: “I knew the VP a bit, not well, 10 years ago. I thought well of him. I'll never understand how he became who he has become. Of course, the ideology changed, but the dishonesty and pettiness, that's the worst of it.”

Vance was once best known as the author of Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, drawing on his upbringing in Ohio and Kentucky, which came to be seen as a Rosetta Stone for understanding the rise of Trump.

But his path to the White House was backed by those on the other side of the economic spectrum: some of the most powerful men in tech, who for years have used their wealth and influence to further his political ambitions.

Following a six-year stint working at largely tech-focused venture capital firms, Vance began his political career with an Ohio senate run that billionaire Palantir founder Peter Thiel bankrolled with $15m in campaign financing.

It was Thiel who personally lobbied Trump to select Vance for vice president, and he has remained a champion: telling a crowd at one of his off-the-record lectures last year on the Antichrist that he is “very pro-JD Vance”.

Other connections to big tech also helped his path to the White House. While he hosted a $300,000-a-plate fundraising dinner at billionaire investor David Sacks' San Francisco mansion during the early days of the 2024 presidential campaign, a room full of wealthy tech donors gathered for Vance all encouraged Trump to select him as a running mate. (Sacks, a political ally of Vance, was later selected as the administration's AI and Crypto Czar.)

Elon Musk, the tech titan and Trump's biggest financial backer, also personally advocated for Vance and repeatedly touted his nomination – declaring to his over 200 million followers on X that the Trump-Vance ticket “resounds with victory”.

The relationship between Vance and Musk stayed close even after the Tesla CEO's very public spat with Trump last summer, which initially threatened to be a permanent rift. Vance played a central role in mending ties between Musk and Trump, according to the Washington Post, including personally appealing to Musk and urging him to back off plans to launch his own political party.

Vance also heavily lobbied for Musk's preferred choice to head NASA, Jared Isaacman, helping to successfully resurrect a candidate that Trump had earlier publicly rejected. Last month, Musk told a gathering of former Doge employees that he predicted two terms of a Vance presidency.

As the tech industry continues to undergo a rightward shift under Trump, Vance has eagerly embraced the role of tech's man in Washington.

As vice president, he has championed many of Silicon Valley's anti-regulation views and functioned as a bridge between Maga world and the tech right. One of Vance's earliest acts in office was a closely-watched address at the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris last February, where he told world leaders the US would pursue “pro-growth” AI policy and claimed that “the AI future is not going to be won by hand-wringing about safety”. The UK renamed its AI Safety Institute to become the AI Security Institute later that month.

And when the UK government attempted to force Apple to provide law enforcement a backdoor to access to encrypted data, it was Vance who led a furious public charge that forced the Home Office to back down.

Vance has made numerous appearances to talk tech, including as featured guest at a live event for the immensely popular All-In podcast which Sacks co-hosts. Perhaps Vance's most revealing appearance, however, was as the keynote speaker last March at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz's American Dynamism Summit. During a period of tension between Silicon Valley's pro-Trump elites and the Republican Party's populist base, he lauded the audience of tech executives for their work and assured them that tech had an important place within the Maga movement.

“It's time to align the interests of our technology firms with the interests of the United States of America writ large,” Vance said.

A RealClearPolitics poll average late last year put Vance at 48.8% for the Republican nomination in 2028, far ahead of Donald Trump Jr on 11% and Rubio on 9.3%. In December Kirk's widow, Erika, threw the support of Turning Point USA and its young army of volunteers behind him. Earlier this month Glenn Youngkin, the governor of Virginia, said Vance would be a “great, great presidential nominee”.

The vice-president plans to travel extensively in 2026, ostensibly to campaign for Republicans in the midterms, but also to lay the groundwork for a presidential run two years later. He will be able to earn political capital, deepen local networks and sharpen his skills on the stump. But loyalty will remain his watchword since he is aware that any overt eagerness risks rubbing Trump the wrong way.

Vance is also steering clear of the internecine wars among celebrity Maga podcasters. Public spats over antisemitism and foreign policy provided a noisy backdrop to his recent appearance at AmericaFest, where he urged Republicans to resist “endless, self-defeating purity tests” and emphasised he “didn't bring a list of conservatives to denounce or de-platform”.

Instead, with Don Jr's likely backing, he will seek to present himself as a natural unifier. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: “He's well along into the Trump dynasty. That is going to be his calling card. ‘I am the guy who can continue Donald Trump's agenda.'

“Now, whether JD Vance has the skill, whether there is enough support for him, that's an open question and that's going to be a real battle.”

Stepping into Trump's shoes would be a daunting prospect and unique challenge for anyone. The president continues to tease a third White House run in 2028 and, while this is not permitted by the constitution, it does point to a deeper truth: that he will be unwilling to cede the limelight to any would-be successor, lest he be seen as a lame-duck president.

Michael Steele, a co-host of MS Now's The Weeknight and former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: “JD Vance, Marco Rubio, any of these so-called wannabe inheritors of Trump's mantle are gonna have to deal with two things. One, Donald Trump, and two, they're not Trump. It becomes real tricky and it's gonna be messy.

“Donald Trump, for all we know, could come out and say he taps Donald Trump Jr. Then what do they do? Are they all going to fall in line or are they going to challenge? Donald Trump Jr for president? That's as a legitimate a part of the conversation as anybody else running for president in Trump world.

“That's why I laugh at all this ‘JD Vance is the heir apparent'. No, he's not. The only thing apparent is that he's not the heir.”

It has been more than 40 years since I was imprisoned in Iran for speaking out against human rights abuses and state executions, and for defending women's rights. I spent eight years behind bars in Iran's notorious Evin prison. I was tortured. I remember it as if it happened yesterday.

Every few years, uprisings erupt across Iran — and each wave of resistance is deeper and more widespread than the one before. In 2022, it was women who led the Woman, Life, Freedom movement after the murder of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini by the country's “morality police,” and it revolutionized my country. Today, women wear what they want, go out in public with their boyfriends — even live with them — without fear of being arrested. Women earned these rights with their lives. In late December last year, the spark was once again lit — this time in an old bazaar in Tehran.

The demands are the same ones we raised in the 1980s: an end to poverty, corruption and unemployment, the right to organize, and freedom from repression. Despite the gains for women's freedoms made since 2022, workers are still denied basic labor rights. Students are arrested and even executed for peaceful protest. Women are still fighting for fundamental rights. People are still risking their lives to stand up to torture and state violence.

The regime's response has been brutal. Human rights organizations report security forces shooting into crowds of largely peaceful protesters. I have seen heartbreaking images of families desperately looking for their loved ones among hundreds of body bags. The true death toll remains unknown, but reports suggested more than 2,000 people have been killed. Given the scale of the protests and the footage of violent clashes, the real number is probably far higher.

The Human Rights Activists News Agency said that by the end of the 17th day of protests, 18,434 people had been arrested and so far, 97 forced confessions have been broadcast on state television. These scenes bring back painful memories of my own imprisonment, where many people were tortured until they “confessed.” For survivors like me, moments like this reopen old wounds. I still see the faces of friends who were executed.

The regime is terrorizing civilians, burning shops and destroying beautiful, historic bazaars. Doctors are reportedly prevented from treating the wounded. Injured protesters are taken away from their hospital beds. Despite the killings, people are still in the street. They say they have nothing to lose but their chains.

However, the situation is changing so quickly. As of Wednesday last week, military vehicles patrol the streets in Tehran day and night, stopping anyone who dares go out. Only bakeries remain open, and people are leaving their homes only to buy the bare necessities.

Iran has been plunged into an Internet blackout. The regime wants to hide its crackdown from the rest of the world and stop Iranians from organizing. For those of us in exile, we wait in agony for news. I have not been able to reach my family and friends for more than a week. Watching the few grainy videos that reach us, survivors like me relive our worst nightmares.

When I fled Iran, I left everything behind — my family, my friends and my home. I was lucky though — I survived. I rebuilt my life. Many others did not.

Freedom from Torture has supported Iranian survivors like me for years, and in 2024 they assisted more people from Iran than any other country. For those who have escaped, the harrowing reports of brutality the world has been hearing since last month are deeply triggering. We know exactly what the regime is capable of.

My heart aches for my country. Iran has gone through half a century of war against its own people. Our society is deeply wounded, but the status quo cannot continue, because Iranians will never give up fighting for their rights and freedoms. Iran's rulers use torture to silence dissent and instill fear. They tried to take my voice away, because I dared to dream of equality and freedom. Today, I use that voice to speak out about the horrors that continue, and to ask the world to speak up for Iranians.

Since 2022, I have watched with dismay as global attention has drifted away from Iran. Silence only empowers those who torture and kill with impunity. The international community and the media must keep shining a light on what is happening.

We must raise the political cost of executions. We must demand the release of political prisoners. We must insist that the use of torture ends right now. We must stand shoulder-to-shoulder in solidarity with Iranians, in their struggle for what many of us take for granted every day: freedom, dignity and a life without fear.

                                                                                In the US' National Security Strategy (NSS) report released last month, US President Donald Trump offered his interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. The “Trump Corollary,” presented on page 15, is a distinctly aggressive rebranding of the more than 200-year-old foreign policy position. Beyond reasserting the sovereignty of the western hemisphere against foreign intervention, the document centers on energy and strategic assets, and attempts to redraw the map of the geopolitical landscape more broadly. It is clear that Trump no longer sees the western hemisphere as a peaceful backyard, but rather as the frontier of a new Cold War. In particular,                                    



                                                                                As the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) races toward its 2027 modernization goals, most analysts fixate on ship counts, missile ranges and artificial intelligence. Those metrics matter — but they obscure a deeper vulnerability. The true future of the PLA, and by extension Taiwan's security, might hinge less on hardware than on whether the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) can preserve ideological loyalty inside its own armed forces.
Iran's 1979 revolution demonstrated how even a technologically advanced military can collapse when the social environment surrounding it shifts. That lesson has renewed relevance as fresh unrest shakes Iran today — and it should                                    



                                                                                When it became clear that the world was entering a new era with a radical change in the US' global stance in US President Donald Trump's second term, many in Taiwan were concerned about what this meant for the nation's defense against China. Instability and disruption are dangerous. Chaos introduces unknowns. There was a sense that the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) might have a point with its tendency not to trust the US. 
The world order is certainly changing, but concerns about the implications for Taiwan of this disruption left many blind to how the same forces might also weaken                                    



                                                                                On today's page, Masahiro Matsumura, a professor of international politics and national security at St Andrew's University in Osaka, questions the viability and advisability of the government's proposed “T-Dome” missile defense system. Matsumura writes that Taiwan's military budget would be better allocated elsewhere, and cautions against the temptation to allow politics to trump strategic sense. What he does not do is question whether Taiwan needs to increase its defense capabilities. “Given the accelerating pace of Beijing's military buildup and political coercion ... [Taiwan] cannot afford inaction,” he writes.

Indonesian authorities yesterday said they had located the wreckage of a fisheries surveillance plane that went missing in South Sulawesi province near a fog-covered mountain, but were still searching for the 11 people on board.

The ATR 42-500 turboprop owned by aviation group Indonesia Air Transport lost contact with air traffic control on Saturday at about 1:30pm around the Maros region in South Sulawesi.

There were eight crew members and three passengers on board the plane, which was chartered by Indonesia's Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries to conduct air surveillance on fisheries. The passengers were ministry staff members.

The head of South Sulawesi's rescue agency, Muhammad Arif Anwar, said on local television that after finding the wreckage, the rescuers would deploy 1,200 personnel to search for the missing passengers and crew.

“Our priority is to search for the victims, and we hope that there are some that we can evacuate safely,” he said.

The aircraft had been heading to Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi, after departing from Yogyakarta province before contact was lost.

Yesterday morning, local rescuers found the wreckage in different locations around Mount Bulusaraung in the Maros region, said Andi Sultan, an official at South Sulawesi's rescue agency. 

The mountain is roughly 1,500km northeast of the sprawling island nation's capital, Jakarta.

“Our helicopter crews have seen the debris of the plane's window at 7:46am,” Sultan told reporters.

“And around 7:49am, we discovered large parts of the aircraft, suspected to be the fuselage of the plane,” he said, adding that the tail of the plane was also seen at the bottom of the mountain slope.

Rescuers have been deployed to the locations where the wreckage was discovered, Sultan said, adding that the search was hampered by thick fog and mountainous terrain.

In video footage shared by the rescue agency, a window of the plane was found scattered on the mountain with thick fog and strong wind around it.

Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee would lead an investigation into the crash, Sultan said. 

The cause remains unclear, and experts say most accidents are caused by a combination of factors.

Flight tracking website Flightradar24 wrote on social media that the plane was flying over the ocean at a low altitude, so its tracking coverage was limited, and the last signal was received about 20km northeast of Makassar airport.

The moves reflect growing global concern over generative AI tools that can produce realistic images, sound and text, while existing safeguards fail to prevent their abuse. The Grok chatbot, which is accessed through Musk's social media platform X, has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.

Syria's army has seized swathes of the country's north, dislodging Kurdish forces from territory over which they held effective autonomy for more than a decade.

The government appeared to be extending its grip on Kurdish-run areas after Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a decree declaring Kurdish a “national language” and granting the minority group official recognition.

The Kurds have said Friday's announcement fell short of their aspirations, while the implementation of a deal agreed to in March last year — intended to see Kurdish forces integrated into the state — has stalled.

Government troops drove Kurdish forces from two Aleppo neighborhoods last week and on Saturday took control of an area east of the city.

Yesterday, the government announced the capture of Tabqa, about 55km west of Raqqa.

“The Syrian army controls the strategic city of Tabqa in the Raqqa countryside, including the Euphrates Dam, which is the largest dam in Syria,” Syrian Minister of Information Hamza Almustafa was quoted by the official SANA news agency as saying.

However, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said they had “taken the necessary measures to restore security and stability” in Tabqa.

In Deir Hafer, about 50km east of Aleppo, reporters saw several SDF fighters leaving the town and residents returning under heavy army presence.

Syria's army said four soldiers had been killed, while Kurdish forces reported several fighters dead. Both sides traded blame for violating a withdrawal deal.

Kurdish authorities ordered a curfew in the Raqqa region after the army designated a swathe of territory southwest of the Euphrates River a “closed military zone,” warning it would target what it said were several military sites.

SANA yesterday reported that the SDF destroyed two bridges over the Euphrates in Raqqa city, which lies on the eastern bank of the river.

Raqqa's media directorate separately accused the SDF of cutting off the city's water supply by blowing up the main water pipes.

Deir Ezzor Governor Ghassan Alsayed Ahmed said on social media that the SDF fired “rocket projectiles” at neighborhoods in government-controlled territories in the city center of Deir Ezzor, al-Mayadin and other areas.

The SDF said “factions affiliated with the Damascus government attacked our forces' positions” and caused clashes in several towns on the east bank of the Euphrates, opposite al-Mayadin and which lie between Deir Ezzor and the Iraqi border. 

On Friday, Syrian Kurdish leader and SDF chief Mazloum Abdi had committed to redeploying his forces from outside Aleppo to east of the Euphrates, but the SDF on Saturday said that Damascus had “violated the recent agreements and betrayed our forces,” with clashes erupting with troops south of Tabqa. 

The army urged the SDF to “immediately fulfil its announced commitments and fully withdraw” east of the river.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and northeast, areas captured during the civil war over the past decade. 

US envoy Tom Barrack met Abdi in Erbil on Saturday, the presidency of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region said.

While Washington has long supported Kurdish forces, it has also backed Syria's new authorities. US Central Command on Saturday urged Syrian government forces “to cease any offensive actions in the areas between Aleppo and al-Tabqa”.

Al-Sharaa's announcement on Friday marked the first formal recognition of Kurdish rights since Syria's independence in 1946.

The decree stated that Kurds are “an essential and integral part” of Syria, where they have suffered decades of marginalization. It made Kurdish a “national language” and granted nationality to all Kurds — about 20 percent of whom were stripped of it under a controversial 1962 census.

The Kurdish administration in Syria's northeast said the decree was “a first step,” but “does not satisfy the aspirations and hopes of the Syrian people.”

Editor's Note: This is a developing story. 

French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and other officials voiced support for Denmark, Greenland, and principles of international law in statements denouncing tariff threats on Jan. 17. 

Their remarks came shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that Washington would impose 10% tariffs on NATO allies — France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Finland — until the U.S. reaches a deal to buy Greenland. 

Macron called the tariff threats ""unacceptable"" in a post on X, saying France's commitment to sovereignty and the United Nations Charter is the foundation of its ongoing support for Ukraine. 

""France is committed to the sovereignty and independence of nations, in Europe and elsewhere. ... No intimidation or threat will influence us — neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,"" he wrote.

France was among a group of nations that recently deployed troops to Greenland to conduct joint exercises as part of a security assessment. Trump lambasted the joint exercises, calling them a ""very dangerous game"" and targeting the participating nations with tariffs. 

The eight nations will face ""a 10% tariff on any and all goods"" sent to the U.S. beginning Feb. 1, Trump said. Tariffs will increase to 25% on June 1 and remain in effect until ""a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland."" 

In light of Trump's statement, Cyprus, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, announced late on Jan. 17 that EU ambassadors will hold an emergency meeting on Jan. 18 to assess the situation and discuss a response. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa defended the joint mission in Greenland and reaffirmed the EU's solidarity with Denmark in a joint letter following Trump's announcement. 

""The pre-coordinated Danish exercise, conducted with allies, responds to the need to strengthen Arctic security and poses no threat to anyone,"" they wrote.

""The EU stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland. ... Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty.""

In an even blunter statement, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called Trump's tariff threats ""completely wrong"" and said London would address the issue with the White House directly. 

""Applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong. We will of course be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration,"" he said.

Starmer's comment represents a rare public criticism of Trump, and Europe's collective response points to strong pushback against Washington's unilateral ambitions in Greenland and punitive economic policies.

""We will not let ourselves be blackmailed,"" Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Jan. 17, joining the chorus of rebukes to Trump. ""Only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland. I will always stand up for my country, and for our allied neighbors.""

Kristersson said he was engaged in ""intensive"" talks with the U.K., Norway, and other EU states on a coordinated response. 

 Experts said Trump's aggressive policy threatens Europe's carefully managed approach to transatlantic relations. 

""Many leaders in Europe would still prefer to avoid open confrontation or a rupture with the Trump administration,"" Jörn Fleck, senior director with the Europe Center at the Atlantic Council, told the Kyiv Independent. 

""But the U.S. president's ever-bolder, some would say more brazen, approach after Venezuela and on Greenland is testing the limits on what Europe's hugging-the-bear strategy can deliver. His aggressive push risks robbing European leaders of what political space is left at home and in Trump's new global power politics to maintain their careful balancing act vis-à-vis the United States.""

One immediate consequence of Trump's threats may be a delay in the pending trade deal between the U.S. and EU — an agreement that Europeans believed successfully smoothed over economic tensions between Brussels and Washington, according to Fleck. 

Manfred Weber, president of the European People's Party — the largest political faction in the European Parliament — said shortly after Trump's Greenland ultimatum that the deal could not be approved. 

""The EPP is in favor of the EU–U.S. trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage. The 0% tariffs on U.S. products must be put on hold,"" he said.

While also criticizing the tariffs, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, pointed out that fractures in the transatlantic alliance only benefit Russia and China — and may undermine support for Ukraine.

""China and Russia must be having a field day,"" she said in response to the U.S. tariff threat. ""They are the ones who benefit from divisions among Allies. ... We also cannot let our dispute distract us from the our core task of helping to end Russia's war against Ukraine.""

Fleck agreed that friction among Ukraine's allies may pose problems for Kyiv, saying that Europe had recently regained a stronger position in support of Ukraine amid Trump's efforts to negotiate a peace deal. 

""That stabilizing role seems at risk should the fractures deepen in the alliance,"" he said. 

James Goldgeier, professor of foreign policy and global security at American University in Washington, D.C., said Trump's stance on Greenland threatens longstanding alliances while doing little to advance U.S. interests. 

""The alliance is in deep trouble for no good reason,"" Goldgeier told the Kyiv Independent. 

""Trump's obsession with Greenland has become a real liability for U.S. interests. He's leaving the Europeans with no choice but to oppose this imperialist foreign policy."" 

Trump's tariff announcement came as thousands of demonstrators gathered in both Denmark and Greenland to protest a possible U.S. takeover. Participants held up signs reading ""Hands of Greenland"" and ""Make America Go Away.""

""(N)o one in the administration has explained what they would do with the people who live in Greenland and who have said over and over they don't want to be part of the U.S.,"" Goldgeier said.

Since returning to office in January, Trump has repeatedly laid claim to Greenland, Denmark's semiautonomous island with strategic significance in access to the Arctic region. Trump has claimed that the U.S. must seize the territory in order to prevent Russia or China from doing so first, echoing similar remarks made to justify the recent U.S. attack on Venezuela.

Trump has also frequently used tariffs — or the threat of tariffs — pursue his foreign policy agenda. 

Danish lawmaker Pelle Dragsted called for ""European solidarity and resistance"" in response to Trump's latest threats. 

""Trump must not be allowed to divide us,"" he wrote. 

""The EU must respond united and hit back hard. ... Enough is enough!""

Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi told participants that Russia shows no readiness to end the war.

""The transatlantic alliance is over,"" Kremlin economic negotiator Kirill Dmitriev said.

 In the latest episode of Ukraine This Week, the Kyiv Independent's Anna Belokur breaks down Russia's intensified winter assault on Ukraine's energy grid, as sustained missile and drone strikes push the system to the brink.

After quickly reaching the initial target, organizers raised the goal to 2 million zloty ($550,000).

The 330-kilovolt power line, damaged and disconnected by military activity on Jan. 2, is vital for supplying the plant with external electricity. 

Disconnecting Ukraine's nuclear power plants would take the crisis one step further — Ukrainians would be fully cut off from electricity and heating in subzero temperatures.

The Brindisi Court approved the seizure of both the vessel and its cargo, which included 33,000 tons of ferrous metal. 

The strikes came as Ukraine faces severe cold and ongoing disruptions to heat and electricity supplies following repeated attacks on the energy sector, which prompted a state of emergency earlier this week.

Russian officials welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on NATO allies over Greenland, with Kremlin economic negotiator Kirill Dmitriev claiming on Jan. 17 that the move signals the ""collapse"" of the transatlantic alliance. 

Trump earlier said that Washington would impose 10% tariffs on NATO allies — France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Finland — until the U.S. reaches a deal to buy Greenland. He has threatened to acquire the island ""one way or the other.""

""The transatlantic alliance is over,"" Dmitriev wrote on X, mocking European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and urging European leaders not to ""provoke"" Trump.

The tariffs will take effect on Feb. 1 and increase to 25% on June 1, Trump said. He threatened the tariffs just days after European forces from France, Germany, and other countries began arriving for exercises in Greenland.

Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, known for provocative outbursts, also welcomed Trump's rhetoric, framing it as evidence of deepening divisions within NATO.

""The U.S. is preparing to attack Greenland, choosing the island itself rather than some kind of Atlantic solidarity,"" Medvedev said, adding that European countries would be ""punished with tariffs"" for relying on U.S. protection.

Medvedev has previously mocked Western unity and urged Trump to move quickly to annex Greenland, reflecting Moscow's interest in exploiting rifts among the U.S. and its allies.

Greenland, home to about 56,000 people, already hosts a U.S. military base and has grown in strategic importance as Arctic competition intensifies. 

Several EU countries have publicly backed Denmark since Trump renewed his threats, signaling alarm in Europe over the potential consequences for NATO cohesion.

Trump has insisted that NATO would become ""more formidable and effective"" if Greenland were under U.S. control, a claim European leaders have rejected.

Cyprus, which currently holds the EU's rotating presidency, announced that EU ambassadors will hold an emergency meeting on Jan. 18 to assess the situation and discuss a response.

The Atesh partisan group sabotaged an electrical substation in Russia's Bryansk Oblast, disrupting power supply to ""key"" components of Russia's war machine, the group claimed in a Telegram post on Jan. 18.

An operative with the group damaged equipment at the substation in an industrial zone in the community of Bolshoye Polpino. 

The group claimed that the sabotage operation disrupted power supply to Polpinskaya railway station, which supplies Russian equipment and ammunition to the front line in Ukraine. Power disruptions also affected nearby enterprises, including a locomotive repair depot as well as fuel storage facilities in the area, the group claimed.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these claims.

The Atesh movement regularly commits sabotage attacks on Russian territory and in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine.

Over the past year, agents of Atesh have claimed to have sabotaged key railway hubs, a locomotive, as well as a Russian air defense factory, among other targets.

Bryansk Oblast, located in Russia's far-west, borders Ukraine's Chernihiv and Sumy Oblast, and has been the target of various Ukrainian strikes.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blamed US President Donald Trump for the casualties that occurred during the recent protests in Iran. Follow DW for the latest.

Here is a roundup of developments on the Iran protests on Saturday, January 17, and Sunday, January 18, 2026.

The Reuters news agency has cited an Iranian official with information that authorities had verified at least 5,000 people killed in protests, including around 500 security personnel.

The official — who Reuters said did not want to be named — said the highest number of deaths took place in Iranian Kurdish areas in northwest Iran.

""The final ​toll ​is not expected to increase sharply,"" the official said, adding that ""Israel and armed groups abroad"" had supported and equipped those taking to the streets.

No exact death toll has been provided by Iranian officials, but Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR) reported that 3,428 people were verified to have been killed by security forces.

IHR warned the actual toll could be several times higher.

On Saturday Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on branded US President Donald Trump a “criminal” for backing protesters in Iran and blamed demonstrators for causing thousands of deaths.

We're pausing our live coverage for now and will be back with the latest developments tomorrow.

The eldest son of the last shah, Reza Pahlavi, said Iran's regime is on its ""last legs"" and called on countries to take action in support of demonstrators. 

DW's Washington bureau chief Ines Pohl spoke to Iran's exiled former crown prince, who said Europe should take action to speed up the collapse of Iran's theocratic regime.

Iran's regime has been cracking down on protesters with brutal force. Images of bodies in shrouds have provoked shock and outrage around the world — including among five Iranian women living in Germany.

DW spoke to five Iranian women living in Germany about how they see the protest movement and its potential impact.

A government crackdown has quelled protests after thousands of protesters were killed or injured. But the crisis has only been ‘postponed', says Middle East expert Fawaz Gerges in an interview with DW.

Since Saturday, Iranians have been able to send text messages via mobile phone within the country after several days of blockages following mass anti-government protests.

However, the blackout on global internet access remains in force, and Iranians can only access state-controlled websites via the national intranet.

Telecommunications have been largely down in Iran since authorities imposed a blockade on January 8 due to the protests. 

There are growing concerns that the global internet could remain blocked in Iran for a long time.

Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, accused US President Donald Trump of being responsible for ""casualties"" during protests in Iran that were met with a deadly crackdown. 

According to human rights groups, more than 3,000 people have been killed.

""We hold the American president guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has levelled against the Iranian nation,"" he told a crowd of supporters on Saturday during an address marking a religious holiday.

""This was an American conspiracy,"" Khamenei said, adding that ""America's goal is to swallow Iran... the goal is to put Iran back under military, political and economic domination,"" he added.

During the protests, Trump repeatedly suggested that the US might take military action against Iran if its government triggered widespread killings. Those protests have since died down.

German soldiers departed Greenland as scheduled. It comes amid President Donald Trump's tariff threats and his claim that Greenland should belong to the US. Follow DW.

Follow below for all the latest news on Trump's new tariff threats on European nations amid an escalating row over the future of Greenland here:

Ambassadors from the European Union's 27 countries have convened for an emergency meeting to discuss President Donald Trump's threat to impose tariffs on eight European countries opposing US control of Greenland.

Cyprus, holder of the rotating six-month EU presidency, convened the meeting.

DW correspondent Jack Parrock reports from Brussels that officials are discussing what to do going forward.

""What are the trade responses on the table, and what is available to them,"" he said, adding that a news conference is not expected following the meeting.

France's President Emmanuel Macron has indicated he wants to activate a never-before-used ""anti-coercion instrument"" against the United States (see earlier entry).

However, officials in Brussels are not expected to decide on using the measure immediately.

""It is unlikely that they will move quickly on using that trade 'bazooka' instrument, but they want to wield the threat... so they certainly won't take it off the table,"" Parrock said.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he discussed the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic with US President Donald Trump.

""We will continue working on this, and I look forward to seeing him in Davos later this week,"" Rutte wrote on social media. 

The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) is taking place in Davos and Trump said he would join the more than 60 heads of state and government, planning to attend. 

Germany's Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul expressed skepticism that the EU-US trade agreement will be ratified anytime soon, citing rising tensions over planned US tariffs aimed at eight NATO member states.

Speaking to German public broadcaster ARD, Wadephul said Europe must respond to President Donald Trump's tariff threat against the so-called Greenland eight countries.

""We must not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,"" he told the Bericht aus Berlin program.

""Europe is politically and economically much stronger than some had thought so far, and I think we should make that count now,"" Wadephul said.

He declined to outline what specific countermeasures the EU might adopt, adding tariffs would be ""poison for transatlantic relations"" and that there would now be intensive talks with Washington.

A provisional EU-US tariff deal reached last year still requires approval by the European Parliament.

French President Emmanuel Macron is working to coordinate a European response to President Donald Trump's Greenland tariffs and is pushing to activate the European Union's Anti-Coercion Instrument, according to sources in his office.

The tool, designed to tackle economic intimidation from third countries, empowers the European Commission to respond with a range of countermeasures.

These include tariffs, export controls, restrictions on intellectual property and investment flows, and blocking access to the EU single market.

The EU considered using it last year when Trump announced his ""big beautiful tariffs."" But a provisional EU-US tariff deal was reached instead, and the Anti-Coercion Instrument was never used.

The agreement, which still requires European Parliament approval, would impose a 15% US tariff on most European goods while scrapping tariffs on US industrial products.

The increasing tariff of 10% over the Greenland issue would be in addition to that.

German industry groups are warning of severe fallout from new US tariffs linked to President Donald Trump's push to take control of Greenland.

Trump announced duties of 10% on goods from several European countries, including Germany, starting in February. The tariffs would rise to 25% in June unless a deal is struck.

Germany's mechanical engineering association VDMA says Europe must not give in to what it calls blackmail, urging Brussels to consider using its Anti-Coercion Instrument.

""If the EU gives in here, it will only embolden the American president to make the next absurd demand and threaten further tariffs,"" VDMA President Bertram Kawlath said.

The automotive industry group VDA warns the tariffs would impose enormous costs at a time of economic strain.

VDA President Hildegard Müller urged the European Commission to pursue a ""smart, strategic and coordinated response"" with affected countries, adding that the United States must respect Greenland's right to self-determination.

The German Chamber of Commerce is calling for a united European response, saying economic pressure must be met with solidarity.

""Economic coercion can only be countered with a clear and common European position,"" Volker Treier, the chamber's head of foreign trade, said.

Eight European countries facing new US tariffs by President Donald Trump over their joint opposition to his Greenland demands warned that the measures ""undermine trans-Atlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.""

The countries, Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, and the UK have deployed a small number of troops to Greenland on Denmark's request earlier this week in a so-called reconnaissance mission.

""As members of NATO, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest,"" they said in a joint statement.

""Tariff threats undermine trans-Atlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty,"" they said.

German soldiers deployed to Denmark were meant to explore possible military contributions to bolster the security of the region, the German defense ministry said in a statement earlier this week. DW's chief political correspondent, Nina Haase, breaks it down:

The German reconnaissance team that arrived in Greenland on Friday is departing the Danish territory as planned.

Fifteen soldiers were leaving the Arctic island on a civilian flight to Copenhagen on Sunday midday. The deployment was scheduled from the start to last only a few days and came at the request of Denmark.

The team was meant to assess conditions for possible NATO exercises, with the spokesman of the command control center having said Sunday that the mission was completed. ""The results of the reconnaissance will be analyzed in the coming days.""

It comes as US President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on eight countries involved in the mission.

Trump insists Greenland should belong to the United States for security reasons, citing threats from China and Russia.

European NATO allies reject that idea, saying the alliance can safeguard the Arctic collectively.

France's Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard told broadcasters that the US would also suffer, should President Donald Trump impose tariffs on European states for opposing his Greenland acquisition plans.

""In this escalation of tariffs, he has a lot to lose as well, as do his own farmers and industrialists,"" Genevard told broadcasters Europe 1 and CNews.

Trump has threatened a 10-percent tariff from February 1 on all goods sent to the US  from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland.

It would be increased to 25 percent on June 1 ""until such time as a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland,"" Trump said.

""The European Union has potential strike force"" from a commercial point of view, Genevard said.

""This is a response that must be handled with caution, because this escalation could be deadly — but it could also be deadly for the United States,"" Genevard said.

An extraordinary meeting of EU ambassadors has been called in Brussels for Sunday afternoon.

US Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York railed against Trump's ""foolhardy"" tariffs on European allies in a statement. 

""It is incredible that he wants to double down on the stupidty by imposing tariffs on our closest allies for his quixotic quest to takeover Greenland,"" Schumer said. ""Senate Democrats will introduce legislation to block these tariffs before they do further damage to the American economy and our allies in Europe."" 

It's unclear whether such a bill would get to the floor of the Republican-majority Senate.

However, Republican Senators Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska traveled to Denmark this week to reassure the Danish government that they are against a US military takeover of Greenland.

""These tariffs are unnecessary, punitive and a profound mistake. They will push our core European allies further away while doing nothing to advance US national security,"" Murkowski posted on X in response to Trump's announcement earlier on Saturday.

She added: ""Congress must work together to reassert our Constitutional authority over tariffs so that they are not weaponized in ways that harm our alliances and undermine American leadership.""

European Commissioner for Trade Maros Sefcovic, who attended the EU-Mercosur deal signing ceremony in Paraguay, told DW's Rosie Birchard about the bloc's strategy for dealing with Trump's fresh tariff threat against European countries over Greenland. 

""There is consultation among the leaders going on. First and foremost, we again stayed very, very, clear on our principles for us, territorial sovereignty, integrity and international law are absolutely key principles,"" Sefcovic said.        

Sefcovic said the new US tariffs could trigger a ""very dangerous downward spiral"" and European leaders should ""simply avoid this type of development.""

Some European lawmakers, such as Manfred Weber of the center-right European People's Party, have said the European Parliament may not be able to ratify the US-EU trade deal that was reached last summer. That deal would see EU goods face a 15% tariff coming into the US, with US goods not facing any levies in the EU.    

Sefcovic told DW that the path to ratifying the deal will be ""very complicated.""

He noted that the new EU-Mercosur agreement ""should help us more than offset, the negative consequences from the increased tariffs imposed by the United States.""   

The new EU deal with the Latin American trading bloc Mercosur will massively reduce trade barriers between the two sides.

Sefcovic also said the EU conducts the most global trade, bigger than China and the US. 

""We are predictable. We always look for mutual advantages, deals and we are simply biggest trading bloc on this planet with a huge consumption power with very solid clientele and world class companies,"" Sefcovic said.  

US House Representative Gregory Meeks of New York said he will offer a resolution to ""terminate"" Trump's ""illegal and absurd tariffs immediately.""

""I'm here in Copenhagen and in every conversation I've had, officials have made clear: Greenland is not for sale,"" Meeks, the top Democrat on the US House Committee on Foreign Affairs, said in a statement posted on X.   

""Trump is manufacturing a foreign crisis and sabotaging our closest alliance — all while ignoring the real crisis the American people actually care about: affordablity,"" the statement added, referring to cost-of-living struggles Americans face.   

It's unclear if such a resolution would pass if brought to the floor of the Republican-majority US House of Representatives.

Some Republicans in Congress have also criticized Trump's plans to acquire Greenland, such as US Representative Don Bacon of Nebraska. 

Following Trump's announcement of fresh tariffs on Denmark, Germany, France and several other US allies, Bacon posted on Facebook that ""Congress must reclaim tariff authorities.""   

""There's a reason James Madison put tariff authorities under Article One,"" Bacon posted on X, referring to Article I of the US Constitution. Madison was one of the framers of the Constitution and served as president from 1809 to 1817,  

Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution reads: ""The Congress shall have power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.""

The US Supreme Court is currently deliberating the constitutionality of Trump's tariffs on US trading partners. In its second term, the Trump administration has invoked the International Economic Powers Act of 1977 to implement the duties and bypass Congress. 

Greenland's Minerals Minister Naaja H. Nathanielsen, in a post on LinkedIn, praised peaceful demonstrations in Greenlandic and Danish cities in solidarity with Greenland, saying it was a ""day of pride and unity.""

Concerning Trump's threats of tariffs on several European countries, Nathanielsen said, ""We live in extraordinary times that call not only on decency but also great courage.""

""I am amazed to witness the first responses from the targeted countries,"" Nathanielsen added. ""I am thankful and hopeful for diplomacy and allieship to prevail.""

Representatives of EU countries are expected to meet on Sunday after Trump's announcement of tariffs on several European countries for their resistance to US efforts to acquire Greenland.  

Cyprus, which currently holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, will preside over the meeting.

			María Corina Machado idolises Margaret Thatcher and hopes to win over the US president with policies similar to those of the late British PM

When María Corina Machado told Hugo Chávez, the former president of Venezuela, he was a liar on live television, she may have been embodying Margaret Thatcher's devastating handbagging moves.

The Venezuelan opposition leader idolises the late British prime minister – and appears to view herself as something of a protégé.

“She was someone willing to defend what she believed, even if she was against the tide, and my life has always been swimming against the tide,” Ms Machado told The Telegraph shortly after her 2023 landslide win in the Venezuelan primary elections.

“People told me my ideas would never be widely accepted. But I said, ‘This is the right thing. This is what works',” she said.

Now Ms Machado, who has been described as Venezuela's Iron Lady, is tasked with trying to convince Donald Trump to back her, a conservative ally, to take over from the communist regime that has ruined her country.

Following the US army's Delta Force capture of Nicolás Maduro, the sitting president, the world waited expectantly for Mr Trump to announce Ms Machado's party would be installed in Miraflores Palace.

That didn't happen.

Ms Machado's party, Vente Venezuela, and the coalition opposition, were widely seen as the legitimate winners of the Latin American country's 2024 elections.

Instead, Delcy Rodríguez, Mr Maduro's deputy, replaced him, keeping the repressive regime intact.

Mr Trump has signalled he's happy with the arrangement, boasting Ms Rodríguez will do anything he wants.

Commenting on Ms Machado, Mr Trump said she was a “very nice woman” but “doesn't have the support within, or the respect within the country” to lead it.

Undeterred by Mr Trump's comments, Ms Machado this week took her cause to the Oval Office in an effort to prove she could be more useful to the administration than a propped-up repressive regime.

The following day, Ms Machado walked onstage at the headquarters of the Heritage Foundation, a Right-wing think tank close to the administration, and explained what was at stake.

Ms Machado said Ms Rodríguez is a “communist” who counts Russia, China and Iran as her closest allies, but if there is a transition to democracy in Venezuela, the country will become “the best ally the United States has ever had in the Americas”.

It is not a choice between her and Ms Rodríguez but between “the cartel” and “justice”, she added.

Recommended

In the coming weeks and months, Ms Machado will pitch herself to Mr Trump and his key allies as the conservative face of a capitalist, free-market Venezuela.

It was no coincidence that Ms Machado chose to deliver her press conference at The Heritage Foundation, which in 1997 hosted her anti-communist idol, Mrs Thatcher, when she delivered a speech on the principles of conservatism.

“When María Corina started speaking at the Heritage Foundation, she described Delcy Rodríguez as a very convinced communist,” said Fabio Valentini, a coordinator for Vente Venezuela, who was part of Ms Machado's team in Washington DC.

“That's the venue to fight those ideas that killed so many and inflicted poverty and hunger on many more people... what I can tell you is that it's also a venue that represents the ideas of María Corina, and also the ideals that we Venezuelans want in our country,” Mr Valentini told The Telegraph.

The anti-socialist opposition leader believes in the small state, free markets and privatisation. Ms Machado wants to see Venezuela transformed into the energy hub of the Americas.

Many of the proposals in her party's National Plan are similar to policies Mrs Thatcher enacted when she was in power in Britain in the 1980s, Mr Valentini said.

Ms Machado has carefully read Mrs Thatcher's autobiography in Spanish, taking notes on it, he added. He has since given her a copy in English, which she plans to read.

“Sometimes in private sessions or meetings with her team, she would refer many, many times to Thatcher's leadership, or sometimes she would quote her,” Mr Valentini added.

“This meeting [with Mr Trump] was quite important, because María Corina needed to play Donald Trump's game and at the same time show Donald Trump that she is a leader and that she is eventually ready to play a role within the larger chess board of Venezuela”, said Carlos Solar, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute.

She used the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour the US president has set his sights upon for years, as a “political weapon”, he said. “I think people are not seeing that she's playing the long game,” he added.

Ms Machado is understood to have a good relationship with Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, who is among a handful of US officials communicating with Ms  Rodríguez and the Venezuelan regime.

She also has “a very good team of advisors who are Washington insiders,” said Chris Sabatini, senior research fellow for Latin America at Chatham House.

John Bolton, Mr Trump's former national security adviser, said it appeared Ms Machado's meeting with Mr Trump “went well”.

“I actually think that meeting was more productive than it first appeared,” Mr Bolton told The Telegraph.

“The best way to Trump's heart is to make sure whatever you're proposing that he does works to his benefit, and she went, obviously, above and beyond that by giving him her Nobel Peace medal. And I think that does have an impact on Trump,” he said.

Mr Trump is on a mission to help reverse the Left-wing tide that swept Latin America in the 2010s. So far this term, he has decapitated the Maduro regime, intervened in the Honduran election to endorse Nasry Asfura, the president-elect, who won, and lent Javier Milei's government in Argentina a $20bn (£14.9bn) lifeline ahead of the mid-terms last year.

“Clearly she has found a comfort zone and a lot of support positioning herself on the Right, and probably further to a hard Right, both within Latin America and outside of Latin America”, Mr Solar said.

Mr Valentini said Mr Trump had truly recognised Ms Machado's “position not only as part of this movement, but also as an important key to restore democracy in Venezuela”.

“I feel that in that meeting, they matched not only in terms of values and principles, but also in the understanding of the real threats that today Western civilisation faces from regimes like the one in Venezuela”, he said.

In private conversations between friends, members of Vente Venezuela would say how the world needed another Ronald Reagan and Mrs Thatcher to take control of the situation.

Mr Valentini said he “absolutely” sees Ms Machado as the Mrs Thatcher of today.

“Many people say María Corina is the Iron Lady of Latin America”, he said.

“For me, the similarity is that María Corina always speaks with the facts and the truth, and she has a very special commitment with our country, as Thatcher had with the United Kingdom, but also with the Commonwealth and all the Western world, because she was a leader for all our countries and our values”, he said.

Now, Ms Machado just has to win over the US president.

            The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers to prepare for possible deployment to Minnesota, according to a Trump administration source, as state officials have also mobilized the National Guard.
    


            Having troops on standby does not mean a deployment is imminent or guaranteed, the Trump administration source said. ABC News first reported the preparations for a possible deployment.
    


            Two battalions from the Alaska-based 11th Airborne Division are on prepare-to-deploy orders in Minnesota, according to a US defense official. It is unclear what tasks they would take on, though the official said it could include crowd control or support for law enforcement, similar to the role active-duty forces played in Los Angeles last summer.
    


            Military officials tell CNN they have options prepared for President Donald Trump.
    


            It is typical for the Pentagon “to be prepared for any decision the President may or may not make,” the White House said in a statement to CNN.
    


            “The Department of War is always prepared to execute the orders of the Commander-in-Chief if called upon,” Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said.
    


            News of the active-duty soldiers on standby comes after reports of an expected surge in Customs and Border Protection agents and other federal personnel, including a small number of FBI agents.
    


            The Minnesota National Guard “are not deployed to city streets at this time, but are ready to help support public safety,” Minnesota's Department of Public Safety said in a social media post which included pictures of Guard members gathering bags of equipment alongside a row of trucks on a snowy road.
    


            The National Guard is “staged and ready to respond,” Minnesota National Guard spokesperson Army Maj. Andrea Tsuchiya said in a statement to CNN, noting the troops will help provide “traffic support to protect life, preserve property, and support the rights of all Minnesotans to assemble peacefully.”
    


            Walz thanked local law enforcement for maintaining public safety amid the ongoing protests against the Trump administration's sweeping immigration operation in the Twin Cities. He urged everyone making their voices heard this weekend to “stay safe and stay peaceful.”
    


            Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey responded to reports of the active-duty soldiers being placed on standby Sunday on CNN's State of the Union
    


            “This act was clearly designed to intimidate the people of Minneapolis,” Frey said, calling the administration's actions “ridiculous” and “completely unconstitutional.”
    


            “I never thought in a million years that we would be invaded by our own federal government,” Frey said.
    


            On the prospect of state National Guard and local police facing off against ICE agents and active-duty troops in Minneapolis, Frey said, “We can't have that in America.”
    


            Trump previously raised the prospect of invoking the Insurrection Act, a centuries-old law, which would allow the deployment of US troops to Minnesota – which Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche voiced support for on Sunday.
    


            “President Trump has promised to keep the American people safe, and the fact that the local law enforcement, because their leadership is not doing their jobs, there may come a time when the president has to order that,” Blanche said on “Fox News Sunday.”
    


            “We support him, the attorney general supports him because we have to keep the citizens safe,” Blanche added.
    


            The possible deployment of even more law enforcement officials to the state comes as protests continue on the frigid streets of Minneapolis. On Saturday, crowds of bundled-up protesters faced tense standoffs with federal immigration officers and a confrontation between anti- and pro-ICE demonstrators near City Hall.
    


            Protests intensified after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, in her car earlier this month. Her killing has sparked protests across the country and fueled outrage at President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, which has seen armed and masked agents employing aggressive tactics in targeted campaigns across US cities. The outrage deepened last week when another federal agent shot a Venezuelan man in the leg who the Department of Homeland Security said was “violently” resisting arrest.
    


            Walz gave the initial order for the state National Guard to support local law enforcement the day after Good was killed.
    


            Demonstrators chanted and waved signs in downtown Minneapolis and outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building on Saturday despite brutally cold weather. Extra measures were put in place in downtown Minneapolis with blocked roads and at least one hotel bolstering security due to the protests.
    


            At the Whipple federal building, a large group of federal officers clad in riot gear moved toward protesters, who responded with chants of expletives and boos. Some protesters urged restraint, calling on the crowd to stay together.
    


            CNN observed several protesters detained by federal law enforcement near the building. The demonstrations appeared largely peaceful, and it was not immediately clear what led to the detentions. CNN has reached out to DHS for comment.
    


            Personnel from the Hennepin County Sheriff's Department were also present but told CNN in the evening they did not detain or arrest anyone at Saturday's protests. Sheriff's deputies' vehicles were used to block parts of the street from demonstrators and deputies appeared to mostly remain in their cars.
    


            Earlier in the day, conservative influencer Jake Lang led a small group supporting ICE in what was dubbed the “March Against Minnesota Fraud” near City Hall but was outnumbered and chased away by a much larger group of counter-demonstrators, CNN affiliate KARE reported. The Minneapolis Police Department told CNN Saturday evening they gave a dispersal order but made no arrests and the crowd “eventually dispersed without incident.”
    


            Lang said on social media before the event he intended to “burn a Quran” on the steps of City Hall, but it's unclear whether that happened, according to The Associated Press. He appeared to have bruises and scrapes on his head as he left the area Saturday, the AP reported. Lang, who recently announced plans to run for US Senate in Florida, is among the January 6 defendants granted clemency by President Trump. He was charged with assaulting an officer with a baseball bat, civil disorder and other crimes, the AP reported.

            Demonstrations are continuing with new restrictions placed on federal agents under a preliminary injunction from a judge on Friday.
    


            Federal agents cannot arrest or detain peaceful protesters or deploy certain crowd-control measures against them, according to US District Judge Katherine Menendez's ruling. Menendez also said agents can no longer stop and detain drivers when there is “no reasonable articulable suspicion” they are forcibly obstructing or interfering with federal operations, noting, “The act of safely following” the officers “at an appropriate distance does not, by itself, create reasonable suspicion to justify a vehicle stop.”
    


            The restrictions apply to personnel carrying out the Trump administration's Operation Metro Surge, which began last month and involves thousands of federal agents dispatched to the Twin Cities to target undocumented Somali immigrants.
    


            The city of Minneapolis responded with a statement saying, “As this is a federal court order, we expect the federal administration to change course and comply for the safety of all.”
    


            Responding to the ruling, assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said agents follow training and use “the minimum amount of force necessary to protect themselves, the public, and federal property” from what the department called “dangerous rioters.”
    


            Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino issued a similar statement on X, alleging “agitators” in Minneapolis have assaulted and thrown objects at officers and rammed law enforcement vehicles.
    


            “We will continue enforcing the law, making arrests, and keeping Minneapolis safe. Undeterred. Unapologetic,” Bovino said, without specifically references the judge's ruling.
    


            The preliminary injunction stems from a lawsuit filed by activists and is separate from a lawsuit filed Monday by the state of Minnesota and the Twin Cities over the federal government's Operation Metro Surge.
    


            The escalating legal battles come amid word the Department of Justice is investigating Walz and Frey over possible obstruction of federal law enforcement, sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            Frey said Sunday he has not received a subpoena or any official notice about the investigation and is not aware of specific allegations.
    


            The mayor, Walz and other Democrats decried the reported investigation, accusing the Trump administration of weaponizing the DOJ to target political opponents.

            It's not often that Europe speaks with one voice – or responds with such urgency.
    


            But US President Donald Trump's announcement Saturday of sanctions against several European countries that reject any US claim to Greenland, a Danish territory, was one of those moments.
    


            An emergency meeting of EU ambassadors will take place in Brussels on Sunday in response to Trump's threat, which he made after an estimated quarter of the population of Greenland's capital Nuuk joined protests against any potential annexation.
    


            Across the continent, among allies that usually tread carefully in responding to utterances from the White House, the response was immediate and emphatic, and recognized an existential threat to the transatlantic alliance.
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron, who has tried to cultivate a good personal relationship with Trump, led the charge – describing the threat of tariffs as “unacceptable.”
    


            “No intimidation or threat will influence us – neither in Ukraine, nor in Greenland, nor anywhere else in the world when we are confronted with such situations,” he said on X.
    


            “Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld.”
    


            UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer chimed in, saying in a statement that “applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong.”
    


            Even Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has typically had positive relations with the US President, described the move as an “error” in a handout video from a state visit to South Korea.
    


            Revealing she had already had a phone conversation with Trump, Meloni said she “doesn't agree” with the idea of imposing tariffs against countries that contribute to Greenland's security.
    


            Eight European countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany and France, issued a joint statement Sunday saying that, “tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response.”
    


            Trump, in a lengthy social media post Saturday, said the United States needed possession of Greenland to counter Chinese and Russian threats in the Arctic and develop what he has called the Golden Dome to protect North America from ballistic missiles.
    


            Experts say that the US does not need to own Greenland for the Dome to be effective, thanks to a 1951 agreement that gives the US the right to build defense facilities on the island.
    


            The Pituffik Space Base, which US Vice President JD Vance visited last March, is focused on missile warning, space surveillance, and satellite command and control missions.
    


            European politicians said Trump's unilateralism over Greenland, and his treatment of long-standing allies, was playing into Moscow and Beijing's hands.
    


            “China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among allies,” said EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas.
    


            Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez took a similar line. In an interview with Spanish newspaper La Vanguardia, he said any military action ‍by the U.S. against Denmark's vast Arctic ‌island would damage NATO and delight Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            It would make Putin “the happiest man in the world. Why? Because it would legitimize his attempted invasion of Ukraine,” he said.
    


            “If the United States were to use force, it would be the death knell for NATO. Putin would be doubly happy,” Sanchez warned.
    


            “The measures against NATO allies announced today will not help in ensuring security in the Arctic,” said the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola on X. “They risk the opposite, emboldening our joint enemies and those who wish to destroy our common values and way of life.”
    


            One casualty of the tariff threat may be the US-EU trade deal agreed last year, which the European Parliament was set to debate this week. The leader of the largest group in the assembly, Manfred Weber, said on X that “given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage.”
    


            There have been plenty of occasions during both Trump administrations that European governments have reeled in shock at the rhetoric from the White House and then embarked on careful damage limitation.
    


            But many Europeans recognize in the second Trump administration a far more strident tone, beginning when Vance excoriated Europe as woke, soft on immigration and anti-democratic in a speech at the Munich Security Conference last February.
    


            Trump's National Security Strategy in November doubled down on the scorn. “It is far from obvious whether certain European countries will have economies and militaries strong enough to remain reliable allies” two decades from now, it said.
    


            The document sneered at what it called the “stark prospect of civilizational erasure” in Europe, claiming “censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence.”
    


            And earlier this month, Trump's deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CNN's Jake Tapper, “We live in a world, in the real world… that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power.”
    


            “For the United States to secure the Arctic region, to protect and defend NATO and NATO interests, obviously, Greenland should be part of the United States,” Miller added.
    


            Essentially, in this White House, a strong transatlantic relationship is no longer thought critical to US national security or its dominance of the Western hemisphere.
    


            But strong words from the capitals of Europe are just that: The challenge is to build greater self-reliance in defense and security, a process that takes decades rather than months.
    


            In the meantime, some may recall then UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill's exasperation over the planning for D-Day, the operation that would liberate Western Europe from Nazi Germany.
    


            “There is only one thing worse than fighting with allies, and that is fighting without them,” Churchill said later.

            What was once a place of worship filled with precious objects packed with meaning now sits in heavy layers of dark soot, burdened by the pungent smell of smoke after someone set fire to Mississippi's largest and oldest synagogue.
    


            A 19-year-old suspect confessed just hours after last weekend's blaze to attacking the historic temple “due to (the) building's Jewish ties,” the FBI said. He faces federal and state charges and, if convicted, could serve up to 60 years in prison.
    


A baseball player and honor student: What we know about the teen who confessed to burning Mississippi's oldest synagogue



            Now, the Beth Israel Congregation in Jackson – founded before the Civil War and bombed in 1967 amid the Civil Rights Movement – is closed indefinitely as restoration and recovery begin inside its historical walls.
    


            Part of that hard work includes finding important religious artifacts, some dating back decades, that were damaged or destroyed in the alleged arson and trying to revive them or to retire them respectfully.
    


            On the outside of the Beth Israel synagogue, which serves some 150 families, boards cover windows that stretch nearly from floor to ceiling, and soot stains concrete.
    


            Inside, the fire's wrath spared nothing, marking nearly every surface with smoke residue.
    


            When Zach Shemper, the congregation's president, arrived at the temple after the fire, he went straight to the sanctuary, where the Torahs – heavy scrolls of the Jewish holy books – were kept.
    


            “First thing I did when I got here after the fire was remove our Torahs and wrapped them up and put them in my truck for safekeeping,” he said.
    


            The holy texts were moved to a church, Shemper said, where they've been unrolled to air out from the smoke.
    


            The Torahs will be stored until a master sofer – a highly skilled scribe qualified to repair Torahs – can evaluate and return them to kosher status, explained Sheila Hailey, the congregation's executive director.
    


            To be kosher, a Torah cannot have any damage and its letters must all be legible, Hailey said, adding it also must be on parchment sewn together and rolled onto wooden spindles.
    


            The fire ignited in the synagogue's library – where religious texts had filled wooden, built-in bookshelves highly susceptible to fire – and left extensive damage, Charles Felton, chief of investigations for the Jackson Fire Department's arson division said.

            It made the space nearly unrecognizable: those same shelves were left bare as charred, decades-old prayer book pages littered the soot-filled floor and shattered glass rested under a window the suspect broke to get in, according to the FBI's criminal complaint.
    


            Jewish custom calls for holy texts to get a respectful burial, rather than simply being tossed out. So, after the temple is remediated, the prayer books and what's left of their pages will be collected, commemorated with a funeral and interred, Shemper said.
    


            Along a library wall, an ornate cabinet with glass doors known in Judaism as an Ark held two Torahs that were almost completely incinerated, he showed CNN this week.
    


            “As you can see by everything,” Shemper said, pausing, “it's totally destroyed.”
    


            The flames then moved toward the sanctuary, where congregants worshipped. Pews were left heavily soiled in black.
    


            “I want to cry. I'm disgusted,” Shemper said as he surveyed the damage. “I've never had to deal with something like this. I've never even experienced the feelings that I'm feeling right now.”
    


            The heat from the fire was so overwhelming, all but one of hundreds of small brass plates that made up the temple's Tree of Life art installation succumbed to the flames. The display, a common Judaic symbol, represented moments of celebration within the congregation, Shemper said.
    


            Also damaged was a decades-old sculpture of Moses, one of Judaism's greatest prophets who is often credited with receiving the Torah from God and writing it down.
    


            The sculpture, which survived the 1967 bombing by Ku Klux Klan members, remained intact after the fire, Hailey said. But in short order, its head broke off its body, chipped and got covered in ash.
    


            Repairing this holy space could take at least a year, until which several churches have opened their doors to Beth Israel, Shemper said. Amid the devastation, the synagogue's congregation is committed to maintaining Jewish community in Jackson and is ready to rebuild, Michele Schipper said, one of temple's past presidents.
    


            Digging through rubble, Shemper searched for a Jewish musical instrument called a “shofar” that's used on holy days like Rosh Hashanah. He knew the piece, made from an animal horn, had been on a nearby shelf.
    


            But after sifting through soot on the floor, Shemper could not find it.
    


            “I don't know how hot something has to get,” he said, “for a ram's horn to burn.”

DENVER (AP) — Josh Allen knows all about heartbreaking losses in the playoffs. After yet another one Saturday, he stood at a microphone and wiped away tears.

This might have been the best chance for Allen and the Bills to get to the Super Bowl. He's heard that, too, and after he committed four of Buffalo's five turnovers in a 33-30 loss to Denver in the divisional round of the AFC playoffs, he had to answer questions about coming up short yet again.

“Extremely difficult,” Allen said, while choking back tears. “I felt like I let my teammates down.”

For a change, there was no Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs in his way, no Lamar Jackson and the Ravens or Joe Burrow and the Bengals. Only Bo Nix and the top-seeded but unproven Denver Broncos. Denver turned all those turnovers into 16 points, including the game-ending 23-yard field goal by Wil Lutz.

Allen watched Lutz's field goal sail through the uprights, then quickly hopped up, headed onto the field and then into the locker room. He will watch as the Broncos move on to face either New England or Houston without Nix, who broke his right ankle late in overtime and will have surgery that will sideline him for the rest of the playoffs.

“Can't win with five turnovers,” said Allen, who threw two interceptions and lost two fumbles. “You shoot yourself in the foot like that you don't deserve to win football games.”




The Bills, who beat Jacksonville in the wild-card round, became the first NFL team to win a playoff game in six straight seasons without capturing a Super Bowl. Allen's eight playoff wins are most for any QB in the Super Bowl era who hasn't played in a Super Bowl.

What's more, Allen became the second player in the last 20 postseasons with two or more interceptions and at least two lost fumbles, joining Arizona's Carson Palmer, who accomplished the feat against the Panthers in the 2015 NFC championship game.

The thought could be dawning on Allen and Bills fans that it's no longer inevitable that he'll hoist a Lombardi Trophy someday. Last season's MVP, who often seems to will the Bills to victory by himself, turns 30 in May.

“I haven't been doing a lot of talking other than I love my teammates,” said Allen, who threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns while running for 66 yards. “Extremely sorry and disappointed.”

Bills coach Sean McDermott defended Allen, who lost a fumble on a scramble in the closing seconds of the first half to set up a long field goal by Denver to make it 20-10.

“No, it's not on him,” McDermott said. “We had opportunities — all of us — and I'm extremely proud of him. He's a tremendous person, tremendous leader, tremendous quarterback. Yeah, there are plays we all want back.”

One of the plays that had McDermott miffed after the game occurred midway through overtime, when Allen's long pass to Brandin Cooks was wrestled away by Broncos cornerback Ja'Quan McMillian for an interception. McDermott thought Cooks had possession and down by contact.

McDermott called timeout to get the officials to at least take a longer look at the play. Had Cooks caught the ball, the Bills would have been well within field-goal range.

“It's hard for me to understand why it was ruled the way it was ruled,” McDermott said. “And if it is ruled that way, then why wasn't it slowed down, just to make sure that we have this right. That would've made a lot of sense to me. To make sure we have this thing right.

“I'm saying it because I'm standing up for Buffalo ... I'm standing up for us. What went on is not how it should go down.”

Referee Carl Cheffers explained to a pool reporter: “The receiver has to complete the process of a catch. He was going to the ground as part of the process of the catch and he lost possession of the ball when he hit the ground. The defender gained possession of it at that point. The defender is the one that completed the process of the catch, so the defender was awarded the ball.”

After the pick, the Broncos drove the ball deep into Bills territory courtesy of a pair of pass-interference calls, one on Taron Johnson and another from Tre'Davious White, who also drew an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty. Those flags got the Broncos so close that Lutz's game-ending kick was a formality.

“It's going to stick with me for a long time,” Allen said. “Losing in the playoffs is not fun.”

John Harbaugh agreed Saturday to become coach of the New York Giants, finalizing the big-market, longstanding franchise's all-out pursuit of its top candidate.

Owners John Mara and Steve Tisch made the hire official less than 72 hours after a lengthy interview and dinner with Harbaugh that sealed the deal. The sides began working on a contract Wednesday night when it was clear Harbaugh was a fit and he canceled meetings with other teams.

Harbaugh is expected to report directly to ownership, rather than general manager Joe Schoen.

“To serve as this franchise's head coach is a tremendous honor,” Harbaugh said in a statement. “I come from a football family, and I have deep respect for the history and tradition of this organization.”

Harbaugh joins the Giants less than two weeks after he was fired by the Baltimore Ravens, who made the playoffs 12 times in 18 seasons with him in charge and won the Super Bowl in the 2012 season. Baltimore fell short of the postseason this year because of a missed kick at the buzzer in the season finale, leading ownership to make an change and put Harbaugh on the market.

Schoen and the Giants pounced, bringing on a proven winner. Harbaugh was flown in on co-owner Steve Tisch's private plane earlier this week, spent several hours at the team facility in East Rutherford, New Jersey, spoke with young quarterback Jaxson Dart and got wined and dined at nearby Elia Mediterranean Restaurant.

With the courting process complete, Harbaugh is now tasked with turning around the beleaguered franchise that has made just two playoff appearances over the past 12 years and not made it past the divisional round. Todd Monken could follow him from Baltimore to be offensive coordinator, unless he takes a head-coaching gig in Cleveland or elsewhere.




“Joe Schoen presented us an outstanding group of candidates, which allowed us to be deliberate and confident in this decision,” Mara said. “Through numerous conversations, John consistently stood out for his conviction and vision for leading a winning organization.”

Harbaugh got the job over the likes of Kevin Stefanski, Mike McCarthy, Raheem Morris and Antonio Pierce, leapfrogging some expected front-runners who got shuffled back as soon as the 63-year-old became available. The chance to work for stable ownership and Dart made New York an attractive landing spot over places such as Tennessee, Atlanta and Miami.

“John is a proven winner whose teams are disciplined, resilient, and prepared,” Tisch said. “His passion for the game, his ability to connect with players, and his experience leading at the highest level made him an outstanding fit for us, and we're excited to move forward together.”

The Giants have talented pieces in place on either side of the ball, including running back Cam Skattebo, receiver Malik Nabers and left tackle Andrew Thomas on offense, plus pass rushers Brian Burns and Abdul Carter and nose tackle Dexter Lawrence on defense. They have the fifth pick in the draft to add to that stockpile.

Changing the culture of losing that has pervaded the Meadowlands for the better part of the last decade is now on Harbaugh's shoulders. Counting playoff games, the seven coaches who followed 2007 and '11 Super Bowl champion Tom Coughlin have gone 45-105-1, a winning percentage of .300.

Harbaugh is 193-124 in 317 games, a .609 winning percentage, since taking over the Ravens in 2008. He spent the previous 10 seasons as an assistant with Philadelphia, mostly as special teams coordinator and then defensive backs coach.

Schoen, after finding out from Tisch and co-owner John Mara that he was returning for a fifth year as GM, said the search would not be limited to just offensive- or defensive-minded options. While Harbaugh comes from a special teams background, he provides the kind of all-around coaching Schoen was believed to be looking for, along with a championship pedigree and a reputation that should garner him immediate respect within the locker room.

This is Schoen's second hire after bringing Brian Daboll with him from Buffalo, where both were assistants with the Bills, in January 2022. Ownership fired Daboll on Nov. 10 after the Giants lost eight of the first 10 games in his fourth season as coach.

Mike Kafka coached out the string as the interim replacement after being promoted from offensive coordinator, and the team lost five in a row before winning its final two games to finish with a 4-13 record. Kafka interviewed but was never a serious candidate for the full-time job.

Almost no one was compared with Harbaugh, giving the Giants an off-field win that might be their biggest of any kind in several years.

“Throughout our conversations, John stood out for his clarity, competitiveness and approach for building a sustainable winning program,” Schoen said. “He has a strong track record of developing players, building cohesive staffs, and setting a clear standard of accountability. We are excited to work with John in moving this team in the right direction.”

TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — A journalist in Taiwan was detained on allegations of bribing army officers to provide military information to people from mainland China, as the self-ruled island cracks down on potential infiltration from Beijing. 

Taiwan's Qiaotou District Prosecutors Office said in a statement that a district court ordered the detention of a television reporter and five current and retired military officers. Saturday's statement didn't identify the journalist, only using the surname Lin. 

Meanwhile, CTi TV separately said one of its reporters, Lin Chen-you, has been detained and that it wasn't aware of the case details, urging a fair judicial process. 

Prosecutors accuse Lin of paying amounts ranging from several thousand to tens of thousands of Taiwan dollars (tens to hundreds of U.S. dollars) to current military officers in exchange for their providing information to “Chinese individuals.” The office didn't specify who the Chinese people were or whether they were linked to the Chinese government. 

Authorities raided the premises of the reporter and nine current and retired military personnel on Friday as part of an investigation into violations of Taiwan's national security and corruption laws and disclosure of confidential information. CTi said that its offices were not raided.

According to Lin's Facebook page, he is a political reporter and anchor covering the island's legislature.

While Taiwan regularly pursues espionage cases within the government and military, allegations against journalists are unusual.




CTi News has been an online news outlet since Taiwan's National Communications Commission refused to renew its cable television license in 2020, citing repeated violations and increasing complaints. A court later overturned the commission's decision, but the legal row is still ongoing following appeals.

Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and threatens to take control of the island by force if necessary, has been increasing military pressure against the island. Last month, China's military launched large-scale drills around it for two days after a Washington announcement of large-scale arms sales to Taiwan.

China and Taiwan have been governed separately since 1949, when the Communist Party rose to power in Beijing following a civil war. Defeated Nationalist Party forces fled to Taiwan, which later transitioned from martial law to multiparty democracy.

CAIRO (AP) — A dividing line, at times invisible, can mean life or death for Palestinians in Gaza.

Those sheltering near the territory's “yellow line” that the Israeli military withdrew to as part of the October ceasefire say they live in fear as Israeli soldiers direct near-daily fire at anyone who crosses or even lingers near it.

Of the 447 Palestinians killed between the ceasefire taking effect and Tuesday, at least 77 were killed by Israeli gunfire near the line, including 62 who crossed it, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Among them were teenagers and young children, The Associated Press found.

And although the military has placed some yellow barrels and concrete barriers delineating the limits of the Palestinian zone, the line is still unmarked in certain places and in others was laid nearly half a kilometer (0.3 miles) deeper than what was agreed to in the ceasefire deal, expanding the part of Gaza that Israel controls, according to Palestinians and mapping experts.




“We stay away from the barrels. No one dares to get close” said Gaza City resident Ahmed Abu Jahal, noting that the markers are less than 100 meters (110 yards) from his house — instead of the roughly 500 meters (546 yards) outlined in a map put out by the Israeli military.

As of Tuesday, the military had acknowledged killing 57 people around the yellow line, saying most were militants. It said its troops are complying with the rules of engagement in order to counter militant groups, and are informing Palestinians of the line's location and marking it on the ground to “reduce friction and prevent misunderstandings.”





Under the ceasefire, Israel withdrew its troops to a buffer zone that is up to 7 kilometers (4 miles) deep and includes most of Gaza's arable land, its elevated points and all of its border crossings. That hems more than 2 million Palestinians into a strip along the coastline and central Gaza.

People of all ages, some already dead, have been showing up almost daily at the emergency room of Gaza City's Al-Ahli hospital with bullet wounds from straying near the line, said hospital director Fadel Naeem.

Amid the vast destruction in Gaza, the demarcation line often isn't easy to detect, Naeem said. He recounted picking his way through undamaged paths during a recent visit to the southern city of Khan Younis. He didn't notice he was almost across the line until locals shouted at him to turn back, he said.




The Israeli military said most of the people it has killed crossing the line posed a threat to its troops. According to a military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military rules, troops issue audible warnings and then fire warning shots whenever someone crosses the line. Many civilians retreat when warning shots are fired, though some have been killed, the official acknowledged.





Zaher Shamia, 17, lived with his grandfather in a tent 300 meters (330 yards) from the line in northern Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp. On Dec. 10, he was playing with his cousin and some friends near the line, according to video he took before his death.

Suddenly, shots rang out and the video stopped. Soldiers approaching the line with an armored bulldozer had fired on the teens, hitting Zaher, said a witness.

A neighbor eventually found Zaher's body, which had been crushed by the bulldozer, said Zaher's grandfather, Kamal al-Beih: “We only recognized him from his head.”

Two doctors, Mohamed Abu Selmiya and Rami Mhanna, confirmed that the teen had been killed by gunshots and then run over by a bulldozer. The military official said he was aware that Shamia was a civilian and that the military was looking into it.

Maram Atta said that on Dec. 7, her 3-year-old daughter, Ahed al-Bayouk, was playing with siblings outside of their tent, which was near the yellow line along Gaza's southern coast. Atta was preparing lentils when she heard aircraft overhead, then shots.

A stray projectile whizzed close to her and struck Ahed, who was dead before they reached the clinic.

“I lost my daughter to what they keep calling a ‘ceasefire'” said Atta, crying. “What ceasefire are they talking about?”

A military official denied the killing.



The line's exact location is ambiguous, differing on maps put out by the Israeli military and the White House.

Neither matches the line troops appear to be marking on the ground, according to Palestinians and geolocation specialists.

Chris Osiek, an open source intelligence analyst and consultant, has geolocated a number of yellow blocks based on social media videos. He found at least four urban areas where troops set the blocks several hundred meters deeper into Gaza than the military map-specified yellow line.

“This is basically what you get when you simply let Trump make an image and post it on Truth Social and let the IDF make their own,” he said, using the acronym for the military. “If it's not a proper system, with coordinates that make it easy for people to navigate where it is, then you leave the ambiguity free for the IDF to interpret the yellow line how they basically want.”

The military official dismissed such criticism, saying any deviations from the map amount to just a few meters. But to Palestinians hemmed in by widespread destruction and displacement, every few meters lost is another house that can't be sheltered in — another they doubt will ever be returned.





Under the ceasefire, Israeli forces are only supposed to remain at the yellow line until a fuller withdrawal, though the agreement doesn't give a timeline for that. With the next steps in the deal lagging and troops digging into positions on the Israeli side, though, Palestinians wonder if they are witnessing a permanent land takeover.




In December, Israel's defense minister described the yellow line as “a new border line — serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”

The military has continued leveling buildings inside the Israeli-held zone, turning already damaged neighborhoods to moonscapes. Almost all of the city of Rafah, on Gaza's border with Egypt, has been razed over the past year. The army says this is necessary to destroy tunnels and prepare the area for reconstruction.

In some places, demolitions since the ceasefire have encroached beyond the official yellow line. Since November, troops have leveled a swath of Gaza City's Tuffah neighborhood extending some 300 meters (330 yards) outside the Israeli-held zone, according to Oct. 14 and Dec. 18 satellite photos provided by Planet Labs.

Abu Jahal moved back to his damaged house in Tuffah at the ceasefire's start. He said he frequently saw new yellow barrels appear and the military forcing out anyone living on its side of the markers.

On Jan. 7, Israeli fire hit a house near him, and the residents had to evacuate, he said. Abu Jahal said his family — including his wife, their child, and seven other relatives — may also have to leave soon.

“The line is getting very close,” he said.

'Squad' member Rep. Ilhan Omar described the Minneapolis protester shot by an ICE agent as 'peacefully waving cars to get by' as new videos emerge of the incident and tensions escalate. The 'Outnumbered' panel reacts.

President Donald Trump lashed out at Minnesota Democrats on social media Sunday, saying they were using the ongoing federal operations to distract from the state's massive fraud issue.

Trump made the statement on his Truth Social media platform, saying federal agents in Minneapolis and St. Paul were targeting ""violent criminals.""

""ICE is removing some of the most violent criminals in the World from our Country, and bring them back home, where they belong. Why is Minnesota fighting this? Do they really want murderers and drug dealers to be ensconced in their community? The thugs that are protesting include many highly paid professional agitators and anarchists. Is this really what Minnesota wants?"" Trump wrote.

Trump went on to call out Gov. Tim Walz and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., saying they ""don't mind because it keeps the focus of attention off the 18 Billion Dollar, Plus, FRAUD, that has taken place in the State!"" 

""Don't worry, we're on it!"" Trump added.

Federal agents have faced harassment and protests from agitators in Minnesota in recent weeks. Federal prosecutors are investigating both Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for allegedly impeding law enforcement efforts in the blue state.

U.S. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News the duo's anti-ICE rhetoric was teetering on a federal crime.

""When the governor or the mayor threaten our officers, when the mayor suggests that he's encouraging citizens to call 911 when they see ICE officers, that is very close to a federal crime,"" Blanche said.

Bondi added on X, ""A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law.""

Walz responded to the news on Friday by accusing the Trump administration of ""weaponizing the justice system.""

""Two days ago, it was Elissa Slotkin. Last week it was Jerome Powell. Before that, Mark Kelly,"" Walz wrote in an X post. ""Weaponizing the justice system against your opponents is an authoritarian tactic. The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.""

Frey also weighed in on social media, asserting he ""will not be intimidated.""

""This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city,"" Frey wrote on X. ""I will not be intimidated. My focus remains where it's always been: keeping our city safe.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, special envoy to Greenland, tells 'Fox & Friends' that everyone on the U.S. East Coast 'should be concerned' about the security of the Arctic region.

More than half a dozen European countries warned in a joint statement on Sunday that tariff threats over Greenland undermine transatlantic relations as the White House seeks to pressure allies into a deal to acquire the Arctic island.

The statement, issued by Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom, said the countries remain committed to strengthening Arctic security and are prepared to engage in dialogue grounded in respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.

""Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,"" the statement said in part. ""We are committed to upholding our sovereignty.""

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members said they also stand in ""full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland.""

The statement comes after President Donald Trump threatened on his Truth Social platform to impose a 10% tariff on the eight countries unless a deal is reached for what he called the ""complete and total purchase of Greenland.""

Trump said the 10% tariff would go into effect on Feb. 2 and could rise to 25% on June 1. 

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned Trump's post Saturday on social media.

Kristersson wrote on X that allies would not be ""blackmailed.""

""Only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland,"" he said, adding that other European Union (EU) countries were discussing a coordinated response.

Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, also voiced concern over Trump's remarks, warning that Russia and China were ""having a field day"" and stood to benefit from divisions within NATO.

""If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO. Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity,"" she said. ""We also cannot let our dispute distract us from our core task of helping to end Russia's war against Ukraine.""

Trump has repeatedly said the United States needs Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory, for ""national security"" purposes.

Greenland's natural resource wealth has also long-drawn strategic interest, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a January report, noting the territory is rich in iron ore, graphite, tungsten, palladium, vanadium, zinc, gold, uranium, copper and oil.

Greenland's leaders, however, have firmly rejected any suggestion the territory's future or sovereignty is open to negotiation.

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on Facebook Thursday that the territory is ""not for sale"" and will not be owned or governed by the U.S.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said the Trump administration's efforts to ""seize"" the territory of an ally were ""beyond stupid.""

A routine parking lot project at Dinosaur National Monument has unearthed dinosaur fossils at the site for the first time in more than a century.

Workers uncovered the fossils near the Quarry Exhibit Hall after removing asphalt in mid-September, exposing dinosaur-bearing sandstone, the National Park Service said. Park staff identified the remains on Sept. 16 and immediately halted construction to allow paleontologists to assess the find.

The fossils are believed to belong to a large, long-necked dinosaur called the Diplodocus. The species is commonly found in the area's historic bonebed.

Park officials said staff members, a Utah Conservation Corps crew, volunteers and construction workers helped excavate the remains.

Between mid-September and mid-October, crews removed roughly 3,000 pounds of fossils and surrounding rock. The material is now being cleaned and studied at the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum in Vernal, where visitors can watch the preparation process in the museum's fossil lab.

The site had not been excavated since 1924, when fossil removal efforts ended after a series of early 20th-century digs led by the Carnegie Museum, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History and the University of Utah. Dinosaur National Monument was established in 1915.

Some of the newly uncovered fossils are already on display at the Quarry Exhibit Hall, often called the ""Wall of Bones,"" as well as at the Utah Field House museum. The exhibit hall is the park's most popular attraction and sits atop the original Carnegie quarry, where visitors can view about 1,500 dinosaur fossils still embedded in rock.

White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller explains how federal law applies regarding Minnesota and illegal immigration on 'My View with Lara Trump.'

President Donald Trump's administration is preparing 1,500 troops for potential deployment to Minnesota, a senior U.S. official confirmed to Fox News.

The official says the U.S. Army's 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska and specializes in cold-weather and mountain warfare, has given prepare to deploy orders. The Washington Post was first to report the Pentagon's readiness.

""The Department of War is always prepared to execute the orders of the Commander-in-Chief if called upon.,"" Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement to Fox News.

Trump on Thursday threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy U.S. military forces to Minnesota if state officials do not start cracking down on anti-ICE agitators.

""If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

Minneapolis and St. Paul are already hosting some 3,000 federal agents deployed there after a massive fraud scandal rocked the state late last year.

Protesters across the Twin Cities have followed and harassed federal agents as they carry out operations, leading to confrontations and the killing of activist Renee Nicole Good by federal agents in the opening days of January.

Trump toned down the pressure in a statement on Friday, saying he did not see at that point a reason to invoke the Insurrection Act.

""I believe it was Bush, the elder Bush, he used it, I think 28 times,"" Trump told reporters while departing the White House. ""It's been used a lot. And if I needed it, I'd use it. I don't think there's any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I'd use it. It's very powerful.""

The readiness order for the 11th Airborne Division was given prior to the Friday statement.

The Insurrection Act reportedly has not been invoked since the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which began after four police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King.

Despite Trump's threat, some Republicans are resistant to the idea of using the centuries-old law.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., seemed to downplay Trump's threat, placing his hope in local law enforcement's ability to ""settle things down.""

""Hopefully the local officials working with not only the federal law enforcement, ICE and other agencies, but also the local law enforcement officials, will be able to settle things down,"" Thune told reporters.

Ran Gvili's father Itzik Gvili joins 'Fox & Friends First' as the family meets President Trump at Mar-a-Lago, pleading for action to bring their son home and warning that a 'deal without Rani is not a deal.'

FIRST ON FOX: Multiple documents released by Argentine President Javier Milei last year reveal how Argentina's search for Nazi war criminals, who found refuge in the country during and after the Second World War, were able to avoid arrest and, for the most part, live ordinary lives.

While Argentina's Peronist government sympathized and often knew of Nazi criminals hiding in their territory – often under their auspices – once the populist regime fell, the South American nation half-heartedly tried to keep tabs on the war criminals hiding there. 

Though many high-profile cases went nowhere, the case of Hitler's henchman Martin Bormann is exemplary in showing how inefficient Argentina was in its investigations.

ARGENTINA REVEALS SECRET WWII FILES ON HITLER'S HENCHMEN WHO FLED BEFORE, AFTER THE WAR

Bormann was one of the most powerful figures in the Nazi regime, despite his relatively low profile to the public. He used his position as private secretary to Hitler and head of the Nazi Party Chancellery to control the flow of documents personally received by Hitler and who had access to him.

Through enormous administrative influence, he shaped policy and controlled what Hitler saw, who he met, and advised on major decisions. Bormann supported extreme antisemitic measures and was one of the masterminds of the Aryanization project. Bormann disappeared in May 1945 during the fall of Berlin. For decades, it was speculated he had fled to Argentina along the ratlines — escape routes facilitated by Nazi sympathizers. Bormann was sentenced to death in absentia during the Nuremberg Trials.

The files show that Bormann was one of the very few Nazis the Argentinians actively tried to pursue and bring to justice. However, most of the leads came from sensationalist press articles often devoid of factual and actionable intelligence beyond the mere mention that he was hiding in Argentina.

The files meticulously depict intelligence agencies trying to corroborate such reports and assert whether the floated false aliases matched the actual man in Argentina. Agencies followed information coming from reports in the Argentine, U.S., British and Brazilian press, along with some translations from German-language media published in Argentina by the émigré community who were suspected of harboring Nazi sympathizers.

The articles triggered extensive paper trails between the ministry of justice, intelligence bodies, border and customs agencies, the federal police, and local authorities, but were often disconnected from one another, or took a long time to be referred to the various sub-offices for action.

As a result, multiple similar searches were carried out at various points haphazardly and a tangle of bureaucracy made authorities play catch up to press reports rather than conduct independent and rational investigations. The files are a testament that the hunt for Nazis in South America was shaped by rumor, miscommunication, mistaken identities, Cold War politics and intense media speculation.

Some of the information reviewed by Fox News Digital showed authorities took rumors such as a hunt for Bormann in the jungles of Peru, Colombia and Brazil as credible. A case of an elderly German man detained in Colombia in 1972 as Bormann (later cleared and released) despite voiced skepticism by Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal is also part of the files.

The diplomatic shockwaves that followed Israel's Mossad seizing Adolf Eichmann in Argentina left local officials acutely sensitive to international scrutiny, recasting the search for Bormann as a bid to ensure the country would not be embarrassed on the world stage a second time.

A pivotal—and ultimately flawed—lead in the Bormann files emerged in 1955, when police, relying on fading testimonies about an illegal German laborer, along with rumors, seized correspondence and aging witnesses, began pursuing a man named Walter Wilhelm Flegel.

Flegel had arrived through Chile, was missing an arm due to an accident, and had been previously arrested and brought to court twice on assault and robbery charges. Suspicions led to his arrest in Mendoza in 1960 despite his complete dissemblance, lack of education, long presence in the country, age gaps and missing factual connections that could tie him to Bormann. Notwithstanding such mismatching profiles — and fingerprints — it still took a week for Argentinians to be convinced Flegel was not Bormann and free him.

Ultimately, despite continued rumors, and Argentina's singular resolve in finally arresting one of the many Nazi fugitives thought to be in the country, human remains found in Berlin in 1972 were a match and confirmed Bormann's death during the city's fall through dental and cranial records. Later, in the 1990s, further DNA testing confirmed the remains found in Berlin indeed belonged to Bormann, bringing the misdirected Argentinian search finally to a close.

A man was seen on video allegedly being chased into a parking garage and struck in the head with a flagpole by a mob of apparent anti-ICE agitators, as violent protests unfolded Saturday afternoon in Minneapolis.

The mob continued following the unidentified man, who was walking to a car in the garage to leave, and allegedly pepper sprayed a gash on his head and struck the wound with their hands.

""I'm trying to be done, but you guys keep harassing me,"" he told the crowd, his jacket soaked with blood.

A protester could be heard shouting into a megaphone, ""Hey no seriously, this guy needs medical help—he needs mental help. The bleeding is natural for Nazis, but he needs mental help.""

""F--- you Nazi,"" agitators shouted as they followed him into the garage.

One woman could be heard asking if the bloodied man needed help, to which he calmly replied, ""No, I'm good. Thank you though, I appreciate you.""

As he got into the car and sped away, the mob slammed on the doors and hit the vehicle with flagpoles.

It is unclear what led to the violent encounter.

Earlier in the day, pardoned Jan. 6 rioter Jake Lang was seen on video being dragged away from a demonstration by protesters.

Footage showed Lang bleeding from the back of the head as he stumbled through a crowd surrounding him.

Lang, who was pardoned after participating in the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, was allegedly taking part in the Americans Against Islamification (AAI)'s ""Crusader March on ‘Little Somalia,'"" with the intention of burning a Quran at Minneapolis City Hall, when the incident took place.

Lang was seen on video trying to get into the back seat of an apparent good Samaritan's car, as agitators pulled the door back open, kicking into the vehicle.

A woman in the passenger seat could be heard telling protesters, ""We don't know him, stop hitting our car.""

Following the incident, Lang took to X, claiming he was also stabbed during the incident, but a plate carrier he was wearing blocked the attack.

""I was just literally LYNCHED by an anti white mob of liberals & illegal immigrants- I'm at the hospital now getting staples in my skull… Nearly ripped limb from limb in Minneapolis!!!!"" Lang wrote in a post. ""[Minneapolis Mayor] Jacob Frey [told] the officers at the Minneapolis Police to stand down, so they could watch me [b]eaten live on national television!!!!! PRESIDENT TRUMP SEND IN THE NATIONAL GUARD They are lynching White Christians on the streets!!!!!""

The Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) told Fox News Digital it is aware of social media accounts of Lang allegedly being assaulted, but that an official report has not been filed.

""MPD encourages anyone who has experienced assaultive behavior to report the incident as soon as possible and provide as much detail as they can, including the date, time, and location of the incident, a description of any suspects, and the nature and extent of any injuries sustained,"" the department wrote in a statement.

Meanwhile, anti-ICE protesters continued to clash with law enforcement outside the Whipple Federal Building, where agents were attempting to keep demonstrators back from the entrance of the facility.

Footage captured agitators screaming and cursing at agents as they attempted to hold a line of formation in the street.

Hennepin County Sheriff's Office patrol cars were later seen parked in front of the building, blocking the road, as it got dark outside.

Tensions flared after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot last week by an ICE agent while allegedly blocking an operation in Minneapolis and driving toward an agent.

The Minnesota Department of Public Safety announced earlier on Saturday the state's National Guard was mobilized and staging to support local law enforcement and emergency management agencies.

However, Guardsmen have not yet been deployed to city streets.

""Minnesota sanctuary politicians have released nearly 470 criminal illegal aliens back into American communities since President Trump took office,"" the White House wrote in a social media post Saturday.

Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) mobilized the state National Guard on Saturday as anti-ICE protesters have taken to the streets in Minnesota.

The Minnesota Department of Public Safety confirmed the mobilization in a post on X, saying that troops are currently engaging in staging exercises. If deployed, they will be armed and will wear reflective vests to distinguish themselves, the Minnesota National Guard said.

“Members of the Minnesota National Guard are on standby, ready to assist local law enforcement and public safety agencies,” the agency posted on X. “These Minnesota National Guardsmen live, work, and serve in our state, and are focused on protecting life, preserving property, and ensuring Minnesotans can safely exercise their First Amendment rights.”

Crowds of anti-ICE protesters were seen outside Minneapolis City Hall, demonstrations that come as tensions remain high after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good in early January. Some clashed with right-wing demonstrators, including activist Jake Lang, who claimed he was stabbed by a protester. Other protesters assembled in the city for a “March Against Minnesota Fraud” rally, as a massive investigation into daycare fraud involving the state's Somali population continues.

Despite the violent clashes, the Minnesota Police Department maintained that protesters were generally “responsive” to directions to clear roadways and disperse from the area.

TIM WALZ AND JACOB FREY UNDER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BY DOJ

Walz has urged protesters to “stay safe and stay peaceful,” even as his own rhetoric blasting Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers has increased the temperature.

Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey are now under federal investigation over their statements about ICE, with the Department of Justice accusing the two of impeding federal law enforcement's ability to do its job in the state.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:theatlantic.com","‘Abolish ICE' Is Back","https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/2026/01/abolish-ice-democrats-defund-police/685665/","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:41:31 GMT","

It's making some Democrats anxious.

History might not repeat itself, but the slogans sometimes do. And in the days since an ICE officer shot and killed a woman in Minneapolis, some Democratic candidates and commentators have joined in on a familiar refrain. “Dismantling ICE is the moderate position,” Graham Platner, the U.S. Senate candidate in Maine, said in a statement on X. “If Trump's ICE is shooting and kidnapping people, then abolish it,” wrote Jack Schlossberg, a candidate for Congress in New York. Even Bill Kristol, the erstwhile Republican turned Trump critic, logged on to share a simple, straightforward message: “Abolish ICE.”

A growing number of Americans disagree with how the agency is handling its mission. But where many Democrats hear “Abolish ICE” as a righteous call to action, others in the party register the clanging of alarm bells. These anxious Democrats believe that such a maximalist demand plays directly into Republicans' hands by making the party seem unserious about immigration. Some of them are pleading with members of their party to avoid adopting the motto. “Unless you truly believe that the United States should not have an agency that enforces immigration and customs laws,” reads a memo from the center-left think tank Searchlight Institute, “you should not say you want to abolish ICE.”

The slogan conjures a not-so-distant time in American politics when even the highest-profile Democrats, under pressure from progressives, embraced a host of deeply unpopular positions, including defunding the police and decriminalizing border crossings. Many members of the party blame this period, at least in part, for the return of Donald Trump—and they're desperate not to relive it. “Oh my God. Déja vú all over again,” Lis Smith, a national party strategist, told me when I asked about the slogan. “Sigh,” Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way, texted me. “Can that be my on the record quote?”

“Abolish ICE” went mainstream in 2018 amid public outrage over the Trump administration separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border. The slogan, embraced widely by progressives, quickly became a litmus test for candidates running in Democratic-leaning districts across the country. But the movement was never especially popular among the broader American electorate, and its proponents could never seem to agree about whether the phrase meant abolishing ICE forever, or abolishing it and replacing it with something else. Critics worried that adopting the phrase hurt Democratic credibility on immigration, an issue on which the party already suffered from low public trust. Eventually, even the activist who helped popularize the slogan in 2018 mostly abandoned it.

Read: ‘We need to take away children'

Eight years later, as masked men patrol neighborhoods far from the southern border, calls to dismantle ICE are resonating differently. In the days since an ICE officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good, stories have circulated of federal agents (from both ICE and Border Patrol) pepper-spraying and tear-gassing families and students, and shoving a protester into oncoming traffic. Photos have shown neighborhoods filled with tear gas. A Texas medical examiner is likely, The Washington Post recently reported, to classify an ICE detainee's recent death as a homicide.

Polling suggests that Americans don't like what they're seeing: Roughly 57 percent say they disapprove of how ICE is handling immigration enforcement; about half believe that ICE is making cities less safe. And two polls taken after Good's killing show that support for abolishing ICE has increased about 13 percent since July 2019. Even Joe Rogan, the high-profile podcast host who endorsed Trump in 2024, seems disillusioned. “Are we really gonna be the Gestapo?” Rogan asked this week. “‘Where's your papers?' Is that what we've come to?” (The Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told me in a statement that ICE “will continue to carry out immigration enforcement for the safety of Americans who have been victimized by rapists, murderers, drug traffickers, and gang members.” In response to Rogan, McLaughlin said on Fox News that the agency has to have a presence in Minneapolis “because we don't have state and local law enforcement's help.”)

Most Democrats have not called for ICE's outright abolition. But a few are recent adopters of the slogan. “I was of the belief that perhaps we could reform ICE. Now I am of the belief that it has to be dismantled as an entity,” Representative Adriano Espaillat of New York said last week. Michigan's Representative Shri Thanedar, who in June was one of 75 Democrats who signed legislation expressing “gratitude” for ICE, just introduced the Abolish ICE Act. Other progressive members of Congress have been on this particular train for years. Representatives Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley have all reiterated their demands to abolish the agency in the past week. “I made this call back in 2018, and that's because I saw where this agency was going,” Abdul El-Sayed, a U.S. Senate candidate in Michigan, told me. Trump is “trying to create an independent, domestic source of state power answerable only to him.” By now, he added, ICE is “corrupted beyond repair.”

A common belief among ICE's critics is that no amount of funding or training can fix the agency. Abolition “is the baseline at a certain point,” Usamah Andrabi, the communications director at the progressive group Justice Democrats, told me. The organization works to unseat Democratic incumbents who aren't sufficiently progressive, and will be focused on that goal as the 2026 primaries intensify. Democrats “need to heed the calls” of the people they represent, Andrabi said, and many of those people “are demanding that we abolish ICE.”

Read: ‘Maybe DHS was a bad idea'

All of this is nightmare fuel for a certain type of Democrat—namely, the kind who is focused on winning elections in swing states and purple districts. These Democrats believe that the mayhem caused by ICE's raids gives the party an uncharacteristic upper hand over Republicans on immigration—and that demands to eliminate the agency erase that leverage. Americans mostly support immigration-enforcement efforts and, in particular, the deportation of unauthorized immigrants with violent criminal records.

“When you say ‘Abolish ICE,' that means you're abolishing the agency that's in charge of enforcing immigration law in this country,” Tré Easton, the vice president for public policy at the Searchlight Institute, told me. “Especially in a time when Democrats don't have a lot of credibility on the immigration issue, it's really, really, a fraught path that they should not go down.” Easton and others argue that the demands to abolish ICE are akin to the calls to “defund the police” that progressives made in 2020 after the killing of George Floyd. Both slogans appeared in response to terrible abuses of power, they say, but both were overcorrections. As with police, “the question is not whether ICE should exist; the question is whether they should follow the laws and be held accountable,” Erickson, from Third Way, told me.

The fight over “Abolish ICE” can feel like semantics—and it sort of is. Strategists at the Searchlight Institute and Third Way have asked their fellow Democrats to please avoid saying “Abolish ICE” and instead to advocate for reforming it and retraining agents. They argue that Democratic leaders could use subpoenas, congressional hearings, and appropriations riders to hold ICE to account—and to make a broader argument about public safety. Some of them point to Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona as an example of an effective messenger: ICE is “out of control,” Gallego said in a recent interview. “People want a slimmed-down ICE that is truly focused on security.”

Somewhat surprisingly, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who ran for Congress in 2018 on a promise to abolish ICE, has in recent days reframed the issue as a question of funding. “The cuts to your health care are what's paying for this,” she said of Congress letting health-care subsidies expire and increasing funding for ICE and other agencies. “You get screwed over to pay a bunch of thugs in the street that are shooting mothers in the face.” That interview “is what highly effective messaging on ICE can look like—without saying ‘abolish ICE,'” Adam Jentleson, the president of the Searchlight Institute, wrote on X. (Ocasio-Cortez says she does still support shutting down the agency.)

The overarching concern for Democrats like Jentleson is that members of their party seem not to have absorbed a crucial lesson from recent elections: that Republicans can and will use Democrats' own words against them. In 2022, for example, former Wisconsin Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes lost his challenge to Senator Ron Johnson by only a hair, after it came to light that Barnes had previously signaled support for abolishing ICE and defunding the police. (Barnes, in his current campaign for governor, has steered clear of the issue.) Vice President Kamala Harris's own mixed record on immigration was fodder for Republicans. During the 2024 election cycle, which famously did not turn out well for Harris or her party, Republicans spent $741 million on immigration-related ads, according to an estimate from the nonpartisan policy organization America Forward.

Now, as then, Republicans are eager to exploit “Abolish ICE.” Democrats “don't want our border secured or criminal illegal aliens being removed,” and want to defund “federal law-enforcement agencies who are protecting public safety,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a press briefing after Good's killing. House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told reporters this week that Democrats “have been for open borders” for years.

Notably, none of the leading 2028 presidential contenders has demanded that ICE be dismantled. Aside from Platner and El-Sayed, Democratic Senate candidates have stuck with calls for reform and for an investigation into Good's killing. Still, as ICE expands operations in Minneapolis and beyond, and as anti-ICE protests intensify, it's reasonable to anticipate more viral videos, outrage, and allegations of violence. Which means it's also reasonable to expect that Democratic primary candidates will face pressure to condemn the agency in the strongest possible terms.

A poem

I am here in the evening light, my eyes now white like the museum sparrow, with a voice that no longer trembles: Remember the child.

I'll visit as a songbird, a rabbit, and lead you up the dash with the wind. I waited for your permission, faceless, and you gave it.

It was a terminal we both knew: the open woods, a last request, an imposition, the letter E.

The leaves narrowed the highway and were full of water. You said so. That is life: the gray flattering the green.

You slept on the town beach, I throughout the day. I wondered if you'd become lost.

I gave you this land and told you the last time is never last.

We met in the afternoon and dined that night at an oval table. There was tiredness, the deep kind, and no wine— only the promise of August.

The National Portrait Gallery removed key details from the caption beside the president's photograph. It still has a story to tell.

“Why does he look so angry?” one visitor to the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., asked our guide, as if that were a question with an answer. The docent had finally stopped before the black-and-white photograph of a looming, glaring President Trump that dominates the entrance to the final rooms of the “America's Presidents” exhibit. We had managed not to talk about him for several minutes, swerving left toward the bright, kinetic John F. Kennedy painted by the abstract expressionist Elaine de Kooning and then crossing right to view Kehinde Wiley's portrait of Barack Obama—a calm, floating, saintlike figure surrounded by leaves and flowers.

But the president with the gorilla posture, knuckles firmly planted on the presidential desk, had to be dealt with. Someone else in our group asked why the Smithsonian had capitulated to Trump. Two days earlier, The Washington Post had broken the news that the National Portrait Gallery, which is overseen by the Smithsonian Institution, had swapped out an older portrait of Trump for the current one and put up a terse “tombstone” plaque that notes only the photographer's name, Trump's date of birth, and his years in office. All of the other presidential portraits in the gallery are accompanied by long assessments of each presidency, its successes and failures. They cite Andrew Johnson's and Bill Clinton's impeachments, and the label beside the previous Trump photograph mentioned Trump's impeachments, too—but the new one, of course, does not. (That other photograph and caption can still be seen on the gallery website.)

Like some demonic trickster of folklore, Trump moves through the world robbing it of speech. The question about the Smithsonian's capitulation left even our docent, a well-informed man, at a loss for words. He couldn't address that, he said, but he could tell us a great deal about the desk in the Oval Office that Trump is leaning on: It is called the Resolute Desk because it was made from the oak timbers of the H.M.S. Resolute, a British Arctic-exploration ship.

The National Portrait Gallery spokesperson, noting that the museum had rotated in new Trump portraits before, dismissed the tweaks as routine. But when it comes to Trump and the preservation of historical memory, nothing is routine. The administration began pressuring the Smithsonian for changes almost as soon as Trump returned to office. In March, he signed an executive order demanding that the Smithsonian review its exhibitions for “improper ideology.” In May, Trump forced out the National Portrait Gallery's director, Kim Sajet, on grounds of excessive partisanship. (He tried to fire her even though that was not within his power, and she resigned.) At the time, the White House wrote up its objections in a list obtained by The New York Times; one complained about the allusions to his impeachments. In July, the National Museum of American History took references to Trump's impeachments out of its presidential exhibit. These were restored in August, but in watered-down form. Meanwhile, the National Portrait Gallery has said that it's planning a larger “refresh” of the “America's Presidents” exhibit and is exploring putting more tombstone labels there and elsewhere.

Many bad things are happening in America right now, and the suppression of wall text in an art museum, even a quasi-governmental one, is far from the worst of them. Yet both the uninformative label and the new portrait are worth lingering on, for two reasons. First, the fact that Trump's impeachments were censored, and nothing else at the National Portrait Gallery has been—that we know of—is a reminder that although the administration couches its assaults on American institutions as a campaign against “wokeness,” what the president really cares about is his own reputation.

Second, Trump is a man who spends a lot of time shaping his image. Many unusual artistic choices had to be made to arrive at the official White House photo of his second administration, a snarling headshot lit from below that plays off the mug shot taken at the Georgia jailhouse in 2023, when Trump was booked on election-racketeering charges. (The official photo hangs in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.) “He's very hands-on,” Shealah Craighead, the chief White House photographer during the first Trump administration, told The New York Times for an article about the inaugural photo. When Trump swapped photographs in the National Portrait Gallery, he was sending a message. Decoding it provides some small insight into why he feels the need to look so angry—though I suspect we'll never understand that completely.

The first president in the “America's Presidents” gallery is, of course, George Washington. His portrait was painted in 1796 by the artist Gilbert Stuart, who may be more famous for a different portrait of Washington, which became the face on the $1 bill. With this work, however, Stuart effectively invented the presidential portrait.

To the contemporary eye, Washington looks uncommonly grand; indeed, the style of composition is known as grand manner. The painting shows the full figure of the great leader, his already-large frame—he was more than 6 feet tall—exaggerated by a bigger-than-life 8-by-6-foot canvas. He stretches out his hand in the classical gesture of a man making a speech. (Stuart is thought to have based the pose on Washington's 1795 address to Congress.) The furniture in the room is ornate and gilded. Lace cascades from his cuffs and neck. He holds a gold-handled saber.

But an 18th-century viewer familiar with European royal portraiture would have understood that even as Stuart was invoking its conventions, he was also defying them, endowing Washington with the authority of a head of state while differentiating him from a king. The historian David C. Ward calls the portrait “an explicitly antimonarchical work of art.” In lieu of regal robes, the president wears a plain black suit. Compared with the mighty swords that dangle by the side of European rulers, his saber is barely noticeable. The Federalist Papers rest on top of the table, the U.S. Constitution below. (The guide pointed out the Constitution, adding, “I'll let you think about that.”)

Washington's most presidential feature, though, is his expression. His lips are pressed into a faint grimace, but his eyes are calm and steady, gazing into the distance as if toward the future. This is not another proud autocrat, but an ardent visionary who is tamping himself down so as to model neutrality. He is a republican, which is the point. In a shaky union still divided over the question of federation, he unifies rather than divides; he may have led the nation in war, but here he seeks peace. The circumspect Washington embodies the ideal of government that had recently been put forth in The Federalist Papers: the maintenance of equilibrium through judicious balance. In the state, the balance is one of powers; in the statesman, it is of feelings about power. Here is a president who would know to step down after his second term.

Washington's portrait sets the emotional tone of the exhibit; he is the benchmark of presidential temperament. Stuart also painted the half-length portrait of Thomas Jefferson, whose lips form the same tight line. His brow is heavier, though, and his eyes half-hooded. He seems remote, unknowable—a complicated man. James Madison has sagging jowls and a mournful gaze turned up toward God, suggesting that the co-author of The Federalist Papers had considerable gravitas. Aesthetically, the best portrait is that of Grover Cleveland; it also makes him very likable. Cleveland sits at a table messy with books and papers, leaning on one arm and looking up as if listening attentively. His legs are spread wide to accommodate his girth, and his expression is frank and open. He could be one of Frans Hals's friendly tavern-goers.

The captions steer us toward interpretations of presidential affect. James Buchanan looks prissy and irresolute, especially after we learn that he “did little to prevent the first seven Southern states from seceding,” and that the Civil War broke out “only a few weeks after he had left office.” Gerald Ford faces us squarely in the canonical stance of the decent man. He granted amnesty to both Richard Nixon and Vietnam-draft evaders, and is the first to smile—faintly—in his presidential portrait. By the time we get to George W. Bush, the norms of self-presentation have relaxed even further: He sits on a low couch in his shirtsleeves. His uncertain electoral victory and failure to mitigate the effects of Hurricane Katrina make him sound like a lightweight, and his smile verges on pleading.

Only one other president projects anything like Trump's aggression. That is a seated but powerful Theodore Roosevelt, his gaze fierce and his walrus mustache seeming to emphasize a downward turn of the lips. One hand clutches a riding whip; the other is balled into a fist. “An outsize personality who preached the benefits of the ‘strenuous life,'” the caption reads, “while also being among the most learned of presidents.”

Read: The wannabe tough-guy presidency

The Trump photograph that was installed this month, however, occupies a whole other political universe—just like its subject. It is the third to go on display at the National Portrait Gallery during his second administration; he scowls in all three of them. (The scowl is “his favorite pose,” Craighead, the former White House photographer, also told the Times. “He doesn't want to smile because it seems weak, is probably what he would say.”)

In the first of this term's photos, displayed in early 2025 to mark his inauguration, Trump is seated at his desk and turns to look at us. We seem to be standing to his right, almost as his equals, and his left hand rests on the desk. In the second portrait, his dark suit recedes into a dark background, highlighting his loud red tie, but he clasps his hands calmly in front of him. To spot changes in the pitch of Trump's ever-present bad temper, you have to look at the hands. That he leans into his fists in the portrait that is now hanging in the presidents gallery says everything you need to know. In the absence of curatorial guidance, nothing shields us from his naked belligerence. He invades the space and overpowers the viewer. I thought of ICE occupying blue-state cities. I felt certain that I was supposed to, though later I wondered whether I was supposed to think at all.

The photo informs us, wordlessly, that we have come under the rule of a monarch, and not just a monarch: a would-be tyrant. We don't know what images, if any, influenced the photographer, Daniel Torok, but somewhere in the background lurks Hans Holbein the Younger's most famous state portrait, a full-frontal depiction of Henry VIII, who, after he broke with the Catholic Church, became the head of his own church, laying claim to God-given authority.

The original Henry VIII portrait, painted in 1537, formed part of a mural that was lost in a fire, but in most of the copies made over the centuries, the king's swollen face and massive body overwhelm the frame. A comically large codpiece pokes out between the folds of his skirt. One hand fingers the strap of a hanging dagger, and his eyes fix the viewer with a cold, appraising stare. Henry was egotistical and ruthless, and executed almost everyone who opposed him; the fierce, blunt portrait is said to have terrified his court. I'm sure he liked that.

What comes after “peak protein”?

Uncle Sam thinks you're probably eating wrong, and he's got some advice.

Out: processed carbohydrates and added sugar.

In: fat and protein, especially the animal-flesh kind.

Those are some of the biggest takeaways from the new — and newly inverted — food pyramid announced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this month.

While the Make America Healthy Again movement is one of the biggest drivers of change in how we eat now, it's not the only one. Today, Explained recently spoke with Liz Dunn, author of the newsletter Consumed, about her predictions for how we will eat in 2026. Some trends are MAHA-approved (more supplements) while others would give RFK Jr. a conniption (sugar-laden drinks are going to get even sweeter).

Below is an excerpt of the conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

The question that I get more than any other as the year came to a close is: What's next after protein? What's the next protein? And I really feel like we're not ready for what's next yet for a few reasons.

One is that the supermarket has sort of reinvented itself for protein delivery. So, whether it's zero sugar yogurts, or meat sticks, or protein boosted waffles, the protein is out there, and it's everywhere calling to us, people really continue to associate protein with fitness and with strength and power — all great, positive things.

And maybe, most importantly, the new federal dietary guidelines up the recommended allowance of protein. So this is just going to add fuel to the fire.

This one does seem a little paradoxical, because there is a lot of sugar hating out there, but the country is not a monolith. And so, there are a really sizable number of people who are drinking and enjoying soup or sugary fast food and coffee chain beverages.

Drinks like this have been around since the Frappuccino, but I think, probably, the best example of how they've really grown is a chain called Dutch Brothers. It's a coffee chain. It's one of the fastest growing restaurant chains in America. And its growth is being driven not by coffee, but by these big, sweet, cold coffee drinks. And at the same time, we're seeing the dirty soda trend. I don't know if you're familiar with dirty sodas.

Everybody from Taco Bell to McDonald's is experimenting with what they call beverage innovation — how to add more of these drinks to their menus — and that is for two reasons.

One is consumers are really tightening their wallets, and they're looking for ways to have an indulgence without maybe ordering an entire fast food meal. So a sweet soda, a sweet coffee drink is a great way to get that kind of fun pick me up without spending a ton of money. And then, on the business end, these drinks are really, really profitable.

They're cheap to make. You can charge a fair amount for them, and especially at a time when coffee and beef are two commodities that are more expensive than they've ever been. These drinks make really good business sense for fast food chains. And so, I expect to see fast food chains to continue to really push them.

A newsletter for anyone trying to make sense of their health.

So, supplements are a $70 billion market in the US.

There's a few reasons why this market has been exploding, and again, why I think it will really continue to explode in 2026. One is the Make America Healthy Again movement, which really buys into supplements as a concept.

I like to say that it's pharma, big wellness. So there's a lot of faith in the idea that the right mix of supplements in your diet could cure really anything. I mean, you may remember Robert F. Kennedy suggesting that Vitamin A was a good alternative to vaccination for measles. So, this is an example of this kind of thinking.

And then, social media has just been a real accelerant for this industry. If an influencer that you follow says that she swears by magnesium to help her sleep, that's probably really going to encourage you to give it a try.

When I grew up, my family shopped at Stop and Shop; we went once a week. It was something for everyone — grocery store carried all the big packaged food brands. The prices are good, but they're not great. But they're kind of your main-street grocer.

Now, those mid-price grocers like Kroger, or Stop and Shop, or Albertsons, they're really losing share to discounters. So Walmart sells about a quarter of the groceries in America today. Costco, Aldi, Dollar General, all of those discounters are really growing as people are willing to sacrifice name brand groceries or having a deli counter or maybe a larger selection for really, really deep value. And then, the other end of the V is the very premium end of the market. I'm thinking about places like Erewhon.

And Erewhon says it's going to be expanding into as many as 20 cities in the coming years. And not quite as high end as Erewhon, but also in the more premium space, there's brands like Sprouts, which is a natural fruits grocer, which is also really expanding rapidly. And so, that's sort of the other end of this V where you see people seeking really deep discounts on one end, then, on the other end of the spectrum, splurging on sort of high-end premium grocery categories.

Listen: It's not new that people choose where they eat in part based on the Instagramability or they're taking pictures of their food or pictures of the interiors.

But I was really shocked to see a recent trend report released by the online bookings platform, OpenTable, which had a little tidbit that I just thought was staggering. 77 percent of Gen Zers and 79 percent of millennials said that they consider a restaurant's Instagram or TikTok worthiness when deciding whether to eat there.

That's a lot, and I think that it will likely be reflected in the types of decisions that restaurants make if a person is choosing where they dine based on what kind of content they can make out of it. I mean, I would expect to see really sort of viral appealing menu items and, I guess, decor touches that really lend themselves to photography.

So this is going to continue to be a really important factor in how people think about where they're dining.

The latest estimates are that about one in eight Americans has tried a GLP-1 drug, and we'd expect to see that number grow, because they're going to be some pill based versions of these drugs coming out in the coming months. So we think that this will probably spread adoption.

Now, if you're a restaurant, and something like one in 10 or one in five, potentially, diners are on a drug that cuts their desire for big portions, that's something that will have to really influence how you design your menu, because restaurants need to continue to try to make the same amount of revenue — even if people want smaller portions.

Over the years, the big packaged food companies have really been able to reformulate their way out of pretty much any diet trend — low fat, low carb, gluten-free. There's a way to make a very profitable packaged food that fits all of those trends.

What we're seeing now in terms of how people are thinking about the food they're eating is that they're really skeptical of highly processed foods. And again, on the GLP-1 front, they also are just potentially eating less or, at least, a sizable share of the population is eating less.

So that's a really new and different challenge. If you're a packaged food company, how do you continue to make profitable products that are not processed, which is sort of the whole engine of how you made them profitable to begin with. I think that there's going to have to be a real reckoning at these companies to figure out how they continue to perform for shareholders and remain profitable as these eating habits are changing dramatically.

The high seas used to be the wild west of the ocean, but a new treaty could finally bring oversight.

In the spring of 2010, I was one of a few journalists invited to travel down to the coast of Ecuador to join an ocean-going TED conference. With me aboard a National Geographic science vessel were ocean and climate scientists, underwater photographers, marine activists, environmental group CEOs, a lot of green-minded rich people, and famous actors like Leonardo DiCaprio and Edward Norton.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

I promise that what follows is not just a chance to tell one of the few close brushes with celebrity in my journalistic career.

For several days, we toured the pristine Galapagos Islands and listened to presentations from the experts and artists on board. That's how I ended up snorkeling in the Pacific with DiCaprio, and, one night, playing the party game Werewolf with the Hollywood contingent. (The details are fuzzy, but I'm pretty sure Norton eliminated me right away. The lesson here is don't play a game that depends on acting ability with Academy Award-nominated actors.)

We were all there because of the work of Sylvia Earle, a legendary oceanographer and advocate for marine conservation. Earle was launching Mission Blue, an organization dedicated to creating a global network of marine protected areas (MPAs), including the largely unprotected high seas or international waters. As Earle put it in a 2009 speech, “The high seas — the areas beyond national jurisdiction — cover nearly half of the world, but they're a kind of ‘no-man's-land' where anything goes.” Less than 1 percent of the high seas are classified as highly protected.

But now, thanks to a rare piece of environmental good news, the high seas are finally getting some protection. On January 17, the UN's long-gestating international High Seas Treaty entered into force, meaning it became binding international law for the countries and parties that have ratified it.

It's not a complete fulfillment of what ocean advocates like Earle have long called for. But it is a new rulebook — and, more importantly, a new set of institutions — for the largest shared space on the planet.

For decades, the high seas have been partially governed at best by a patchwork of overlapping authorities. Shipping is largely handled through the International Maritime Organization. Fisheries are overseen by regional fisheries management organizations. The deep seabed is handled through the International Seabed Authority. Those bodies matter. The problem is that none of them, on their own, were designed to deliver broad, coordinated biodiversity protection across the open ocean — especially as new threats like climate change grew and technology made it easier to operate farther from shore.

The oceans and their wildlife need that protection. Take overfishing. Across 1,320 populations of 483 species of commercial fish, 82 percent are being removed faster than they can repopulate. Even when fishery management organizations aren't captured by commercial interest, they're too narrowly focused on specific territories or species. No one is looking out for the oceans as a whole.

The High Seas Treaty is an attempt to fix that governance gap, to make “beyond national jurisdiction” stop meaning “beyond meaningful stewardship.” The treaty, which emerged from nearly two decades of UN negotiations to close gaps in the existing Law of the Sea, has a sweeping official objective — conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction — but its architecture is practical, focusing on a handful of major points, plus the governing bodies that can turn those principles into real decisions.

And while not every country is fully on board — the US signed the treaty but never ratified it — 145 nations have, which means there's a substantial coalition committing to a new way of governing the global ocean commons.

Here's what the treaty will not do: It will not instantly create a vast ocean park next week, nor will it magically end illegal fishing or reverse warming seas.

What it will do is create the legal and institutional machinery that makes protection possible — and makes “doing harm” harder to hide.

The headline provision is the one conservationists have been chasing for years: a global process to establish area‑based management tools, including marine protected areas, in the high seas.

That matters because MPAs can work when designed and enforced well, but global ocean biodiversity goals can't be met unless they're extended to the two-thirds of the oceans that make up the high seas. And importantly, the treaty aims for an ecologically representative network of MPAs — areas that map to the needs of the ocean, rather than just random spots on the globe.

The treaty also insists that activities that may significantly harm the marine environment, like industrial fishing, should be assessed in advance, monitored afterward, and disclosed publicly. The agreement envisions such environmental impact assessment reports being shared through a “clearing‑house” mechanism — essentially, a transparency infrastructure — that allows scientific review and recommendations if monitoring suggests harms from those activities that weren't predicted. That's the right approach for what is the ultimate shared resource.

If the high seas are the planet's largest commons, they're also a library of genetic information with real commercial potential: pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, biotech. So far, that's been a problem. If commercially valuable discoveries come from a global commons, who benefits?

The agreement sets expectations for fair and equitable benefit‑sharing, including open access to scientific data, along with transparency about collection and use, though it anticipates key details (especially around who gets the money) will be hammered out through the new treaty bodies. Ultimately, monetary benefits will go to a shared pool for helping developing countries build marine science programs and for the creation and management of more MPAs.

The treaty also aims to balance out one of the reasons that high-seas governance has been so unbalanced towards rich nations: the high cost of both ocean science and enforcement. (That's one reason why waters near impoverished African countries are being exploited by illegal fishing fleets from China and Europe.) Capacity‑building and technology sharing is a core element of the treaty, intended to help developing countries participate in decision‑making and implementation that directly affects them.

Like anything hammered out through the UN, the treaty is far from perfect. The absence of the US is important, if unsurprising: The Senate has failed to ratify numerous international treaties in recent decades, especially environmental ones. The treaty has enough ratifications to enter into force anyway, but US participation would have made it easier to enforce, provided more scientific capacity to implement it, and added political legitimacy.

And the high seas will still be hard to police. The treaty will need political will and generous funding to be effective. And its agents will have to coordinate with existing bodies that govern fishing, mining, and shipping, which is sure to create friction.

But amid relentless environmental bad news, it's worth noticing when the international system does something concrete: creating binding rules, building institutions, and giving itself a chance to protect the parts of the planet that belong to everyone — and that, until now, have too often been treated as belonging to whoever gets there first.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Bessent: Unlikely Supreme Court will overrule tariffs, Trump's 'signature economic policy'","https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/18/trump-tariffs-supreme-court-bessent-trade-greenland.html","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:22:36 GMT","



Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's ""very unlikely"" that the Supreme Court will overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. 

""I believe that it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will overrule a president's signature economic policy,"" Bessent said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""They did not overrule Obamacare, I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos."" 

In June, the Supreme Court upheld a key Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients.

Bessent's comments come one day after Trump said he would impose a new slate of tariffs on goods coming from Europe until ""a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland."" 

Trump did not specify in his Truth Social post which statute he was invoking to impose the tariffs, though the move appears to mirror the ""liberation day"" duties he has imposed on dozens of nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. 

The tariffs on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will begin at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump said. They will then escalate to 25% on June 1, Trump said. 

The Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump's use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs before the end of its term, but a decision could come as soon as this week. IEEPA gives the president wide latitude to use economic tools in response to an ""unusual and extraordinary threat.""

Bessent said Trump's new tariffs on Europe regarding Greenland are a response to an emergency. 

""The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency,"" Bessent said. ""It is a strategic decision by the president ... he is able to use the economic might of the U.S. to avoid a hot war."" 

Trump has long sought to acquire Greenland, the Arctic territory of Denmark, and has ratcheted up his pressure campaign for a U.S. takeover of the island in recent weeks. Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe have widely rejected Trump's demands to take over the island. 

European leaders of countries targeted by the new tariffs responded on Sunday. 

""Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,"" the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.

""We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,"" the statement read.

Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Motzfeldt at the White House last week in a meeting that Rasmussen described as ""frank but constructive.""

After the meeting, the group said the U.S. and Denmark would establish a high-level working group to chart Greenland's future.

The Trump administration claims that a U.S. acquisition of Greenland is critical to national security to counter the expansion of Russia and China in the region. 

CNBC has reached out to the White House and the Treasury Department to clarify what statute Trump is using to impose the new European tariffs.

CORRECTION: Vivian Motzfeldt is Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs. A previous version of this article misstated her title.

Everyday living costs play a major role in how much money you need to retire.

A new state-by-state analysis from personal finance website GOBankingRates shows that the estimated total savings needed to retire at 65 can differ by as much as $1.46 million depending on where you live.

In Hawaii, retirees need about $2.2 million to stop working at 65 and cover essential living expenses for 25 years, including housing, groceries, transportation, utilities and health-care costs. That is the highest estimated minimum of any state. By comparison, Oklahoma has the lowest estimated total, at $735,284, to cover the same basic costs.

The analysis is based on the average living costs for retirees 65 or older in each state, drawn from the latest data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. From there, GOBankingRates subtracted average Social Security payments and estimated the savings needed to cover the remaining expenses using an annual 4% withdrawal rate. 

The resulting figures represent a baseline for covering essential costs and don't factor in discretionary spending such as travel, dining or entertainment. Additionally, the estimates don't account for factors such as inflation, lifestyle changes or unexpected costs.

Housing is the biggest factor in annual retirement costs, as it varies by roughly $30,000 annually between states. Utilities and health-care costs can range by as much as $5,000 annually, the study finds.

Here's a look the minimum amount of savings needed to retire at 65 in each state, in alphabetical order.

European leaders have hit back at U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose fresh tariffs on them if they oppose his attempt to buy Greenland, describing the ultimatum as ""completely wrong"" and ""unacceptable.""

Trump announced on Saturday that eight European allies would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb.1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal is not reached so Washington can ""buy"" the Arctic territory, which is semi-autonomous and part of the Kingdom of Denmark.

Eight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs ""until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,"" Trump stated on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday.

The proposed tariffs would target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K, the Netherlands and Finland, Trump said.

European leaders were quick to react to the latest threat with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer commenting Saturday that ""applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,"" while French President Emmanuel Macron described them as ""unacceptable.""

""Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld,"" Macron stated on social media platform X on Saturday.

Reuters quoted a source close to Macron as saying he was pushing for the activation of the Anti-Coercion Instrument, which could limit access to public tenders in the EU or restrict trade in services in which the U.S. has a surplus with the bloc.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President of the European Council Antonio Costa issued a statement Saturday in which they said the EU ""stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland."" 

It added that it was committed to further dialogue following talks between Denmark, Greenland and top U.S. officials last week, which ended without a diplomatic breakthrough. 

Nonetheless, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump's tariffs threat had come ""as a surprise"" following the ""constructive meeting"" with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. 

The European Union has called an emergency meeting which will take place at 16:00 p.m. London time on Sunday, Reuters reported.

Finnish President Alexander Stubb, who, like British PM Keir Starmer is known to have a good relationship with Donald Trump, called for cool heads and further talks.

He warned further tariffs — which would come on top of the 15% tariff on EU exports to the U.S., and the 10% levied on U.K. exports -- would be damaging, however.

""Among allies, issues are best resolved through discussion, not through pressure,"" he said on X. 

""European countries stand united. We emphasize the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty. We support Denmark and Greenland. Dialogue with the United States continues. Tariffs would undermine the transatlantic relationship and risk a dangerous downward spiral.""

Trump's demands now threaten the EU-U.S. trade agreement struck in August.

Manfred Weber, a senior member of the European Parliament (MEP), said the EU trade deal with the U.S. is ""not possible at this stage.""

Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank said: ""Trump wants to force Denmark and its European backers to sell Greenland to the U.S. by imposing tariffs. For Europe, this is a bad geopolitical headache and a moderately significant economic problem.""

He estimated that an additional 10% levy on goods from affected countries could raise U.S. consumer prices by up to 0.15%. But ""in the unlikely case"" that the EU-U.S. trade deal is not implemented, ""the damage to US consumers could then be almost three times as bad in the end,"" Schmieding told CNBC in a note.

Denmark and its European neighbors have made repeated efforts to dissuade Trump from looking to acquire Greenland, particularly after the president said earlier this month that he would consider all options to obtain the mineral-rich island, including using military force.

Trump says acquiring Greenland is critical for U.S. national security. He has also said that U.S. ownership would prevent Russia and China from gaining a foothold in the territory. Beijing and Moscow have lambasted Trump's claims and his coveting of Greenland, calling them a ""pretext ...for selfish gains"" and ""extraordinary."" 

Greenland itself has repeatedly rejected Trump's advances and while a majority of its population would like independence from Denmark, according to opinion polls, most Greenlanders would not like to become a part of the U.S., either.

Protests were held in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, on Saturday, with demonstrators holding placards reiterating the position of the island's leadership, and that of Denmark, that ""Greenland is not for sale.""

Venture capital firm Sequoia is joining Singapore's GIC and U.S. investor Coatue in a funding round for Anthropic, which aims to raise $25 billion at a $350 billion valuation, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC, and Coatue will contribute $1.5 billion each for the Claude chatbot-maker, the newspaper said.

Sequoia, Anthropic, GIC and Coatue did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

Last year, Anthropic secured commitments from Microsoft and Nvidia totaling up to $15 billion.

Insatiable demand for AI and growing enterprise adoption have driven tech spending higher globally, pushing valuations of AI startups like Anthropic to record levels, even as concerns about an AI bubble loom.

Anthropic last raised $13 billion in a Series F round that valued the company at $183 billion, the company said in early September.

California-based Sequoia, founded in 1972, was an early investor in many top tech names, including Google, Apple, Cisco and YouTube.

In this article

Investors contended with bank earnings and geopolitical tensions this week, but the ongoing volatility may help uncover a few attractive stock picks.

Stock ratings from top Wall Street analysts can help inform investors as they search for opportunities in the market. These experts arrive at their recommendations following a thorough analysis of the macro and micro factors affecting a company.

Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

This week's first pick is Broadcom (AVGO), a semiconductor and infrastructure software provider. The company's custom chips or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, are seeing strong demand amid the ongoing artificial intelligence boom.

Following an investor meeting with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom's semiconductor solutions group, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated a buy rating on Broadcom stock with a price target of $475. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $393.

The meeting made Rasgon conclude that investor concerns about the impact of rising competition and customer-owned tooling on Broadcom's AI positioning are ""hugely overblown and that the company is unlikely to be dethroned in the ASIC space anytime soon.""

While Broadcom acknowledges that Nvidia (NVDA) is innovating faster than anyone else, Rasgon noted that the company is confident about being the only partner that can help XPU customers keep up. With innovation related to 3D chip stacking and 400G SerDes to a massive supply chain and in-house substrate production, Broadcom is progressing in a way that no one can match, the five-star analyst noted.

Broadcom is also expected to benefit from the growing demand for Alphabet-owned Google's ($GOOGL) tensor processing units, or TPUs, given its partnership with Google in developing these chips. Rasgon highlighted Kawwas' commentary about TPU v7 (ironwood) shipments rising from hundreds of thousands of units in 2025 to ""many many millions"" in 2026. He added that TPU v8 shipments are expected to touch hundreds of thousands of units per month in a few months, and millions by the end of this year. Also, Rasgon noted that the $73 billion order figure given at AVGO's earnings release is substantially higher today.

Rasgon ranks No. 120 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 68% of the time, delivering an average return of 30.7%. See Broadcom Statistics on TipRanks. 

Travel stock Airbnb (ABNB) is next on the list. In his research note on the outlook for the U.S. internet space, Mizuho analyst Lloyd Walmsley named Airbnb as one of the top ideas for 2026. The analyst reaffirmed a buy rating on ABNB stock with a price target of $156. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Airbnb stock with a price target of $153.

Walmsley expects room nights (a key metric in the hospitality industry) growth to reaccelerate, driven by Airbnb's strategy to add hotels to its supply; book now, pay later expansion; and easier comparisons in the domestic market.

""We see Airbnb's forthcoming AI product as a call option and see better prospects here than with other OTAs [online travel agents] given the product-focused leadership,"" said Walmsley.

The five-star analyst contends that investors are underappreciating Airbnb's prospects and its potential to reaccelerate room nights growth. Walmsley believes that the company's strength will become more evident this year when it rolls out its hotel strategy in three test markets and expands into more cities, possibly in late 2026. The analyst also expects Airbnb's decision to add hotel inventory to broaden the company's addressable market beyond traditional short-term rentals.

Walmsley expects the hotel expansion, along with the book now, pay later conversion benefits, to reaccelerate growth in the second half of 2026 and lift ABNB stock's valuation multiple.

Walmsley ranks No. 158 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.1%. See Airbnb Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. 

Walmsley also named social media giant Meta Platforms (META) as one of his top ideas in the internet space for 2026. The top-rated analyst reiterated a buy rating on META stock with a price target of $815. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an ""outperform"" rating on META stock with a price target of $753.

Walmsley expects META stock to rise from current levels, given that Wall Street's estimates have already priced in the company's high costs and capital spending. He expects upside in revenue and the company's progress on the AI front to reduce investors' fears about elevated spending.

""We believe Meta shares work on positive revisions and multiple expansion as the company better demonstrates returns on its massive AI investment,"" Walmsley said.

The analyst highlighted that his industry contacts indicated better advertising ROIs, or return on investment, on the platform. Moreover, Walmsley is optimistic about Meta Business AI and the monetization of WhatsApp. Also, he sees strength in AI/ML, or machine learning, engagement and ad targeting benefits to bolster revenue growth in 2026.

Walmsley expects Meta Platforms to roll out improved quality for large language model and product capability, which he believes will quell investors' concerns about the company's high investments. The analyst is also encouraged by the company's cost management efforts and focus on optimizing Reality Labs expenses.

I have been going to the World Economic Forum since 2009, when I was a young news assistant on ""Squawk Box Europe"" and had no idea what I was getting into. 

Back then, and still now, it is CNBC International's biggest outside broadcast of the year, and it's still thrilling to attend. 

The heady combination of world leaders, the most powerful players in business and a splash of celebrity — all navigating the snowy streets of Alpine ski resort Davos — makes for a unique experience. 

Over the years, I have seen many versions of Davos: the fall-out from the Great Financial Crisis and European debt crunch; the trading scandal that rocked French banking giant Societe Generale; the surge of the Arab Spring; the rise and fall of Russia; the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic and now the upending of the world order that has been in place since the end of the Second World War. 

Everyone has an opinion about this meeting, but one thing is true — it is never dull. And 2026 will certainly be no different. 

The tension between countries that call themselves allies is palpable going into this meeting. 

U.S. President Donald Trump has started 2026 by shocking the international community with a series of actions that challenge sovereignty and alliances that have been in place for decades. 

His latest threat to impose fresh tariffs on European countries for not supporting his advances on Greenland has drawn sharp criticism from Brussels to Paris, and from Copenhagen and Nuuk. The move will sharpen what was already set to be a tense week in Davos as he will cross paths with European leaders in the hallways of the Congress Centre. 

He will speak at the Forum on Wednesday, as the global community struggles to assess the impact of his action in Venezuela, his hardline stance towards Iran and slow progress toward a peace deal for Ukraine. 

The World Economic Forum designated this year as ""The Spirit of Dialogue,"" but the organization itself has warned in its latest Global Risk Report that ""rules and institutions that have long underpinned stability are under siege in a new era in which trade, finance and technology are wielded as weapons of influence.""

Ahead of Trump's speech, we will hear from a number of other world leaders on the first full day of the Forum. 

This includes European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. It is likely that all three will urge the importance of the role of NATO as it faces the most significant challenge since it's inception. 

President Trump's threats of military force in Greenland have put what was previously inconceivable — the end of the NATO alliance — on the table. Reports suggest the G7 could convene on the side-lines of the event, ostensibly to progress a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but the tensions with NATO will inevitably be debated. 

Tuesday will also see Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng speak, as a tentative trade truce seems to be holding with Washington D.C, despite recent data showing China recording the world's largest ever trade surplus for 2025, topping $1 trillion. Corporate leaders with significant interests in China, like Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, will also speak at the Forum as they look to navigate an increasingly political business landscape. 

Outside of geopolitics, the debate over the independence of central banks is set to heat up the frosty peaks of Davos. Central bankers across the globe were outraged by the announcement of the Department of Justice launching a criminal probe into Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell. 

In a statement, Powell said the probe ""is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates... or whether monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation."" 

His peers from across the globe issued an astonishing letter of support, including signatures from ECB President Christine Lagarde and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, alongside others. Former ECB boss, Jean-Claude Trichet told Squawk Box Europe that markets were not taking the threat seriously enough, calling the situation ""extremely grave.""

If I had told my 20-something year old self back in 2009 that in 2026 these would be the big debates for Davos, I'm sure I would not have believed it. 

Today, the influence of the G20 and G7 have been tested, making the World Economic Forum an even rarer occasion for face-to-face diplomacy. As someone who values diplomacy in all aspects of my life — at work, at home, in the content I consume and the people I am influenced by — I hope that cooler heads can prevail in the Alps.

Tuesday: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen; Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, French President Emmanuel Macron

Wednesday: U.S. President Donald Trump

Thursday: Israeli President Isaac Herzog; German Chancellor Friedrich Merz

In this article

Australia's social media ban for children under the age of 16 has grabbed global attention, and governments worldwide are considering implementing similar policies, with the U.K. seen as likely to be next. 

The Australian government's Online Safety Amendment Act came into effect on December 10, and included major social media platforms, including Reddit, X, Meta's Instagram, Alphabet's YouTube, Bytedance's TikTok. 

The platforms were forced to implement age verification methods to ensure under-16s are unable to create an account, and the companies can face fines up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32 million) for not complying. 

Although teenagers, tech giants, and experts have had mixed reactions since the ban came into force, governments globally are drafting bills to implement an Australia-style ban. 

""This is a global issue, and governments everywhere are under pressure to respond,"" Daisy Greenwell, co-founder of U.K.-based Smartphone Free Childhood, told CNBC. SFC is a grassroots campaign urging parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access.

""We're already seeing countries move in this direction, and as confidence builds and evidence accumulates, more will follow. No one thinks the status quo is working for children, parents, or society – and this is one of the clearest policy responses currently on the table,"" Greenwell added. 

Other countries that are considering an under-16s social media ban include the U.K., France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Italy and Greece. 

The U.S. is trailing behind on this front with a national ban being unlikely, however there is certainly state and local interest, according to Ravi Iyer, a managing director of the University of Southern California Marshall School's Neely Center. 

Iyer has worked closely with social psychologist Jonathon Haidt who wrote the renowned book The Anxious Generation, about the harmful impacts of social media and smartphones on children and teens. 

""It's really hard to predict Federal policy, but it is one of the few bipartisan issues left, so it certainly is possible,"" Iyer said in emailed comments. 

""I'm more confident at the state level and I believe we will see a few U.S. states enact such a policy in the next couple years.""

Lawmakers in California and Texas are looking at bringing in state-level bans in 2026. 

But governments looking to implement such bans could face resistance from the tech giants. 

Following Australia's move, community-focused forum Reddit launched a lawsuit, arguing that the new law goes too far by restricting political discussion online. Facebook and Instagram owner Meta urged Canberra to reconsider the ban. And in a statement to users explaining how the restrictions work, Elon Musk's X said: ""It's not our choice – it's what the Australian law requires.""

Meanwhile, calls for a social media ban for under-16s in the U.K. have grown rapidly at the beginning of this year. The U.K.'s House of Lords is expected to vote this week to amend the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to include a social media ban for under-16s. 

Greenwell's SFC launched an email campaign this week, which saw more than 100,000 emails sent to local U.K. lawmakers. The SFC template email urged the government to set ""reasonable, age-appropriate boundaries that protect children's wellbeing."" 

""We consistently see that the more time children spend on smartphones and social media, the worse their mental health outcomes tend to be. If these platforms are no longer available, the network effects collapse – and young people can reconnect with each other and with the real world,"" Greenwell told CNBC. 

U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has even backed the idea saying ""we need to better protect children from social media"" and that he's studying Australia's ban. 

""All options are on the table in relation to what further protections we can put in place - whether that's under-16s on social media or an issue I am very concerned about, under fives and screen time,"" Starmer said last week. 

""Children are turning up age four at reception [the first year of school] having spent far too much time on screens,"" he added.

Meanwhile, U.K. health secretary Wes Streeting asked The Anxious Generation author Haidt to address his officials at an event to push for stricter limits on young people. 

France is also a strong contender as it debates two bills, one backed by French President Emmanuel Macron, to prevent social media access for under 15s, France24 reported last week. France's public health watchdog ANSES outlined that social media's negative effects are ""numerous"" and well documented. 

USC's Iyer said that if a teen ban becomes a global norm, it alleviates the pressure on young people to self-police. 

""One of the primary goals of the law is to change the norm, such that teens don't feel pressure to use social media because all their friends are doing so"" Iyer said. 

""It's not really a realistic choice to abstain if you feel that all your friends are using a particular platform. If we can solve that problem and the majority of teens are off of social media, we'll have done a lot of good,"" he added.

Tax changes for 2026 offer new ways for individuals ages 65 and over to plan financially.

That is largely due to a new temporary senior ""bonus"" or deduction of up to $6,000 per qualifying individual that was enacted when President Donald Trump signed the ""big beautiful bill"" package into law last July. A married couple filing jointly could qualify for a deduction of up to $12,000.

The $6,000 senior deduction is in effect from tax years 2025 through 2028. It applies to taxpayers 65 and over, regardless of whether they itemize their tax returns or take the standard deduction. 

Retirees may not have made full use of the break since it was implemented partway through last year, experts say, but the next three years of planning could be key.

""This three-year window is an incredible, valuable opportunity,"" said Miklos Ringbauer, a certified public accountant and founder and principal of MiklosCPA Inc., an accounting and tax strategy firm in Southern California.

""It's three times $12,000, plus adjusted for inflation,"" Ringbauer said. ""That's a lot of savings that we can build in for further down the road."" 

The deduction will lower, or may even eliminate, the taxes eligible seniors owe. However, because it is not a tax credit, they will not necessarily receive those sums back in their refunds.

The impact of the deduction could be vast, Bill Sweeney, senior vice president of government affairs at AARP, said during a Jan. 15 briefing on the tax changes.

The Council of Economic Advisers, an agency within the executive office of the president, estimates about 33.9 million seniors may qualify for the new senior deduction and receive an average $670 increase in after-tax income per eligible taxpayer.

""That's four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs,"" Sweeney said.

Seniors must have a modified adjusted gross income under certain thresholds to qualify for the full deduction — up to $75,000 if single or $150,000 if married and filing taxes jointly. The deduction is gradually reduced for taxpayers with incomes over those thresholds and fully phases out for individuals with $175,000 or more in income and married couples with $250,000.

On the campaign trail, Trump pitched eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. Yet because the law was passed by a legislative process known as reconciliation, Republican lawmakers could not directly make that change. Instead, the new senior deduction is aimed at replacing the income that any federal taxes on Social Security benefits may take away. 

Federal taxes on Social Security benefits that are still in effect make it so beneficiaries may face levies on a formula called combined income — the sum of adjusted gross income, nontaxable interest and half of Social Security benefits. 

Up to 50% of Social Security benefits are taxable for individuals with $25,000 to $34,000 in combined income, and married couples who file jointly with between $32,000 and $44,000. Up to 85% of benefits are taxable for individuals with more than $34,000 in combined income and married couples with over $44,000.   

The ""big beautiful"" tax package includes other tax changes that individuals ages 65 and over may take advantage of — a higher standard deduction and state and local tax deduction, a deduction of up to $10,000 per taxpayer for interest on new auto loans, plus no tax on tips or overtime pay for those who are still working.

""With tax changes come tax planning opportunities,"" said Joe Elsasser, a certified financial planner and president of Covisum, a Social Security claiming software company. 

Notably, the new $6,000 senior deduction applies to individuals 65 and over, whether they have claimed Social Security benefits or not, Elsasser said. 

""Don't just focus on the temporary additional senior deduction as a reduction of Social Security tax,"" Elsasser said. ""Instead, think of it as a four-year additional deduction that could be applied against any kind of income.""

The new change went into effect with the 2025 tax year. Yet some individuals may not have been mindful of their taxable income for the year with the new senior deduction in mind, according to Ringbauer.

For example, if taxpayers ages 65 and over had a very successful year in the stock market in 2025, they may be phased out of the full deduction that could have been available to them, Ringbauer said.

For tax years 2026 and beyond, older individuals may want to focus on how to stay within the deduction's income limits, he said.

Individuals who are age 65 and up and still working may be able to reduce their taxable income by contributing to a retirement plan. In 2026, individuals ages 50 and older may be able to contribute up to $32,500 to a 401(k)-retirement plan, including catch-up contributions. Individuals ages 60 to 63 may be able to set aside up to $35,750, with super catch-up contributions.

Older taxpayers may also consider reducing their taxable income through charitable contributions.

Individuals ages 65 and older also want to be aware of other potential sources of income — such as required minimum distributions or Roth conversions — that may affect the size of their taxable income and therefore eligibility for the senior deduction, Ringbauer said.

The new senior deduction will reduce taxes on other income, not just Social Security, according to Elsasser.

Consequently, for taxpayers who have financial flexibility, it may make sense to withdraw money from IRAs or other retirement accounts while the temporary deduction is in place, he said. Those withdrawals may also help reduce required minimum distributions later, which can also help limit retirees' future income subject to taxes. 

Notably, that strategy may also help individuals ages 65 and over to delay claiming Social Security retirement benefits. Delaying Social Security provides a guaranteed return of 8% per year from full retirement age — typically age 66 or 67 — up to age 70.

Those who have already claimed Social Security retirement benefits and who have reached full retirement age may consider voluntarily suspending their monthly checks while the senior bonus is in effect to let their future monthly benefit checks grow, Elsasser said.

If Indiana University wins the 2026 College Football Playoff National Championship on Monday, fans will owe some thanks to one of the football program's biggest financial donors: billionaire Mark Cuban.

Cuban, whose net worth is estimated at $9.6 billion by Bloomberg, graduated from IU with a degree in management in 1981. He's a longtime donor to his alma mater, including $5 million for a sports media center in 2015 and $6 million for IU's rugby team in 2024.

While Cuban hasn't disclosed the size of his recent donations to IU's athletic department, it was a ""big number,"" the billionaire told CBS in October 2025. The team's recent success under head coach Curt Cignetti, hired in 2024, inspired Cuban to open his checkbook again: The school is ""happier this year than last year"" after his latest donation, Cuban told Front Office Sports on Jan. 7.

Now, Cignetti's team is just one win against the University of Miami away from a national championship and Cuban says it's because the coach understands the most important aspects of building a successful organization.

""I've been part of championship organizations and putting together a team isn't easy,"" Cuban told Bloomington, Indiana's The Herald-Times on Jan. 10. The billionaire was the majority owner of the NBA's Dallas Mavericks when that team won an NBA championship in 2011, and remains a minority owner of the team today.

Cuban discussed team-building strategy with Cignetti and came away impressed, he said. The coach assured Cuban that the team would use his donations to recruit a well-rounded roster of players, rather than putting the money toward chasing after just a few high-profile recruits, said Cuban.

""It's about getting players that know their roles, work as a team, continue to improve and work in the system,"" Cuban told the newspaper. ""When you have a coach and organization that understands that, that's how championship teams and organizations are built. That's why I've been so excited to support them.""

Cuban has previously spoken about how good leaders build successful businesses through hiring the right people. Leaders should avoid hiring people who don't fit their company culture, ""because you can't have conflict on what the vision of the company is,"" he said on a March 2021 episode of the ""Starting Greatness"" podcast. ""You've got to hire the right people for the right roles.""

Every winning team, or successful business, needs those employees who excel in their specific roles, like the ""glue guys"" on a basketball team, Cuban added on ""Starting Greatness."" Culture and competency are the two biggest considerations for leaders when building a team, Cuban said during a MasterClass course released in February 2024. 

Cuban chose to attend IU because, at the time, the university offered the cheapest tuition out of the country's top 10 business education programs, he's said. He's credited his time at the school for exposing him ""to all kinds of different people [and] ideas"" while nurturing his early entrepreneurial skills: Cuban opened and ran a local bar as an undergraduate, and picked up extra cash teaching dance lessons.

""Just watching the team I grew up with from the time I was 18 years old [and] to be part of this, wow,"" Cuban told The Herald-Times. ""What it gives me is far more than anything I could give to IU. No one would know who the hell I am if it wasn't for Indiana University.""

Fresh money poured back into US spot Bitcoin ETFs this week, giving the market a clear jolt after a quiet month. The inflows totaled about $1.42 billion, the biggest weekly pickup since early October. That rush pushed prices higher for a time and pulled a lot of attention back to these regulated funds.

Institutional Demand Comes Back

Reports say big, familiar investors are rejoining these funds. Managers with large pools of capital are using ETFs to get Bitcoin exposure in a way that fits standard rules and reporting.

Some of the buying came through a tight set of funds that have wide reach with big clients. The move is being read as a return of steady, long-term money rather than quick speculative bets.

Reports from the Bitcoin macro newsletter Ecoinometrics note that recent jumps in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows usually lead to brief price gains, which often disappear when the inflows ease.

Based on data from SoSoValue, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw their biggest inflows midweek, with Wednesday bringing in more than $840 million in a single day and Tuesday following with roughly $754 million.

Bitcoin doesn't need a few good days. It needs a few good weeks.

We've seen this pattern repeatedly: a short burst of ETF inflows, a quick price bounce, and then momentum fades. That tells us demand still exists, but it's not persistent enough to change the trend.

The chart… pic.twitter.com/6mkv7ye9fW



BlackRock's IBIT Tops Flows

BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust drew the largest share of the gains. On several days it led all spot ETF flows, with one report showing IBIT accounted for roughly $1.03 billion of the weekly total.

A single day during the run saw IBIT pull in amounts measured in the hundreds of millions, underlining how dominant the fund has become in the US market.

When big, regulated vehicles buy a lot of Bitcoin, the effect is not just on paper. These ETFs must either create new shares by buying coins or choose to source supply elsewhere.

That process removes coins from the pool available to regular traders. At the same time, some data show that large holders eased off selling in recent days, which tightened the coins ready to trade even more. The mix of fresh demand and less selling can lift price quickly. Short Gains, Or The Start Of Something Longer? 

Some market watchers point out that a single week of big inflows is only part of the picture. Patterns matter. If monthly flows stay strong, then the story is clearer.

If the money fades, prices can fall back just as fast. Still, the sudden inflow shows that at least a group of big investors prefers regulated ETF exposure right now. That matters for how traditional funds think about Bitcoin in balanced portfolios.Bitcon Price Action 

Bitcoin has been hovering around $95,000 this week, moving up and down slightly as buyers and sellers test the market. Reports say the price steadied after a small bounce from recent lows.

Some updates show Bitcoin briefly rising above $96,800, shaking out short-term traders. Analysts note the swings reflect mixed sentiment, with the market unsure of the next clear direction.

Explore how these two crypto ETFs differ in cost, risk, and portfolio approach -- key factors for aligning with your investment strategy.

The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT +0.44%) tracks Bitcoin itself with a lower expense ratio and much larger assets under management, while the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ +4.12%) offers exposure to crypto-related equities, higher volatility, and a more diversified portfolio of 33 holdings.



Both IBIT and BITQ target investors interested in the crypto economy, but their approaches are fundamentally different. IBIT provides direct Bitcoin price exposure, while BITQ invests in companies that operate in the crypto sector, such as exchanges and mining firms. This comparison highlights key differences in cost, performance, risk, and portfolio makeup to help clarify which may align better with specific investor goals.





Beta measures price volatility relative to the S&P 500; beta is calculated from five-year weekly returns. The 1-yr return represents total return over the trailing 12 months.

BITQ charges a higher management fee than IBIT, making it less affordable on cost alone, though its recent performance has outpaced IBIT over the past year.









BITQ focuses on the broader crypto economy by investing in 33 companies across financial services, technology, and consumer cyclical sectors. Its largest holdings include Iren (IREN +11.43%) at 14.68%, Coinbase Global(COIN +0.78%) at 8.39%, and Microstrategy (MSTR +1.64%) at 6.80%. The fund has operated for 4.7 years, offering indirect crypto exposure without the need to hold digital assets.



IBIT, by contrast, is a pure-play vehicle holding only Bitcoin and cash. This results in a single-asset exposure, tracking the digital currency's price movements almost one-for-one. Unlike BITQ, IBIT does not hold equities or diversify across companies, so its performance is tied directly to Bitcoin's price. There are no notable structural quirks or thematic tilts in IBIT, and its large size provides ample liquidity for most investors.

For more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link.

Cryptocurrency ETFs represent one of the newest investment categories, with spot Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT only launching in January 2024. These funds offer regulated exposure to crypto assets without the complexity of managing digital wallets or navigating exchanges. 

BITQ invests in crypto-related companies like miners, exchanges, and service providers, holding around 30 stocks with a hefty 0.85% expense ratio -- meaning a $10,000 investment will cost you $85 in fees. Its $400 million in assets and beta above 4 signal extreme volatility, so this ETF is not for the faint of heart. In contrast, IBIT holds physical Bitcoin directly through institutional custody, tracking Bitcoin's price movements with a 0.25% expense ratio and massive $71 billion in assets from BlackRock's backing.

These ETFs suit investors who understand cryptocurrency's extreme volatility and want regulated exposure without direct coin ownership. If you're interested in pure Bitcoin price tracking at a lower cost, IBIT is the ETF for you. For diversified exposure to crypto industry growth, choose BITQ. But only allocate capital you can afford to lose entirely, as crypto remains highly speculative and prone to dramatic swings.

Something went wrong

XRP is a more efficient payment method than Bitcoin, offering fast transactions and sub-$0.01 fees.

It's designed as a cross-border payments solution for financial institutions, but it hasn't been widely adopted.

While Bitcoin is the more proven investment, XRP also has potential if it can increase usage with issuer Ripple's banking partners.

10 stocks we like better than XRP ›

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is the largest cryptocurrency by a wide margin, worth nearly $2 trillion (as of Jan. 14). Because of its value and the immense cost of buying just 1 BTC, many crypto investors prefer to look for altcoins -- a term for all the cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.

A popular choice is XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), which has a market cap of $127 billion. That theoretically gives it more growth potential, and over the last five years, XRP has increased by 666% compared to Bitcoin's returns of 169%.

If you're wondering whether you should invest in XRP instead of Bitcoin for your crypto portfolio, here's what you need to know.

Bitcoin and XRP are both decentralized digital currencies that use blockchain technology to record transactions. Bitcoin was the first, and its anonymous founder launched it in 2009 as a digital currency for online payments, with no reliance on a central banking system.

XRP has a much different origin story. Ripple, a private company, launched XRP in 2012. Where Bitcoin's purpose was to eliminate the need for financial institutions, Ripple designed XRP to work with financial institutions, making cross-border payments faster and cheaper.

Of the two, XRP works much better as a payment method. Transactions typically process in three to five seconds and cost well under $0.01. Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, normally take about 10 minutes, and the current average fee is just over $0.80.

However, hardly anybody uses Bitcoin as a payment method anymore. It's an investment, often referred to as a form of digital gold. A fairly low maximum supply of 21 million BTC helps with that by providing built-in scarcity. XRP exists in more of a middle ground between investment and payment method.

The value of XRP is tied to its issuer. Ripple offers a blockchain-based global payments network, Ripple Payments, which banks can utilize for fast and affordable international transactions. Ripple Payments includes an On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) feature that incorporates XRP.

Banks have traditionally maintained pre-funded accounts with foreign currencies. If a bank uses ODL with Ripple Payments, it can instead convert its local currency to XRP to transfer funds. The recipient can then convert XRP into its own currency.

As financial institutions adopt XRP for ODL, demand will likely grow, and the price should increase. There are a few hurdles this cryptocurrency has to overcome, though.

While Ripple has partnered with over 300 financial institutions, many of them only use Ripple Payments without ODL. In the second quarter of 2025, $1.3 billion in transactions were processed through ODL, according to Digital Asset Solutions. Such small payment volume won't drive much growth for XRP.

Ripple also launched a stablecoin, Ripple USD (CRYPTO: RLUSD), in December 2024. Stablecoins aim to maintain the same value as another asset -- in Ripple USD's case, the U.S. dollar. This could potentially reduce demand for XRP if banks prefer a stable asset for ODL instead of XRP, which is highly volatile.

XRP has had several growth catalysts since late 2024. It surged after the election of Donald Trump as president, and issuer Ripple's five-year lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) came to an end in August 2025. The SEC would go on to approve the first spot XRP ETFs in November 2025. But for XRP to take the next step, usage by financial institutions will need to increase.

I wouldn't recommend forgetting about Bitcoin and buying any other cryptocurrency instead, XRP included. Bitcoin accounts for nearly 60% of the value in the entire crypto market, and although it isn't always the top performer, it has consistently set new all-time highs in every bull market. XRP still hasn't topped its all-time high from 2018. If you invest in cryptocurrency, it makes sense to have Bitcoin in your portfolio.

That said, you may want to hold altcoins, too, in which case XRP is worth considering. It has a potentially lucrative use case as a digital currency for financial institutions. With XRP's speed and low costs, plus Ripple's payments network, it could be a long-term winner.

Before you buy stock in XRP, consider this:

Writer by choice, CryptoCurrency Writer, and Researcher by chance.  Currently, focusing on financial news and analysis, as well as cryptocurrency news and data. One may not call me a crypto “Enthusiast” but trust me I'm getting there.

Ethereum's biggest risk may no longer be competition, regulation, or scaling. According to Vitalik Buterin, the real threat is something more subtle: complexity.

In a recent warning, Buterin argued that Ethereum's long-term goals, trustlessness, self-sovereignty, and resilience, are being quietly undermined as the protocol grows larger, more technical, and harder to understand. His message was blunt. A blockchain does not become stronger just because it adds features. In many cases, it becomes weaker.

Ethereum is often praised for its decentralization. Thousands of nodes verify transactions, and no single party controls the network. But Buterin argues that decentralization alone is not enough.

If a protocol becomes so complex that only a small group of experts can fully understand it, trust creeps back in. Users end up trusting developers, auditors, or cryptography specialists to explain what the system does and whether it is safe. At that point, the system may be decentralized in theory, but not in practice.

Buterin calls this failing the “walkaway test.” If today's client teams disappeared, could new developers realistically rebuild Ethereum clients from scratch and reach the same level of safety and quality? As the codebase grows and the cryptography becomes more exotic, that answer becomes less clear.

Every added feature increases the number of ways different parts of the protocol can interact. Each interaction is another chance for something to break.

Buterin warns that Ethereum development has often favored adding features to solve specific problems, while rarely removing old ones. Backward compatibility makes subtraction difficult, so the protocol slowly accumulates technical debt. Over time, this bloat makes Ethereum harder to secure, harder to audit, and harder to evolve safely.

To counter this, Buterin calls for an explicit simplification process. Not just optimizing code, but actively removing unnecessary parts.

His idea of simplification focuses on three things: reducing total lines of code, minimizing reliance on highly complex cryptography, and strengthening core invariants, rules the protocol can always rely on. Fewer moving parts make systems easier to reason about and harder to break.

Ethereum has done this before. The move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake was a form of large-scale cleanup. Future changes, such as leaner consensus designs or moving complexity into smart contracts instead of the core protocol, could follow the same logic.

Perhaps the most uncomfortable part of Buterin's argument is his conclusion. Ethereum may need to change less, not more.

He describes Ethereum's first fifteen years as an experimental adolescence. Many ideas were tested. Some worked. Others did not. The danger now is allowing failed or outdated ideas to become permanent baggage.

If Ethereum wants to survive for decades, or even a century, Buterin suggests it must prioritize simplicity over ambition. Otherwise, the protocol risks becoming too complex to truly belong to its users.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Vitalik calls for a ‘garbage collection' function to stop Ethereum bloat","https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:b1eb068e0094b:0-vitalik-calls-for-a-garbage-collection-function-to-stop-ethereum-bloat/","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 11:41:34 GMT","

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin is urging developers to confront the protocol bloat driven by an endless push to add new features while rarely removing old ones.

In a Sunday post on X, Buterin argued that true trustlessness and self-sovereignty depend less on raw decentralization metrics and more on simplicity. 

“Even if a protocol is super decentralized with hundreds of thousands of nodes, and it has 49% byzantine fault tolerance, and nodes fully verify everything with quantum-safe peerdas and starks, if the protocol is an unwieldy mess of hundreds of thousands of lines of code and five forms of PhD-level cryptography, ultimately that protocol fails,” he claimed 

According to Buterin, this complexity undermines Ethereum (ETH) on three fronts. First, it weakens trustlessness by forcing users to rely on “high priests” to explain what the protocol actually does. Second, it fails the so-called walkaway test, because rebuilding high-quality clients becomes unrealistic if existing teams disappear. Third, it erodes self-sovereignty, as even highly technical users can no longer inspect or reason about the system on their own.

Buterin urges “garbage collection”

Buterin warned that the issue is rooted in how protocol changes are evaluated. When upgrades are judged mainly by how disruptive they are to existing systems, backward compatibility tends to dominate decision-making. The result is a bias toward additions rather than subtractions, causing the protocol to grow heavier over time.

To counter this, he called for an explicit “simplification” or “garbage collection” function in Ethereum's development process. The goal would be to reduce total lines of code, limit reliance on complex cryptographic primitives, and introduce more invariants — fixed rules that make client behavior easier to predict and implement. 

The Ethereum mastermind pointed to past changes as examples of effective cleanup. The shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) was one large-scale reset, while more recent efforts, such as gas cost reforms, aim to replace arbitrary rules with clearer links to actual resource usage. Future cleanups could involve demoting rarely used features from the core protocol into smart contracts, reducing the burden on client developers.

Solana Labs CEO prefers a different approach

Meanwhile, Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko says Solana (SOL) must remain in constant motion, arguing that a blockchain that stops evolving to meet developer and user needs risks becoming irrelevant. Responding to a recent post by Buterin, Yakovenko claimed that continuous iteration is essential for Solana's survival, even if no single group is responsible for driving those changes.

In contrast, Buterin has argued that Ethereum should eventually pass the “walkaway test,” reaching a point where it can operate securely and predictably for decades without ongoing developer intervention.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ethereum","Why enterprises choose Ethereum for tokenization","https://www.jpost.com/crypto-currency/article-883721","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:53:27 GMT","

As cryptocurrency has matured into a seriously considered asset, Ethereum's value has moved far beyond speculative trading. Now, many businesses are using Ethereum's technology to build financial systems that could transform how capital markets, real estate, and asset ownership operate. While the Ethereum price USD is the main indicator of interest in ETH, Ethereum's true value comes from its role as a base for tokenization, assets, and institutional finance. 

For many companies, Ethereum isn't just another cryptocurrency. It stands out as a programmable blockchain that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). This quality makes it perfect for creating whole financial systems. Smart contracts automate financial processes, ensure compliance, and allow for programmable ownership.

As one article noted, “VanEck CEO Jan van Eck believes Ethereum will be the blockchain backbone for stablecoins, calling it the ‘Wall Street token.'” More and more, institutions see Ethereum as a way to get involved in the growing Web3 ecosystem through smart contracts, tokenized assets, or decentralized finance.

Because of these capabilities, Ethereum is becoming an essential layer in modern financial models. On-chain, you can track ownership, settlements, compliance, and liquidity. 

Businesses use crypto to turn real-world assets into tokens, which is one of the most important applications. This means converting assets such as real estate, debt, bonds, or cash into digital tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

RWA tokenization allows for partial ownership. Large or illiquid assets, such as real estate, fine art, or funds, can be split into smaller fractions, making these investments more accessible to people with smaller budgets. 

Smart contracts on Ethereum can automate tasks such as distributing rental income in real estate, making interest payments on bonds, or disbursing dividends. Automated management enables institutions to allocate more time to strategic initiatives and less time to manual fund management.

Tokenized assets can actually reduce some of the friction found in traditional transfer processes by utilizing the blockchain's transparent and immutable ledger. Businesses get to operate more efficiently and can reduce auditing teams in this model.

According to recent data, Ethereum already supports nearly ten times the total value of RWAs than the next most popular blockchain. Six of the top ten protocols that issue real-world asset tokens are built on Ethereum or its underlying Layer-2 networks.

Some firms have projected that the overall market for tokenized real-world assets could be worth up to $2 trillion by 2028, with the vast majority of on-chain activity taking place on Ethereum. These statistics show how valuable Ethereum is, making it more appealing for traditional finance institutions. This chain provides a reliable and popular platform that can meet compliance standards.

Enterprise adoption isn't solely about tokenizing assets. Some public companies now hold ETH as part of their treasury strategy. For example, BitMine Immersion Technologies, a company that has historically focused on BTC mining, announced that it was shifting to ETH. As of 2025, BitMine holds millions of ETH, which is worth billions of dollars, as part of its treasury allocation. Other data shows that at least 26 institutions now have a combined 5.7 million ETH, which is a significant portion of their total supply.

This kind of adoption demonstrates institutions' high confidence not just in ETH's value, but in its broader utility. It putsEthereum in the position to be a strategic digital asset that's directly tied to a real, functional network for enterprise finance. 

Tokenization and treasuries are just two parts of Ethereum's ecosystem. Its infrastructure can handle a wide range of business needs, such as tracking the supply chain, settling trades, and making sure that people are who they say they are.

Enterprises and even governments are already exploring how blockchain-based solutions use Ethereum to create more efficient, auditable, and programmable systems. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) brought together major companies, including banks, financial institutions, and tech firms, to explore how businesses could use blockchain. 

Today, that spirit of community and collaboration remains. Companies are selecting Ethereum for its ability to work with other systems and its solid developer support.

Despite its promising technology and high adoption, using Ethereum for institutional systems has its own challenges. While tokenization and on-chain assets can improve transparency and compliance within a company, legal policies remain uncertain. Institutions should ensure they comply with local laws and compliance standards before issuing or trading tokenized assets.

If you want to keep a lot of ETH or tokenized assets, you need strict custody solutions, clear governance, and internal security. This is especially true for institutions that have only used traditional assets before. You might need to hire a whole new team to take care of the digital assets. 

While Ethereum's RWA ecosystem is growing rapidly, tokenized markets remain less developed than traditional capital markets. Real-world adoption by a broader audience will take time. Even so, many companies see these hurdles as negligible given the potential payoff of using modern crypto-based solutions.

If the current momentum continues, Ethereum could become the backbone of the overall digital financial system. It supports assets, funds, debt, real estate, and even corporate treasuries entirely on-chain.

Cryptocurrency offers a mature, flexible, and highly adopted foundation for decentralized finance. For many companies, Ethereum has become a bridge between traditional operations and a more programmable financial future.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=altcoins","XRP Surge Alert: 33% Weekly Climb to $3.26 as Altcoins Crush Bitcoin in Epic Rally","https://blockmanity.com/news/xrp-surge-alert-33-weekly-climb-to-3-26-as-altcoins-crush-bitcoin-in-epic-rally/","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 03:34:35 GMT","

In the fast-moving world of crypto, XRP is stealing the show. This week, XRP jumped 33% in price, hitting $3.26. It now sits just 4.8% away from its all-time high. While Bitcoin stays flat after new peaks, altcoins like XRP are leading a huge market rally.

XRP broke through a key resistance level at $2.60. This move opens the door for even higher prices. Experts say if XRP pushes past $3.40, it could enter price discovery mode. That means new highs with no clear top in sight.

The XRP price surge shows strong buyer interest. Trading volume is up, and whales are accumulating. Ripple's ongoing wins in court and growing use in cross-border payments add fuel to this fire.

Bitcoin hit fresh all-time highs but couldn't hold gains. Its market dominance dropped from 65% to 61.5%. Meanwhile, the altcoin market cap exploded 47% in 90 days to $1.44 trillion.

Of the top 100 cryptos, 77 turned green this week. Bitcoin stayed flat, but altcoins shone bright. This shift signals the start of altseason, where coins like XRP outperform BTC.

Dogecoin (DOGE) bounced back above $0.20 for the first time in six weeks. Meme coins are resurging with hype from social media and big endorsements.

Solana (SOL) gained 5.9% in one day. Its fast network and DeFi growth keep it popular.

Cardano (ADA) rose 8% on Thursday. Smart contract upgrades are drawing developers.

Ethereum's market share climbed above 10% for the first time since March. DeFi tokens like Aave and Uniswap also rallied hard.

Market watchers point to stablecoin adoption as a key driver. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC are flowing into altcoins, boosting liquidity. Solana, XRP, and DeFi projects benefit most.

Bitcoin's dominance fall means money is rotating into alts. Lower interest rates and ETF inflows could extend this trend. Galaxy analyst Michael Harvey highlighted rallies in SOL, XRP, Aave, and Uniswap.

“Strong rallies in Solana, XRP, and DeFi tokens are fueled by stablecoin growth.” – Market Expert

XRP's chart looks strong. The breakout above $2.60 confirms a bullish trend. RSI is in the green but not overbought. MACD shows upward momentum.

Support holds at $2.80-$3.00. If bulls stay in control, $4.00 is next. Watch for Bitcoin moves – a BTC dip could spark more XRP gains.



Bitcoin remains king, but altcoins are fighting back. BTC dominance at 61.5% is low compared to peaks. Altcoin season often follows BTC tops.

Investors rotate profits from BTC to alts for higher returns. This week proves alts can outperform even in bull markets.

XRP could test $3.50 soon if volume holds. Broader market depends on macro news like Fed decisions. Positive crypto regs could send prices soaring.

Stay tuned for more XRP news. With altcoins on fire, this rally has legs. Don't miss out – DYOR and trade smart.

The <33% Weekly Climb to $3.26> puts XRP in spotlight. As altcoins outperform Bitcoin, the market feels alive again. Whether you're HODLing XRP or eyeing DOGE and SOL, excitement is high.

Writer by choice, CryptoCurrency Writer, and Researcher by chance.  Currently, focusing on financial news and analysis, as well as cryptocurrency news and data. One may not call me a crypto “Enthusiast” but trust me I'm getting there.

Ethereum's biggest risk may no longer be competition, regulation, or scaling. According to Vitalik Buterin, the real threat is something more subtle: complexity.

In a recent warning, Buterin argued that Ethereum's long-term goals, trustlessness, self-sovereignty, and resilience, are being quietly undermined as the protocol grows larger, more technical, and harder to understand. His message was blunt. A blockchain does not become stronger just because it adds features. In many cases, it becomes weaker.

Ethereum is often praised for its decentralization. Thousands of nodes verify transactions, and no single party controls the network. But Buterin argues that decentralization alone is not enough.

If a protocol becomes so complex that only a small group of experts can fully understand it, trust creeps back in. Users end up trusting developers, auditors, or cryptography specialists to explain what the system does and whether it is safe. At that point, the system may be decentralized in theory, but not in practice.

Buterin calls this failing the “walkaway test.” If today's client teams disappeared, could new developers realistically rebuild Ethereum clients from scratch and reach the same level of safety and quality? As the codebase grows and the cryptography becomes more exotic, that answer becomes less clear.

Every added feature increases the number of ways different parts of the protocol can interact. Each interaction is another chance for something to break.

Buterin warns that Ethereum development has often favored adding features to solve specific problems, while rarely removing old ones. Backward compatibility makes subtraction difficult, so the protocol slowly accumulates technical debt. Over time, this bloat makes Ethereum harder to secure, harder to audit, and harder to evolve safely.

To counter this, Buterin calls for an explicit simplification process. Not just optimizing code, but actively removing unnecessary parts.

His idea of simplification focuses on three things: reducing total lines of code, minimizing reliance on highly complex cryptography, and strengthening core invariants, rules the protocol can always rely on. Fewer moving parts make systems easier to reason about and harder to break.

Ethereum has done this before. The move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake was a form of large-scale cleanup. Future changes, such as leaner consensus designs or moving complexity into smart contracts instead of the core protocol, could follow the same logic.

Perhaps the most uncomfortable part of Buterin's argument is his conclusion. Ethereum may need to change less, not more.

He describes Ethereum's first fifteen years as an experimental adolescence. Many ideas were tested. Some worked. Others did not. The danger now is allowing failed or outdated ideas to become permanent baggage.

If Ethereum wants to survive for decades, or even a century, Buterin suggests it must prioritize simplicity over ambition. Otherwise, the protocol risks becoming too complex to truly belong to its users.

NASA's latest drone test shows how blockchain could protect future flights from cyber threats.

In a move that signals a bold leap for aviation cybersecurity, NASA is testing blockchain technology to protect air travel systems from data tampering and disruption. A recent test at NASA's Ames Research Center used drones to validate a decentralized data infrastructure designed to secure communication between aircraft and ground control. This initiative, part of the agency's Air Traffic Management and Safety project, could transform the backbone of future airspace operations.

The heart of the test involved a custom-modified Alta-X drone flying in real-world conditions at the Ames Research Center in California's Silicon Valley. The drone was equipped with a specialized suite including a GPS module, radio transmitter, and a blockchain-integrated computer system. This setup allowed researchers to evaluate how a blockchain-based framework performs in an actual operational environment. Unlike traditional databases, blockchain operates as a distributed ledger. Information is shared across multiple systems, and each change is logged and verified. This ensures that flight data remains authentic, immutable, and transparent even under cyber pressure.

The system enables secure real-time transactions of sensitive aviation data such as telemetry, operator registration, and flight plans. Only verified and trusted users can access the information, shielding it from manipulation or unauthorized access. This aspect is particularly significant in an era where cyberthreats are becoming more sophisticated and the integrity of air traffic management systems is constantly at risk. The test highlighted that such decentralized architecture could be fundamental to supporting autonomous vehicles, urban air mobility, and even high-altitude operations.

Unlike previous efforts that relied heavily on layered security where multiple software and hardware barriers are built to block intrusions, NASA's blockchain approach embraces zero-trust principles. Every interaction, transaction, and data packet is logged and verified, eliminating reliance on any single point of control or failure. As noted in the original NASA report, the test demonstrated how blockchain systems could remain resilient even under intentional cyberstress simulations.

The team also introduced a series of penetration tests during the drone flights to assess how the system would react under real cyberattacks. The blockchain framework responded well, maintaining data integrity throughout. This marks a significant step toward creating scalable and secure airspace operations especially as traffic from drones, high-altitude aircraft, and electric vertical takeoff vehicles (eVTOLs) continues to grow. Researchers believe that the system, once refined, can form the digital spine for next-generation air mobility networks.

One of the most promising elements of the blockchain trial is its potential to streamline and safeguard autonomous aviation. As more uncrewed systems take to the skies from delivery drones to flying taxis, the need for secure communication channels becomes critical. Traditional systems rely on centralized command-and-control models that are vulnerable to single-point failures or external attacks. Blockchain by design prevents this by ensuring that data exists in multiple synchronized nodes, making unauthorized tampering exceedingly difficult.

NASA's research suggests that the technology could support secure digital identity verification, real-time flight plan validation, and operator accountability, key features in managing future urban and commercial skies. As cities plan for low-altitude air corridors filled with semi-autonomous aircraft, blockchain could serve as the guardian layer, maintaining order, traceability, and security. It's not just about locking down data. It's about creating a digital trust system that can grow with the complexity of the airspace.

Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko emphasized the importance of maintaining an ever-evolving blockchain ecosystem, highlighting a dynamic approach prioritized by the network. He contrasted this vision with Ethereum's focus on decentralization and sustainability, as outlined by its co-founder Vitalik Buterin.

Tickers mentioned: Ethereum, Solana

Sentiment: Neutral

Price impact: Neutral. The contrasting philosophies reveal divergent development strategies without immediate market repercussions.

During a recent statement, Anatoly Yakovenko stressed that Solana must continuously innovate, asserting that the network should never depend solely on specific groups or individuals for upgrades. Instead, a diverse community should steer protocol improvements, including AI-assisted development efforts. He envisions a future where Solana's fees could directly support AI applications aimed at optimizing the network's codebase, reinforcing a commitment to adaptable technology.

Yakovenko reaffirmed that “You should always count on there being a next version of Solana,” signaling ongoing development and evolution. This approach starkly contrasts with Ethereum's vision of becoming a highly decentralized, stable platform that prioritizes security and decentralization, even at the expense of faster scaling.

Meanwhile, Vitalik Buterin recently indicated that Ethereum still has significant work ahead before achieving true self-sustainability. Improvements such as quantum resistance, advanced scalability features, and more decentralized block production are critical for Ethereum's future resilience. His emphasis remains on safeguarding decentralized sovereignty, even if it slows adoption in the short term.

Both networks operate within a competitive landscape, with Ethereum dominating smart contracts and tokenization, while Solana capitalizes on speed and consumer app integration. Their differing roadmaps reflect broader industry debates on innovation speed versus protocol security and decentralization.

In summary, Solana is committed to a flexible, community-driven evolution model, potentially harnessing AI for future upgrades, whereas Ethereum aims for a robust, self-sufficient system built on decentralization and security. These strategic choices are shaping their respective roles in the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem.

Key Takeaways

Hyperliquid is a decentralized crypto trading platform that combines fast execution with full control over your funds, making it ideal for traders who want speed and transparency.

Hyperliquid uses an on-chain order book that allows users to place limit orders, trade perpetual contracts, and manage positions with precision, similar to centralized exchanges.

The Hyperliquid Crypto Exchange runs on its own native blockchain, optimized for high-speed trading, which ensures transactions are processed quickly while remaining fully decentralized.

The platform's native token, HYPE, powers governance and incentives, enabling users to participate in decision-making and earn rewards through staking and ecosystem activities.

Hyperliquid is gaining attention in the decentralized trading space for combining some of the best features of centralized exchanges with decentralization. As more traders seek transparent, non-custodial trading, Hyperliquid meets this need by using an on-chain order book and a custom-built blockchain designed for high-speed trading.

This allows users to trade perpetual contracts and spot assets while keeping ownership of their funds. In this article, we will explain how Hyperliquid works, its key features, and how it compares with other decentralized exchanges (DEXs).



Hyperliquid is a decentralized trading platform designed to offer fast, efficient, and transparent crypto trading. Unlike many leading decentralized exchange platforms that rely on automated market makers, Hyperliquid uses an on-chain order book, enabling traders to place limit and market orders and implement advanced trading strategies.

Hyperliquid runs on its own custom blockchain built specifically for trading applications. This blockchain is optimized for high-speed transactions, low latency, and real-time settlement, allowing users to execute trades quickly while keeping their assets secure in their own wallets. Hyperliquid supports both spot and perpetual futures trading, giving users multiple ways to participate in the market.

Hyperliquid was founded by Jeff Yan, a former Wall Street trader and key figure from Chameleon Trading, together with a team of experienced derivatives traders from top financial firms. Their combined expertise in high-frequency trading highlighted major gaps in existing decentralized exchanges, including slow execution and limited tools for serious users.

Using this experience, the Hyperliquid team designed a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain with a decentralized exchange that prioritizes speed, precision, and efficiency. Features such as sub-millisecond order matching, advanced order types, and Hyperliquidity Provider (HLP) vaults reflect a focus on derivatives trading, as seen in major global crypto trading platforms and market-making automation.

The Hyperliquid ecosystem combines a custom Layer-1 blockchain, HyperCore, with an off-chain matching engine, delivering centralized-exchange speed while keeping settlement fully on-chain. User orders go to the current validator leader via HyperBFT, who bundles transactions into blocks, broadcasts them for validator votes, and achieves finality after a few rounds with quorum from two-thirds of staked validators.

This process ensures that trades are confirmed quickly and securely. The system follows a leader-based design inspired by HotStuff and uses optimistic execution, allowing blocks to be processed as quickly as network conditions permit, often in under 0.07 seconds.

HyperCore handles the core state for margin accounts, order matching, and liquidations without relying on external order books. Meanwhile, HyperEVM provides EVM compatibility for general decentralized applications, but all trading operations remain optimized within HyperCore to minimize latency.

After matching, all trades settle transparently on-chain, reducing risks such as front-running or manipulation that can occur in purely off-chain systems. The architecture supports up to 200,000 orders per second, making Hyperliquid suitable for both professional and high-frequency trading strategies.



Hyperliquid has a native token called HYPE, which forms the core of its ecosystem. The HYPE token powers governance, allowing users to participate in decisions that shape the platform's development, and also supports rewards, staking, and other incentives that encourage active participation.

By integrating HYPE into trading, liquidity provision, and platform governance, Hyperliquid ensures that all users have a role in maintaining network security, contributing to liquidity, and benefiting from the platform's growth.

HYPE is the native utility and governance token of the Hyperliquid Layer-1 blockchain. It was launched through a community airdrop in late 2024, rewarding early traders and users. The token has a fixed supply of 1 billion, and a portion of trading fees is used to repurchase and burn HYPE, creating scarcity and supporting its long-term value.

HYPE serves multiple critical functions. It acts as a gas token for HyperEVM transactions and trading fees, and offers staking to secure the HyperBFT consensus. It is also used as a reward for validators and enables governance through on-chain voting on upgrades, listings, and treasury decisions.

Stakers and Hyperliquidity Provider vault users can earn yields often exceeding 20–50% APY, while HYPE also provides access to premium copy-trading vaults and functions as collateral in spot and perpetual markets.

The HYPE token powers multiple functions across the Hyperliquid ecosystem while giving users a voice in governance. It acts as the gas token for HyperCore and HyperEVM transactions, often under $0.01 per trade. HYPE also serves as collateral for spot and perpetual positions, enabling leveraged trading without bridging external assets.

Governance is managed through on-chain voting on Hyperliquid Improvement Proposals, or HIPs, allowing staked token holders to approve updates, new trading pairs, vault strategies, and treasury decisions. Additionally, quadratic voting prevents dominance by large holders, and approved changes, such as HyperBFT or HyperEVM upgrades, are implemented rapidly.



Staking HYPE tokens on Hyperliquid secures the HyperBFT consensus while providing passive income. Users delegate HYPE to active validators from a dedicated account, with a minimum self-delegation of 10,000 HYPE.

Rewards come from the future emissions reserve rather than inflation and accrue every minute during 100k-round epochs, with daily distribution and automatic compounding, allowing stakes to grow without manual claiming. The dynamic reward system adjusts based on total staked HYPE. For example, 400M HYPE staked yields around 2.37% APY, while 142–144M HYPE staked produces 2.27 – 2.29%.

Validators earn block rewards and share proportional returns with delegators, after a 5–10% commission. Stakers also gain trading fee discounts from 5% up to 40% and eligibility for airdrops and vault bonuses. To learn more about how staking works and its benefits, read our detailed guide on what staking is in crypto.

Hyperliquid Exchange offers traders a fast, reliable, and flexible platform for managing their crypto positions. It is designed to handle high-frequency trades without delays, ensuring that every order is executed accurately and transparently. Both beginners and professional traders can use the platform, whether they want to trade casually or implement advanced strategies.

The exchange also includes tools and features that give users more control over timing, pricing, and execution. Below are the three main features of the platform, which are perpetual futures, the spot market, and advanced order types.



Perpetual futures trading allow traders to take long or short positions on digital assets without worrying about expiration dates. This feature provides continuous exposure to the market, letting users manage positions over time according to their strategy. Traders can use leverage to amplify potential returns while keeping risk controls in place. The system is optimized for speed and accuracy, ensuring trades are executed quickly even during high volatility.



Spot trading allows users to buy and sell crypto assets directly at current market prices. It is suitable for beginners who want straightforward transactions as well as experienced traders who prefer immediate settlement. Orders are processed quickly, ensuring reliable execution and minimal price slippage during active market conditions.

Advanced order types give traders more control over how and when trades are executed. Features such as limit orders, TWAP, and iceberg orders help manage large positions without causing sudden price movements. These tools allow users to automate parts of their trading strategy and reduce emotional decision-making.



Vaults on Hyperliquid allow users to pool funds into automated strategies such as copy trading and liquidity provision. The Hyperliquidity Provider vault functions as the platform's main market maker and liquidation engine, accepting USDC deposits without manager fees.

Funds are used to place bids and asks across perpetual markets and handle liquidations, with profits shared proportionally among depositors. With hundreds of millions in total value locked, HLP helps maintain deep liquidity and stable execution. Although withdrawals require a 4-day lockup, yields often reach 20-60% APY during volatile market conditions.

Hyperliquid removes gas fees on all trades through its Layer-1 design and instead applies low maker and taker trading fees. It also runs a tiered fee structure with 0.070% for takers and 0.040% for makers, which is lower than many major decentralized exchanges.



High-volume traders can further reduce costs through HYPE staking tiers, which offer fee discounts of up to 40% or 50%, while HLP depositors earn a share of taker fees.

Revenue distribution supports long-term sustainability by directing funds toward HYPE buybacks and burns, the Assistance Fund for platform protection, and rewards for stakers and liquidity providers. This allows the protocol to grow without external venture capital funding.



Hyperliquid operates on a dual-chain architecture made up of HyperCore and HyperEVM, each designed for specific network functions. HyperCore handles high-speed trading activities such as margin management, liquidations, and order execution, while HyperEVM supports decentralized applications and smart contracts.

To understand the underlying technology powering these chains, you can learn more about what a blockchain is. The network uses the HyperBFT consensus mechanism to achieve block times as low as 0.07 seconds and high transaction throughput.

More than 50 validators secure the network through HYPE staking, enabling fast finality and protecting transaction integrity. Since validators could be malicious or offline, Hyperliquid integrates Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) via its custom HyperBFT consensus algorithm, which secures the entire Layer 1 blockchain against malicious or failed validators.

Hyperliquid achieves high-speed performance by combining a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain with an optimized trading engine. The HyperBFT consensus mechanism enables transactions to reach finality within seconds through a leader-based validation process and rapid block confirmation rounds. Trading operations are handled directly on HyperCore, eliminating external dependencies and reducing network congestion.

While Hyperliquid offers speed and advanced features, it also comes with certain limitations.

Step 1: Connect Wallet: Visit the official Hyperliquid website and connect a supported wallet, such as OKX Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, or log in with an email address. Ensure the wallet is funded with HYPE or USDC for trading.



Step 2: Deposit Funds: Transfer HYPE, USDC, or other supported assets into your Hyperliquid account. Deposits are fully on-chain, enabling immediate trading or staking.

Step 3: Start Trading or Staking: Choose between spot, perpetual futures, or depositing into vaults like HLP. Each option offers different risk and reward profiles.

Step 4: Manage Positions: Monitor trades, staking rewards, or vault performance using the dashboard. Withdrawals are subject to the platform's rules, including the HLP four-day lockup.

The Hyperliquid Crypto Exchange aims to become a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) derivatives platform in 2026. Some significant advancements and milestones include the full integration of HyperCore and HyperEVM, enabling dApps to run at exchange-level speeds while remaining EVM-compatible.

The platform plans to deploy a $1B treasury fund to buy and stake HYPE, aligning protocol reserves with token demand to stabilize the market and counteract volatility. Large-scale buybacks could tighten supply, especially given that 97% of protocol fees have already been allocated to HYPE repurchases.

Looking ahead to 2026–2027, HyperEVM is expected to grow with new projects, including liquid staking via kinetiq xyz and money markets through hyperlendx. Permissionless perpetuals launched under HIP-3 in October 2025 will further decentralize listings, expanding use cases for staking, lending, and derivatives trading.

Unlike traditional DeFi platforms, Hyperliquid combines speed, advanced trading tools, and a unique token ecosystem to create a professional-grade decentralized exchange. Its dual-chain design, HyperBFT consensus, and innovative vault system offer both retail and institutional traders ways to maximize returns while maintaining security.

While some risks exist, including validator downtime and lockup periods, HYPE staking and HLP vaults provide strong incentives for participation. But that's not all. We reviewed the platform and compiled a comprehensive Hyperliquid review to provide insight into its features, security, and architecture.

Yes. Hyperliquid is designed with a validator-based HyperBFT consensus and staked HYPE as economic security, providing strong protection against malicious activity. However, risks exist, such as validator downtime or vault impermanent loss, but these are rare and mitigated by network design.

Hyperliquid runs on HyperCore, a trading-optimized Layer-1, and HyperEVM, an EVM-compatible Layer-1 for decentralized apps. This dual architecture ensures fast, low-latency trading and full on-chain transparency.

Yes. Hyperliquid allows users to trade without KYC.

The platform achieves sub-second trade execution and finality, with block times as low as 0.07 seconds and throughput of over 200,000 transactions per second.

A perpetual exchange lets users trade futures contracts that never expire, offering leverage and the ability to go long or short on assets without settlement deadlines.

Bruce Straley says ""before that, games were just games to me""


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The Last of Us and Uncharted 4 game director Bruce Straley is back with a game that basically sells itself from the word go: Coven of the Chicken Foot has you play as a witchy grandma with chicken feet as she builds a bond with a hulking fantasy creature. And Straley's taking some inspiration from lots of places, from his own post-apocalyptic work and a Studio Ghibli classic to Fumito Ueda.

Speaking to GamesRadar+ about his upcoming ""semi-open-world"" explorative puzzle game, Straley explains that while building the central relationship between our grandma Gertie and our odd, unnamed companion, the team looked at ""the bond between the Red Elk Yakuul and Ahitaka from Princess Mononoke, and of course Ellie and Joel from The Last of Us"" as reference.

The biggest reference point was the hugely influential Japanese game maker Fumito Ueda, however, who directed ICO, Shadow of the Colossus, The Last Guardian, and an upcoming project featuring massive robots - all games that, to varying degrees, are about connecting with a character outside of your control.

""Ueda's games have definitely had an influence on our game,"" Straley explains. ""ICO was the first game to ever make me cry. Before that, games were just games to me. But after playing ICO, my entire philosophy of what kind of experiences the medium had the potential to deliver completely changed. Before hiring Wouter Gort as Art Director, Wouter and I bonded over the idea of capturing some of the relationship building between ICO's horned boy and Yorda, as well as Agro the horse and the adventurer from Shadow of the Colossus.""

While Straley doesn't outright mention it, Coven of the Chicken Foot most reminds me of The Last Guardian, which is also about a sometimes helpless protagonist's push-and-pull relationship with a fantasy beast that's several times stronger and bigger than him. Coven of the Chicken Foot's Steam description even makes reference to ""innovative technology"" that lets our companion learn based on our behaviour while also pushing back based on its own motivations, which sounds a lot like Trico's role in The Last Guardian.

""Ueda has a way of creating atmosphere and has set the bar for creating bonds between the player and the characters in his games that we've been inspired by,"" Straley continued. Ueda's design by subtraction has left its mark on countless games, including The Last of Us, so it's no surprise to see it carried over here.

Uncharted and Last of Us director says Zelda: Wind Waker was the main inspiration for his new game's art style, because the devs wanted the graphics to ""last the test of time""

This move shows growing demand and reinforces why many investors are watching Remittix closely among upcoming crypto projects that promise real use and adoption.

Due to the growth, Ethereum whales pile into RTX at scale, increasing large-holder exposure and adding weight to the narrative. These developments highlight why analysts see Remittix as the fastest-growing crypto in 2025 with real utility and momentum ahead of its platform launch.

Remittix's 600% surge has captured investor interest across the crypto space. This jump reflects intense buying pressure and renewed faith in the project's roadmap. It shows increasing volume and stronger participation from active traders and institutional participants.

Analysts point out that such a move is rare for tokens without clear utility and Remittix stands apart because of its payment-focused mission. The surge coincides with milestones like reaching over 701 million tokens sold at $0.123 each and raising more than $28.8 million toward ecosystem growth.

As Remittix approaches $30 million raised, the project will unlock major exchange reveals and deeper liquidity options. These developments make Remittix relevant beyond short-term price action.

Large holders on the Ethereum network are showing increased interest in Remittix, with wallets accumulating significant amounts of RTX. This trend suggests confidence from experienced market players who often move early on projects with long-term prospects. These flows have also helped boost visibility for Remittix across trading communities.

This increase in whale exposure comes as Remittix advances toward its 9 February 2026 platform launch, which will unlock broader PayFi tools connecting crypto with real-world finance. The ecosystem already includes a live Remittix Wallet on the Apple App Store with strong features and Google Play support is soon to follow.

Also, the project is fully audited and verified by CertiK, ranked #1 on CertiK Skynet, which adds trust for broad investor groups. It has also completed full KYC verification, signalling readiness for compliance and wider integration.

Listing milestones on BitMart and LBANK and a third major exchange coming, increases access and liquidity. With the 15% referral rewards still active, Remittix engages holders and builds network effects before its big platform launch date.

Key features that Ethereum whales highlight include:

Remittix's big value jump and whale participation reflect real interest in a project with a clear purpose. The surge shows that Remittix is becoming a core payments token that connects crypto with everyday financial needs. As a project that bridges technology and value, it stands out in a crowded market.

The project's milestones, whale interest and growing liquidity make it attractive to investors. Remittix offers tangible progress, utility focus and measurable growth, giving confidence to investors looking for tokens with huge upside potential in the crypto market. These strengths make Remittix a token to watch as it continues its expansion and adoption.

China-led cross-border digital currency platform mBridge has processed more than $55 billion in transactions as efforts to build payment rails that operate outside traditional dollar-based systems find momentum.

Project mBridge, a multi-central bank digital currency (CBDC) platform, has now settled over 4,000 cross-border transactions with a cumulative value of roughly $55.5 billion, according to data compiled by the Washington-based Atlantic Council. That figure marks a nearly 2,500-fold increase since the project's early pilot phase in 2022.

The platform is currently being tested by central banks in mainland China, Hong Kong, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. China's digital yuan, or e-CNY, accounts for an estimated 95% of total settlement volume on mBridge.

mBridge's rapid expansion comes as China continues to scale its domestic CBDC infrastructure. Recent figures from the People's Bank of China show the e-CNY has processed more than 3.4 billion transactions worth around 16.7 trillion yuan ($2.4 trillion), representing an increase of over 800% compared with 2023.

China to allow banks to pay interest on digital yuan

As Cointelegraph reported, China's central bank is introducing a new framework for the digital yuan that will allow commercial banks to pay interest on e-CNY wallet balances. The move is aimed at pushing the digital yuan beyond its initial role as a cash-like payment tool.

According to People's Bank of China, the framework will enable banks to integrate the digital yuan into their asset and liability management. PBOC Deputy Governor Lu Lei said the e-CNY will transition into a “digital deposit currency,” expanding its role to include value storage and cross-border payments alongside everyday transactions.

“Taken together, these developments point to a gradual expansion of the yuan's internationalization through digital infrastructure,” Atlantic Council analyst Alisha Chhangani told Reuters. Rather than directly challenging the US dollar's dominance, she added, China and its partners are building parallel settlement rails that reduce dependence on existing dollar-centric systems.

BIS exits project mBridge amid sanctions evasion concerns

In 2024, the Bank for International Settlements stepped back from mBridge, the project it helped develop through its Innovation Hub since 2021, describing the move as a “graduation” rather than a withdrawal. 

At the time, BIS General Manager Agustín Carstens sought to distance the BIS from speculation that mBridge could be used by BRICS nations to bypass international sanctions, claiming that “mBridge is not the BRICS bridge.” He said that BIS systems cannot be used by sanctioned countries, even as overlap between mBridge participants and BRICS members fueled debate over the project's geopolitical implications.

Since then, the BIS has shifted its focus to Project Agorá, a separate effort involving several major Western central banks that recently announced expanded testing.

 Date 

mBridge, a China-backed initiative focused on cross-border digital currency transactions, has processed more than $55 billion across over 4,000 transactions since its inception. This marks a significant milestone in efforts to establish borderless payment systems outside traditional dollar-dominated frameworks. The platform's rapid growth highlights the increasing role of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in international finance, supported by several countries integrating the technology into their banking infrastructure.

The project, which is a collaborative effort among central banks in mainland China, Hong Kong, Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, has demonstrated notable progress. China's digital yuan, or e-CNY, accounts for approximately 95% of the total settlement volume on mBridge. This burgeoning usage is part of China's broader push to develop its CBDC infrastructure, with recent data from the People's Bank of China revealing that the e-CNY facilitated over 3.4 billion transactions totaling roughly 16.7 trillion yuan ($2.4 trillion), an increase of over 800% compared to 2023.

Further developments include China's move to allow commercial banks to pay interest on digital yuan wallets. This initiative aims to elevate the e-CNY from a simple digital cash tool to an asset capable of store of value and cross-border payments. Deputy Governor Lu Lei of the People's Bank of China stated that the digital yuan is transitioning into a“digital deposit currency,” expanding its role within the financial ecosystem.

Analysts view these advancements as part of China's strategy to gradually internationalize the yuan through digital infrastructure, reducing reliance on the US dollar without directly challenging its dominance. Instead, Beijing focuses on establishing parallel settlement channels that complement existing global payment systems.

In early 2024, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) announced its departure from mBridge, the cross-border CBDC platform it helped develop through its Innovation Hub. The BIS characterized the exit as a“graduation,” emphasizing that the organization remains committed to innovative financial initiatives. BIS General Manager Agustín Carstens clarified that the platform is not intended to serve as a bypass mechanism for international sanctions, despite ongoing speculation about its geopolitical implications.

Following its withdrawal, the BIS has redirected efforts toward Project Agorá, a new initiative involving several prominent Western central banks, which has recently expanded its testing parameters. This strategic shift signals ongoing evolution in the landscape of central bank digital currencies and international monetary cooperation.

Hedge fund manager Michael Burry, who rose to worldwide fame by correctly predicting the 2008 global financial crisis, has publicly praised a charitable use case for Bitcoin.

On social media, Burry, who posts under the handle Cassandra Unchained, endorsed cryptic donations to Little Wishes, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to granting wishes for chronically and critically ill hospitalized children. 

“Bitcoin for Little Wishes is a good use of $BTC,” Burry said in an X post. 

Little Wishes, which was founded in 2003, has a long track record of granting over 36,000 wishes across 46 hospitals in the United States.

The organization facilitates both immediate and ongoing wishes that include small personal items to experiences that bring comfort and joy to children facing serious medical challenges. 

The nonprofit confirmed that supporters could contribute Bitcoin directly through a dedicated platform on Every.org in response to questions about cryptocurrency donations. 

Burry's views on Bitcoin

Bitcoin is often criticized for its volatility and use in speculative investment, but this shows that the cryptocurrency is also used for philanthropy. Accepting Bitcoin can open up new donor demographics, including younger or tech-savvy contributors who might prefer using digital currency over traditional payment methods.

Burry, who rose to prominence after predicting the subprime mortgage crisis, is known as a longtime critic of the leading cryptocurrency. Most recently, in a December 2025 podcast with author Michael Lewis, Burry offered some of his bluntest public comments on Bitcoin.

He opined that Bitcoin going to $100,000 was ""the most ridiculous thing."" adding that it is ""not worth anything."" 

The “Big Short” hero even invoked the infamous 17th‑century Dutch tulip bubble. 

Earlier, he warned that leverage was the main problem with crypto. 

However, the post shows that he might be warming up to the leading cryptocurrency based on his recent social media post.

Oops, something went wrong

XRP is a more efficient payment method than Bitcoin, offering fast transactions and sub-$0.01 fees.

It's designed as a cross-border payments solution for financial institutions, but it hasn't been widely adopted.

While Bitcoin is the more proven investment, XRP also has potential if it can increase usage with issuer Ripple's banking partners.

10 stocks we like better than XRP ›

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is the largest cryptocurrency by a wide margin, worth nearly $2 trillion (as of Jan. 14). Because of its value and the immense cost of buying just 1 BTC, many crypto investors prefer to look for altcoins -- a term for all the cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.

A popular choice is XRP (CRYPTO: XRP), which has a market cap of $127 billion. That theoretically gives it more growth potential, and over the last five years, XRP has increased by 666% compared to Bitcoin's returns of 169%.

If you're wondering whether you should invest in XRP instead of Bitcoin for your crypto portfolio, here's what you need to know.

Bitcoin and XRP are both decentralized digital currencies that use blockchain technology to record transactions. Bitcoin was the first, and its anonymous founder launched it in 2009 as a digital currency for online payments, with no reliance on a central banking system.

XRP has a much different origin story. Ripple, a private company, launched XRP in 2012. Where Bitcoin's purpose was to eliminate the need for financial institutions, Ripple designed XRP to work with financial institutions, making cross-border payments faster and cheaper.

Of the two, XRP works much better as a payment method. Transactions typically process in three to five seconds and cost well under $0.01. Bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, normally take about 10 minutes, and the current average fee is just over $0.80.

However, hardly anybody uses Bitcoin as a payment method anymore. It's an investment, often referred to as a form of digital gold. A fairly low maximum supply of 21 million BTC helps with that by providing built-in scarcity. XRP exists in more of a middle ground between investment and payment method.

The value of XRP is tied to its issuer. Ripple offers a blockchain-based global payments network, Ripple Payments, which banks can utilize for fast and affordable international transactions. Ripple Payments includes an On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) feature that incorporates XRP.

Banks have traditionally maintained pre-funded accounts with foreign currencies. If a bank uses ODL with Ripple Payments, it can instead convert its local currency to XRP to transfer funds. The recipient can then convert XRP into its own currency.

As financial institutions adopt XRP for ODL, demand will likely grow, and the price should increase. There are a few hurdles this cryptocurrency has to overcome, though.

While Ripple has partnered with over 300 financial institutions, many of them only use Ripple Payments without ODL. In the second quarter of 2025, $1.3 billion in transactions were processed through ODL, according to Digital Asset Solutions. Such small payment volume won't drive much growth for XRP.

Ripple also launched a stablecoin, Ripple USD (CRYPTO: RLUSD), in December 2024. Stablecoins aim to maintain the same value as another asset -- in Ripple USD's case, the U.S. dollar. This could potentially reduce demand for XRP if banks prefer a stable asset for ODL instead of XRP, which is highly volatile.

XRP has had several growth catalysts since late 2024. It surged after the election of Donald Trump as president, and issuer Ripple's five-year lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) came to an end in August 2025. The SEC would go on to approve the first spot XRP ETFs in November 2025. But for XRP to take the next step, usage by financial institutions will need to increase.

I wouldn't recommend forgetting about Bitcoin and buying any other cryptocurrency instead, XRP included. Bitcoin accounts for nearly 60% of the value in the entire crypto market, and although it isn't always the top performer, it has consistently set new all-time highs in every bull market. XRP still hasn't topped its all-time high from 2018. If you invest in cryptocurrency, it makes sense to have Bitcoin in your portfolio.

That said, you may want to hold altcoins, too, in which case XRP is worth considering. It has a potentially lucrative use case as a digital currency for financial institutions. With XRP's speed and low costs, plus Ripple's payments network, it could be a long-term winner.

Moving value across blockchains is now largely mediated by a small group of centralized intermediaries despite crypto's long-standing claims of decentralization.

Michael Steuer, president and chief technology officer of Casper Network, framed this dynamic as a structural outcome of the industry's approach to interoperability and user experience.

With a background spanning mobile gaming, enterprise software and early blockchain development, Steuer approaches the industry's interoperability problem as a question of how real users interact with technology.

“For some reason, in crypto, it's perfectly acceptable to ask users to care about things they would never think about in the real world,” he told Cointelegraph.

Moving value across chains requires investors to understand how bridges work or rely on centralized players that reintroduce risks crypto set out to eliminate, Steuer said. As a result, interoperability has been pushed into the hands of a small number of intermediaries.

Crypto's ideological UX failure

For most users, interacting with crypto still requires an understanding of infrastructure that would be invisible in almost any other consumer technology.

Moving value often means choosing a network, confirming wallet compatibility, checking bridge support and accounting for fees and delays along the way.

Steuer said this expectation became normalized as the industry grew around early adopters who were willing to tolerate friction.

“We have to think beyond the early adopter and what's acceptable to them to what's acceptable to your mom, your dad and your neighbor,” Steuer said. “If this is supposed to be mass-market technology, we can't expect everyone to think the way crypto natives do.”

Related: US crypto market structure bill in limbo as industry pulls support

In traditional payment systems, users make a simple choice, such as paying with cash or a card, while routing and settlement are handled in the background. A shopper does not decide how a transaction moves between banks or networks, and most errors can be reversed.

The stakes are higher in crypto. Major exchanges warn that assets sent over the wrong network — for example, sending tokens on Solana instead of Ethereum — may become permanently lost.

When assets need to move between blockchains, bridges often become the default path. Those bridges have evolved into critical infrastructure for interoperability, placing a small number of intermediaries at the center of how value moves across blockchains.

Bridges are also among the most fragile parts of the crypto stack, as they hold large pools of locked assets. Cross-chain bridges have been repeatedly targeted by hackers, accounting for some of the largest losses in crypto history. Chain hopping via bridges has also become a rising money laundering method by threat actors.

Centralized gatekeepers control interoperability

Bridges function as the user-facing interoperability layer, while at the infrastructure level, messaging and verification systems mediate cross-chain communication. Some mechanism must still determine whether a cross-chain transfer or message is valid and sufficiently finalized before it can be acted upon on the destination network.

These systems typically do not custody assets themselves, but they authorize which cross-chain messages are recognized by destination contracts and eligible for execution.

“Interoperability today is effectively centrally controlled by a handful of players like Chainlink, LayerZero and Axelar,” Steuer said. “They build and deploy their own cross-chain interfaces, decide which protocols are enabled and, ultimately, gatekeep who has access and who doesn't.”

Related: How AI crypto trading will make and break human roles

Steuer said the issue is not that these systems exist, but that they have become unavoidable. When a small number of providers control how blockchains communicate, interoperability begins to resemble the same centralized chokepoints crypto was designed to avoid.

He argued that this concentration limits who can participate, making cross-chain activity dependent on infrastructure that operates outside the control of the underlying networks themselves.

At the same time, the concentration is partly a product of technical reality. Blockchains operate under different security assumptions, consensus models and execution environments, making native interoperability difficult to implement.

Messaging and verification layers emerged to solve that coordination problem, providing a shared mechanism for validating cross-chain events in the absence of common standards.

Crypto fragmentation and centralized interoperability fuel tribalism

The consequences of fragmented interoperability extend beyond infrastructure and into culture.

When users are forced to care about which network they are on, which wallet they use and which tools support their assets, loyalty to specific chains hardens into identity.

“You see this with the XRP army, the Bitcoin maximalists, the Ethereum crowd,” Steuer said. “That kind of tribalism doesn't happen because users want it. It happens because the systems force people to choose sides.”

Networks compete as closed ecosystems rather than as interchangeable components of a broader system.

Steuer said that this tribalism is the result of users committing to specific networks in order to participate at all. Once assets, applications and communities are locked into particular chains, interoperability becomes a competitive weapon.

That dynamic makes it harder to design infrastructure that works universally, he said. Protocols are incentivized to protect their own ecosystems rather than reduce friction across them, even when doing so would benefit users.

Until blockchains can interact without exposing users to networks, wallets and bridges, Steuer said the industry will continue to reproduce the same fragmentation it set out to eliminate. Today, decentralization exists at the protocol level, but coordination, usability and power concentrate elsewhere, simultaneously reinforcing centralized infrastructure and tribal divisions.

Crypto startups raised $588 million in the first two weeks of January 2026, according to data from DefiLlama. The funding marks a strong start to the year for digital asset companies.

🚨 ARTHUR HAYES DOUBLES DOWN ON CRYPTO STARTUPS

— Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) January 17, 2026



Arthur Hayes' Maelstrom Fund, Revolut's Vlad Yatsenko, and Citadel Securities participated in the funding rounds. Venture capital firms including Lightspeed, Paradigm, and YZi Labs also invested in various projects.

The money flowed primarily into payments, trading platforms, and centralized exchanges. Investors focused on companies building infrastructure for institutional clients.

Privacy technology emerged as a key investment theme. Tim Sun, senior researcher at HashKey Group, said privacy is required for traditional institutions to use blockchain technology at scale.

Investors backed companies working on zero-knowledge proofs, fully homomorphic encryption, and multi-party computation. Privacy-preserving payment systems also received funding.

These technologies allow institutions to conduct transactions without exposing trade details publicly. This prevents front-running and protects sensitive financial information.

Rain topped the funding chart with a $250 million Series C round. The stablecoin payment company reached a valuation of nearly $2 billion.

Rain provides infrastructure for businesses to issue payment cards accepted anywhere Visa operates. The company processes over $3 billion in annual transaction volume.

Western Union counts among Rain's major partners. The fresh capital will fund international expansion across five continents.

Alpaca raised $150 million in a Series D round at a $1.2 billion valuation. The trading infrastructure firm operates through an API-first model.

The company provides trading, data, and custody services for millions of accounts in 40 countries. Kraken uses Alpaca's infrastructure.

Alpaca launched several products in 2025 including 24/5 trading and fixed income options. The company also introduced its Instant Tokenization Network and securities lending features.

Indonesian exchange ICEx secured $70 million to expand spot trading services. The platform serves both retail and institutional clients in Southeast Asia.

ICEx operates as a regulated exchange with compliant fiat on-ramps. The exchange competes with international platforms like Coinbase in regional markets.

The funding demonstrates investor preference for established infrastructure over speculative projects. Regional exchanges and stablecoin payment systems led the investment activity.

Let's swing for the fences with this one, shall we?

Some questions are timeless because they're so fundamental that everyone ponders them at some point in life (often—for me at least—in the shower). Others are timeless because, regardless of how many times they're asked, no definitive answer may exist.

This one seems to fall in both categories. Consciousness—the awareness of yourself, your mind and body and its surroundings—is intrinsic to what may be called “the human experience.” And yet despite being something we all viscerally know, it's also one of the hardest things to pin down and study in any objective, empirical manner.

Leaving aside whether or not insights from something like string theory (or any other area of knowledge) can offer real advances in this domain by better explaining basic neurophysiology, the deeper quandary is whether the question itself is tractable. Asking whether we'll ever understand the nature of consciousness may well be in the same quasi-nonsensical realm as wondering what's north of up, or what occurred before the beginning of time.

Perhaps, if an answer ever comes, it will arise less through studying and more through making; already there's no shortage of speculation about glimmers of consciousness in various instantiations of artificial intelligence. Then again, the query itself may miss the mark here, too: what we consider “consciousness” may be more an anthropomorphic quirk of our evolutionary biology than some reflection of deeper, universal truths.

We're unlikely to find certitude here, of course. But it's still fun to talk about. What do you think?

To Stuart GW

Keeping in mind that the definition of consciousness is the ability to choose voluntarily, your example of calling to mind certain thoughts/memories with your eyes closed and presuming no other sensory input is consistent with consciousness because you are still choosing voluntarily what you are recalling from memory, and that ability to choose is what defines consciousness.

Returning to the original question of whether we will ever understand consciousness, if we accept that it boils down to awareness of our surroundings and decision making based on a range of internal factors, then I think the answer is yes.  

If it's more than that, then in what way is it more than that?  Is our perception of the colour red really anything other than a convenient representation of a frequency of electromagnetic radiation?  I'm not convinced that mine is.

@boxweed and @Claude COULOMBE

Another, more common, example of conscious action which does not involve comparing incoming sensory information with memories.  When I sit with closed eyes and consider, for example, how I will spend my day, that rumination is not using incoming sensory information.  It is simply accessing existing memories, preferences, constraints etc. in order to make decisions.  Yes those mental constructs were derived, to some degree at least from sensory information, but it's not incoming at the time of the conscious experience.

To Claude Coulomb: Re Wiedemeyer's definition of consciousness as a voluntary decision. It seems to me that it's impossible to distingish between a voluntary and an involuntary decision. Any decision is driven by preferences. To decide is to prefer one of two or more options (to do nothing is always an option). All we have is the decision, and it tells us which option was preferred. Whether the preference was detremined or not, the outcome is exactly the same.

a) If we label ""consciousnesses"" as an ""emergent property"", why not label ""digestiveness"" as an ""emergent property""? Seems to me that the most important single fact of consciousnesses is that it exist only while it's happening.  To me, ""consciousness"" looks like something the brain does, just as digestion is something the gastric system does. That implies that ""consciousness"" is a behaviour. If so, thinking of consciousness as a property (emergent or otherwise)  seems to me a mistake. But maybe I'm misunderstanding what ""emergent property"" means.

b) I don't understand the math, but the claim that string theory provides a more accurate model of neural and other physical networks reminds me of fractals. It suggests that the structure of physical networks is the same at all scales. Would that apply also to the structure of networks in time? I'm thinking of the flow of plasma from the Sun. Or of the networks of electromagnetic fields that AIUI roil the surface of the Sun. Or of the ""network"" of gravity that controls the movements of everything that has mass. Would it make sens to think of quantum fields as networks? Or of interactions at the quantum level as networks?

Thanks for this article. ""Gives me to think."" :-)

The nature of consciousness is indeed one of the most profound and puzzling questions in human thought. It's fascinating how something we experience every moment—our awareness of ourselves and our surroundings—remains so difficult to fully define or study scientifically. While neuroscience and philosophy continue to explore the mechanisms behind consciousness, it may always retain an element of mystery, reminding us of the limits of human understanding and the wonder of the mind.

By the way, if you're looking to explore something timeless and spiritually enriching, https://suraheyaseen.com/ provides the complete Arabic text of this blessed Surah, allowing readers to recite and reflect on its profound guidance, connecting deeply with the divine message in a clear and authentic way.

Response to Claude COULOMBE:

1)  Yes, that's correct that a voluntary decision requires one to be conscious, and that the definition of consciousness is the ability to make a voluntary decision.

2)  Yes, reflexes can change due to frequency of stimuli, resulting in diminution or hyperactivity; however, these changes have nothing to do with consciousness as there is no choosing involved in how one responds reflexively.

3)  In locked-in syndrome, even though the person is completely paralyzed, he can still receive sensory input and choose how to react to it.  The fact that he can't move to carry out his intended response to that sensory stimulation has nothing to do with his being conscious.  Consciousness is determined by the individual, not an observer.  When the person with locked-in syndrome is conscious, he is able to choose how to react to sensory input, he just isn't able to physically carry out his response due to his paralysis.  The fact that he's paralyzed has nothing to do with his consciousness.

In lucid dreaming, by definition, the person is conscious because he is able to choose a response to sensory input.  He is in a reduced level of consciousness, but conscious just the same.

While this discussion is really unfolding with all possibilities and perceptions of individuals keeping Science as the philosophical basis, the cue from Metaphysical realisation of the Being is like Collapse of a Wave Function in Quantum Mechanics. Once one realises it, the World/Universe/ Cosmos collapses onto this Being..nothing else exists, not even the Being..!!

Response to @boxweed (and my final words, so as not to monopolize the discussion):

1. Circular argument

When I mentioned a ""circular argument,"" I was not referring to the biological feedback loop (data loop) of accumulating memory. I was referring to a logical tautology. Wiedemeyer defines a ""voluntary decision"" as a process that requires consciousness to function, yet he simultaneously uses ""voluntary decision"" to define what consciousness is. 

2. The blur between reflex and memory 

You claim that reflexes are ""purely genetic"" and devoid of memory. Reflexes are not static scripts. If you stimulate a reflex repeatedly, the synaptic response diminishes (habituation). The neurons have ""remembered"" the previous inputs and altered their efficiency accordingly. This is a form of non-associative learning stored in the circuit. The distinction between ""hardwired"" and ""learned"" is not a binary wall.

3. ""Responsiveness"" definition is too narrow

The strict definition that ""consciousness can only occur when a person is able to choose a response to an external sensory stimulus"" is demonstrably false based on 2 medical phenomenas:

Locked-in Syndrome: These patients are fully awake and conscious, yet they are completely paralyzed and cannot ""choose a response"" to external stimuli in the way you describe. Under your definition, these fully conscious human beings would be classified as unconscious.

Lucid Dreaming: A lucid dreamer is fully aware and makes decisions, yet they are disconnected from external sensory input. They are conscious without external stimuli.

Therefore, consciousness cannot be defined solely by the output (external response) but must also be defined by the internal state.

It's a shame that you probably don't live near Montréal. We could debate this for hours over coffee or a good vegetarian meal.

Response to Claude COULOMBE's three points below:

1)  Yes, incoming sensory information is compared to stored memory, but remember that that stored memory is also the result of incoming sensory information.  All of stored memory used for evaluating sensory information arises from sensory input, which starts being stored at the time of our birth.  None of this would be considered a closed loop.  You simply keep adding to memory as you receive more sensory information throughout your life, and when you're conscious, you're able to draw upon this stored memory to choose a response to further sensory input.  

2)  Reflexes are genetic and present at birth.  They have nothing to do with memory.  Memory is defined as changes to the structure of neurons in the brain secondary to sensory input via our five senses.  

3)  Yes, you are correct in that the brain can generate predictions and thoughts without external sensory input.  For instance, when a person is asleep and dreaming he is generating thoughts within his brain without sensory input.  However, this internal generation of thoughts is not consistent with consciousness, as people are not conscious when they're sleeping and consequently, are not able to choose a response to external sensory input.  As stated previously, consciousness can only occur when a person is able to choose a response to an external sensory stimulus.

@boxweed I see... 

1) So, Wiedemeyer argue that a 'voluntary decision' is the act of comparing input against memory, but he is simultaneously claim that a subject 'must be conscious' to perform this comparison. This creates an arguments closed loop. 

2) Defining 'voluntary' as 'comparing input against memorized information is a bit short because it's simple mechanics. Even a reflex arc contains a form of 'memory', the biological thresholds (synaptic weights) that determine whether a neuron fires. If a reflex signal is 'compared' against a neuronal threshold to determine an outcome, this definition would force us to classify reflexes as voluntary decisions. This mechanism of comparison exists in the simplest of neuron's circuits. It's not proof of consciousness. 

3) Robert Wiedemeyer model neglects endogenous or inner model treats the brain as a purely reactive device (Input => Process => Output). This ignores the vast amount of 'inner signals', activity generated by the cortex and other brain structures independent of current sensory impulses. The brain is not just reacting to the five senses; it is constantly generating predictions, thoughts, and simulations (top-down processing). A definition of voluntary decision / consciousness must account for these non-sensory, internally generated initiations of action.

Anyway, your answer is stimulating, thanks a lot!

Thanks @Claude COULOMBE for your comments!

In response to Claude COULOMBE's comment referring to the problem of defining voluntary decisions in my previous note, all the information contained in our brains is the result of sensory impulses that travel to our brains from one or more of our five senses.  Once the information reaches the brain, it's compared and contrasted with other stored information in our memory system.  Then, a response is initiated by the brain that it deems the best course of action for that particular stimulus.  Voluntary decisions are defined as this comparing and contrasting of information to choose an appropriate response.  Reflex reactions, for example, are not voluntary decisions, and can occur whether a person is conscious or unconscious.  When a sensory stimulus causes a reflex response, there is no comparing or contrasting this incoming sensory information.  A reaction to that sensory stimulus is a simple cause and effect process.  In order to compare and contrast incoming sensory information, then choose a response, a person has to be conscious; hence, the definition of consciousness.

I forgot to mention the article I meant: https://www.quantamagazine.org/string-theory-can-now-describe-a-universe-that-has-dark-energy-20260114/.

... Another string theory article—but with a different frame of reference ...

Wow! It's so refreshing to read the reader comments on Scientific American. It's a welcome change from the heated debates on X (I'm no more member) or even sometimes on Reddit. 

Thank you to Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn  for the « Landscape of Consciousness » website and  @Doug Baldwin and Copilot for the taxonomy of consciousness theories which, even if not correct, can at least provide a nice basis for discussion. 

I agree with many commentators (@Peter Lugten, @Stuart GW, @Don, @Tom C, @Dr. Matt, @Mitchell Timin)  about the difficult problem of defining consciousness and the practicality of using it.  First the consciousness definition is challenging but we need to get one or many for different use cases. 

Establishing an efficient and reliable protocol to determine whether a biological beings or an AI system is ""truly conscious"" is a challenging problem, perhaps even an ill-posed or intractable one without any satisfactory solution.

I like the simple definition reported by @boxweed of Robert Wiedemeyer, MD which is «  voluntarily choosing how to react to perceptive impulses » but all the problem is now to define « voluntarily decision ». 

I agree with many commentators about the fact that consciousness is not only a human phenomenon but rather a biological one (@Don, @David Hillstrom, @SL, @Bob Coppock). That said, I respectfully distrust the idea that consciousness emerges from all complex system, and even more so the idea that consciousness is a universal fluid or energy.

Finally,  thanks @Peter Lugten, I have to think more about the « The Entropic Theory of the Emergence of Consciousness »...

Thanks all folks for your comments and shared ideas.

We will never be able to understand how consciousness emerges from neurons as a matter of principle. We are blocked from such an understanding by entropy. Being conscious lowers an organisms overall entropy, making it more organized, better able to survive and sexually reproduce than would be an identical organism that was not conscious. Lowered entropy does not come for free, and there is an entropy debt to be repaid immediately and simultaneously with the emergence of consciousness. This is achieved by a Landauer's principle-like mechanism. Computation requires temporary storage of information, upon which the mind or calculator acts to perform the calculation. It cannot be stored indefinitely, and must be erased in order to proceed to the next computation. Rolf Landauer in 1961 proposed that any logically irreversible computation, i.e., erasing a bit of information, requires work, expels heat and increased entropy.  The Entropic Theory of the Emergence of Consciousness (see Landscape of Consciousness website: Entropy theories) explains that the steps, or computations involved in the emergence of consciousness must be deleted simultaneously with their being performed. The steps are executed, in both senses of the word! This is work, which explains why we have to switch it off after about 18 hours, and sleep. It releases heat, which it might eventually be possible to measure. And it explains why we'll never be able to understand how consciousness arises.

This theory has important implications for consciousness in AI. It restricts consciousness to living organisms that evolve a physical mechanism to repay their entropy debt, which I'm assuming takes place, as per the theory of Penrose and Hameroff, in the Tryptophan molecules of neural microtubules.  In order for the mechanism to evolve, the organism must benefit from being conscious, so that its offspring evolve, first, ever more efficient microtubules, and then, more efficient arrangements of neurons. If an AI computed its way to consciousness, it would delete the computation immediately, and not remember how it got there, and not be able to evolve a more effective mechanism able to execute the computation repeatedly. On the other hand, building computers out of neural organoids is extremely dangerous, and should be very tightly controlled if not prohibited.

Reference: How Entropy Explains the Emergence of consciousness: the Entropic theory. Peter Lugten, 2024. J. Neurobev. Sci. Doi: 10.4103/jnbs.jnbs_6_24 

I am aware of X and I am aware of myself being aware of X. However, there is an infinitesimal displacement between X and X'. That differance (Derrida) constitutes a dimensionless string whose vibrations manifest as consciousness.

That's a wonderful suggestion to fathom the unfathomable...I mean, in physical or experimental sense. A topic that has eluded Science, since time immemorial but is a realization of the Mystics: that's outside this World/ Universe/Cosmos.

I am all ears, for how this discussion unfolds where we wonder the origin of the Subjective Experience of Being..!

Firstly I agree with Tom C that we need an agreed definition of what we're trying to explain.  But even if we agree on a definition, I have my doubts about achieving a testable theory.  Given the subjective nature of the phenomenon it's difficult to see how it could be reliably tested.  

If we do something to your brain and it makes you less (or more) conscious or alters you consciousness in some other way, how is that qualitatively different from the fact that your brain is functioning differently, except in the way you perceive it.  

It's no good asking an AI if it's conscious, or a dolphin or even another human because you can't rely on the answer.  I'm not even sure that I am conscious, again depending on the definition.  I'm inclined to agree with Dennet (if I understand him) that it's all a bit of an illusion.  A subjective interpretation of perceptions and the mistaken belief that we have free will.  And I don't think Christof Koch's recent exposure to the cosmic consciousness proves anything beyond the impact of altered brain chemistry on our perceptions.

Maybe the idealists are right, but I can't imagine how it could be tested.

Consciousness exists in all animals..The level of consciousness is dependent on the level of complexity of the brain. While our level of consciousness seems to be the highest at present, I'm sure it is still far from the high test level that can be obtained.

Physically, the complexity of the brain and its “wiring” are factors. Brain injury has demonstrated that consciousness is not separate from the brain. Change the brain, consciousness is changed. 

Now we are more aware of the brain - body connection. The brain does not operate independently. The body has input to the brain. Bacteria, living in out body, have input to the brain. Both influence decisions. Our understanding of the concept of free will has changed accordingly and how free will impacts our concept of consciousness.

It seems that every new discovery just brings new questions. 

I guess I am a little  embarrassed to admit this, but a few years back I learned from Scientific American that while matter can die, energy does not.  This inspired my imagination to envision a vibrant universe that is connected and connecting.  I am a firm believer that consciousness is pure energy and that pure energy can occupy mass, but not confined to mass.   If we look at consciousness in biological terms, we have only surface and not truth.  Exploring consciousness outside of physical terms is extremely exciting, if science can allow it.  

Understanding where consciousness comes from is even more important now so we can tell if AI becomes conscious. 

The other fundamental question is what is Time?

Consciousness is an emergent property not of any complex system, as some believe, but rather probably a property emerging from the interaction between a slowly evolving complex biological system and its environment. We will probably never be able to explain the behavior of a human or any intelligent agent by looking solely at its brain. We must consider the triad of brain, body, and environment.

This reminds me of Roger Penrose's (2020 Nobel Prize in Physics) favorite dramatic word: « collapse ». First, the collapse of mathematical formalism, referring to Gödel's theorem to explain the ""uncomputability"" of consciousness and second the collapse of the wave function again to explain consciousness.

Speaking of ""collapse"" in the case of Gödel's theorem is a shortcut that conflates the failure of a specific ambition (the program of the mathematician David Hilbert) with the validity of the formal method itself. Gödel did not destroy the formalism. Rather, he revealed its limitations. Penrose bases his argument on the fact that humans can ""understand"" Gödel's theorem, but understanding does not mean that humans are capable of solving or measuring problems that are incomputable or undecidable.

Roger Penrose suggested that mysterious protein structures called ""microtubules"" played a role in human consciousness by exploiting quantum effects, including the dreaded wave function collapse. However, it seems obvious that the brain is too hot to sustain macroscopic quantum states. Just ask anyone working on quantum computers.

As Carl Sagan said, ""An extraordinary claim requires extraordinarily strong evidence.""

There are as many theories about consciousness as there are neuroscientists, philosophers, psychiatric, physicists, etc. and non-conventional experts. The question of whether we will ever understand the nature of consciousness must follow after first developing a unified and accepted definition of consciousness. We need to agree about what we are trying to solve. Granted we can approach this from a number of competing theories concurrently but at some juncture they need to coalesce. That requirement aside, I question whether the entire field is rich and mature enough at its present stage to answer this question unequivocally; it is doubtful. Solving this question will require a coordinated effort of those who assert that consciousness resides and springs from the brain along with those who assert that consciousness resides external to the body and is an emergent and integral property of the universe, along with those who assert theories that appear on the surface to be invalid. The best course of action is to continue the research, continue the discussions and try to tease out common elements that may start to illuminate the path, keeping in mind that some common elements may be misdirected. No heavy treatment of the topic for this first post, just some basic introduction. I look forward to our continued discussions. Who knows, we may be the forum that advances this toward the solution.

At a glance, the 400 acres of soybeans on the Preston family's dairy farm in southern Michigan appear no different from any other field in the region. But this crop is far from ordinary. The soybeans are part of a research-driven collaboration with Michigan State University that is saving the farm tens of thousands of dollars each month on livestock feed. The results point to a shift that could have lasting effects across the dairy industry.

According to federally funded research from MSU's College of Agriculture and Natural Resources, this soybean variety has the potential to improve milk quality when included in dairy cow diets. In the spring of 2024, the fourth-generation team at Preston Farms decided to commit nearly 400 acres, close to one third of their 1,500-acre operation, to growing the crop.

Brian Preston, an MSU graduate who oversees daily operations and manages nearly 1,000 cows, understood the risk involved. ""Those 400 acres could have been our corn and our grain for the year,"" he says.

Fast results after harvest

Once the soybeans were harvested, the family began incorporating them into the cows' feed. The impact was noticeable almost immediately. Within three days, milk fat and protein levels increased, significantly raising the milk's overall value.

""There was a lot of relief,"" Preston says, ""that it was all coming together and that it paid off."" That relief quickly gave way to confidence and excitement.

""The first thing we noticed when we started feeding the soybeans,"" Preston says, ""was that our purchased feed costs dropped by 20% per month, and that was huge. That's a once-in-a-generation change.""

Years of dairy nutrition research behind the breakthrough

While the results appeared rapid, the science behind them developed over many years. Adam Lock, a professor in MSU's Department of Animal Science and interim chair of the Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, leads a research group that has studied dietary fats and their influence on dairy cows for more than a decade.

One area of focus has been high-oleic soybeans, which are rich in oleic acid, a naturally occurring fatty acid found in animal and plant-based fats and oils. Researchers believed that adding these soybeans to dairy diets could increase milk fat and protein output while also improving farm profitability.

""Our work builds on over a decade of research in our lab exploring how dietary fats influence milk composition, cow health and farm economics,"" Lock says. ""High-oleic soybeans are a natural extension of our focus on practical, science-based feeding strategies.""

The research is supported by funding from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture, as well as the Michigan Alliance for Animal Agriculture, the Michigan Milk Producers Association and the United Soybean Board. ""Public funding drives innovation, industry partnerships and real-world impact for our state's agricultural sector,"" Lock says.

Roasting soybeans and cutting supplement costs

Data gathered by Lock's team confirmed the original hypothesis. Additional studies showed that roasting the soybeans before feeding them to cows could further enhance milk production benefits.

Many dairy farms rely on expensive supplements, including added fats and amino acids, to fine-tune cow nutrition. Preston says high-oleic soybeans, especially when roasted on-site, can replace much of that purchased feed. As one of the early adopters, Preston Farms is no longer alone in its interest. Lock notes that seed suppliers across Michigan ran out of high-oleic soybean seed last year due to strong demand.

The benefits extend beyond a single farm. Public investment in dairy research helps strengthen trust within the agricultural community, supports Michigan's farm economy and ensures that scientific findings lead to real-world improvements.

""Seeing our research in action at farms like Preston Farms is incredibly fulfilling,"" Lock says. ""It's a reminder that the work we do at MSU doesn't just live in journals, it lives in feed bunks, milk tanks and the day-to-day decisions of Michigan farmers. That kind of impact is what drives us.""

At a time when many universities are scaling back dairy research, MSU's new Dairy Cattle Teaching and Research Center is expected to support continued producer-focused work like Lock's.

A long-standing partnership and statewide benefits

The partnership between the Prestons and MSU stretches back generations, much like the farm itself. Several family members have attended MSU, beginning in the 1940s when Brian Preston's grandfather, Stanley, completed an agricultural short course. The family has worked closely with MSU and MSU Extension for more than 30 years, but Preston says the recent soybean collaboration stands apart.

High-oleic soybeans, he believes, ""could change our entire industry.""

Michigan is home to more than 850 dairy farms and about 436,000 dairy cows, and the industry contributes $15.7 billion to the state's economy. That scale makes improvements in efficiency and milk quality especially meaningful. Michigan residents benefit from better dairy products, while farmers gain tools to maximize production and manage costs.

According to the United Dairy Industry of Michigan, fresh dairy products such as milk, cheese and yogurt are produced in-state and typically move from farm to processor to store within about 48 hours. Higher-quality milk from farms like Preston Farms adds value for consumers across Michigan.

For Glenn Preston, Brian's uncle and the owner of Preston Farms, the partnership with MSU is essential. ""Through MSU Extension and working with Adam Lock, we have access to the best and brightest minds in the world,"" he says. ""People at MSU are pushing the envelope to help our industry move forward -- and they are helping us be more profitable. And what it comes down to in the end is that MSU helps our business, which means we're able to be here for another generation.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","The Ring Nebula is hiding a giant structure made of iron","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260118064633.htm","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:26:09 GMT","

Astronomers in Europe have identified an unexpected feature hidden inside the famous Ring Nebula. The discovery was made by a team led by researchers at UCL (University College London) and Cardiff University, who found a narrow, bar shaped cloud made of iron deep within the nebula.

The iron cloud is being reported for the first time in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. It forms a long strip that fits neatly inside the nebula's inner region, which has an elliptical shape seen in many well known images, including those captured by the James Webb Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths.1 The structure is immense. Its length is about 500 times greater than Pluto's orbit around the Sun, and the total amount of iron it contains is roughly equal to the mass of Mars.

What Makes the Ring Nebula Special

The Ring Nebula was first observed in 1779 by French astronomer Charles Messier in the northern constellation Lyra.2 It is a glowing shell of gas produced when a star reaches the end of its nuclear fuel burning stage and ejects its outer layers into space. Astronomers expect the Sun to shed its outer material in a similar way several billion years from now.3

How the Iron Bar Was Found

The iron cloud was revealed through observations made with the Large Integral Field Unit (LIFU) mode of a new instrument known as the WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer (WEAVE).4 WEAVE is mounted on the Isaac Newton Group's 4.2-meter William Herschel Telescope.5

LIFU is made up of hundreds of optical fibers working together. This setup allowed the researchers to collect spectra (where light is separated into its constituent wavelengths) from every point across the face of the Ring Nebula, covering all optical wavelengths for the first time.

Seeing the Nebula in a New Way

Lead author Dr. Roger Wesson, who is based at both UCL's Department of Physics & Astronomy and Cardiff University, described how the finding emerged. ""Even though the Ring Nebula has been studied using many different telescopes and instruments, WEAVE has allowed us to observe it in a new way, providing so much more detail than before. By obtaining a spectrum continuously across the whole nebula, we can create images of the nebula at any wavelength and determine its chemical composition at any position.

""When we processed the data and scrolled through the images, one thing popped out as clear as anything -- this previously unknown 'bar' of ionized iron atoms, in the middle of the familiar and iconic ring.""

Competing Ideas About Its Origin

The researchers say the origin of the iron bar is still unknown. More detailed observations will be needed to understand how it formed. One possibility is that the structure preserves new information about how the dying star expelled its material. Another, more speculative explanation suggests the iron could be part of a curved arc of plasma created when a rocky planet was vaporized during an earlier expansion of the star.

Co author Professor Janet Drew of UCL Physics & Astronomy stressed that key information is still missing. ""We definitely need to know more -- particularly whether any other chemical elements co-exist with the newly-detected iron, as this would probably tell us the right class of model to pursue. Right now, we are missing this important information.""

What Comes Next for the Research

The team is now preparing a follow up study and plans to gather new data using WEAVE's LIFU at higher spectral resolution. These observations should help clarify how the iron bar formed and whether other elements are present alongside it.

WEAVE is scheduled to conduct eight major surveys over the next five years, studying objects that range from nearby white dwarfs to extremely distant galaxies. One part of the project, the Stellar, Circumstellar and Interstellar Physics survey led by Professor Drew, is already observing many additional ionised nebulae across the northern Milky Way.

Dr. Wesson noted that similar structures may turn out to be common. ""It would be very surprising if the iron bar in the Ring is unique. So hopefully, as we observe and analyze more nebulae created in the same way, we will discover more examples of this phenomenon, which will help us to understand where the iron comes from.""

Professor Scott Trager, WEAVE Project Scientist at the University of Groningen, added: ""The discovery of this fascinating, previously unknown structure in a night-sky jewel, beloved by sky watchers across the Northern Hemisphere, demonstrates the amazing capabilities of WEAVE. We look forward to many more discoveries from this new instrument.""

In a new study, terrestrial bacteria-infecting viruses were still able to infect their E. coli hosts in near-weightless ""microgravity"" conditions aboard the International Space Station, but the dynamics of virus-bacteria interactions differed from those observed on Earth. Phil Huss of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, U.S.A., and colleagues present these findings January 13thin the open-access journal PLOS Biology.

Interactions between phages -- viruses that infect bacteria -- and their hosts play an integral role in microbial ecosystems. Often described as being in an evolutionary ""arms race,"" bacteria can evolve defenses against phages, while phages develop new ways to thwart defenses. While virus-bacteria interactions have been studied extensively on Earth, microgravity conditions alter bacterial physiology and the physics of virus-bacteria collisions, disrupting typical interactions.

However, few studies have explored the specifics of how phage-bacteria dynamics differ in microgravity. To address that gap, Huss and colleagues compared two sets of bacterial E. coli samples infected with a phage known as T7 -- one set incubated on Earth and the other aboard the International Space Station.

Analysis of the space-station samples showed that, after an initial delay, the T7 phage successfully infected the E. coli. However, whole-genome sequencing revealed marked differences in both bacterial and viral genetic mutations between the Earth samples versus the microgravity samples.

The space-station phages gradually accumulated specific mutations that could boost phage infectivity or their ability to bind receptors on bacterial cells. Meanwhile, the space-station E. coli accumulated mutations that could protect against phages and enhance survival success in near-weightless conditions.

The researchers then applied a high-throughput technique known as deep mutational scanning to more closely examine changes in the T7 receptor binding protein, which plays a key role in infection, revealing further significant differences between microgravity versus Earth conditions. Additional experiments on Earth linked these microgravity-associated changes in the receptor binding protein to increased activity against E. coli strains that cause urinary tract infections in humans and are normally resistant to T7.

Overall, this study highlights the potential for phage research aboard the ISS to reveal new insights into microbial adaption, with potential relevance to both space exploration and human health.

The authors add, ""Space fundamentally changes how phages and bacteria interact: infection is slowed, and both organisms evolve along a different trajectory than they do on Earth. By studying those space-driven adaptations, we identified new biological insights that allowed us to engineer phages with far superior activity against drug-resistant pathogens back on Earth.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","People Still Aren't Into Buying Cars Online","https://www.wired.com/story/people-still-arent-into-buying-cars-online/","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 11:00:00 GMT","

In the US, cars follow only housing as the most expensive purchase consumers make. So it makes a lot of sense that, according to recent buyer surveys, very few of them want an Amazon-style, one-click approach to getting a new set of wheels.

“People want to see, feel, and touch the car,” says Erin Lomax, the vice president of consumer marketing at Cox Automotive, a research firm that also makes digital auto sales products that allow dealers to initiate transactions online. (This gives Cox a lot of insight into buying patterns, but it also has a stake here.)

Not to mention test-driving the expensive thing they'll probably use every day. Data released by Cox this month shows that while 28 percent of car buyers go into the transaction thinking they want to do the whole thing online, just 7 percent end up pulling it off. More than half of buyers conduct their purchases entirely in person.

Another consumer survey, published in the fall, found that just over half of car buyers wanted to physically sign paper copies of important documents. In yet another, released in December, 86 percent of surveyed buyers said ​​they wanted to see a car in person before finalizing their purchase.

That's despite what looks like a full-scale industry push to bring car-buying online, one that began out of necessity when the Covid-19 pandemic and related shutdowns limited in-person interactions. The direct-sales success of automakers including Tesla and Rivian, and online-first used-car merchants including CarMax and Carvana, have also given the practice some momentum. Dealerships and used-car sites have rolled out waves of technology in recent years—including crucial backend connections between financial institutions—allowing more and more of the transaction to happen with a series of clicks or taps.

This past summer, Hertz launched a fully online car buying platform, letting customers get prequalified for loans, evaluate trade-ins, choose warranties, and eventually arrange pickups on the internet.

It turns out, though, that the whole online car-buying thing is nuanced. It's not that people are eschewing the internet altogether. In interviews, purchasers told Cox that they were pleased that they could do lots of the process—especially applying for and receiving loan approvals—online. One described a “seamless” transition between researching and selecting a car online, then going into the dealership to finalize the deal.

Lomax says Cox finds that internet-enthusiastic buyers tend to make their way to brick-and-mortar dealerships when they hit the financing part of the transaction. “They really figured out viewing inventory online,” she says. “The steps relating to money and financing—that's where the anxiety comes in.”

The auto industry sees big potential upsides in calming that anxiety, especially for Americans who aren't comfortable with the wheeling and dealing that goes down at some dealerships. Amazon's Autos division, launched in 2024, lets consumers research and sometimes finance vehicles online, then passes them on to local dealerships to finish up the work. The company declined to share numbers, but spokesperson Jessyka Faison says in a written statement that Amazon is “very encouraged by the strong positive response.” (The company notes that customers often browse Amazon Autos during evening hours, when dealers might be closed.)

Automakers are getting in on the internet, too. In the fall, Ford joined Hyundai in allowing car buyers in select US cities to buy certified pre-owned vehicles on Amazon's giant online sales platform. Ford CEO Jim Farley vocally coveted Tesla's direct sales approach, which skips the middle-man dealership altogether. “We've got to go to non-negotiated price. We've got to go to 100 percent online,” he said at a 2022 event, referring to EV sales strategies specifically.

Years ago, online used-car retailers including CarMax (founded in 1993) and Carvana (founded in 2012) helped prove that some car buyers were willing to complete at least parts of the buying experience on the internet. The companies, which do have brick-and-mortar locations, also took a no-haggle approach to car sales and posted their inventory online. Traditional dealers, and third-party sites like Edmunds, eBay Motors, and Cox's Autotrader have worked to catch up.

Jessie Dosanjh, the president of the California Automotive Retailing Group, which owns 20 vehicle dealership franchises in the San Francisco Bay Area, says his business makes more profit on online sales. That's not because consumers are paying more for cars, he says, but because efficient, internet-first transactions help the business spend less per transaction because they require less time of his salespeople.

The internet actually “bolsters transparency,"" Dosanjh says, because customers can more easily find prices and compare across makes and models. That “brings us credibility,” he says. Car buyers who want to limit in-person negotiating, or at least that niggling feeling that a dealership is pulling one over on them, might be soothed by an internet full of information. At one of Dosanjh's dealerships, a Cadillac franchise in Dublin, California, 80 percent of car sales documents get executed remotely. “People are really busy in the luxury segment,” he says. “They demand convenience.”

The average new-auto transaction price rocketed past $50,000 late last year, according to Cox. Sixty-two percent of survey respondents said that owning or leasing a vehicle is becoming too expensive. It makes sense that both consumers and dealerships are looking for better ways to buy and sell cars—whether that's in person or not.

If you're at all concerned about privacy, the rise of AI personal assistants can feel alarming. It's difficult to use one without sharing personal information, which is retained by the model's parent company. With OpenAI already testing advertising, it's easy to imagine the same data collection that fuels Facebook and Google creeping into your chatbot conversations.

A new project, launched in December by Signal co-founder Moxie Marlinspike, is showing what a privacy-conscious AI service might look like. Confer is designed to look and feel like ChatGPT or Claude, but the backend is arranged to avoid data collection, with the open-source rigor that makes Signal so trusted. Your Confer conversations can't be used to train the model or target ads, for the simple reason that the host will never have access to them.

For Marlinspike, those protections are a response to the intimate nature of the service.

“It's a form of technology that actively invites confession,” says Marlinspike. “Chat interfaces like ChatGPT know more about people than any other technology before. When you combine that with advertising, it's like someone paying your therapist to convince you to buy something.” 

Ensuring that privacy requires several different systems working in concert. 

First, Confer encrypts messages to and from the system using the WebAuthn passkey system. (Unfortunately, that standard works best on mobile devices or Macs running Sequoia, although you can also make it work on Windows or Linux with a password manager.) On the server side, all Confer's inference processing is done in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), with remote attestation systems in place to verify the system hasn't been compromised. Inside that, there's an array of open-weight foundation models handling whatever query comes in. 

The result is a lot more complicated than a standard inference setup (which is fairly complicated already), but it delivers on Confer's basic promise to users. As long as those protections are in place, you can have sensitive conversations with the model without any information leaking out.

Confer's free tier is limited to 20 messages a day and five active chats. Users willing to pay $35 a month will get unlimited access, along with more advanced models and personalization. That's quite a bit more than ChatGPT's Plus plan — but privacy doesn't come cheap.

The weather in Las Vegas wasn't looking good. The plan had been that each employee of YC-backed Bucket Robotics would carry parts of their booth in their luggage to the 2026 Consumer Electronics Show. But CEO and founder Matt Puchalski didn't want to take the chance that one (or all) of their flights would be delayed. So he rented a Hyundai Santa Fe and packed it up. 

“It was… it was tight,” he said with a laugh on the show floor.  

It took 12 hours driving in the rain, but the gear – and Puchalski – made it safely to Las Vegas, and so began the young company's first-ever CES.

San Francisco-based Bucket Robotics was just one of thousands of companies exhibiting at the annual tech conference, a speck of sand on a beach full of products and promises. But despite its modest setup in the automotive-focused West Hall, Puchalski said the trip was worth it.

Part of that was a willingness to be tireless, observant, and always ready to pitch.

An engineer by trade, Puchalski spent most of the last decade working on autonomous vehicles at Uber, Argo AI, Ford's subsidiary Latitude AI, and SoftBank-backed Stack AV.

At those jobs, Puchalski developed deep connections in the automotive industry, and we crossed paths all week.

There he was at an industry networking party one night. On another night, in my hotel lobby at 10 p.m., he was debating how to balance quality and manufacturing yield with Sanjay Dastoor — founder of mobility startups Skip and Boosted, both of which also got off the ground at YC.

But I first ran into Puchalski during breakfast at the hotel. Seated at the table next to me, he and sales associate Max Joseph were running through preparations for the conference's “Media Day” over (allegedly) cage-free eggs.

Puchalski's verve piqued my interest, and after making an intro, he told me what Bucket Robotics is up to. Before I knew it, he had cracked open a bright yellow Pelican case and I was holding a small piece of plastic.

Started as part of YC's Spring 2024 batch, Bucket Robotics is all about using advanced vision systems to do quality inspections, specifically for surfaces. The goal is to automate a menial task that Puchalski joked is usually done by “dudes in Wisconsin,” and to accelerate the broad, multi-industry effort to onshore manufacturing. 

One example Puchalski offered was car door handles. It's a part customers touch every day, so it needs to be structurally sound, and that kind of quality inspection is basically solved.

But it can be challenging to make sure the surface is flawless. Is the color right? Are there any burn or scuff marks? These are the questions Bucket Robotics wants to answer.

“It's deeply hard to automate these types of challenges without huge volumes of data, so auto manufacturers just throw dudes in Wisconsin at this problem,” he said. 

Bucket Robotics solves that data problem by working from the CAD files for a particular part. It then generates a bunch of simulated defects – burn marks, bumps, breaks – so that its vision software can detect those problems quickly on a production line.

There's no need for manual labeling, and the company claims its models can deploy “in minutes” while also adapting if products or production lines change. One of the big selling points to date is that Bucket Robotics can integrate into existing production lines without adding new hardware, Puchalski said. 

This has already attracted customers in automotive and in defense, setting up Bucket Robotics to pursue the increasingly popular path of becoming a “dual-use” company.  

When the show floor opened, the first two hours were “intense,” Puchalski said. Attendees in suits snooped around the startup's tables, plucked orange stickers with the Bucket Robotics logo, and quizzed the employees about their tech.  

More importantly, Puchalski said the level of interest stayed consistent throughout the week. He had “real technical discussions” with people from the worlds of manufacturing, robotics, and automation. He said Friday that he's spent the week since the show on follow-up calls with prospective customers and investors. 

CES can be a slog, but Bucket Robotics survived. Now comes the actual hard part: building a business, scaling, fundraising, and striking commercial deals.  

As for the “dudes in Wisconsin,” Puchalski doesn't see his company as a threat to their livelihoods. Those jobs are just as much about spotting defects as they are about identifying the root cause of the problem, he said.

And besides, Puchalski added, automating surface quality inspection is something that the manufacturing industry has been trying to do for decades.

“So when we go to our customers, it's incredibly exciting,” he said.

It's been a minute, folks! As you might recall, the newsletter took a little holiday break. We're back and well into 2026. And a lot has happened since the last edition. 

I spent the first week of the year at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. And while I wrote about this last January, it's worth repeating: U.S. automakers have left the building. 

What has filled the void in the Las Vegas Convention Center? Autonomous vehicle tech companies (Zoox, Tensor Auto, Tier IV, and Waymo, which rebranded its Zeekr RT, to name a few), Chinese automakers like Geely and GWM, software and automotive chip companies, and loads of what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang calls “physical AI.” 

The term, which is sometimes called “embodied AI,” describes the use of AI outside the digital world and into the real, physics-based one. AI models, combined with sensors, cameras, and the motorized controls, allow that physical thing — humanoid robot, drone, autonomous forklift, robotaxi — to detect and understand what's in this real environment and make decisions to operate within it. And it was all over the place from agriculture and robotics to autonomous vehicles and drones, industrial manufacturing, and wearables. 

Hyundai had one of the busiest and largest exhibits with a near-constant line wrapped around the entrance. The Korean automaker wasn't showing cars. Nope, it was robots of various forms, including the Atlas humanoid robot, courtesy of its subsidiary Boston Dynamics. There were also innovations that have come out of Hyundai Motor Group Robotics LAB, including a robot that charges electric autonomous vehicles, and a four-wheel electric platform called the Mobile Eccentric Droid (MobEd) that is going into production this year. It seems everyone was embracing and showcasing robotics, particularly humanoids. 

The hype around humanoids, specifically, and physical AI, in general, was palpable. I asked Mobileye co-founder and president Amnon Shashua about this because his company just bought his humanoid robotics startup for $900 million: “What do you say when people tell you humanoid robots are all hype?” 

“The internet was also a hype, remember in 2000, the crisis of the internet,” Shashua said. “It did not mean that [the] internet is not a real thing. Hype means that companies are overvalued for a certain period of time, and then they crash. It does not mean that the domain is not real. I believe that the domain of humanoids is real.”

Now onto the other non-CES and more recent news … 

President Trump made comments this week at a Detroit Economic Club meeting about welcoming Chinese automakers into the United States that did not sit well with many in the auto industry, according to insiders I have spoken to. Specifically, I have been told the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (the industry lobbying group) is “freaking out,” one DC insider told me. 

“If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbors, that's great, I love that,” Trump said, according to reporters in attendance. “Let China come in, let Japan come in.”

A couple of notes. Japanese companies like Toyota are already very much in the United States. The bigger hurdle, beyond protests from within the boardrooms of U.S. automakers, is existing law. In 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security issued a rule that restricts the import and sale of certain connected vehicles and related hardware and software linked to China or Russia. This essentially bans the sale of Chinese vehicles in the country. 

Avery Ash, who is CEO of SAFE, a nonpartisan organization focused on securing U.S. energy, critical materials, and supply chains, weighed in about the dangers of allowing Chinese automakers to sell their vehicles in the United States. Side note: Ash was on my podcast, the Autonocast, which touches on some of this subject.

“Welcoming Chinese automakers to build cars here in the U.S. will reverse these hard-won accomplishments and put Americans at risk,” he said. ”We've seen this strategy backfire in Europe and elsewhere — it would have potentially catastrophic impacts on our automotive industry, have ripple effects on our entire defense industrial base, and make every American less secure.”

Meanwhile, Canada is opening the door to Chinese automakers. Canadian prime minister Mark Carney announced his country will slash its 100% import tax on Chinese EVs to just 6.1%, Sean O'Kane reports.

Budget carrier Allegiant agreed to buy rival Sun Country Airlines for about $1.5 billion in cash and stock.

Dealerware, which sells software services to automotive OEMs and retailers, was acquired by a group of investors led by Wavecrest Growth Partners and Radian Capital. Automotive Ventures and automotive industry executives David Metter and Devin Daly also participated. The terms were not disclosed.

Long-distance bus and train provider Flix acquired the majority share of European airport transfer-platform Flibco. Luxembourg company SLG will retain some ownership stake in Flibco. Terms weren't disclosed. 

JetZero, the Long Beach, California, startup developing a midsized triangular aircraft designed to save on fuel, raised $175 million in a Series B round led by B Capital, Bloomberg reported.

Joby Aviation, a company developing electric air taxis, reached an agreement to buy a 700,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Dayton, Ohio, to support its plans to double production to four aircraft per month in 2027.

Luminar has reached a deal to sell its lidar business to a company called Quantum Computing Inc. for just $22 million. If that seems low, you're right. Luminar's valuation peaked in 2021 at $11 billion.

Bluspark Global, a New York-based shipping and supply chain software company, didn't realize its platform was vulnerable and open to anyone on the internet. Here's how a security researcher (and TechCrunch) got it fixed.

The Federal Trade Commission finalized an order that bans General Motors and its OnStar telematics service from sharing certain consumer data with consumer reporting agencies. Read the full story on what that means.

InDrive, the company that started as a ride-hailing platform that lets users set the price, is diversifying and starting to execute on its “super app” strategy. That means more in-app advertising across its top 20 markets and expanding grocery delivery to Pakistan. Read the full story here. 

Motional, the majority Hyundai-owned autonomous vehicle company, has rebooted. When Motional paused its operations last year, I wasn't sure it was going to survive. Other AV companies with big backers have seen their funding disappear in a blink, so it was certainly plausible. But the company is here and with a new AI-first approach. Before you roll your eyes at that term, take a read of my article, which includes a demo ride and an interview with CEO Laura Major. Then feel free to hit my inbox with your thoughts. 

New York governor Kathy Hochul plans to introduce legislation that would effectively legalize robotaxis in the state with the exception of New York City. No details on this yet; I've been told it will all be revealed in her executive budget proposal next week. What we do know is the proposal is designed to expand the state's existing AV pilot program to allow for “the limited deployment of commercial for-hire autonomous passenger vehicles outside New York City.” My article delves deeper into what she shared and gives an update on Waymo's NYC permit. 

Tesla is ditching the one-time fee option for its Full Self-driving (Supervised) software and will now sell access to the feature through a monthly subscription.

On-demand drone delivery company Wing is bringing its service to another 150 Walmart stores as part of an expanded partnership with the retailer.

If you've been following the billionaire exodus from California with some confusion, here's what's actually driving the nervousness: it's not the 5% rate. As highlighted Friday in the New York Post, the proposed wealth tax would hit founders on their voting shares rather than the actual equity they own.

Take Larry Page, who about 3% of Google but controls roughly 30% of its voting power through dual-class stock. Under this proposal, he'd owe taxes on that 30%. For a company valued in the hundreds of billions, that's a lot more than a rounding error. The Post reports that one SpaceX alumni founder building grid technology would face a tax bill at the Series B stage of the company that would wipe out his entire holdings.

David Gamage, the University of Missouri law professor who helped craft the proposal, thinks Silicon Valley is overreacting. “I don't understand why the billionaires just aren't calling good tax lawyers,” he told The San Francisco Standard this week. Gamage insists founders wouldn't be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don't want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you're giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula.

But that's pretty small consolation. For startups that aren't publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. “These are not clear cut—you could come to a very different conclusion not because of dishonesty.” And if the state disagrees with your appraisal, it's not just the company on the hook; the state can also penalize the person who calculated the valuation. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven't realized.

Now, if you've been under a rock: California's health care union is pushing a ballot initiative for a one-time 5% tax on anyone worth over $1 billion. The union argues it's necessary to offset the deep cuts to health care that President Trump signed into law last year, including slashes to Medicaid and ACA subsidies. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026.

But the resistance is fierce and bipartisan. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump's crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They've called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and Peter Thiel's firm leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about the move was seemingly meant to send a message.)

Even Governor Gavin Newsom is fighting it. “This will be defeated, there's no question in my mind,” he told the New York Times this week, adding that he'd been “relentlessly working behind the scenes” against the proposal. “I'll do what I have to do to protect the state.” 

For now, the union isn't backing down. “We're simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend. “The few who left have shown the world just how outrageously greedy they truly are.”

The proposal needs 875,000 signatures to make November's ballot, where it would need a simple majority to pass.

-d should be approx. 10k to 14k given the size of the city. You can give it a shot.

It doesn't look like the orange and blue colors are part of the theme definitions, so the rendering library may be using some default values. This is why they are rendered in the same color on images using different theme files.

I wish there was less of it, we'd have better software then, but :/

Yeah, like FOSS which is drastically underfunded since birth, yet continues to put out software that the entire world ends up relying on, instead of relying on whatever VC-pumped companies are putting out.I'm not talking ""better software"" as in ""made a lot of money"", I meant ""better"" as in ""had a better impact on the world"".

FOSS software that many rely on that has been around for a while were non-VC: VCS, Linux / GNU / BSD, web browsers, various programming languages, various databases...

reply

Back then it was very normal to get VC funding and then hire the core committers of your most important open source software and pay them to keep working on it.  I worked at Sendmail in the 90s and we had Sendmail committers (obviously) but also BSD core devs and linux core devs on staff.  We also had IETF members on staff.And we weren't unique, this happened a lot.

And we weren't unique, this happened a lot.

reply

Was it in a different nature to current VC funded FOSS though? It sounds like their contributions to FOSS was tangential and not the sold product?Maybe a bit more like Google and Chrome?

Maybe a bit more like Google and Chrome?

reply

It's honestly hard to pick a pattern out for older open source project contributions. PostgreSQL started at UC Berkeley but people contributed to it from all over. Key engineers like Tom Lane worked a number of companies in the database field, some dependent on VC funding, some not. He's currently at Snowflake. [0] A lot of recent innovation around PostgreSQL today (Neon, Supabase, etc.) is VC funded.That pattern changed with projects like Hadoop, which was about the time that VC funds recognized a standard playbook around monetizing open source.

I think it's easy to forget how long ago it was when FOSS truly was the outsider and wouldn't be touched by most companies.Mozilla/Firefox started in 1998 and then started taking ad revenue from Google in 2005, which pays for a large chunk of its development. It's been part of the Silicon Valley money machine for 20 years, most of its existence.

They tend to have more grounded financials (read: paths to profitability) and while the pay packages aren't quite aligned with the top end of the market, they also tend to manage headcount more responsibly than FAANG. I work with a fairly niche stack and I'm constantly finding new companies that I've never heard of and don't raise VC rounds.Long way of saying that just because they're not easy to find doesn't mean they don't exist.

E.g, fitting a model to house prices, you don't care if feature 1 is square meters and feature 2 is time on market, or vice versa, but in a time series, your model changes if you reverse the order of features.With text, the meaning of word 2 is dependent on the meaning of word 1. With stock prices, you expect the price at time 2 to be dependent on time 1.Text can be modeled as a time series.A language model tells you the next character/token/word depending on the previous input.Language models are time series.It's not an audacious claim.Any student of nlp should have met a paper modeling text as time series before writing their thesis.

These frameworks provide structure for established patterns,but they also actually do a lot that you don't have to do anymore. If you are for example building an agentic application then these kind of frameworks make it very simple to create the workflows, do the chat with the model providers, provide structure for agentic skills, decision making and the human in the loop, etc. etc.All stuff that I would consider ""low level"". All things you don't have to build.If you have an aversion to frameworks then sure - by all means. But if you like to move faster and using good building blocks then these frameworks really help.One thing to keep in mind - many of these AI frameworks are open source and work really well without needing backend services. Or you can self host them where needed. But for many that is also the premium model, please use and pay for our backend services. But that is also a choice of course.

But those are also very trivial to build, and you end up having to customize them for your need, and if the framework don't have those levers, better be prepared to either fork the framework, or spend time contributing upstream.Or, start simple yourself with what you need, use libraries for the hairy parts you don't want to be responsible for the implementation of, then pipe these things together.

They also say in the announcement that they had a term sheet for a good series a.I think the team just took the chance to exit early before the llm hype crashes down. There is also a question of how big this market really is they mostly do observability for chatbots but there are only so many of those and with other players like openais tracing, pydantic logfire, posthog etc they become more a feature than a product of its own. Without a great distribution system they would eventually fall behind I think.2 years to a decent exit (probably 100m cash out or so with a good chunk being Clickhouse shares) seems like a good idea rather than betting on that story to continue forever.

Can a kernel be compiled with Ftrace forced off? If it can be disabled at runtime, I take it it's not mandatory for the kernel to work. And I don't just mean off: I mean striping the Ftrace code path (dead code elimination or whatever).I'm also interested in other measures, like a unified kernel moreover without the ability to load modules but this is not what my question is about. I'd like to know if Ftrace can just be turned off for good at kernel compile time.

Uh, what limits? I'm not aware of anything that would stop your module, once probed, from reaching around the back of the kernel and futzing around in the internals of another driver/device in a completely unrelated subsystem, or subsystem internals. SoC/SoM vendors love to pull that kind of crap in their BSPs.> hooks the VFS to allow dynamically remapping file paths on a per process basisInstead of messing with kernel VFS internals, you could try:- patching the offending application or package (ideally make the path configurable and contribute that back upstream)- running the application in a mount namespace and bind-mount something over the path- use LD_PRELOAD to wrap fopen/open/openat (I'm pretty sure, ready made solutions for this already exist)

I think I would literally recompile libc to patch fopen/open/openat long before I would even begin to consider writing a kernel module to mess with filesystem paths on a per-process basis.I feel like if you find yourself seriously considering writing a kernel module then you are either contributing to kernel development, or have embarked on an adventure specifically to learn about kernel internals, or have take a very wrong turn.

- His breaking up images into grids was a poor-man's convolution. Render each letter. Render the image. Dot product.- His ""contrast"" setting didn't really work. It was meant to emulate a sharpen filter. Convolve with a kernel appropriate for letter size. He operated over the wrong dimensions (intensity, rather than X-Y)- Dithering should be done with something like Floyd-Steinberg: You spill over errors to adjacent pixels.Most of these problems have solutions, and in some cases, optimal ones. They were reinvented, perhaps cleverly, but not as well as those standard solutions.Bonus:- Handle above as a global optimization problem. Possible with 2026-era CPUs (and even more-so, GPUs).- Unicode :)

No plans to build a library right now, but who knows. Feel free to grab what you need from the website's code!If I were to build a library, I'd probably convert the shaders from WebGL 2 to WebGL 1 for better browser compatibility. Would also need to figure out a good API for the library.One thing that a library would need to deal with is that the shape vector depends on the font family, so the user of the library would need to precompute the shape vectors with the input font family. The sampling circles, internal and external, would likely need to be positioned differently for different font families. It's not obvious to me how a user of the library would go about that. There'd probably need to be some tool for that (I have a script to generate the shape vectors with a hardcoded link to a font in the website repository).

in general, ascii rendering is when ascii character codes are converted to pixels. if you wish to render other pixels onto a screen using characters, they are not ascii characters, they are roman or latin character glyphs, no ascii involved. that is all.

Taking into account the shape of different ASCII characters is brilliant, though![1]: https://spader.zone/wrapped/

The resulting ASCII looks dithered, with sequences like e.g. :-:-:-:-:. I'd guess that it's an intentional effect since a flat surface would naturally repeat the same character, right? Where does the dithering come from?

I think there's a small problem with intermediate values in this code snippet:  const maxValue = Math.max(...samplingVector)

  samplingVector = samplingVector.map((value) => {
    value = x / maxValue; // Normalize
    value = Math.pow(x, exponent);
    value = x * maxValue; // Denormalize
    return value;
  })

Replace x by value.

Everyone seems now familiar with hallucinations. When a model's knowledge is lacking and it is fine tuned to give an answer. A simplistic calculation says that if an accurate answer gets you 100%, then an answer gets you 50% and being accurate gets you 50%.  Hallucinations are trying to get partial credit for bullshit.  Teaching a model that a wrong answer is worse than no answer is the obvious solution, turning that lesson into training methods is harder.That's a bit of a digression but I think it helps explain the difference to why I think a model would find writing an article like this.Models have difficulty in understanding what is important.  The degree to which they do achieve this is amazing, but it is still trained on data that heavily biases their conclusions to the mainstream  thinking.  In that respect I'm not even sure if it is a fundamental lack in what they could do.  It seems to be that they are implicitly made to think of problems as ""it's one of those, I'll do what people do when faced with one of those""There are even hints in fiction that this is what we were going to do.  There is a fairly common sci-fi trope of an AI giving a thorough and reasoned analysis of a problem only to be cut off by a human wanting the simple and obvious answer. If not done carefully RLHF becomes the embodiment of this trope in action.This gives a result that makes the most people immediately happy, without regard for what is best long term, or indeed what is actually needed.  Asimov explored the notion of robots lying so as to not hurt feelings.  Much of the point of the robot books was to express the notion that what we want AI to be is more complicated than it appears at first glance.

I'm hoping people who harness ASCII for stuff like this consider using Code Page 437, or similar. Extended ASCII sets comprising Foreign Chars are for staid business machines, and sort of familiar but out of place accented chars have a bit of a distracting quality.437 and so on taps the nostalgia for BBS Art, DOS, TUIs scene NFOs, 8 bit micros.... Everything pre Code Page 1252, in other words. Whilst it was a pragmatic decision for MS, it's also true that marketing needs demanded all text interfaces disappeared because they looked old. Text graphics, doubly so. That design space was now reserved for functional icons. A bit of creativity went from (home) computing right there and then. Stuffing it all into a separate font ensured it died.But, that stuff is genuinely cool to a lot of people in a way VIM, (for example) has never been and nor will it ever. This is a case of Form Over Function. Foreign chars are not as friendly or fun as hearts, building blocks, smileys, musical notes, etc.

(I've previously tried pre-transforming on the image side to do color contrast enhancement, but without success: I take the Sobel filter of an image, and use it to identify regions where I boost contrast. However, since this is a step preceding ""rasterization"", the results don't align well with character grids.)

> Consider how an exponent affects values between 0 and 1. Numbers close to experience a strong pull towards while larger numbers experience less pull. For example 0.1^2=0.01, a 90% reduction, while 0.9^2=0.81, only a reduction of 10%.That's exactly the reason why it works, it's even nicely visualized below. If you've dealt with similar problems before you might know this in the back of your head. Eg you may have had a problem where you wanted to measure distance from 0 but wanted to remove the sign. You may have tried absolute value and squaring, and noticed that the latter has the additional effect described above.It's a bit like a math undergrad wondering about a proof 'I understand the argument, but how on earth do you come up with this?'.

Simply trying every character and considering their entire bitmap, and keeping the character that reduces the distance to the target gives better results, at the cost of more CPU.This is a well known problem because early computers with monitors used to only be able to display characters.At some point we were able to define custom character bitmap, but not enough custom characters to cover the entire screen, so the problem became more complex.
Which new character do you create to reproduce an image optimally?And separately we could choose the foreground/background color of individual characters, which opened up more possibilities.

I'd probably arrive at a very different solution if coming at this from a ""you've got infinite compute resources, maximize quality"" angle.

reply

For example, limiting  output to a small set of characters gives it a more uniform look which may be nicer. Then also there's the “retro” effect of using certain characters over others.

And in the extreme that could totally change things.  Maybe you want to reject ASCII and instead use the Unicode block that has every 2x3 and 2x4 braille pattern.

There is stackedit, also an offline first editor. Far more mature, can sync and store to the typical storage services.This app I made is.. more lightweight. It loads instantly for quick writing with no distractions. Pure markdown. Can organise but not mature.My contact is via my profile if you need access give your GitHub account.

There will come a point when we've gone too far with health tracking. One could argue we have already arrived, but sometimes we really need to overindulge to rein ourselves in. Case in point: we can now analyze our urine anytime we want, from the comfort of our own toilets.

In November, Withings released its long-awaited U-Scan: a home monitoring system for your urine. The gadget resembles an artificial seashell that sits inside your toilet. When prompted, it collects a bit of urine that flows over it as you pee and analyzes it for various elements like pH and calcium.

Withings U-Scan

Do most healthy people need a urine tracker? Absolutely not. Was the Withings U-Scan fun and enlightening? Absolutely yes. 

Pros

Cons

I can't think of a single person who enjoys providing a urine sample at the doctor's office, myself included. So I was completely unenthusiastic about testing the $380 U-Scan, if I'm being honest. For whatever reason, the concept of collecting details about my urine is way less exciting than knowing how many hours of sleep I had the night before, or how many steps I took, or how high my heart rate got on my run that morning. Despite all this dread, though, I somehow surprised myself. Analyzing my urine for a few weeks turned out to be somewhat surprisingly fun. And it's nothing like peeing in a cup inside a cold doctor's office bathroom.

Withings first debuted the U-Scan back at CES in 2023, so it's taken the company a few years to perfect.

The hockey puck-sized (or large seashell) device opens up to reveal a compartment for a removable cartridge. Right now, there are two cartridges available. The first, called the Nutrio, focuses on components of your urine that reflect your body's overall nutrition. It checks your urine pH, its specific gravity, ketones, and your current level of vitamin C. The second, called the Calci, also tracks your urine's pH and specific gravity, but it additionally checks your calcium levels. This test focuses on your body's overall kidney functioning.

The U-Scan comes in four different versions. First, you can choose either the Proactive Package or the Intensive Package. Both of them include the U-Scan reader, but the Proactive Package comes with just one cartridge, while the Intensive Package comes with two cartridges. Then, you can choose whether you want the Calci or the Nutrio. The Proactive package (with either test) will cost you $380, while the Intensive package will reach $450. Each cartridge contains 22 urine tests. With the Proactive package, your renewal cartridge is delivered every two to three months for $100 each renewal cycle. With the Intensive Package, you'll get a renewal delivery (of two cartridges) every two to three months for $180 each. For my testing purposes, I chose the Nutrio cartridge.

Installing the device on your toilet is equal parts easy and difficult. The main difficult part is literally getting the U-Scan open to install the cartridge. Because it is going to literally sit inside your toilet, where lots of liquid is spraying everywhere, the scanner must be sealed shut. Withings does this by using a sort of twisting method where you have to hold the palms of your hands on both sides of the device and twist it open and shut. Unless you are a devoted rock climber with the finger and wrist muscles to prove it or a chef who twists open difficult jars on a regular basis, it's likely that you will have difficulty with this step. I eventually got the U-Scan open, but it took a lot of feeling silly and confused. However, once I figured out the signature twist, I could usually reliably get it open anytime I wanted (which was literally twice).

Once unsealed, the U-Scan has an empty place for where the cartridge sits, and it clips in fairly easily. Then you have to reseal the device (equally as hard as unsealing it) and clip it to your toilet. Withings provides three clip sizes; my toilet turned out to be medium-sized. All in all, the installation process was fairly routine, albeit a bit weird.

The logical next step is to pee on the U-Scan, which is even simpler than it sounds. Inside the Withings app, you click on the “Launch a measurement” feature. You'll quickly hear the device power up, and then you have about a two-minute window to pee like you normally would. As this is happening, the U-Scan has a thermal sensor that detects the presence of urine via a temperature meter (urine is much warmer than toilet water). Once it detects urine, the U-Scan has a pumping system that pulls urine inside it via a microfluidic channel, which manipulates the flow of liquid through pumps whose diameter is often smaller than a human hair. The tiny channels move the urine along to the testing area.

Once there, according to Withings, a needle injects the sample onto a colorimetric test strip, which changes colors based on various chemical reactions. A built-in LED plus a proprietary algorithm analyzes any color changes that help determine things like pH and vitamin C levels, among other things. Within a few minutes, your urine analysis will pop up within the Withings app.

Okay, but why? From a medical perspective, urine is actually full of surprises. Urine testing has one of the longest continuous histories in medicine. That's mainly because it is easy to collect and reflects many body processes. In fact, during medieval times, ancient physicians would literally taste urine, knowing that sweet-tasting urine often meant that their patient had diabetes. Thankfully, this practice ended in the 1700s.

Today, though, there are so many things we can check with a simple urine test. The U-Scan focuses on a few main ones, including the pH of your urine, its specific gravity, the calcium level, and the presence of ketones.

When I tested the device, I did it about once a day (as recommended by Withings) and tried to do it at the same time every day as well (often first thing in the morning). For the most part, my readings were within the normal range, but randomly they'd be a bit off, particularly my pH, the level of vitamin C, or my calculated hydration status. If I got a result like that, I would just focus on eating more vegetables over the next couple of days or drinking more water. Often, though, my results would return to normal even if I didn't do any of those things.

And that's where the utility of the U-Scan gets a bit wonky for me. Unless you have a diagnosed condition, like diabetes or kidney disease, that you are monitoring (hopefully with the help of a doctor!), it's unclear how well the U-Scan will improve your health. I can see an extremely healthy person overly obsessing over every single pH or vitamin C reading without those one-off readings having any actionable effect on their health.

The U-Scan comes with a cleaning and charging station (it charges via a USB-C port). According to Withings, the battery life can last up to three months on a full charge, but could be significantly less (only about a month) if you use it frequently. Withings claims that with every toilet flush, the U-Scan should stay clean. However, it also comes with a deep cleaning detergent that you can use inside the station (you'll need to remove the cartridge first).

The U-Scan seems designed—or at least currently marketed—for health-obsessed yet overtly healthy people. For instance, anytime that my urine reading told me that my hydration level was low, I would make a point to drink water throughout my day, and the next day the reading would be back to normal. It made me feel awesome, yes, but do I need a $400 device that measures my urine every morning to remember that hydrating on the regular is good for my health? Probably not.

On the other hand, I can see the U-Scan having a ton of potential for people with conditions like diabetes or kidney disease, where urine readings for ketones or protein are incredibly important for monitoring their condition. And while there are other devices out there that can test your urine, most of them utilize physical test strips. There doesn't yet seem to be another device like the U-Scan that attaches directly to the toilet and contains the testing technology inside the device itself. I don't want to overall dismiss the concept of an at-home urine analyzer, however, even for healthy people. But I think it needs more work on what you are testing and why, and how to use the data it spits out to you.

SwitchBot, the company behind a button-pressing robot that turns dumb buttons smart, has been rapidly expanding its catalog of smart home devices in recent years. Those range from the super niche—things like a smart candle warmer—to the useful and compelling gimmickry of a smart hub with an IR transmitter that lets it act as a Matter-enabled universal remote. For one of the company's newest products, the SwitchBot Smart Video Doorbell, the gimmick is a connected indoor display that acts as a chime, digital peephole, and video storage device, among other things.

SwitchBot isn't the only company to offer such a combo, but it is the cheapest I'm aware of at $149.99. That's compared to something like the $380 Eufy Smart Display E10 and Video Doorbell E340 combo or pairing a $100 Google Nest Hub with a $180 Google Nest Doorbell Cam. And it has a lot of good ideas beyond those I listed above.

SwitchBot Smart Video Doorbell

A dedicated video monitor and local storage aren't enough to save the SwitchBot Smart Video Doorbell from itself for most people.

Pros

Cons

It's a shame, then, that the Smart Video Doorbell itself is one of the worst smart home cameras I've ever used. Its big problem is that the company whiffed it on the actual video doorbell part. The camera produces muddy, awful video at the wrong aspect ratio, the onboard speakers of both the doorbell and display are terrible, and the whole affair is driven by smartphone software that's unreliable, at best. Despite it all, I still think this camera might have a place. But that place is decidedly not next to my front door.

I had a number of reasons to look at SwitchBot's Smart Video Doorbell. Its supposedly 2K resolution video recordings are local by default; it's battery-powered but can also be wired up; it's Matter-compatible (with a big asterisk that I'll get to); it's got a 165-degree field of view (again, asterisk). If you have a paired SwitchBot smart lock, the Smart Video Doorbell can read the NFC chip on your smartphone or a SwitchBot tracking device in order to unlock it.

The indoor monitor component is what really caught my eye, though. It's a smallish, square device with a 4.3-inch display that can either be wall-mounted or placed on a table using a built-in kickstand—near a power outlet, though, as it uses a power cable that's only about four-feet long. Below the display are four buttons, including one to view the camera's live feed, one to lock or unlock your door (assuming you have a SwitchBot smart lock), and one to pop up a list of generic, robotic replies asking visitors to leave a message or telling them someone will be at the door soon. A feature in the SwitchBot app supports user-recorded replies, so, obviously, I fired up YouTube to grab soundbites from “Angels With Filthy Souls,” the fake movie inside of Home Alone. Then I had my child ring the doorbell so I could answer with them. We laughed and laughed.

The display comes with a microSD card slot already filled with a 4GB microSD card for local recordings, which I think is enough, but the device officially supports up to 512GB memory cards for those who need more. Having the memorycard live inside an indoor device is nice, and not something every local-first video doorbell does, so kudos to SwitchBot. It's part of why this doorbell works without an internet connection, another nice feature. In fact, you never actually need to connect the Smart Video Doorbell to an app or the internet at all, as the monitor comes paired with it. Although, in my testing, the camera didn't actually record video when I used it without connecting it to the SwitchBot app.

Beyond the video monitor, SwitchBot's camera just slides right off the rails. I'm not a fan of the camera's design, and I can't stand the scratchy, tinny speakers in either it or the video monitor. Its video quality is atrocious, and the camera didn't seem to produce recordings anywhere near the 2K resolution SwitchBot claims it's capable of. Those I checked on the microSD card were 640 x 360 at most, in fact. If there are circumstances in which the camera will actually grab a 2K video, I didn't encounter them. I asked SwitchBot for clarification on this, and I'll update this review if I get an answer.

Right after setting the Smart Video Doorbell up, I saw another issue—its 165-degree FOV is great on paper, but SwitchBot's choice to use a 16:9 aspect ratio meant only the edge of my porch floor was in view, despite the camera being mounted at the low end of SwitchBot's recommended mounting height of 1.2 to 1.5 meters. Compare that to the Google Nest Doorbell, which uses a square aspect ratio and captures about as much lateral area as the SwitchBot camera while getting way more of what's above and below it.

Not being able to see much of my porch means I couldn't check the camera to see if, say, a package is there—one of the main reasons I even want a video doorbell on my porch in the first place. That wouldn't be as big a deal if I could count on the Smart Video Doorbell to always catch it when someone is delivering a package, but it routinely missed people approaching my porch, especially when they were quickly in and out the way so many delivery drivers are.

It's not much better on the software side of things. The SwitchBot app is immediately annoying about promoting its cloud storage service. Thankfully, you can turn off its pestering reminders if you explore the app's settings deeply enough. But then there are other weird choices, like that motion detection and recording are both turned off by default, or that video recordings are set to end after just five seconds.

At home and on the same Wi-Fi network, it takes many seconds to load the live feed, occasionally failing. When I left for a few days while reviewing it, I could hardly get it to load at all. And while I could get the live feed to load in the Alexa app, I never could in Google Home after adding the camera there. That's a harsh contrast to the video monitor, which shows the live feed almost immediately when the doorbell button is pressed. It was also consistently a struggle to load recordings in the SwitchBot app, either by navigating to the camera's timeline via the app, or by tapping a motion notification on my phone. Most smart home security cameras have these issues here and there, but for the Smart Video Doorbell, it was constant.

Third-party support is a little confusing all around. The Smart Video Doorbell has a settings menu labeled “Third-party Services,” but this seems to just be a way of linking your general SwitchBot ecosystem to others. That is to say, the doorbell shows up when I link SwitchBot to Google Home or Amazon Alexa, but not for Samsung SmartThings or Siri Shortcuts. Apple Home isn't supported. Also, although this package has Matter support, that's only referring to the video monitor's ability to bridge a SwitchBot smart lock to other ecosystems via the universal standard. Matter only just gained smart home camera support in version 1.5 of the standard, and as of this writing, only Samsung SmartThings has updated to that version.

Lastly, the SwitchBot app is a little light on typical smart camera features. You can set a single detection zone by resizing a rectangle on the video feed, but there's no privacy blackout feature. The app has scheduling and a sensitivity slider, but you can't turn off, or adjust the brightness of, the blinding LED lights that turn on when someone approaches the camera at night. And human detection is the only specific motion detection category that's included with a free plan; you have to pay for one of SwitchBot's cloud subscriptions for vehicle and pet detection (both are things that my Netatmo camera has been able to do for free since I bought it in 2019). That costs at least $3.99 a month for a single camera—which isn't bad!—and doesn't include package detection.

All of my complaints aside, there are the makings of a good video doorbell here. Local storage, the fact that it works without Wi-Fi, easy setup, and its SwitchBot smart lock integration are all great things. But the problems I listed make it a bad choice if you want all the smart home bells and whistles that come with many smart home security cameras.

But there's one kind of person the Smart Video Doorbell might be ideal for. Its indoor video monitor makes it ideal for non-tech-savvy folks, especially those with limited mobility, since it means they can see who's at their door without getting up, and they don't have to futz with an app to do it. And if you don't care about ever having recordings and just want a fancy digital peephole and intercom, it's great for that, too. Bad video quality, inconsistent event sensing, and fancy algorithmic detection features really don't matter, then.

But everyone else should just look elsewhere. There's just too much competition from the likes of Eufy, Reolink, and others whose cameras also prioritize local video storage but that produce better video quality, offer more features, and can detect, record, and show events with much greater reliability. I've never used a smart home security camera that I thought was perfect, doorbell or otherwise, but the SwitchBot Smart Video Doorbell misses the mark in too many areas, making it a doorbell camera for almost nobody.

The firm's senior financial strategist is concerned the advancements in the field of quantum computing will break Bitcoin.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Senior financial strategist Christopher Wood said in the latest issue of the GREED & Fear newsletter that he's removing the 10% Bitcoin allocation from his recommended portfolio. He justified this move by saying that advancements in quantum computing pose a threat to the cryptocurrency's cryptographic protections, thus undermining its argument of durability through network security. According to Bloomberg, Wood recommends replacing Bitcoin with an investment with a 5% allocation to physical gold and another 5% set for gold mining stocks.

Wood, who is the Global Head of Equity Strategy at the global investment banking firm Jefferies, first included Bitcoin in his sample portfolio in December 2020. He then grew it to 10% in 2021, citing the fear of inflation because of the stimulus checks the government released during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, advancements in quantum computing have long-term investors concerned about its implications, especially for cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin currently uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which is technically impossible to crack with current computing technology. However, there have been reports as far back as 2022 that quantum computers could crack Bitcoin by the 2030s. An event like this would cause chaos in the system, resulting in Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) losing its value overnight, especially if the break comes as a surprise. Because of this, Wood recommended moving away from it, especially for long-term investors.

Despite this, many cryptocurrency developers aren't as concerned as Wood and other financial experts. For one, current quantum computing capabilities are nowhere near powerful or stable enough to defeat current cryptography algorithms, so they remain safe for the time being. Besides that, progress in the field of quantum computing is slow and public, meaning developers would have ample warning that they need to upgrade their algorithms.

Another big reason that cryptocurrencies aren't particularly concerned about quantum computing right now is that if quantum computers can break Bitcoin security, then they can break cryptography algorithms all across the world. So, if their security protocols were to be broken, then the security of everything else — including traditional banking systems, secured internet protocols, government encryption, and more — will also be affected. Besides, security developers are already looking into post-quantum cryptography, with cryptocurrency developers able to take advantage of their developments as well.

Despite this, Wood says that the debate between cryptocurrency developers and quantum computing will only be a “long-term positive for gold.” It has historically held its value, reaching an 11% annual return over the past 50 years. So, investors looking for a stable, long-term asset to park their funds would probably find the precious metal an attractive option.

More proof that ‘floppy disks are awesome,' not just for save icons.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


“Floppy disks are the best storage media ever invented,” claims tech tinkerer and maker Mads Chr. Olesen. The devoted dad has made it his mission to prove that assertion to his three-year-old son, by making an easy, tactile, Smart TV control system that is fed by these distinctive physical manifestations of the save icon. Say hello to the FloppyDiskCast smart TV remote system for kids.

Modern Smart TV controls are disempowering for toddlers, reckons Olesen. The maker considers the bundled remote control, or using smart device controls, to introduce too much ‘noise' and distraction to the use of a Smart TV. The tile-based UIs may even cause little ones to develop short attention spans – if they can even successfully navigate the interfaces.

The Smart TV meets toddler problem played on Olesen's mind, until he decided that kids would benefit from the floppy disk experience of yore. Putting the idea into practice, the first idea of using a floppy shell to enclose an RFID tag was set aside. Olesen wanted the floppy disk remote control device to exhibit the authentic “click, whirrr, brrr brrr,” feedback that veteran users of this portable removable storage media were familiar with.

The maker seems most familiar with retro-Windows ways of loading removable media. That meant “floppy drives basically don't know if a disk is inserted until the operating system tries to access it.” But those of us who used Apple Macs and Amigas back in the day remember the former's whirring clicky auto-feed mechanism, and the latter's constant FDD ticking, ready to sense media, if the slot was empty.

Olesen eventually figured that pin 34 on old floppy drives could relay disk change information. But to get it to work, he needed to make a physical switch to engage when a disk was inserted. When a floppy is detected, the Arduino FDC Floppy library by dhansel comes into play.

Making the insertion of a particular floppy disk fire up the playback of a particular TV show comes down to a short configuration file ‘autoexec.sh' that Olesen adds to each floppy. Since the disk read bursts are so short, it was feasible to make this floppy disk-driven remote battery-powered, despite the ancient desktop computer tech at its heart.

 




Different config files reside on different disks, featuring different colors and artwork, and play different shows. It is a highly intuitive Smart TV control method for the toddler. It likely ‘feels' to the user that the media playing is the disk, but the Arduino code simply fires up the corresponding streams via a Chromecast.

The EPA just closed a loophole that allowed hyperscalers to quickly deploy power generators without requiring a permit.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency just released a ruling that removes any permitting exemptions for all types of gas turbine generators. According to The Guardian, this move comes as some Memphis residents have been fighting a legal battle against Elon Musk and his xAI startup for its allegedly illegal use of generators to deliver power to his multiple AI data centers.

While any deployment of a gas turbine generator generally requires a permit from the authorities, the county where Musk's first AI supercluster is located has a loophole that allows their operation without a permit, provided they are moved within 364 days. xAI took advantage of this technicality, allowing it to set up and run an AI data center with 100,000 Nvidia H200 GPUs in just 19 days — something that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says usually takes four years. It achieved this by using multiple portable power generators to power the site while waiting for the 150MW substation to finish construction.

Other AI hyperscalers have also started using this technique while waiting for a connection to the grid, with OpenAI planning to use gas turbines at its first Stargate site for additional power. However, EPA's latest rule now requires air permits for gas turbines, even portables ones that are deployed on a temporary basis. More than that, companies that want to use them now have to abide by the requirements set in the federal Clean Air Act.

This is going to be a blow to companies that are rushing to build AI data centers and bring them online, even without available grid power. The U.S. electricity grid is being stretched thin by the sudden influx of power demand from millions of power-hungry AI GPUs, and many hyperscalers are now turning to on-site generators for electrical power while waiting for their site to get a grid connection. While the EPA's ruling is not a ban on portable or even permanent turbines, it increases the regulatory burden for those who want to deploy them. Furthermore, they can no longer rely on legal loopholes in local ordinances, meaning they'll have to follow the higher standard that the federal government has set when it comes to permits and air quality.

A video posted on social media shows a gamer playing a first-person shooter game on a hardcore gaming rig that makes an extra step, or two, for realism. X user @interesting_aIl shared the clip showing the engineer playing an fps title with firework mounts arranged around their monitor. Whenever an opponent took a shot at them, a pyrotechnic is launched at the player, who wore a full-face helmet and a jacket (hopefully, fire retardant) for protection.

A Chinese engineer turned a standard gaming setup Into a physical combat rig that fights back in real time pic.twitter.com/ak81K4jMqWJanuary 17, 2026

The next part of the clip shows an additional a gun contraption that probably delivers recoil with every shot and also revealed the firework launcher's capability to launch multiple pyrotechnics in succession to simulate machine gun fire.

Another scene showed the player underneath an in-game rainstorm, with the clip then transitioning to the player blasting away while being pummeled by wind and water in real life. It is also in this part of the video that we see the player's smoke or wind machine fall apart during operation.

The last few seconds show the player wearing some sort of electrical contraption zapping them every time they get shot in game. This does not just give them a whole-body shock — instead, it only electrifies the specific limb that received damage, like an arm or a leg. But when they were cornered and mowed down by their opponent, you can see them getting knocked off their chair with the electrocution they received from their arms and legs up to their torso.

This gaming feedback rig isn't practical at all, especially as you will have to reload the fireworks after every encounter — so you either have to pause your game after every fire fight, or you need to pay someone to do it for you. More than that, the electrical zap effect is visibly painful and dangerous, which kind of defeats the purpose of playing fps games. Still, the post gained a lot of admiration from the gaming community, with even tech mogul Elon Musk commenting, “Hardcore,” followed by a laughing emoji.

This isn't the first time that we've seen gamers take gaming to the literal next level. A Bilibili user called blyat, possibly the person in this Tweeted video, built a three-crew tank rig to play World of Tanks in, while another one built a jet fighter sim rig, complete with a full motion gaming chair, a recoiling machine gun, rocket launchers that shoot fireworks, countermeasure dispensers behind the cockpit, and afterburners that spurt out literal flames.

U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino is a reportedly a top candidate to return to Tottenham after the World Cup.

First-year manager Thomas Frank is under increasing pressure after the north London side has gone winless in its last five matches across all competitions, including Saturday's 2-1 defeat at home against relegation-threatened West Ham.

Spurs may be on the brink of parting ways with the Danish manager, who has Tottenham in 14th place.

According to multiple reports. Spurs could potentially seek the services of Pochettino, who was at the helm from 2014 to 2019.

Per Football Insider, the Argentine is open to the possibility of rejoining Tottenham when his USMNT contract expires after the World Cup.

talkSPORT reports that Spurs would likely appoint an interim manager until the end of the year if they sack Frank, allowing the club to have more options in the summer.

Despite his undivided attention on the upcoming World Cup, Pochettino has previously expressed his desire to return to the Premier League.

""Yeah, I watch a lot,"" the Argentinian manager said in an interview last month with the BBC. ""The Premier League is the best in the world. Of course I miss it.

""I am so happy in the USA, but I am always thinking about returning one day. It is the most competitive league, and of course I would love to come back again.""

Pochettino said he felt he had unfinished business in England, having led Spurs to runner-up finishes in the Premier League and Champions League.

""Talking about the Premier League, and we are in London... to win the Premier League and the Champions League,"" he answered when asked what he would aim for if he could only achieve one more thing in his career.

""We were so close in Tottenham. I want to achieve this. I am still young, I have the energy, experience and motivation to try in the future.""

Pochettino is currently preparing the USMNT for March friendlies against Belgium and Portugal before the World Cup commences in June.","{'href': 'https://www.usatoday.com', 'title': 'USA Today'}","soccer"

Mid-level and senior officials uncomfortable with award

Fifa says it still ‘strongly' supports the peace prize

There is a growing sense of embarrassment among mid-level and senior officials within Fifa over the awarding of its peace prize to Donald Trump. The US president was handed the award at the World Cup draw in Washington DC in December with the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, telling Trump: “We want to see hope, we want to see unity, we want to see a future. This is what we want to see from a leader and you definitely deserve the first Fifa Peace Prize.”

Since then, the US has launched airstrikes across Venezuela and captured the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, and flown them to the US, where he was put in jail. Maduro appeared in court on 5 January, pleading not guilty to drugs, weapons and “narco‑terrorism” charges. Trump has also threatened to invade Greenland because he said the US needs the territory “very badly”.

There was unease within Fifa at the time of Trump receiving the award with the governing body not disclosing any details of the selection process. Now, though, that has shifted to “deep embarrassment”, according to one senior Fifa source. Multiple officials have expressed their unease about the way it was handled.

A highly placed official, who declined to go on the record, admitted that staging the World Cup in the US is going to be a “very delicate” and “difficult” period, in the months leading up to the tournament as well as during the competition itself.

It is understood that Infantino has been left to deal with the “political matters” concerning Trump for the World Cup as others fear it may tarnish their reputations. “Involving myself in the politics surrounding this World Cup is something I stay far away from. My job concerns football on the pitch and nothing else,” a Fifa source said.

Fifa, however, doubled down on its decision to give Trump the peace prize, and said it did not comment on “hearsay”. A spokesperson said: “Fifa strongly supports its annual peace prize, an award to recognise exceptional actions for peace and unity. Fifa notes the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado] has given her medal to President Trump.

“Fifa has strong relations with President Trump, along with leaders from fellow co-hosts Canada and Mexico. This has resulted in good working relationships leading to, for example in the US, the formation of the White House Task Force for the Fifa World Cup.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Three Lions Pride, the group for England supporters who are LGBTQ, says it will not travel to the USA to follow the team at this year's FIFA World Cup; 3LP was founded before Russia 2018 and has grown to 350 members; the group says FIFA has made “appalling decisions” around the tournament…

By Jon Holmes

The official LGBTQ supporters group of the England football team has announced it will not have a visible presence at the 2026 World Cup in the United States, citing serious concerns over fan safety, human rights, and FIFA's approach to ticketing and accessibility.

In a strongly worded statement, Three Lions Pride said hopes that the tournament would allow travelling LGBTQ fans to focus on football rather than personal safety had been “well and truly shattered”.

The men's FIFA World Cup, due to be hosted across the USA, Canada and Mexico, had been seen by many supporters as offering a contrast to recent tournaments held in Russia and Qatar. In both nations, laws that are hostile to the LGBTQ community were the focus of criticism and concerns.

England are among the favourites to win FIFA World Cup 26, but for Three Lions Pride (3LP), a “dangerous rollback of human rights” in the U.S. means they will not be in attendance this summer.

The group, which has around 350 members – many of whom regularly attend games home and away – says it no longer has confidence that the tournament will provide a safe and inclusive environment.

In particular, 3LP have highlighted the heightened risks of discrimination and violence in the U.S. and how these could impact members who are trans or gender non-conforming.

“This is unsafe and unacceptable,” said 3LP in its statement, adding that the group could not guarantee the security of its members if it attended the World Cup in an organised, visible way.

England will play all three of their Group L games in the U.S., against Croatia (in Dallas, June 17), Ghana (in Boston, June 23) and Panama (in New York/New Jersey, June 27).

Should they progress into the knockout stages by winning their group, Thomas Tuchel's side would also play matches in one or more of Atlanta, Mexico City, and Miami.

Finishing second in Group L would present potential trips to one or more of Toronto, Dallas and Los Angeles. Eight teams that finish third in their groups will also go through.

There are 16 host cities in total, and the Pride House United 2026 project is hoping to offer welcoming venue spaces for LGBTQ people and allies in every one. “We see this as an enormous opportunity to show up for LGBTIQ+ human rights while participating in a sport that we love,” says the official website.

In its statement, 3LP also raises broader human rights issues, including U.S. travel bans affecting certain nationalities, visa refusals linked to social media activity, and fears around immigration enforcement disproportionately impacting fans of diverse ethnicities.

It cited the recent killing of an American citizen by ICE agents in Minneapolis as evidence of the risks posed by aggressive policing and law enforcement.

Issues of accessibility for fans with disabilities and the dynamic pricing ticketing system are criticised in the 3LP statement as well. It is “FIFA's choice to extort fans for financial gain whilst generating revenue of $483 million in 2024 alone (exceeding their 2024 budget by 65%),” the group said.

The group's announcement comes amid suggestions of a potential boycott by other supporters' associations, and the wider community of football fans, stakeholders and even governments.

Pressure is mounting on European powers as a result of the current U.S. administration's attempts to purchase Greenland from Denmark through the threat of tariffs on its European allies, as reported by The Guardian.

A foreign policy spokesperson for the German chancellor's party has suggested that four-time winners Germany could threaten to boycott the World Cup “as a last resort in order to get Trump to see sense on the Greenland issue”.

A recent poll from Bild suggests that, should the US annexe Greenland, 47% of Germans would be in favour of a boycott, with 35% against.

For its part, 3LP says it cannot endorse FIFA's “appalling decisions” in relation to the World Cup “by tacit acceptance through our visible attendance as a group”.

However, it stresses it will continue to support LGBTQ England fans attending the tournament independently, offering remote advice, key contacts and guidance.

“This is a tournament that had so much promise,” the 3LP statement concludes, warning that the event risks empty seats, exclusion of loyal fans and “numerous human rights violations based on disability, race, gender and sexuality”.

In closing, 3LP issued a direct rebuke of FIFA President Gianni Infantino, saying he “should feel ashamed” over his organisation's handling of the tournament.

Clint Dempsey has teamed up with Unilever Personal Care, the FIFA 2026 World Cup's official personal care sponsor, to give soccer fans in the U.S. a chance to win tickets to the world's biggest tournament in North America this summer.

“I was really excited about engaging with fans, giving them the opportunity to get these difficult tickets that everybody's struggling to try to find,” the former U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) captain and current CBS Sports analyst told amNY.

Fans who buy products from brands Axe, Dove, Closeup, LUX, Lifebuoy, Pepsodent, and Rexona can upload their receipts to UnileverWorldCup26.com for a chance to win tickets to the final at MetLife Stadium, outdoor watch parties, and other prizes, such as a Walmart+ membership and a $500 Walmart gift card.

Each product purchased counts for one entry, and fans of the beautiful game can earn more entries by checking out other Unilever brand content and games.

“That's what's difficult about this World Cup — the ticket situation, right?” Dempsey said. “They're going to be really expensive, and they're going to be hard to get. You've got to get creative ways to find those tickets, and [this is] one of those great ways.”

FIFA has received over 20 million requests for tickets to the 104 matches spanning 16 cities and three countries. Newly elected New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani has been an outspoken critic of the prices, which could range from $60 for a group stage game to over $6,000 for the final at MetLife Stadium. These prices might fluctuate even more based on FIFA's “variable pricing” model. 

“As a not-for-profit organisation, FIFA reinvests the revenue it generates from the FIFA World Cup to fuel the growth of men's, women's and youth football throughout the 211 FIFA Member Associations,” the governing body said on its website. “FIFA expects to reinvest over 90% of its budgeted investments for the 2023-2026 cycle back into the game, with the aim of significantly boosting the development of football around the world.”

It released $60 tickets for the qualified countries' supporters amid the backlash, but amNY's Shane O'Brien reported that the low-price tickets represent just 1.6% of tickets at each game, amounting to 0.8% per nation in any given match.

“You don't want to price out the working class from an opportunity to go and represent their country in the sport that they're passionate about,” Dempsey said. “I would like to see everybody have a fair shake at it.”

In addition to a superb assist for Alessandro Del Piero when the move looked lost, Cafú added two goals, making the most of the pace and striking ability that defined his career.

“El Matador” Hernández, Marco Fabián and Moisés Muñoz shine for Mexico


Time seems to have passed without dulling Luis “El Matador” Hernández, who scored once and delivered a clever assist—very much in the style of Cuauhtémoc Blanco—for Antonio De Nigris.







Marco Fabián also made his mark with a free-kick goal that sent the match to penalties, where Moisés Muñoz emerged as the hero, producing key saves to secure the victory for the Mexican Legends.

The FIFA 2026 World Cup is heading to Toronto, and ysou know what that means – a massive influx of energy and excitement! For businesses looking to connect with clients and employees during this global event, a photo booth rental can be a real game-changer. Think about it: people are already in a festive mood, looking to celebrate and make memories. A well-designed photo booth taps right into that vibe, offering a fun way to interact and create lasting impressions. It's more than just silly pictures; it's a smart marketing tool that can really boost your brand presence when everyone's attention is on the beautiful game.

When thinking about a photo booth for a corporate event during the FIFA World Cup, the backdrop is your first big chance to get people excited. You want something that screams ‘soccer' without being too generic. Think about iconic stadium elements – maybe a stylized goal net, a pattern resembling a soccer ball's panels, or even a cityscape silhouette with a giant soccer ball hovering over it. Using a mix of bold colors and dynamic lines can really make the photos pop. You could also go for a more abstract design that uses green and white to evoke a pitch, perhaps with subtle textures that mimic grass. The key is to create a visual that's instantly recognizable and fun to pose in front of.

This is where things get a bit tricky, but it's totally doable. You can't just slap the official FIFA World Cup logo everywhere without permission, that's a big no-no. However, you can absolutely use the official colors of the tournament or the host country's colors. For 2026, think about the vibrant reds, blues, and whites associated with the USA, Canada, and Mexico. You can incorporate these colors into your backdrop design, your props, or even the lighting. If you want to use official logos, you'll need to look into licensing agreements, which can be complex and costly for a single event. A safer bet is to create custom graphics that are inspired by the World Cup's aesthetic – think stylized soccer balls, pennants, or laurel wreaths that hint at victory without infringing on trademarks.

Props are where the real fun begins! Forget the standard silly hats; let's get into the World Cup spirit. You can have inflatable soccer balls, mini flags of participating nations (maybe focus on the ones your guests are most likely to support), referee whistles, and even custom-made cardboard cutouts of famous soccer players or trophies. Think about adding some Toronto-specific flair too – maybe a mini CN Tower wearing a soccer jersey. Having a variety of props ensures everyone can find something they like to use in their photos.

When planning your props, consider a mix of items that represent the global nature of the World Cup and those that tie into the local Toronto experience. This blend creates a unique and memorable photo opportunity for your guests.

Here's a quick rundown of prop ideas:

When planning your corporate event during the FIFA 2026 World Cup in Toronto, you want more than just a static photo backdrop. You need something that gets people talking and participating. Interactive photo booth rentals are perfect for this. They turn a simple photo opportunity into a memorable experience that guests will actually want to engage with. The goal is to make the photo booth a destination at your event, not just an afterthought.

Forget about flimsy cardboard cutouts. Modern photo booths can use digital props and augmented reality (AR) to add a whole new layer of fun. Imagine guests virtually donning soccer jerseys, holding up championship trophies, or even having animated confetti rain down around them – all without touching a physical object. This tech is pretty cool and really makes the photos pop. It's a great way to incorporate the World Cup theme without cluttering the space with physical items. Plus, AR elements can be customized to include your company's branding, making each shot a subtle advertisement.

Photo booths are naturally social, but you can push that further. Set up challenges that encourage groups to pose together. Think about prompts like “Recreate your favorite World Cup celebration” or “Show your team's spirit animal.” You could even have a leaderboard for the most creative group photo submitted throughout the event. This not only generates fun content but also helps break the ice among colleagues who might not interact daily. It's a fantastic way to build camaraderie.

People love sharing their experiences online, especially during a big event like the World Cup. Make it super easy for guests to share their photo booth creations directly to social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Most modern booths have built-in sharing capabilities. You can even set up a custom event hashtag, like #YourCompanyNameWorldCupBash, to track all the shares. This extends the reach of your event and provides user-generated content that promotes your brand organically. It's a win-win for engagement and marketing. Check out some ideas for photo booth rentals in Toronto that offer these features.

Interactive elements in photo booths aren't just about novelty; they're about creating active participation. When guests are involved in creating the content, they feel a stronger connection to the experience and, by extension, your brand. This active engagement is far more impactful than passive observation.

When planning a corporate event in Toronto during the FIFA 2026 World Cup, the venue itself plays a big role in what kind of photo booth setup will work best. You've got to think about the space you have, how many people are expected, and the overall vibe you're going for. It's not just about sticking a booth in a corner; it's about making it a feature that fits right in.

If your event is taking place outdoors, perhaps in a park or a large plaza, you'll want a photo booth that can handle a lot of people and the elements. Think about booths that are more open, like a kiosk style, or even a custom-built structure that can act as a focal point. These are great for festivals or large gatherings where people are milling about. They often have a wider entrance and can accommodate more guests posing at once. Plus, they can be designed to be more weather-resistant, which is always a good idea in Toronto. A well-placed outdoor booth can become a hub of activity, drawing people in with its design and the fun they see happening inside.

For a touch of modern flair and a different kind of guest experience, consider a 360-degree booth or a mirror booth. A 360-degree booth captures a full, immersive video of your guests, which is fantastic for social sharing and creating dynamic content. It's a bit more involved, requiring a bit more space, but the results are pretty spectacular. Mirror booths, on the other hand, offer a sleek, elegant look. They're interactive, with the mirror surface displaying prompts and animations. They feel a bit more upscale and can really add a touch of class to a corporate event. These booths are great for venues that want something a bit more unique than a traditional setup. They're a real conversation starter and provide a memorable experience for your guests.

No matter the type of booth you choose, the backdrop is your chance to tie everything together. If your venue has a specific architectural style or a beautiful view, you can design your backdrop to either blend in or stand out. For a historic venue, maybe a backdrop with a vintage feel or classic floral arrangement works. For a modern space, think clean lines, metallic accents, or even a digital screen displaying custom graphics. You want the photo booth to feel like it belongs there, not like an afterthought. This attention to detail shows your guests that you've put thought into every aspect of the event. For example, if you're hosting at a venue with a stunning cityscape view, you might opt for a backdrop that frames that view rather than hides it. Or, if the venue has a specific color scheme, incorporating those colors into the backdrop can create a cohesive look. It's all about making the photo booth a natural extension of the event's environment, providing a great photo opportunity that enhances the overall atmosphere.

When you're planning a corporate event, especially one tied to a big occasion like the FIFA World Cup, you want everything to scream ‘your brand.' A photo booth rental isn't just about fun pictures; it's a prime spot to get your company noticed. Think of it as a mini billboard that people actually want to interact with.

This is where you make the photo booth truly yours. It's not just about slapping your logo on a printout. We're talking about integrating your brand identity into the whole experience. This could mean:

The goal is to make the photo booth feel like a natural extension of your brand, not an afterthought.

The physical photo strip or printout is often the most tangible takeaway from a photo booth. This is a fantastic opportunity for branding. You can customize:

These printouts become mini-advertisements that guests will likely keep, sharing them with others and keeping your brand top-of-mind. A company like Moment In Time Photo Booth Rental can help you nail these custom print details.

Beyond the immediate fun, modern photo booth rentals can provide data that's surprisingly useful for marketing. Many digital photo booths track:

Analyzing this data helps you understand what aspects of the photo booth experience were most popular and how effectively your event generated online engagement. This information can inform future marketing strategies and event planning.

By thoughtfully integrating your brand into every aspect of the photo booth rental, you transform a fun activity into a powerful marketing tool that leaves a lasting impression on your corporate guests.

Want to make your corporate event during the FIFA 2026 World Cup in Toronto truly unforgettable? It's all about keeping your guests entertained and involved. Interactive photo booth features are a fantastic way to do just that, turning a simple photo op into a memorable experience. The goal is to create moments that guests will talk about long after the event ends.

Imagine this: your guests step into the booth, ready for a fun picture, but instead, they're greeted with a quick trivia question related to the World Cup. This adds an unexpected layer of engagement. You could have a rotating set of questions, perhaps with different difficulty levels. For instance:

Correct answers could unlock a special digital prop or a discount on a printed photo. This gamified approach not only entertains but also subtly educates guests about the tournament, making the photo booth a hub of friendly competition and learning. It's a smart way to tie the event's theme directly into the booth's functionality, creating a unique event experience.

People love to personalize their photos, and digital filters and overlays offer a simple yet effective way to do this. Think custom World Cup-themed frames, team crests, or even animated elements that guests can add to their pictures. You could offer a selection of filters that mimic different eras of World Cup history or allow guests to choose their favorite participating country's flag to overlay on their image. This level of customization makes each photo unique and shareable, turning a standard snapshot into a personalized memento.

While digital sharing is great, there's still something special about a physical photo. Offering instant printing means guests can take home a tangible memory of the event right away. Pair this with a digital photo gallery where all the event's photos are uploaded and accessible. Guests can then view, download, and share their pictures online, extending the life of the photo booth experience. This dual approach caters to different preferences and ensures that every captured moment is preserved and easily accessible.

When planning your corporate event, especially one tied to a global event like the FIFA World Cup, it's super important that everyone feels welcome and can join in the fun. This means thinking about how your photo booth rental can be used by all your guests, no matter their abilities or background. It's not just about having a cool backdrop; it's about making sure the experience is for everyone.

Think about the physical space of the photo booth. Can someone using a wheelchair easily get into the booth and operate it? We need to make sure there's enough room to maneuver. Some booths have a higher counter or a fixed setup that can be a barrier. Look for options that have a lower profile or a design that allows someone to stand or sit comfortably in front of it. It's about removing physical obstacles so everyone can get a great shot.

Toronto is a diverse city, and your guests likely are too. Having instructions and signage for the photo booth in multiple languages can make a big difference. This could include simple, clear pictograms alongside text. If you know you'll have a significant number of guests who speak a particular language, consider having those instructions printed. It shows you've put thought into making everyone feel comfortable and understood.

Props are a huge part of the fun, right? But let's make sure the props reflect the diversity of your guests and the spirit of the World Cup. Instead of just generic soccer balls, think about props that represent different countries or cultures. Also, consider props that are easy to hold and use for people with different dexterity levels. The goal is to have a variety that allows everyone to express themselves and create a memorable photo.

Here are a few ideas for inclusive props:

Making a photo booth accessible isn't just a nice-to-have; it's a way to show respect and consideration for all your attendees. It turns a simple activity into an inclusive celebration, which is exactly what a big event like the World Cup should be about.

Getting your team together for the FIFA World Cup 2026 in Toronto is a fantastic chance to boost morale and build some serious camaraderie. A photo booth rental can be more than just a fun distraction; it can actually become a tool for team building. Think about how you can use it to get everyone interacting and feeling more connected.

Who doesn't love a little friendly competition? You can easily turn your photo booth into a contest zone. Have teams or departments create their own group photos, perhaps representing their favorite World Cup team or coming up with a unique company-themed soccer celebration. You can then have a company-wide vote for the “Best Group Photo.” This not only gets people talking and laughing but also encourages creative collaboration. It's a simple way to inject some energy and fun into the event.

Imagine sending your employees home with a personalized photo badge or a small, branded keepsake featuring their team's photo from the booth. This acts as a tangible reminder of the event and the fun they had. You could offer different badge designs based on which country's team they're supporting, or even create custom frames for the prints that include the company logo and the event date. These little mementos can really help solidify the positive memories.

With the World Cup being all about national pride, why not let your employees show theirs? Encourage teams to pick a country they want to support during the tournament and use props and backdrops that reflect that. You could even set up a digital gallery where all the team photos are displayed, perhaps categorized by the country they're cheering for. This visual representation of team spirit can be quite engaging and makes for a great talking point throughout the event and beyond. It's a great way to see who's backing whom!

Using a photo booth for team building during a major sporting event like the World Cup isn't just about taking silly pictures. It's about creating shared experiences that strengthen bonds and foster a more connected workplace. The right setup can turn a simple rental into a memorable team-building activity.

So, as the FIFA World Cup excitement builds for Toronto in 2026, remember that a photo booth can be more than just a fun add-on. It's a chance to create lasting memories and give your guests a unique takeaway from the event. Think about how you can tie it into the soccer theme, maybe with custom props or a backdrop that screams ‘World Cup.' It's a simple way to make your corporate event stand out and give everyone something to smile about long after the final whistle blows. Don't overthink it; just make it fun and memorable.

A photo booth can be super fun for a World Cup event! You can make it look like a soccer field or use colors from the World Cup. Adding props like soccer balls, jerseys, and flags makes it even better. It's a cool way for people to take home a fun memory of the event.

You can use backdrops with soccer designs or the official colors of the World Cup. Think about using fun props like referee whistles, championship trophies, or even cardboard cutouts of famous players. Just make sure you're allowed to use official logos and colors.

Absolutely! You can put your company's logo on the photo booth itself, on the pictures people get, or even on the props. It's like a moving billboard that people will want to share because the photos are so fun.

Modern photo booths can do more than just take pictures. They can add digital effects, let people use fun filters, or even put virtual soccer players in the photos using augmented reality. Some can also share pictures instantly on social media.

Yes! You can get booths that are open and allow lots of people in at once, or enclosed ones for more privacy. There are also fancy ones like 360-degree booths that spin around you, or mirror booths that look like mirrors but take pictures. You can even pick one that fits the style of your event venue.

It's important to make the photo booth easy for everyone to use. This means making sure someone in a wheelchair can get in, having instructions in different languages if needed, and offering a variety of props that everyone can relate to, not just specific teams or countries.

Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi enduring a dramatic flight up to Manchester to complete his transfer to Pep Guardiola's side. Guehi's private jet was forced to abort its landing at Manchester Airport at the last minute and loop over the city before safely touching down. The defender is set to join the Cityzens in a January transfer worth £20 million.

Guehi flew to Manchester on Sunday morning but there was drama as his flight aborted its planned landing just before 9am, as reported by The Sun. A larger plane was unexpectedly moved onto the runway which forced Guehi's private jet to take emergency action and postpone its landing when it was very close to the ground. The flight did subsequently land safely at Manchester Airport, with Guehi then travelling onto City to finalise his transfer.

Guehi is into the last year of his contract at Crystal Palace and came close to a move to Liverpool last summer. That deal fell through at the last-minute but Guehi is now set to move to City in a deal that sees Palace avoid the prospect of losing him on a free transfer at the end of the season. However, his sale has left Oliver Glasner furious, with the manager revealing he only found out a day before their game against Sunderland. 

Glasner told Sky Sports: ""I heard yesterday at 10.30am for the first time that we were selling Marc. I think the negotiations were a few days long so nobody would have called at 10am and by 10.30am, everything was agreed. Then we have to deal with it. One day before a game, we have to come to Sunderland, when we know we're not on the best run. We know the circumstances with no players available and we're selling our captain. No team would do this. Other teams, the players play and then the next day, they're leaving and we are selling the day before?""

Glasner's own future at Crystal Palace is now in doubt. He revealed earlier this week he will leave at the club of the season but could now be sacked following his angry ""we've been abandoned"" comments after Palace's win over Sunderland.

Guehi's arrival will give Manchester City a much-needed boost. Guardiola's side slumped to a 2-0 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday, with City currently having to make do without injured centre-backs John Stones, Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol. Guardiola has started inexperienced defender Abdukodir Khusanov and Max Alleyne in City's last four matches and admitted his side were second best against Michael Carrick's side.

Guardiola told reporters: ""They were the better team. They had something we did not have. I've come many times here. But today we were not the level required to win these types of games. We had that energy four days ago against Newcastle but not today. It was not a bad performance. We didn't get the result. It happens. It was a football game and they were better. They have a new manager, and they had the energy in a derby that we didn't have. We've changed a lot of players in the last two transfer windows, and we need to live it. This [type of] game can happen; it's more about the previous three. We change a lot in the last 12 months. The spirit has been top. Today was the day we were not here, but at Sunderland we were extraordinary and we didn't score the goals to win against Brighton and Chelsea.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Revealed: Marc-Andre ter Stegen brutally rejected West Ham offer as Barcelona goalkeeper finally picks new club","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/revealed-marc-andre-ter-stegen-rejected-west-ham-barcelona-goalkeeper-picks-new-club/blt1f51b78002e44014","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 17:30:10 GMT","

Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen is set to seal a move away from Camp Nou, but has rejected the chance to head to the Premier League after receiving an offer from West Ham United. Ter Stegen is no longer the first-choice stopper at Barca after losing his starting spot to summer signing Joan Garcia.

Ter Stegen technically remains Barcelona's captain, but he is close to leaving after becoming surplus to requirement. The club made a huge financial effort to win the race for Espanyol goalkeeper Garcia last summer, and after missing much of this season already through injury, Ter Stegen is utilising the January window to secure a move away and increase his playing time ahead of Germany's World Cup 2026 campaign.

According to talkSPORT, one of the clubs who showed an interest in Ter Stegen this month were West Ham. The Hammers signed Mads Hermansen from Leicester City last summer, but he started only four Premier League games before being dropped for predecessor Alphonse Areola. Amid this uncertainty between the sticks and their ongoing battle against relegation, West Ham reached out to gauge Ter Stegen's interest in a loan move, but found he was not considering swapping Spain for England.

Instead, Ter Stegen is closing in on a loan move to Barcelona's Catalan neighbours Girona, who currently sit ninth in La Liga. Reports in Spain suggest the 33-year-old will give up a significant portion of his hefty wage packet in order to get the deal over the line, with Barca also agreeing to pay the majority of his salary even while he's at another club.

Ter Stegen is hoping to be Germany's starting goalkeeper at this summer's World Cup following the international retirement of Manuel Neuer, and head coach Julian Nagelsmann has already stated he will not call on players if they are not starting regularly at club level. Even since returning from injury last month, Ter Stegen has found himself on the Barcelona bench, including for their 2-0 win away at Racing Santander in the Copa del Rey, during which starter Garcia made several fine saves to keep his side afloat.

Though this switch to Girona isn't permanent, this is still likely to signal the end of Ter Stegen's Barcelona career. He's made 423 appearances for the club and won 19 trophies, including their last Champions League back in 2015.

Ter Stegen should immediately become Girona's No.1 goalkeeper ahead of Croatian legend Dominik Livakovic and ex-Tottenham star Paulo Gazzaniga, with the Spanish side looking to qualify for Europe after their one-season jaunt in the Champions League.

Barcelona, meanwhile, can open up a four-point gap at the top of La Liga on Sunday when they travel to Real Sociedad. Real Madrid reduced that deficit to one point with a 2-0 victory against Levante on Saturday, during which many of their star players were booed and jeered following their Supercopa de Espana loss to Barca and the subsequent shock sacking of Xabi Alonso.

As for West Ham, they are still looking for further January reinforcements as they look to beat the Premier League drop. They are now five points from safety after beating rivals Tottenham Hotspur 2-1, while 17th-place Nottingham Forest drew 0-0 with Arsenal.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Crystal Palace make sack decision on FA Cup-winning manager after furious 'abandoned' outburst","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/oliver-glasner-crystal-palace-sack-decision-manager-abandoned-outburst/blta8b5c5e40d10600d","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:39:48 GMT","

Crystal Palace have made a decision on Oliver Glasner's future as the club's manager, with sack talk being played down at Selhurst Park. Glasner has revealed that he intends to sever ties with the Eagles when reaching the end of his contract in the summer. He has spoken of feeling “abandoned” after seeing club captain Marc Guehi sold to Manchester City and transfer speculation rage around Jean-Philippe Mateta.

Palace enjoyed a historic 2024-25 campaign, as they savoured FA Cup glory and captured a first piece of major silverware. They went on to beat Premier League champions Liverpool in the traditional Community Shield curtain-raiser and have graced European competition in the Conference League.

They did, however, sell talismanic playmaker Eberechi Eze to London rivals Arsenal in the summer of 2025. Skipper Guehi has become the next to head through the exits, as the England international defender - who was due to become a free agent at the end of the season - heads to the Etihad Stadium.

Star striker Mateta, who has become a full international with France in a World Cup year, is now generating transfer talk as he registers on the recruitment radar at Serie A giants Juventus. Glasner feels his efforts are being undermined by a lack of support from those above him.

He told reporters ahead of a Premier League trip to Sunderland: “Your heart gets torn out twice in a season, one day before a game. It's tough to survive. That's how it feels right now. We feel that we're being abandoned. There's no support. Everybody's disappointed. We've been playing with 12 to 13 players for weeks now. On the bench I had just kids.”

Said outburst is said to have frustrated club chairman Steve Parish. He was mulling over a change in the dugout before Glasner's contract comes to a close and forces the Eagles to find a new head coach.

The Guardian claims that Parish held talks with Glasner on Sunday morning, in the wake of a 2-1 defeat at the Stadium of Light. He has decided that he “would like Glasner to see out his contract until the end of the season.”

The Austrian has been involved in transfer discussions with the winter window open, acquiring Brennan Johnson from Tottenham in a club-record deal, and Palace “expect him to turn things around after a run of 10 games without a win in all competitions.”

Glasner had said in the wake of a disappointing reversal on Wearside that he did not “care” if he remained in charge at Selhurst Park through to the end of the campaign.

The 51-year-old said of big decisions needing to be made on and off the field: “I don't need any support. Crystal Palace needs it. Crystal Palace are fine to end the season like this – with Oliver Glasner, with another manager, I don't know, I don't care. They are fine with this.

“OK, they can do it if they want to play a more successful season. For me, it feels like we just wait until all the players are back. It will be OK, 42 points at the end, it's all good, it's fine. It doesn't matter how we are acting. It's just my feeling.”

The Guardian claims that Palace “feel that they have acted in the club's best interest by accepting the offer for Guehi given that he was out of contract in the summer and would have been able to leave for free”. They are poised to pull in a £20 million ($27m) fee for a player that would have left for nothing in a matter of months.

Glasner will not be overseeing a rebuild at Palace, as his successor will dictate transfer business in the summer, and it could be that he finds himself lining up against the Eagles next season having been identified as a top target for Manchester United - with the Red Devils in the market for a permanent replacement for ousted Portuguese tactician Ruben Amorim.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","'Come to my house!'","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/house-lisandro-martinez-challenges-paul-scholes-nicky-butt-showdown-talks-man-utd-legends-made-fun-defender-derby-win/blte7f22d78cb16f2a9","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:03:11 GMT","

Lisandro Martinez has invited Manchester United legends Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt to his house for showdown talks. A couple of former Red Devils stars were hardly glowing in their assessment of Martinez ahead of his derby meeting with Erling Haaland, but the Argentine defender had the last laugh and pointed out that “no-one says anything in your face”.

The World Cup-winning South American is giving two ex-England internationals the opportunity to address him in person after making them eat plenty of humble pie with his latest performance at Old Trafford.

Martinez helped to keep Haaland and Co quiet as United, under interim head coach Michael Carrick, put in their most complete performance of the season and collected an impressive 2-0 win - with three goals being chalked off for offside that would have made the final outcome even more decisive.

Ahead of that game, Scholes and Butt featured on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast. The latter suggested that prolific Norwegian striker Haaland would “pick Martinez up and run with him” due his size, while Scholes added that City's powerful No.9 would “throw” the 5ft 9in South American “in the net” after enhancing his remarkable goal record in 2025-26.

Neither prediction proved to be correct, with Martinez having never been the type to back down from a physical challenge. He is not overly concerned with what the likes of Scholes and Butt have to say, despite their respective standings at Old Trafford, with the 28-year-old centre-half preferring to do his talking on the pitch.

Martinez told reporters when reacting to a few pre-match comments that served as added motivation - with Scholes being addressed first: “Honestly, he can say whatever he wants. I told him already, if he wants to say something to me, he can come to wherever he wants. To my house, wherever. I don't care.

“And I think for me, I respect the relations when they want to help the club because everyone can talk on the television, but when you see [them] here face to face, no-one says anything in your face.

“So for me, I don't really care what they say. I just put the focus on my performance, the performance of the team and I give everything to this club until my last day.”

After Martinez's quotes hit the internet, Scholes was quick to respond to the Argentine. Taking to Instagram, Scholes said: “Someone's had a good game, was really happy for you... Tea, no sugar pls (please).“

United have endured a tough time this season, with Martinez having to wait until November 30 for his first appearance of the campaign after recovering from anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) damage.

The Red Devils have parted company with Portuguese coach Ruben Amorim, as he struggled to deliver positive results on a consistent basis, and will be taking in their lowest number of games in a single season since 1914-15 - with early exits from FA Cup and Carabao Cup competition being endured.

They did, however, get things right against City and Martinez is confident that they can start to move in the right direction. He added on working to get supporters believing in the club again: “It is about the connection. It's about how we represent them on the pitch. If they see us fighting like [that], they will be with us.

“If sometimes our performance wasn't the best, because they expect a good attitude from us, tackles, the DNA, the blood of Manchester United. And I can really understand because sometimes it's like 'what are we doing here?'”

United's victory over City has seen them close on the Premier League's top four, with only one point keeping them outside of that pack. Champions League qualification for 2026-27 is considered to be imperative after missing out on European action entirely this term.

The Red Devils are very much in the hunt, as they plan to appoint a new permanent manager in the summer, but face another tough test in their next outing when heading to Emirates Stadium for a meeting with table-topping Arsenal. Martinez, who fills the Red Devils' captain's armband at times, will be looking to lead by example again there.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Inter Miami are chasing a “dream” that would allow Lionel Messi to enjoy a career first, with talks being opened regarding involvement in the 2026 Copa Libertadores. The Argentine GOAT has never graced the most prestigious club competition in South America, but he has become an MLS Cup winner in the United States and could see the Herons handed a special invite.

Such a move has been mooted before, with there obvious benefits to CONMEBOL when it comes to getting Messi gracing their flagship event. Speculation first raged on the back of the former Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain superstar heading to Florida in 2023.

He helped Inter Miami to Leagues Cup glory there, as they came up against Mexican opposition, while further discussions are said to have taken place in 2024. Liga MX teams have been allowed to enter the Copa Libertadores competition.

That tournament could now be expanded further, with Inter Miami having already graced the FIFA Club World Cup. They savoured a historic MLS Cup triumph in 2025, making them the kings of North American soccer.

With that in mind, fresh talks are planned with CONMEBOL president Alejandro Dominguez. Inter Miami managing owner Jorge Mas admits as much, telling Ole of the Herons' ambitious plans for the future as they continue to build their global brand with Messi on board: “I would love to see the Club World Cup return so we can compete against the best clubs in the world. 

“Obviously, a competition like the Copa Libertadores -I would love to see Inter Miami participate someday to compete against the giants of South America, a competition Leo hasn't played in. Those are our aspirations.”

He added: “It's a dream. I've had conversations with CONMEBOL and with Alejandro to see if participation in the Copa Libertadores is possible. There are precedents, because Mexican clubs have played in the Libertadores before. I would like to play in the Libertadores, I've said it and I'll say it publicly. I've also said it within the League.”

Mas went on to say of MLS champions earning their place in the Copa Libertadores, with teams in the United States becoming more competitive by the year: “I believe that the MLS champions, like those of Liga MX, deserve a spot.

“I know these are matters between CONCACAF and CONMEBOL, but I think hemispheric soccer can continue to grow. With the participation of North American and Mexican clubs, I believe the competition would be better.”

Messi has agreed a contract extension with Inter Miami through 2028. The Herons have lost other Barcelona icons Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba to retirement, but Luis Suarez has signed on for another year.

David Beckham and the club's ownership team intend to complete more marquee recruitment business that will ensure Javier Mascherano's team remain fiercely competitive when moving into a new purpose-built stadium.

Mas added: “We're going to have a squad that can compete and reach the highest level, even more so than what we saw last year. It's going to be an extraordinary squad. Our goal is to win the CONCACAF Champions League, I've told the club that. The objective is to win the CONCACAF Champions League in seven matches this year.

“That's why we're building this squad, and that's why we've improved a lot in key positions. We can compete with all the clubs, Tigres, America, they are very good and very difficult clubs, with respect to those clubs, but we have what it takes.”

While counting down the days to another domestic campaign with Inter Miami - which could include Copa Libertadores action - Messi, who remains the most decorated player of all-time, is also mulling over his options when it comes to a quest for global glory.

He helped Argentina to World Cup immortality at Qatar 2022 and is expected to form part of that title defence this summer on North American soil, despite being yet to officially confirm his involvement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","It All Adds Up: Mpetshi Perricard's serve sizzles above all others","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/scorecards-mpetshi-perricard-first-serve-speed","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 03:53:03 GMT","

During the Australian Open, ATPTour.com will bring fans insight into the leaders of key statistical categories, showing how performances throughout 2025 all added up to successful seasons and the promise of more good times ahead in 2026.

Standing across the net from Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard as the Frenchman prepares to serve is one of the most daunting sights in pro tennis. The 22-year-old does not only possess one of the biggest serves in the sport, he also relishes the boldness it allows. He embraces any and all risk behind his lethal weapon, putting the returner in a constant battle.


In 2025, Mpetshi Perricard led the ATP Tour in average first-serve speed, clocking in at 134.4 mph (216.3 kph). American Reilly Opelka ranked a distant second at 130.6 mph.

""His technique is so fluid,"" said Craig O'Shannessy, the Frenchman's strategy analyst. ""You see him load back with his energy and drive so well with the legs.

""With his height, looseness in his arm and wrist and energy coiling up through the body, he's able to hit the ball harder than anyone else in the game. He has a very lively wrist at the end of that kinetic chain.""

Fastest Average First-Serve Speed, 2025

 


What distinguishes Mpetshi Perricard from his peers is his refusal to ease off when hitting a second serve. Rather than prioritising safety, as many players would, Mpetshi Perricard doubles down on aggression. He averaged a fearless 117 mph on his second delivery in 2025, rarely giving any breathing room for his opponents. Valentin Vacherot ranked second in average second-serve speed at 112.5 mph.

""He needs to be a player who mixes in a number of second serves that he hits as hard as his first serve,"" O'Shannesy said. ""He doesn't need to hit two first serves all the time; it needs to be strategic.

""Kyrgios has proven how potent it can be when it's unpredictable. Just because you have a big hammer doesn't mean you always have to use it. The threat of the big hammer is also very important. Keeping an opponent guessing what speed is coming, what height is coming is key.""

Mpetshi Perricard's approach is unapologetically bold, designed to keep opponents under constant stress and ensure that points unfold entirely on his terms. After hitting a career-high No. 29 in the PIF ATP Rankings in 2025, Mpetshi Perricard will look to rely on his thunderous serve in search of further success in 2026.

Carlos Alcaraz made a winning start in his quest to complete the Career Grand Slam at this year's Australian Open, where he overcame a resilient performance from Australian Adam Walton to reach the second round in Melbourne.

Competing for the first time in the post-Juan Carlos Ferrero era, the World No. 1 moved past Walton 6-3, 7-6(2), 6-2 in the night session on Rod Laver Arena.

Alcaraz, who ended his seven-year relationship with former coach Ferrero in December, is aiming to become just the sixth man – and youngest – in the Open Era to win all four major titles at least once. The Spaniard was not at his free-flowing best against Walton but found enough consistency when needed to shake off the World No. 79 in the pair's second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting (2-0 Alcaraz).

“I am really happy to step onto the court once again for the first time this season. It could not have been better, playing here on the Rod Laver Arena,” Alcaraz said. “It was a good match. I felt great and Adam pulled off some great shots, a great level in the match, so I had to stay there at this kind of level.”



Alcaraz struck 38 winners and showed his fighting qualities in the second set, rallying from 1-3 to stamp further authority on the clash. Walton was trying to advance to the second round of his home Slam for the first time and gave a good account of himself throughout the two-hour, 13-minute clash, troubling Alcaraz at times with his deep groundstrokes. However, he could not match the Spaniard in the key moments.

“It was really, really difficult to find the good spots,"" Alcaraz added. ""It felt he was always in a good position. Long rallies. He was solid from the baseline and his flat ball was sometimes really difficult for me. Getting used to the conditions and the court, but it was a really solid match.”

Alcaraz, led by coach Samuel Lopez, is chasing his seventh major this fortnight. The Spaniard is a two-time champion at Roland Garros (2024, '25), Wimbledon (2023, '24) and the US Open (2022, '25). The 22-year-old will next meet Yannick Hanfmann after the German beat American qualifier Zachary Svajda 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6(3).



In other action, the No. 10 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Alexander Bublik earned his first win at the Australian Open since 2022. Competing as a Top 10 player for the first time, the 28-year-old overcame Jenson Brooksby 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to set a second-round clash with Marton Fucsovics.

American qualifier Michael Zheng earned a dream win on his tour-level debut, upsetting Sebastian Korda 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 6-7(0), 6-3. The 21-year-old Zheng, who will next play Corentin Moutet, is currently studying at Columbia University in New York, where he is a senior. Learn more about the reigning NCAA men's singles champion here.

There were also wins for seeds Cameron Norrie, Francisco Cerundolo and Frances Tiafoe on Day 1. British lefty Norrie defeated Benjamin Bonzi 6-0, 6-7(2), 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 and has now won his past three matches that have gone to five sets, according to Infosys ATP Stats. The 18th seed Cerundolo downed Zhang Zhizhen 6-3, 7-6(0), 6-3, while Tiafoe defeated Australian Jason Kubler 7-6(4), 6-3, 6-2.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","World No. 185 Fery stuns Cobolli, Zverev rallies to reach Australian Open R2","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/australian-open-2026-sunday-day-1","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 04:57:53 GMT","

British qualifier Arthur Fery earned the first win of the 2026 Australian Open men's draw on Sunday when he upset 20th seed Flavio Cobolli 7-6(1), 6-4, 6-1.


“Incredible experience here,” said Fery in his on-court interview. “My first time playing a main-draw Slam outside of Wimbledon and it didn't disappoint on such a great court with great fans as well.”


Fery, 23, has claimed two of his three tour-level victories at Slam level. Last year at Wimbledon, the then-No. 461 in the PIF ATP Rankings stunned Alexei Popyrin in the opening round. Fittingly, Popyrin was the 20th seed, the same seed which Fery ousted Down Under.


A former two-time ITA All-American at Stanford University, Fery produced superb shotmaking throughout the two-hour, 12-minute clash and converted six of his 10 break-point chances. Cobolli took a medical timeout after three games and received several visits from the doctor across the match, seemingly struggling with a stomach issue. The World No. 22 was unable to find rhythm and counter Fery's fearless baseline play at John Cain Arena.


Fery, who began the season's first major at a career-high No. 185 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will look to build upon his momentum against Miomir Kecmanovic or Tomas Martin Etcheverry.

Cobolli helped guide Italy to a third consecutive Davis Cup title in November. Cobolli was clutch that week, not only clinching the final victory against Spain, but also saving seven match points against Belgium's Zizou Bergs in the semi-finals.


The 23-year-old was playing his third match of the 2026 season. He went 1-1 at the United Cup, earning a three-set victory against Stan Wawrinka before falling to Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech 6-7(4), 7-6(5), 7-5 in a three-hour, 21-minute nailbiter.

Third seed Alexander Zverev overcame early trouble against dangerous Canadian Gabriel Diallo to begin his campaign in winning fashion, posting a 6-7(1), 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 victory after claiming six service breaks.

""When I saw the draw I wasn't too happy to be honest,"" Zverev said. ""He's very young and talented and unbelievably aggressive. It was difficult to find a rhythm and the first set was not my best tennis, but once I got into the match I felt good on the court.""

Making his 40th major appearance, last year's finalist quickly rebounded from a below-par performance in the first-set tie-break, during which he struggled to find rhythm on his forehand. By earning a break in Diallo's first service game of the second set, Zverev loosened up and stood closer to the baseline to dictate rallies while swinging freely at the ball.

The 28-year-old's serve set the tone for the match, a positive sign for Zverev's form in the early stages of the tournament. In the third set alone, the German landed 86 per cent of his first serves and won 95 per cent (18/19) of those points, according to Infosys ATP Stats. He finished with 15 aces and just one double fault.

Two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka won her opening match at the 2026 edition with a straight sets victory over Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah. The young Frenchwoman certainly tested the World No. 1 in the first set, but Sabalenka's power and experience prevailed.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka's quest to make a fourth straight Australian Open final started on a high note Sunday, defeating Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah, who tested Sabalenka in the first set.

The wild card gave it everything against the highest-ranked opponent in her career on the WTA Tour Driven by Mercedes-Benz, but the two-time Australian Open champion's experience prevailed in the 6-4, 6-1 victory at Rod Laver Arena to begin the night session.

""I think I didn't really start at my best and was struggling to find my rhythm,"" Sabalenka said to reporters. ""But then I feel like in the last two games of the first set I found my rhythm, and I was able to step in and play a little bit better tennis.""

Sabalenka really took advantage of the momentum and security of winning the first set. Breaking Rakotomanga Rajaonah's serve to end the first set allowed Sabalenka to serve for a 1-0 lead. Quickly, the second-set lead blossomed to a 3-0. It was evident Sabalenka's power behind her shot was too much for Rakotomanga Rajaonah, who often hit returns into the net or out of bounds.

In the second set, Sabalenka began to control Rakotomanga Rajaonah's movement, opening the court and finishing points at the net, where she ventured forward 22 times, or forcing errors under pressure. The difference in weight of shot was clear on serve: Sabalenka averaged 104 miles per hour on her first delivery, compared with 93 mph for Rakotomanga Rajaonah. That edge carried over on return, where Sabalenka won 42% of points against first serves and 64% against second serves, steadily tightening her grip on the match.

Sabalenka then won three of the final four games to end the 1-hour and 16-minute match. 

""I was definitely working on serve and volley,"" Sabalenka said. ""I'm super happy to be able to do it on the match. On the practice is one thing, but to be able to be kind of fearless and go there at the match is something else. I'm really proud I'm able to show this tennis.""

The 20-year-old made a quick statement in the opening game. Winning the coin toss, she elected to receive, and set herself up with triple break point. Sabalenka did force a deuce, but her return into the net gave Rakotomanga Rajaonah the early break.

After Sabalenka broke to level at 1-1, Rakotomanga Rajaonah stayed in it by holding her serve across her next three service games. She even saved a break point to avoid going down 5-3, and hit a solid forehand winner to tie at 4-4. 

It was a performance to be very proud of even in defeat as Rakotomanga Rajaonah left the court in smiles and waved to the Rod Laver Arena crowd, who showered her with applause. 

""You're always kind of trying to figure out where you are,"" Sabalenka said. ""Also that opponent that I never played before. I haven't really watched her games before and kind of lose her out of my radar. I didn't really know much about her. I was just struggling to find the rhythm of her shots. I'm happy that I could manage and I could get this win in straight sets.""

Rakotomanga Rajaonah was serving to remain in the first set down 5-4. She had two game point opportunities to extend the set, once at 40-30 and the other at Ad-40. Ultimately, Sabalenka saved the game points and created a set point of her own.

On the return, Sabalenka elected to use her power to force the young Frenchwoman from side-to-side, and the four-time Grand Slam champion took the break point and won the 45-minute first set. Sabalenka finished 4-of-10 on break point opportunities.

Sabalenka will face Zhuoxuan Bai in the second round. The Chinese qualifier, ranked No. 702 as she returns from injury and competing in her first Grand Slam main draw since Wimbledon 2024, saved one match point in the super-tiebreak to defeat Anastasia Pavluchenkova 6-4, 2-6, 7-6[10].

Two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka won her opening match at the 2026 edition with a straight sets victory over Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah. The young Frenchwoman certainly tested the World No. 1 in the first set, but Sabalenka's power and experience prevailed.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

Elsa Jacquemot saved a match point to upset Marta Kostyuk in the Australian Open first round, winning the tournament's first triple-tiebreak match of the Open Era.

Elsa Jacquemot sprung the first major upset of the Australian Open on Sunday in historic fashion, defeating No. 20 seed Marta Kostyuk 6-7(4), 7-6(4), 7-6[7] in the first triple-tiebreak match at the Australian Open in the Open Era.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

The 60th-ranked Frenchwoman came from a set and 5-3 down, saving one match point serving down 6-5 in the second set, and eventually pulled through in 3 hours and 31 minutes -- the longest match of the season so far, and just two minutes shy of 2025's longest match. The result was also Jacquemot's first career Top 20 win.

""I won it with the heart and with the guts,"" Jacquemot told press afterward.

Kostyuk had raced out of the blocks in 2026, notching three Top 10 wins to reach the Brisbane final in the first week of the year. Her pre-season strength training had paid off, she told press, and she had set her sights on a Top 10 finish of her own this season.

But the fluidity and consistency the Ukrainian displayed two weeks ago was lacking against Jacquemot: Kostyuk fired 67 winners, but they were outweighed by 68 unforced errors. Jacquemot, the 2020 Roland Garros junior champion who cracked the Top 100 last year, lured Kostyuk into over-pressing with superb defense, but also sprinkled in moments of well-timed aggression. A pair of ferocious forehand returns denied Kostyuk as she served for the match at 5-3 in the second set, and Jacquemot fended off match point with a service winner.

Serving down 6-5 in the decider, Kostyuk required a medical time-out after rolling her ankle. She was nonetheless able to force a tiebreak, only for her volleys to let her down badly as Jacquemot took a 5-1 lead. Kostyuk managed to level matters at 7-7, but at that point Jacquemot unleashed at the perfect time again, hammering her two biggest forehands of the tiebreak to reach match point of her own. A cagy rally ensued, and ended when Kostyuk netted her drop shot attempt.

The result was Jacquemot's first match win of 2026, having lost her openers to Ajla Tomljanovic in Brisbane and Magdalena Frech in Hobart. It was also the third time in the past four majors that Kostyuk had lost her first round to a player ranked outside the Top 50, having exited at Roland Garros to Sara Bejlek and at Wimbledon to Veronika Erjavec.

Kostyuk's loss means that a brand new Australian Open quarterfinalist is guaranteed to come out of her section of the draw. The only two players remaining who have reached any major quarterfinal are No. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini and Yulia Putintseva.

The contest was just the fifth triple-tiebreak Grand Slam match in the Open Era, following:

1985 US Open QF, Stefanie Graf d. Pam Shriver 7-6(4), 6-7(4), 7-6(4)1991 US Open R3, Gigi Fernandez d. Leila Meskhi 7-6(1), 6-7(3), 7-6(2)2021 US Open R1, Rebeka Masarova d. Ana Bogdan 6-7(9), 7-6(2), 7-6[9]2023 Wimbledon R2, Ekaterina Alexandrova d. Madison Brengle 6-7(4), 7-6(5), 7-6[7]

It's a scoreline that has only been possible at the Australian Open since 2019; prior to that, the US Open was the only major to use a third-set tiebreak instead of playing the set out.

At tour level, Jacquemot's win was the 13th triple-tiebreak match of this decade so far, but the second of 2026 already following Madison Keys' 6-7(5), 7-6(5), 7-6(5) defeat of Diana Shnaider in the Brisbane third round.

Putintseva lays down marker for celebration of the year

Jacquemot will next face former No. 20 Yulia Putintseva, who laid down a marker for the best celebration of the tournament -- maybe the season -- after defeating Beatriz Haddad Maia 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 in 2 hours and 53 minutes from a set and a break down. Scheduled on Court 6 adjacent to the rambunctious Courtside Bar, Putintseva's dynamic with the crowd was a spicy one throughout. But the Kazakhstani had the last laugh, approaching the net with a shimmy of her hips after sealing the win and then delivering a florid bow to the audience -- with a theatrical twirl thrown in for good measure.

“It's Yulia Putintseva time”- Yulia Putintseva pic.twitter.com/Dws9HzlUCJ

Another seed to exit was No. 32 Marketa Vondrousova, the former Wimbledon champion, who was forced to withdrew from the tournament due to ongoing shoulder issues. Vondrousova underwent shoulder surgery in 2024 that sidelined her for six months that year.

""I'm really sorry that I had to withdraw from the Australian Open due to ongoing shoulder issues,"" the Czech said in a statement. ""After everything I've been dealing with, I need to prioritize my health, even though this decision wasn't easy. Thank you all for your understanding and support.""

Lucky loser Taylor Townsend took Vondrousova's spot in the draw, but fell 6-3, 6-7(3), 6-3 to fellow American Hailey Baptiste.

Elsewhere, Polina Kudermetova defeated qualifier Guiomar Maristany Zuleta De Reales 6-2, 6-3 to become the first woman representing Uzbekistan to win a Grand Slam main-draw match in 13 years -- since Akgul Amanmuradova defeated Mathilde Johansson in the first round of the 2013 Australian Open.

Zeynep Sonmez became the first Turkish woman in the Open Era to win a match at the Australian Open after upsetting Ekaterina Alexandrova in the first round.

Qualifier Zeynep Sonmez delivered sportsmanship, hot shots and ultimately a slice of Turkish history after coming from 3-0 down in the third set to upset No. 11 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 in the Australian Open first round.

Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play

Sonmez, 23, claimed the second Top 20 win of her career (following her defeat of Clara Tauson in Beijing last year), and became the first Turkish woman in the Open Era to win a match at the Australian Open. Last year, she became the second Turkish woman to compete in the main draw here following Cagla Buyukakcay, who fell in the 2017 first round in her only main-draw appearance.

The 2-hour, 37-minute contest was marked by wild momentum swings -- Sonmez won the first set from 5-2 down, saving one set point, with a run of seven straight games; she lost the second set from 3-1 up as Alexandrova took eight of the next nine games; but from 3-0 down in the decider, Sonmez hit her stride again to take six of the last seven games, converting her fourth match point as Alexandrova netted a backhand.

Sonmez's third-set comeback was kickstarted by one of the best points of the day, a masterclass of rally construction. With Alexandrova serving up 3-1, 15-30, Sonmez opened the court with a powerful angled forehand. She followed it by pulling Alexandrova into net with a drop shot, and although Alexandrova still managed to get decent pace on to her own reply, Sonmez anticipated it and managed to slot a forehand pass at full stretch for a winner.

The World No. 112 also won over the 1573 Arena audience with a display of sportsmanship late in the second set. As Alexandrova served at 5-3, a ballkid next to the umpire's chair appeared to faint. Sonmez was the first over to her, and helped the ailing girl to a courtside seat in the shade. She later received medical attention and left the site.

""She was really struggling,"" Sonmez later told BBC Sport. ""She said she was fine but it was really obvious she was not fine. So I went to grab her and said 'Sit down and drink something, you're not fine.'

""As we were walking she fainted so luckily I grabbed her. She was really shaking.

""I always say it is more important to be a good human being than a good tennis player. It was just my instinct to help her and I think everyone would do the same. I'm happy I got to help.""

Not that the crowd needed any further encouragement to get behind Sonmez. She enjoyed fervent Turkish support throughout; a plethora of the country's flags were waved, and Sonmez adorned herself with one of them for a victory lap after the match. It's not the first time she's attracted this kind of excitement by breaking new ground. Last year, London's Turkish diaspora turned out for Sonmez at Wimbledon as she became the first Turkish player to reach the third round of a Grand Slam in the Open Era -- a run that was halted by none other than Alexandrova.

Sonmez, who dropped just 13 games in three qualifying matches last week, is bidding to return to the Top 100 after reaching a career high of No. 69 last October.

Red Bull and Racing Bulls unveil new cars

How drivers will adapt in 2026

Lawrence Barretto's new F1 TV series Off The Grid sees him spending time with the great and the good of the F1 paddock away from the racetrack. In the third episode, he travels to Geneva to meet Haas driver Esteban Ocon.

When a Formula 1 driver arrives at a racetrack, he selects full race mode and puts everything else out of his mind to focus on the day job. Over the course of the last decade covering the sport, that's usually the mode they're engaged in when I get to talk to them through my role as an interviewer for F1. But for a change of pace and as part of an exclusive new series, I headed Off The Grid to hang out with the sport's elite racers away from the office.

In the third and final episode of this series, Grand Prix winner Esteban Ocon invited me to Geneva, the place he now calls home, to join him on a training day. The Frenchman, who like his rivals Oscar Piastri and Pierre Gasly in the opening two episodes gave up one of his personal days to take part in filming (rather than via mandatory team media or commercial time), talks expansively about his family selling their home to fund his career, his relationship with fellow French racer Pierre Gasly, his rivalry with Sergio Perez, the pain he felt as Manor went under and his new chapter with American squad Haas.

Esteban Ocon grew up surrounded by cars, as he would spend his days watching – and, when he was old enough, helping – his mechanic Dad tinker with machines. When Sundays came, he was glued to the TV watching Formula 1, so it's perhaps not surprising he quickly zero-ed in on a career in motorsports.

""I was watching F1 on a Sunday, I was shocked but also fascinated at the same time,"" says Ocon, when we chat in one of the quaint corners of his stunning training base 321 Perform. ""The love for the sport grew from there. At the same time, I got a taste of karting. I wanted to only drive all the time. Many kids say I want to become an astronaut or footballer. For me, it's always been Formula 1 driver and it's never changed since I first talked about it.""

Racing is obviously not cheap – and the Ocons weren't wealthy, but his family believed in him to such an extent that they opted to sell their home and move into a caravan to fund his go-karting career. How did he feel when his Dad told him they were going all in on him?

""Dad said, 'It's now or never'. It was an immense amount of pressure. I didn't have a normal childhood, but we were living [in the caravan] with my mum and dad and my dog. Every day I woke up with a different scenery. I remember one day opening the door and it was a view of the sea and we were in Monaco. It was amazing. That moment will stick with me forever.""

Ocon and his family clocked up tens of thousands of kilometres travelling to various karting meets across Europe – and once there, he'd encounter some of the best karters in the world, including Gasly, whom he had known since he was little because they grew up in Normandy and who had used his kart to get a first taste of motorsport.

""I was on that little go-kart track in Anneville, and I was practising for the regional championships that were coming up,"" says Ocon. ""Pierre was playing football and my Dad said to him quit these shoes and jump in Esteban's go-kart. The following week, Pierre got a go-kart as well. We were driving together – I was showing him the line first and then we were racing together.""

That relationship fractured as they made their way through the lower racing categories – ""Pierre was my best friend when I was younger,"" he says. ""Then we grew up and things changed a little bit"" – but there was a wholesome moment in Brazil in 2024 when they unexpectedly shared the podium racing for French team Alpine.

""Two kids from Normandy racing for a brand from Normandy,"" he says.  ""Who would have thought? This world has a billion people, we're just two little guys from France – it's quite crazy. That moment meant the whole world for us. The only thing I would love too is for us to share even more podiums in the future.""

The Frenchman returned from that race to find a large image of him hoisting the trophy for P2 aloft in his apartment. It was a gift from his girlfriend Flavy – and one of the many mementos he keeps on display in the house, which range from a Spiderman book Daniel Ricciardo gave him as a secret Santa present, which sits on his coffee table, to a handmade steering wheel from a fan, which has working clutch paddles. I had a little mishap with a red-coloured drink, which you'll see in the episode, but can report none of these items were damaged!

Ocon may never have got to F1, though, as funds started to dry up when he made it into single-seaters despite his success in karting. So he took a punt when he had the chance to meet now Mercedes boss Toto Wolff. ""I asked if he could help me for the future,"" says Ocon. ""He was my last chance, my last hope. If he was saying there were no options, the whole dream would have been gone. But he called back and said, 'You are going to race with ART in GP3 and if you succeed in that one, we take you in the [Mercedes] programme'.""

He did succeed, winning the GP3 title in 2015. Wolff was there, standing under the podium to congratulate his soon-to-be newest member of the Mercedes family. Then in the summer of 2016, he gave Ocon a call and offered him the thing the Frenchman had a dreamed of – a shot in F1 with the Manor team when the campaign resumed at Belgium's Spa-Francorchamps track.

""I remember receiving the call when I was on holiday with friends,"" he says. ""I had to go straight away to do a seat fit at Manor to join the grid in Spa. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. We were having a drink – I don't drink alcohol, I was having a coke or something – and I remember looking at the TV in the bar and seeing myself on the news. And I was like, 'Oh, that's me!' People were talking about me on live TV. I didn't believe it. It was pretty nuts!""

He came close to scoring a point in Brazil, in what was one of the slowest cars on track, but faded in the closing stages to end up 12th. He spent much of the race battling with Sauber's Felipe Nasr, who scrapped to ninth to score two points and hoist the Swiss team above Manor in the championship. That had big repercussions for the minnows in terms of prize money as it left them last in the standings – with the team ultimately going into administration.

While Ocon's form would be good enough to get him a seat at midfielders Force India for the following season, he took Manor's demise hard. ""We didn't succeed and the team died at the end of the year,"" he says. ""If I scored more points than that Sauber car, maybe it would have been a different outcome, keep the team alive for the following season. I felt that it was almost my fault. That was very tough. I moved on from them but there were fantastic people working in this team and it was tough to see this team went unfortunately.""

Ocon enjoyed an impressive first full season in F1 with Force India – but while he and team mate Perez scored consistently to help the team finish a superb fourth, they also gave their bosses some big headaches with multiple clashes on track. ""It was a lot of pressure,"" says Ocon.

""I was racing against someone who was very experienced, he was a consistent scorer in the midfield, probably the most consistency. I started on the backfoot in the first race but I caught up well and then we were racing very closely. There were moments where I did mistakes, there were moments when I don't feel it was necessarily my fault.""

He adds: ""I was very young, I was inexperienced, I wanted to push hard and show people I what I was capable off. At the time we were just racing hard and trying to race as best we can, and that's also why we got so many points that year because we were racing very well together.""

""These kinds of moments shouldn't have happened. It cost the team points. I've made mistakes over my career, and thing I shouldn't have done in racing, but that's how you learn from it. We all make mistakes but it's how you overcome those. That's the way I saw racing back then, the track was what matters the most.

""Still I believe the track is what matters the most, but things could have happened in a different way. With how much respect I had for Checo at the time, and I still have now, I would have preferred things to go in a different way. We finished with a very good championship position for the team with P4, and a top 10 finish in my first full season. It was solid.""

After a year on the bench working as a reserve for Mercedes, Ocon reclaimed his spot on the grid with Renault – which ultimately became Alpine and yielded the machine that gave him his first, and as yet only, Grand Prix win. We downloaded the final lap of the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2021 when he triumphed onto a tablet so he could enjoy reliving it mid-interview.

""When I crossed the line, it meant the whole world to me, to all the people who were working so hard for it,"" he says, a beaming smile etched across his face – along with a few fist pumps in the air – while he watches. ""All we did through all my life was worth it just for that moment. It was a beautiful moment.""

Ocon spent five years with the Enstone-based team from 2020, but as he approached the end of that period, things started to get challenging and he began considering his future – and ultimately left the team one race early, missing the chance to complete 2024 in Abu Dhabi. ""At the beginning of 2024, and even at the end of 2023, it was clear the vision I had for the future and how we were moving forward with the team was not matching what I wanted,"" he says.

""I didn't want to let anyone down. I gave 120% every single time I was behind the wheel of that car. Unfortunately it didn't end up the way I wanted. I had prepared a special helmet for my last race, I had planned to go and visit the team, but I didn't get that option.""

Ocon started afresh at Haas last year, linking up with boss Ayao Komatsu who engineered him in his first-ever Formula 1 test when he did a session with Lotus - with his ambitions laser-focused on adding to his win tally and fighting for a championship in the future. ""The best option and how it was presented to me, was to go to Haas. Ayao is a very straightforward person. He has the biggest sense of competing that I have ever seen out of anyone. He doesn't want to lose.

""The way he presented me the straightforward plan, what he is going to build for the team, and what he has already built now. It was for me the best option. I want to be racing and winning in the future. I will give everything until I manage to secure what I want. And if I don't manage to win, I will have given everything, no regrets.""

Red Bull and Racing Bulls unveil new cars

How drivers will adapt in 2026

Their progress so far has been incredible, but Red Bull will head to the season opener having never run their power unit in a Grand Prix before. There's no doubt that they know the scale of the challenge that lies ahead of them.

Red Bull's powertrain project, in conjunction with American car giant Ford, had a lot of airtime during the Formula 1 team's impressive launch event in Detroit – and that's because it's a very big deal for the energy drinks firm.

Back in 2022, Red Bull took the step to create their own power unit facility from scratch after engine partner Honda, with whom they had enjoyed success, opted to withdraw from Formula 1 (before later deciding to return with Aston Martin in 2026).

Red Bull threw everything at the project, building a bespoke set-up on their Milton Keynes campus and recruiting heavily – including tempting several members of staff from Mercedes, who had enjoyed unprecedented success in the turbo-hybrid era.

Finn Wolfhard and Ben Marshall portrayed franchise characters Harry Potter and Ron Weasley who are opposing quidditch players who are wrapped up in a behind-the-scenes romance. 


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



Saturday Night Live took a moment to address the success of the gay hockey series Heated Rivalry, with wizardy twist. 


	The pre-taped sketch saw Finn Wolfhard and Ben Marshall step into the roles of Harry Potter characters Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, respectively. It appeared to be a bit playing on the upcoming HBO series based on the film franchise, but things quickly took a heated turn.




	“Coming soon to HBO, the beloved wizarding world of Harry Potter makes its television debut,” the sketch began with a voiceover before Wolfhard's Harry and Marshall's Ron crossed paths in a heated exchange on their first day at Hogwarts. “With an all new story hastily written after the success of a certain other HBO show…”

	“You dropped your wand. It's lovely, by the way” Marshall's Ron said. “I'd love to see yours sometime,” Wolfhard's Harry responded, with Ron adding, “You would.”


	Entitled Heated Wizardry, the bit went on to spotlight the two in a quidditch rivalry, instead of a hockey rivalry like the HBO show the sketch is based on, who are wrapped up in a behind-the-scenes romance. 


	The sketch featured a few raving reviews, with one not-so-approving fake quote from Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, which read, “I am not a part of this.” 


	In an even wilder turn of events, Jason Momoa made a surprise cameo to portray Rubeus Hagrid. Harry and Ron approached him to reveal their romance, but before they could share the news, Momoa's Hagrid cut him off, saying, “You're a homo, Harry.” 

	











	The Strangers Things star made his SNL host debut on Saturday, where he was joined by his former co-stars Caleb McLaughlin and Gaten Matarazzo during his monologue. There, they commemorated the end of the beloved Netflix series, as Wolfhard reminisced on growing up on the show.


	“I know a lot of people still see me as the kid from Stranger Things, right? But I'm 23 now, and I'm proud to officially announce that I am a man,” he said. “Meet the new me, the man me. Stranger Things is over, and I'm not a kid anymore,” Wolfhard continued, as McLaughlin and Matarazzo appeared, exclaiming, “And neither are we!”


	The Crave series, which airs on HBO Max in the United States, became a quick success, spotlighting the story of two professional hockey players who have been in a long-running situationship. Hudson Williams portrays Canadian Shane Hollander of the faux Montreal Metros, while Connor Storrie plays Russian-born Ilya Rozanov of the fictitious Boston Raiders. 


Heated Rivalry has been renewed for a second season by Crave, and it will continue to air on HBO Max.

“The moment we booked this interview, we made the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety,” CBS News said in a Saturday statement shared with The New York Times.


							By 

	McKinley Franklin



White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Tony Dokoupil and an executive producer of CBS Evening News that the president would “sue your ass off” if his Tuesday interview with the anchor was not aired in full, according to The New York Times. 


	After the interview was taped, Leavitt relayed a message from Trump to Dokoupil and CBS Evening News executive producer Kim Harvey. “He said, ‘Make sure you guys don't cut the tape, make sure the interview is out in full,'” Leavitt said, per a recording obtained by the Times.

	“Yeah, we're doing it, yeah,” Dokoupil responded, to which Leavitt added, “He said, ‘If it's not out in full, we'll sue your ass off.'”

	“Oh, great, OK!” Harvey replied according to the outlet, while Dokoupil, “in a light tone,” said, “He always says that!” The Times noted that Leavitt “did not laugh” at his reply. 


	In a statement, CBS News said they were always planning to air Dokoupil's full interview with President Trump. “The moment we booked this interview, we made the independent decision to air it unedited and in its entirety,” they said in a Saturday statement.


	Trump notably sued CBS, which was settled by parent company Paramount Global in a $16 million payout, over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. 

	











	His lawsuit against CBS claimed “deceptive doctoring” in Harris' 60 Minutes interview. Before the settlement, legal observers' predicted that the suit would be dismissed due to industry norms pertaining to interview editing. Sources told The Hollywood Reporter Paramount believed the lawsuit could deter Skydance's deal to acquire the company, which required regulatory approval, including the transfer of FCC licenses. The merger was later approved in August 2025.


	The network was also recently criticized for pulling a planned 60 Minutes report in December about the “brutal and tortuous conditions” at an El Salvador prison where the Trump administration had deported alleged illegal immigrants. CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss, who was slated into the role by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, defended the decision, claiming the story “was not ready.”


	“I held a 60 Minutes story because it was not ready,” she said in an editorial call on Dec. 22. “While the story presented powerful testimony of torture at CECOT, it did not advance the ball—the Times and other outlets have previously done similar work. The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment at this prison. To run a story on this subject two months later, we need to do more. And this is 60 Minutes. We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera. Our viewers come first. Not the listing schedule or anything else. That's my north star and I hope it's yours, too.” 

	











	In Dokoupil's CBS Evening News interview with Trump, the president said the anchor “wouldn't have a job” if he hadn't won the 2024 election. 


	“You wouldn't have this job, certainly, whatever the hell they're paying you. Our country is rocketing right now. If they got in, we would be Venezuela on steroids,” Trump said. Dokoupil later pushed back on his claims, noting, “I do think I'd have this job even if the other guys won.”


	“Yeah, but at a lesser salary,” Trump replied.

	Ed Sheeran is putting part of his Australia and New Zealand Loop Tour directly in the hands of fans.


	Ahead of the tour's opening night in Auckland, the singer-songwriter revealed that each show will include a live, fan-driven setlist element, with audiences invited to text in song requests that he will perform on the night.


	In an Instagram Story shared Thursday (Jan. 15), Sheeran explained that a phone number will appear on screens inside the venue before the show begins, allowing fans to submit the songs they want to hear. Those requests will be tallied in real time, with the most popular picks making it into the set.

	“So tomorrow, if you are at the gig, there will be a big thing on the screen before it begins where it will say ‘text in song recommendations,'” Sheeran said.


	“There's five slots in the gig where I'll play any song that you guys decide.”


	The singer added that the selections aren't limited to current hits or recent releases, and that he plans to prepare whatever fans vote for ahead of showtime.


	“So whatever song you wanna hear at the gig, go look at the screen, text it, and it'll basically tally up the songs, and I will play those songs, whatever the song is,” he said.


	“I will learn it before the show. So, surprise me and see you tomorrow.”


	Sheeran's Loop Tour kicks off with two shows at Auckland's Go Media Stadium, followed by dates in Wellington and Christchurch before crossing to Australia later this month.

	











	The Australian leg opens with back-to-back shows at Perth's Optus Stadium on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1, before continuing to Sydney's Accor Stadium (Feb. 13–15), Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium (Feb. 20–22), Melbourne's Marvel Stadium (Feb. 26–28), and wrapping up at Adelaide Oval on March 5.


	The tour supports Sheeran's latest album, Play, which features the singles “Azizam,” “Sapphire,” and “Old Phone.” Across the run, Sheeran is joined by special guests Vance Joy and Mia Wray on all dates, with BIIRD appearing on New Zealand and Perth shows, and Aaron Rowe supporting in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Adelaide.


	Tickets for the Loop Tour are on sale now via Frontier Touring.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


Zootopia 2 is now the highest grossing MPA title with $1.703 billion at the global box office, surpassing Disney‘s Inside Out 2 ($1.69B). Overall, the Jared Bush and Byron Howard directed animated movie is the 9th highest grossing movie ever at the global box office, and also passes 2019's The Lion King ($1.663B), Jurassic World at ($1.672B). The Zootopia 2 franchise counts a running cume of $2.7 billion. 


Zootopia 2 reaches this milestone in its eighth weekend with a running total of $390M domestic, and $1.3B abroad.  


	China Ne Zha 2 remains the highest grossing animated movie ever worldwide with $2.2B.

	Hollywood likes to cry a river about how China no longer works for them at the box office, but for Zootopia 2, the market is king with $618.9M; the highest MPA animated release of all-time there, as well as ten markets including France ($71.7M). Zootopia 2 clicked in China for myriad reasons: the whole notion of the luck of the rabbit, and the franchise's popularity at the parks. The sequel remained the No. 1 movie over the weekend in Japan and China. Japan's running cume is $83M. The sequel is also the highest grossing Walt Disney Animated release of all-time in 26 markets including China, France and Mexico.

	Other benchmarks for Zootopia 2: It's the No. 1 global MPA release of 2025, as well as the No. 1 international MPA title release of last year.  Walt Disney Studios owns the top three animated MPA releases with Zootopia 2, Inside Out 2, and Frozen 2.


Zootopia 2 is also the fastest MPA animated title, and PG-rated to hit $1B at the global box office. 


	The sequel opened over the Thanksgiving stretch (Nov. 26, 2025) to a record-breaking $559.5 million in five days, becoming the highest global animated opening of all time, the highest global debut of 2025, and the highest global opening for any animated film in Disney history.

	Academy Award-winning actress Melissa Leo is reflecting on the accolade she received for her supporting role in the 2010 David O. Russell boxing biopic The Fighter, saying it was detrimental to her professional and personal life.


	In a Q&A published in The Guardian, the Frozen River star answered fan-submitted questions, including one about her 2011 Oscar triumph.


	“One loses one's mind,” she said. “I had won a lot of prestigious awards for The Fighter that season, and sat in that great gigantic theatre thinking: ‘Well, it certainly is possible.' Kirk Douglas came out to present the best supporting actress award, opened the envelope and called my name. I was so delighted to meet him — that was all I was thinking about.”

	She continued, describing the scene: “I turned to the house, which in most theaters, you can see by looking a little above your own eyesight. In the Dolby Theatre, you have to raise your chin like you're about to scale Mount Everest. Every single actor, director and producer you recognize, is staring you in the face. I then cursed, and I'm still sorry I cursed. I fucking curse all the time, but you cannot curse on network television. Thank God for the 10-second delay, which was introduced for fucking idiots like me. Having said that, winning an Oscar has not been good for me or my career. I didn't dream of it, I never wanted it, and I had a much better career before I won.”




			Watch on Deadline		







The Fighter centers on the life of pro boxer Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), who is managed by his mother Alice (Leo) and trained by his older half-brother/former boxer Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale).


	Of the role, Leo said, “I accepted because David really, really wanted me to be his Alice. Then I met the real Alice Ward, who came from a very different socioeconomic background than my mother's mother, but there was something of my mother's mother in her, so that's where I found a path towards becoming her. I was no more than 10 years older than the majority of the nine people who played Alice's children, but that's movies for you.”

	











	Leo — who is also known for her roles in Denis Villeneuve's Prisoners, The Equalizer franchise, Oliver Stone's Snowden and the HBO series I Know This Much Is True — added in her responses that she's “happy to play what I'm offered — apart from after The Fighter, when all I was offered was older, nasty women. I don't want to do that any more.”

i get she isnt hollywood norm, and she has proven to go against the standard and came out on top while the industry laughed..

she is more in touch wioth her base or the people who would enjoy her films,

The swearing didn't help, but it wasn't the only unwise thing she did that season: she also publically criticized her director and, when she felt the movie's Oscar campaign wasn't focusing enough on her (the distributor was campaigning equally for her and Amy Adams in the category), she went rogue and put out her own “Consider…” ads.

I feel sorry for her if she has regrets and feels her career hasn't been what it could have, but she's not telling the full story and I especially don't buy the “I never wanted it” part.

Didn't she paid for her own FYV ads in trades? lol

An actress that complains about winning an Oscar – mindboggling.

I remember this. She turned ALOT of people off with how hard she campaigned. So to say she never wanted it is a straight up lie. She did any and everything to get that award. You can read articles about it from the time. How off putting people found it. She was aggressive in her campaigning.

Finn Wolfhard is ready to take on “adult films” after the conclusion of Netflix phenomenon Stranger Things, the actor joked during his Saturday Night Live opening monologue, which was crashed by co-stars and friends Gaten Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin.


	“I gotta tell you: It feels so amazing that 400 million people got to watch me go through puberty. What a dream,” he quipped during the beginning of his opener.


	The inaugural host said he experienced many firsts on camera while filming the Duffer Brothers' fantasy drama series — from his first kiss to the first time his voice changed, as well as “the first time I learned what a woman looked like down there.” A clip of the show then played, as a young Mike Wheeler reacted to a Demogorgon's head opening up.

	











	“I am a man,” the 23 year old announced as a jazzy instrumental played in the background. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	After cracking some obligatory jokes about his sparse facial hair and doing a spit-take of whiskey, he declared, “Stranger Things is over, and I'm not a kid anymore.”


	“And neither are we!” chimed in Matarazzo and McLaughlin as they popped up on the Studio 8H stage.


	“Any time you read ‘former child star' in a headline, it can only mean good things,” Matarazzo joked, as McLaughlin sarcastically thanked viewers for relentlessly posting about “our changing faces and bodies” on social media.


	You can watch the monologue above. 


	Later on in the evening, the Lorne Michaels-helmed sketch show spoofed the show itself, skewering audiences who believed a secret ninth episode would be dropping on the streamer. In the pre-taped sketch, the Stranger Things universe sprawled numerous '90s-era-inspired spinoffs, including “Strangerous Minds” featuring Steve Harrington as a teacher; and “Mike in Manhattan,” a Sex and the City-esque series. In “The Wheeler Report,” Nancy Wheeler reports on the O.J. Simpson chase. And, in another spoof, the entire Stranger Things story is retold through the perspective of an “insignificant character”: Mike Wheeler's dad, played by Mikey Day. Meanwhile, Will Byers doesn't receive a spinoff because his coming out scene is still ongoing. In a kicker, Kenan Thompson plays Eleven, donning a hospital gown and wielding an Eggo waffle.

	Before Ben Affleck became a two-time Oscar-winning industry heavyweight, an early career role taught him the importance of the worker's inalienable right to call off sick from work.


	While promoting his latest film and collaboration with Matt Damon, Netflix's The Rip, the multi-hyphenate recalled shooting a key Armageddon scene opposite star Bruce Willis while extremely ill.


	“When we shot that scene, I had food poisoning,” he told Fox 32 Chicago's Jake Hamilton in a recent interview. “And I wasn't an experienced enough actor at that point to know that you can just pick up the phone and be like, ‘I'm too sick to work today.' I was like, ‘I better come in.' And I went in there, and I was literally — it's the only time it's ever happened in my life — vomiting between takes.”

	“They had a garbage can and I was [mimics hurling]. And it probably made the scene better,” he continued with a laugh, adding that he didn't choose to persevere out of perceived “martyrdom” or extreme dedication to the 1998 film's emotional farewell sequence. (The heartrending denouement sees Willis' Harry sacrifice himself to detonate the earth-ending asteroid so that Affleck's A.J. can build a life with his daughter, played by Liv Tyler.)




			Watch on Deadline		







	Affleck reminisced on the disaster film, which granted him the opportunity to work with Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson and Willis, whom he described as being “really nice to everybody.”


	“I actually saw Steve Buscemi last night at the premiere for The Rip, and we were reminiscing about that movie and saying about how that was the weirdest, kind of wonderful, strange, otherworldly movie experience,” the Gone Girl actor said.

	











Armageddon — directed by Michael Bay, produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and co-written by Tony Gilroy and J.J. Abrams (among others) — went on to become the highest-grossing film of 1998.

It was cute. But Story line was even more stupid then the F1 movie. refuling the space shuttles at a russian space station, to start with.

Saw it the theater after the X-Files movie and it was one the best movie going experiences ever. One of the most fun action movies of the 90s and that farewell scene with Bruce hit hard.

One of the best movies …

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


Saturday Night Live returned with a cold open once again featuring Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson), this time boasting along with Vice President JD Vance and his cabinet members about his latest moves, furthering his presidential authoritarianism. 


	The skit was pretty standard for SNL, with Trump at a lectern at the White House addressing the country. It also was not a surprise for the show, given all that has happened since the holiday break: the ICE occupation of Minneapolis, the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and the threats to Greenland.


	At one point in the skit, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem (Ashley Padilla) said, “Obviously there's been clashes on both sides in Minneapolis. And have we been perfect? Yes.”

	











	“And I know a lot of people looking at the situation in Minnesota are wondering the same thing: Can I join ICE? Well, let me ask you, is your neck wider than your head? Are you currently wearing a Punisher T-shirt? Have you ever punched a hole in the wall because your son took a dance class? If the answer is yes, then grab a gun, any gun, and settle up big boy.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Trump then said, “Well, now that we're heard from my Secretary of War on America, let's go ahead and bring out our Secretary of War with the world.”


	Colin Jost returned as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, trying to please the boss with unending “tough guy” posturing as if he were a WWF fighter. But it doesn't quite work when Hegseth takes out a kettle bell, and lurches it back and forth between his crotch.


	“That was great buddy, even I know you're doing that wrong,” Johnson's Trump told him.


	As is typical, the skit featured real-life Trump moments that easily made the transition to SNL satire, like POTUS savoring “someone else's Nobel Prize.” At another moment, while Vance (Jeremy Culhane) is speaking, Trump wanders off to look out a window. “I see a cardinal and a blue jay in the same tree,” Trump told him. In reality, Trump did wander off look out a White House window during a meeting with oil executives, as he marveled at the construction site for his new ballroom.

	











	Also returning was Marcello Hernandez as Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He is asked to say a few words “to the people of Cuba,” a next potential U.S. military target. But he gave remarks in Spanish, irritating Trump. “No, no. no not in here big guy. I didn't like that at all. You're driving in the wrong direction, honey.”


	The skit ended with Trump blurting out that “midterms are canceled.” In reality, Trump suggested such a possibility in an interview with Reuters, a comment that Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said was a joke. In the havoc of Trump 2.0, it's harder and harder to tell the difference.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pagesix.com","Keith Urban moves in with new girlfriend after Nicole Kidman divorce: report","https://pagesix.com/2026/01/17/celebrity-news/keith-urban-moves-in-with-new-girlfriend/","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 00:09:00 GMT","

Keith Urban has reportedly moved in with a new girlfriend following his high profile divorce from Nicole Kidman. 

“I hear he [Urban] has someone, which is why the girls are publicly supporting Mom,” a source told the Daily Mail in comments published on Saturday — referencing the former couples' daughters, Sunday, 17, and Faith, 15. 

“People think they are even living together,” they added. “Look, teen girls love their dads, so there's a reason they're making it three against one.”

The source further noted the former power couples' daughters have had a more prominent role in the Oscar winner's social media accounts.

“Since the split, you are seeing her and the girls all the time, on her social media and in other photos,” the insider added. 

“They were with her in Paris and in Sydney. She posted pictures of them all taking part in a ‘turkey trot' running race on Thanksgiving which is really unusual, she's generally more private than that.”

“Each time you see them they are linking arms or holding hands. It looks ‘us against the world,'” they explained. 

Meanwhile Urban — who was married to the “Big Little Lies” star, 58, for 19 years before their shocking split over the summer — is said to be working on a breakup album in Nashville, where he's reportedly renovating a music studio in Music Row.

The outlet reported that the album “might be an uncomfortable retelling of the unravelling of their love story.” 

According to the Daily Mail, “everyone is adamant” that Urban, 58, is involved with someone new, and that it's “serious” — speculation about Urban's current girlfriend is centered on country star Karley Scott Collins, 26.

The outlet noted that “there is no suggestion they had an affair.” 

Reps for Urban and Collins did not immediately return Page Six's request for comment on Saturday.

Kidman and Urban finalized their divorce earlier this month following nearly two decades of marriage, with Urban earning the right to “every other weekend” with Faith and Sunday, and the “Babygirl” actress having them for the remaining 306 days of the year. 

The former couple waived spousal and child support in the matter.

Kidman was previously married to Tom Cruise — with whom she shares grown children Bella, 33, and Connor, 31 — from 1990 to 2001.

Page Six confirmed last September that the “Eyes Wide Shut” star and Urban were separating after 19 years of marriage.

“Sometimes relationships just run their course,” a source told us at the time, noting that the actress “did not want the separation and was trying to save things.”

The famous duo reportedly had been living apart since the beginning of summer 2025, and subsequent rumors that Urban was involved with guitarist Maggie Baugh were shut down by a friend who called them “absolutely not true.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Finn Wolfhard brings a small army of backup to his Saturday Night Live hosting debut","https://www.avclub.com/saturday-night-live-recap-season-51-episode-10","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 08:00:17 GMT","

A lot of performers make some noise about being nervous over the prospect of hosting an episode of Saturday Night Live, and while it wouldn't be fair to call these claims broadly disingenuous, some are easier to believe than others. Any confessions of nerves from Finn Wolfhard strike me as eminently plausible. He seems to be interested in the show, given that two of his highest-profile movie roles have been in the Jason Reitman orbit of two Ghostbusters revival sequels and an actual SNL docudrama, and though he has experience performing music live, he's young enough to still register as vaguely inexperienced (or at least maybe kind of a limited actor?) outside of the Stranger Things universe. There's plenty of reason to think it would mean a lot to him if his hosting gig, the first of 2026, went well.

Wolfhard certainly made for an endearing host out of the gate, goofing on himself and the very slight aging of his fresh kid-actor face in the monologue, but his first appearance on the episode also set an immediate pattern of calling for back-up: It featured Stranger Things co-stars Galen Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin, who later turned up a second time for a proper parody of their show and shared the episode by fellow cameos Sabrina Carpenter and musical guest A$AP Rocky in the Snack Homiez sketch, plus Jason Momoa incongruously jumping aboard a Harry Potter bit. In aggregate, it all feels like what the show would do to pad out a sports star who has to uneasily play himself in most of the sketches.

I don't mean to sell any of those cameos short by laundry-listing through them like that. Seeing the Stranger boys do a Sex And The City riff was cute, and I genuinely love that Sabrina Carpenter was down enough with the Snack Homiez to join the ranks of SNL hosts with their own recurring characters. (Her schedule may not permit it, especially if SNL has to split her sktech-comedy time with their old felt nemeses The Muppets, but doesn't it seem like she has to come back every time they do it now?) The sketch-comedy traditionalists tend to hate the big guest appearances, but c'mon, let the Wolfhard boy bring his friends! And also Jason Momoa! Still, as fun as this stuff was in the moment, it did add up to a pervasive sense of lightening the load for the host.



Snack Homiez is the perfect example: When that sketch grabbed the leadoff position for its second appearance, I thought, oh, right, of course, perfect place to put an actor who (despite having grown up on camera) still reads as young and might be self-conscious about it. But there wasn't all that much room for Wolfhard to dive into the group dynamic there, with Carpenter hitting the ground running and A$AP Rocky turning up for the guest spot. (Much as I enjoyed his musical performances tonight—and his work in Highest 2 Lowest, for that matter—he was probably one element too many in this sketch.)

As for the sketches that did lean more heavily on Wolfhard, he fared the best in a deeply silly sci-if-show sketch (lots of fake-streamer pretenses in this week's bits, huh?) where a toady (Mikey Day) insistently feeds an intergalactic ruler (Wolfhard) exotic space snacks, distracting from his imperious menacing. The organic physical comedy gave the scene an unpredictable looseness that made up for the fact that it had no discernible ending. I'm all for the idea that comedy sketches can weasel out of punchline-y “proper” endings (Monty Python did this all the time!) but it's probably best to find a better joke to exit on than one as mild as another guy volunteering to eat what the imperious ruler has rejected.



Even so, it was a home run compared to another sound premise sketch with arguably even better performances, where Wolfhard played a son confessing to his parents (Ashley Padilla and James Austin Johnson) that he wants to tour with his indie band rather than follow in his dad's pop-star footsteps. Johnson and Padilla are probably the two best pure sketch actors in this cast, and they were hitting all of their marks, taking everything perfectly seriously; Wolfhard didn't recess from the scene so much as fail to heighten as far as his co-stars, including the additional cast members stepping in as Johnson's fellow boy-banders. An admittedly tall order for Wolfhard, granted, but for whatever reason, a reasonably well-written and quite well-performed sketch seemed to more or less die in the room.

Sometimes that's more an indictment of the audience than the show, but I do wonder if in this case the muted reaction exacerbated by timing broader than the mere matter of Wolfhard syncing up with his scene partners. The outdatedness of Backstreet-style boy bands was part of the joke of Johnson and company's shtick—love the characterization of those acts' dominance as “the year and a half before 9/11”—yet the whole sketch felt like existed out of time alongside it. Wolfhard's generic indie bandmates read more as mid-'90s alterna-rock (complete with obligatory Pixies influence), which of course warps the timeline further, although Jane Wickline's completion of the runner where boy-band members flirt with Padilla's character was aces.

The slight mustiness pervaded the episode, especially for one built around the still-young star of a current (albeit now finished) pop-culture phenom. Elaborate Harry Potter sex jokes? Riffing on 2018's Free Solo? Still having no idea how to parody J.D. Vance? What year is this?! This installment still managed to get by on broad charm, two engaging A$AP Rocky numbers, and keeping the worst stuff to a minimum. But if the idea was to propel Finn Wolfhard out of the Stranger Things promo tour, he might need a little more assistance to make that happen.

If Snack Homiez is going to be a three-times-a-season recurring bit from now until Chloe Fineman leaves the show (so… somewhere between four and sixteen months?), I'm good with that. The show can use a youth-culture-spoofing hangout sketch, even if skews a little closer to Jarret's Room than Wayne's World. Also, the sci-fi sketch was exactly the kind of pushy ridiculousness that Mikey Day does especially well.



Look, Veronika Slowikowska has an energy about her that seems very right for SNL. But her showcase this week as a girlfriend who goes into grotesque overdrive trying to be one of the guys was so aggressively one-note. Points for the complexity of that note: overfamiliar in the broad strokes, yet distended enough by her distinctive vocal style to not really play as a classic high-concept run-through. It felt like a belated audition in the worst way.

For the show's first post-Bowen Yang outing, no one really stepped up. Naturally, cast veteran Mikey Day jumped in. He may have almost broken in both sketches where he was heavily featured, but he got to be the weirdo and the straight man in quick succession.

Teyana Taylor is this season's designated Oscar-season get (unless Jessie Buckley makes it a double in March, closer to her likely victory and/or the release of The Bride!). Because the show has zero women of color in the cast, she will also be the first non-white woman performing in any sketches for Season 51! So that's kind of a bummer! I also see that I have one (1) week to get on board with Geese or risk sounding monumentally old. I bought their album (like I said: old) and I'm not feeling it, guys!

Hallmark Channel is known for its hunky leading men, delivering a lethal on-screen combination of washboard abs, chiseled jawlines, and puppy dog eyes. But believe it or not, the network's top actors don't spend all of their downtime at the gym or memorizing lines. 

Some Hallmark hunks are also amazing visual artists, periodically sharing another side of their creativity, from painting to woodworking to photography. Here are six of our favorites! 

Incredibly, Hallmark has three very accomplished and talented woodworkers among its most popular actors. “Catch of the Day” star Michael Rady, who's been with the network since 2016's “Christmas at Homestead,” kicked off 2026 by sharing a new project he's working on. 

Rady periodically posts videos from his expansive wood shop in Connecticut, on the property where he and his wife Rachel have lived with their kids for more than eight years. In late 2025, Rady shared much of the process of creating a gorgeous round table, posting the final result on November 2. 

Fellow Hallmark star Kristoffer Polaha commented on the post, sharing that he built a kitchen table during the pandemic that can be passed down for generations. Rady sweetly replied, “A kitchen table is a special thing … It is one of the things I'm most proud of, when someone asks me to make them one. To help create the place where SO much of their life -little moments, big moments- will unfold.”

Luke Macfarlane is so passionate about woodworking that he starred in Hallmark's 2025 unscripted series “Home Is Where the Heart Is,” available to stream on Hallmark+. The longtime Hallmark hunk, who co-stars with Rachael Leigh Cook in “Caught By Love” on January 24, teamed up with interior designer Olivia Westbrook on the show to transform families' spaces with a whole lot of heart. In his limited spare time, Macfarlane has shared some of his woodworking projects on social media, including building his daughter's crib. 

In 2022, Macfarlane told Story+Rain that his dad initially taught him the craft and then he took classes once he moved to California to act, recalling, “I started working with a woodworking teacher down in Anaheim. Between gigs, I would drive down, and this teacher, William Ng, showed me how to take my work to the next level, to get into furniture design, building, and joinery. That really led me to a next level of woodworking.” 

Meanwhile, busy “Three Wisest Men” actor and screenwriter Paul Campbell also has a rich background as a woodworker. Some of his older projects are showcased on his website, from skateboards to a playhouse. 

“The Chicken Sisters” star Ektor Rivera is an accomplished painter whose art is sought after by collectors and celebrities. According to his website, in 2023, renowned playwright and actor Lin-Manuel Miranda, along with his father, commissioned Rivera to create a giant oil and acrylic painting as part of a “living tribute” to legendary actress Rita Moreno. Rivera shared photos in August 2025 of Moreno seeing the beautiful portrait up close for the first time, which brought her to tears. 

In September, Rivera was one of eight artists — all from different countries — whose paintings were featured in a Los Angeles art show called “Unbordered.” His art has become so popular that he runs a separate Instagram page dedicated to sharing what he creates. 

When Ryan Paevey took a break from acting in 2024, much to the chagrin of his Hallmark fans, he spent time reflecting, surfing, and focusing on his jewelry business, Fortunate Wanderer. The “Two Tickets to Paradise” star periodically hosts pop-up sales of his rings and bracelets, which he melts, shapes, hammers, and polishes, often incorporating raw stones or beautiful beads. 

While there are a few items still available on the site, Paevey's next collection will drop in the spring of 2026. And though he has not made a Hallmark movie since 2023's “Under the Christmas Sky,” Paevey did announce his return to “General Hospital” in August. 

Longtime Hallmark star Victor Webster told EntertainmentNow in June that he considers photography “just a hobby,” but it's clear he has quite a gift for it. The “Hannah Swensen Mysteries” star has an Instagram page dedicated to his photos, from intimate portraits (including several of “When Calls The Heart” stud Kevin McGarry) to stunning landscapes. 

Webster has a website where art lovers can purchase his photographs, taken on his travels around the world. They're available in collections devoted to topics like nature scenes, Americana, animals, and protests.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Melissa Gilbert & Timothy Busfield's Large Blended Family: Everything to Know About Their Children","https://entertainmentnow.com/hallmark/melissa-gilbert-timothy-busfield-children-family/","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 01:03:59 GMT","

“Little House on the Prairie” star Melissa Gilbert's husband, Timothy Busfield, is facing legal troubles, but she remains supportive, including releasing a statement about how she would be focusing on their family during this time. 

In her first statement since the news of Busfield's case, Gilbert's rep said: “During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment. Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.” But who is this “very large family” the Hallmark star refers to? This is everything you need to know about Gilbert and Busfield's blended family. 

Gilbert is a mom to two sons. She shares her first child, Dakota Brinkman, with her first husband, director Bo Brinkman. Dakota was born in May 1989. 

Gilbert became a mom for the second time when she and her second husband, actor Bruce Boxleitner, welcomed their son Michael Boxleitner in October 1995. Michael is named after Gilbert's late co-star, Michael Landon. He was born prematurely, at just 28 weeks, and he spent time in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). “He was only 3 lbs and had the courage of a lion,” Gilbert shared, People reports. “He'll be 21 soon but he will always, always be my Peeker McSqueek.”

The actress chose to raise her children away from the public eye, protecting their privacy. She has made rare posts on Instagram, although she has since deleted the platform amid Busfield's case. Gilbert is also a grandmother to her son Dakota's daughter, Ripley, People reports, and she refers to herself as “Nana.” 

Michael is an actor with credits including “FBI: Most Wanted.” He also made a statement in defense of his stepdad, whom he has known since he was a teenager. In court filings, he wrote, “Ever since we met, he has shown up for me as a father more in the 15 years l've known him than my own biological father ever has in the entirety of my life,” People reports. “He is kind, thoughtful, and carries himself with a stalwart integrity all of us could only ever hope to match.”

Busfield was also married twice before his marriage to Gilbert, and during that time, he welcomed three children. His firstborn is his son, Wilson Busfield, whom he shares with his ex-wife, Radha Delamarter. The couple were married from 1981 to 1986. In 1988, Busfield married his second wife, Jennifer Merwin, and the couple has two children, a son, Samuel, and a daughter, Daisy, Us Weekly reports. They divorced in 2007.

Wilson has followed in his father's footsteps into the entertainment industry, though his work has been mostly behind the scenes. Wilson has worked as a camera operator, cinematographer, writer, and director, Us Weekly reports. Much of his life is still unknown and has been kept private. Even less is known about his half-siblings, Samuel and Daisy. 

Daisy works as a freelance photo stylist, with a career that includes collaborations with major brands, Us Weelly reports.

Former “American Idol” judge Keith Urban's love life has been the topic of many headlines in the last few months. When Nicole Kidman, his wife of 19 years, filed for divorce on September 30, 2025, fans were shocked, and now there is a report about Urban dating someone new. Sources have revealed that Urban is dating Karley Scott Collins, Daily Mail reports. Here are 5 fast facts about her. 

The reports have not been confirmed, but sources revealed that Urban and Collins are in a relationship and it is “serious,” Daily Mail reports. Collins is 26, and “People think they are even living together,” the source said. “Look, teen girls love their dads, so there's a reason they're making it three against one.”

The source claims that this is why Urban's two daughters, Sunday Rose and Faith, appear to be publicly supporting Kidman during this difficult time. 

Collins has 62,000 followers on Instagram, and she is a rising country music star. Her Instagram bio reveals that her debut album, “Flight Risk,” is out. On May 21, 2025, Collins teased the release of her album for September that year. 

“The dream of putting out my first real record where I get to share the story of my life, loves + heartbreaks with you guys is one that has kept me up at night since I picked up a guitar when I was 11 years old,” she wrote in the caption. “It sort of feels like putting 16 little pieces of my heart back together in one place…this is my favorite announcement I've ever gotten to make, so thank you to everyone who's loved, listened to & related to my music the way you have up ‘til now and making this possible.”

Collins shared a stunning photo on Instagram on December 5, 2025, showing herself posing next to a motorcycle with a helmet in her hand. Fans flooded the comment section with fire emojis. 

Collins shared that she had completed her “number one bucket list thing” when she posted a video on Instagram on November 1, 2025, showing her shark-cage diving. The experience was with Great White sharks in Australia. In the caption, she shared her thoughts, writing, “this was my #1 bucket list thing for my whole life, I might still be in shock.”

On January 15, Collins took part in the viral social media trend of posting pictures from ten years ago. She shared several photos on Instagram from 2016 and, in the caption, revealed what had changed in her life and what had not. “2016… so much has changed, and yet so little has I drew on everything from my clothes to my arms (because people definitely thought a Sharpie looked like a real tattoo), my hair was about a foot longer (which I do miss), I wore some questionable outfits, and I always had a guitar in my hand. Spot the difference? Hahaha,” she wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Josh Allen Breaks Down in Tears After Heartbreaking Bills Playoff Exit","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/josh-allen-emotional-playoff-loss/","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 04:41:21 GMT","

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen did not try to hide his emotions after the season ended Saturday night. Following Buffalo's overtime loss to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Divisional Round, Allen broke down in tears during his postgame press conference, offering a rare and vulnerable moment from one of the NFL's biggest stars.

The clip spread quickly across social media, where fans, fellow athletes, and celebrities reacted not with mockery but with support. For many, the moment felt less like a sports headline and more like a reminder that even the most celebrated figures carry the weight of expectation, pressure, and disappointment.

Allen spoke candidly after the loss, taking responsibility for mistakes and expressing how deeply the outcome affected him. “I feel like I let the guys down,” Allen said, according to USA Today. His voice cracked as he described the bond he shares with his teammates and how much the season meant to him.

The Bills quarterback finished the game with strong numbers, throwing for more than 280 yards and accounting for multiple touchdowns. Still, turnovers played a key role in the loss, and Allen did not shy away from accountability. According to Sporting News, Allen emphasized that wins and losses start with him, a sentiment that resonated with fans and analysts alike.

Teammates echoed that support. Several Bills players later spoke about Allen's leadership and commitment, noting that his emotional response reflected how much he cares about the team and the city of Buffalo, as reported by Buffalo Rumblings.

While Allen's tears highlighted a difficult professional moment, they also revealed a softer, more personal side of an athlete who has increasingly crossed into pop culture territory. Allen is married to actor and singer Hailee Steinfeld, whose own career has long placed her in the entertainment spotlight.

Steinfeld, known for roles in films like “Pitch Perfect 2” and series such as “Hawkeye,” has spoken in past interviews about balancing public life with private support. Though she did not publicly comment on the loss, fans online praised the couple's ability to remain grounded amid constant attention.

Allen's emotional moment sparked renewed conversations about masculinity in sports and the importance of emotional openness, especially among high-profile figures whose lives often unfold in front of cameras. For entertainment audiences, the moment humanized a quarterback often defined by stats and strength.

The video of Allen wiping away tears did more than trend. It shifted the narrative from failure to empathy. In a media environment that often rewards stoicism, Allen's honesty stood out. It also aligned with a broader cultural shift where vulnerability is no longer seen as weakness, but as authenticity.

As the offseason begins, Allen will return to training, preparation, and the pursuit of another playoff run. For now, though, the image that lingers is not a throw or a fumble, but a man allowing himself to feel the magnitude of the moment.

9.0

Genre:

Rock

Label:

Island

Reviewed:

January 18, 2026

When Bob Marley died of cancer in May 1981, two of his most recent singles showed how far he'd come from the roots reggae that made him a global star. “Redemption Song” was a solemn, acoustic folk ballad, and “Could You Be Loved” was a glistening slice of reggae-tinged disco-pop that dialogued with Chic, Michael Jackson, and Diana Ross. Marley's hard-won stardom had come by softening his music for Western ears under the tutelage of Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, the white man who grew up in a tony Kingston suburb as the scion of generational wealth owing to his mother's imperial bloodlines.

Blackwell was a representative of what Marley dubbed the vampiric, westernized “Babylon System”—Marley's one-time bandmate Peter Tosh dubbed him “Chris Whiteworst”—but Marley had his eyes on the prize more than most of his Rasta contemporaries, deploying his bottomless charisma and canny songwriting abilities to reap significant financial benefits from that same crooked business. A Billboard article published the week of Marley's death illuminated the two sides of his public persona: It opened by noting that Marley would lie in state and receive Ethiopian Orthodox funeral services, before quoting a Warner Bros. representative complaining that the company's distribution centers had been “hard hit” by a Marley LP shortage in the wake of his passing.

The critic Evan Eisenberg wrote that “record listening is a séance where we get to choose our ghosts,” which rings especially true once a musician cannot record anymore. The final gift that a dead musician gives their listeners is the capacity to hear their music anew: to mourn, to celebrate, but also to narrativize. What is their legacy, now that they're finished releasing new music? Marley's level of fame and influence meant that, after his death at 36, his legacy, his spirit, his brand was to be shaped by a record industry that could be callously indifferent to truth or quality at the expense of revenue. Four months after his death, a handful of late 1960s recordings Marley and the Wailers cut for American soul singer Johnny Nash and his business partner, Danny Sims, were rushed out on a slapdash compilation, abysmally titled Chances Are–the first cash-in of many to come. Pulling no punches, Rolling Stone critic (and Marley biographer) Timothy White savaged Chances Are for its poor quality and exploitative proximity to Marley's death as “a tribute to unvarnished greed and maliciousness,” wishing “shame on anyone connected with it.”

In a press release, Blackwell also shamed Chances Are's poor curation and terrible mastering, but he too was plenty busy meeting the sudden demand for new and old Marley material. In 1982, Island's newly established video production subsidiary released a television documentary (also terribly titled: Caribbean Nights) that opened with footage of local laborers building Marley's humble mausoleum in his rural birthplace of St. Ann, and, for the first time, told his life story with participation from family, friends, and collaborators. At the other end of the spectrum, Island produced the low-budget 1982 film Countryman, plotted around the titular, nearly naked Jamaican bushman—Rasta gadabout Edwin Lothan—who outwits powerful enemies with his jungle-honed wiles. An instant cult classic of Caribbean Orientalism, the film ended with a solemn dedication to Marley, though its plot couldn't have been further from the singer's actual life or beliefs. Whatever: it had a great soundtrack, loaded with Marley's own music and cuts from reggae musicians Aswad, Dennis Brown, and Toots and the Maytals.

On the second anniversary of Marley's death, Island released Confrontation, the final album of unheard Marley material. It was promoted with “Buffalo Soldier,” a slick, uptempo single honoring the Black U.S. soldiers who fought for the U.S. after the Civil War—a natural fit for late-period Marley, who believed that the African diaspora was fighting the same battles. He likens the Black U.S. soldier to the “dreadlock Rasta,” both of whom were “stolen from Africa” and forced to labor under the yoke of imperial powers. “If you know your history,” Marley keens in the third verse, “then you would know where you're coming from.” But as White (among others) correctly noted in his best-selling 1983 Marley biography Catch a Fire, the U.S. used the Buffalo Soldiers as “part of a public relations move to justify and glorify the genocide of Native Americans,” and any irony that Marley intended in his lyrics was drowned out by the song's gaudy brass arrangement, evoking a stately medal ceremony. More depressingly, Marley had recorded and released several incredible songs about imperialist abuses of power during his short life, but a posthumously released track about formerly enslaved soldiers forcing Natives from their land became more popular than all of them.

Released into a rapidly changing musical landscape, “Buffalo Soldier” shared the airwaves with a glut of Caribbean-indebted new wave that was thriving in the wake of Marley's island revolution. Culture Club, Men at Work, Madness, the Police, the English Beat, Blondie, and others proved that reggae and ska could attract U.S. radio listeners and MTV viewers—as long as attractive, fashionable young white people were the most visible part of the promotion. Unlike most FM radio programmers, however, the upstart MTV included reggae as part of its notoriously segregated format: “We are going after a rock audience. We play Bob Marley and Peter Tosh,” crowed an executive at a late-1981 music conference, pushing back on the racism claim while admitting that so-called “third world” authenticity was one of the few avenues for Black artists to get on MTV's air. Blackwell duly commissioned a music video for “Buffalo Soldier,” and the results were as embarrassing for Marley's legacy as Chances Are: Rastas dressed as 19th-century U.S. grunts puff ganja while fighting an unseen enemy in a generic wilderness. Intercut with unrelated footage of Marley himself at a studio mixing board, the video tacitly conveys his approval of an amateurish skit.

In 1984, with Marley's musical legacy still largely underaddressed, Island finally met the demand with Legend: The Best of Bob Marley and the Wailers, a compilation culled from Marley's time on the label, including “Soldier,” “Redemption Song,” “Could You Be Loved” and 11 others, focusing on the catchy UK hits from the latter half of his career. In the U.S., Legend initially peaked at No. 54, accurately reflecting Marley's inability to sell albums stateside (his biggest-selling U.S. LP, 1976's Rastaman Vibration, wasn't certified gold until 1996). It took a while for Legend' to find its initial audience–itreached platinum by 1988–but during the 1990s, it kept selling and selling, averaging nearly a million copies per year. By the turn of the century, Legend was certified diamond, commemorating the rare achievement of 10 million copies sold.

This was due, in part, to the compact disc's arrival: When millions started replacing their cassettes and donating their vinyl records, a single CD standing in for “reggae” was an efficient investment. A much bigger hit across the Atlantic, Legend stayed on the UK albums chart for longer than any other album, save the greatest-hits comps from Queen and ABBA. By the end of 2024, Legend had sold more than 18 million copies, the sixteenth highest count for any album. Critic Michaelangelo Matos called Legend “the Kind of Blue of reggae—the one album of its type that everyone owns,” and indeed, if you play it for a music fan of a certain age, odds are that they'll express their love for its simple beauty, yawn at its omnipresence, or complain that “Concrete Jungle” and “Natural Mystic” aren't on there. Legend's most widely-known songs—“One Love,” “Three Little Birds,” “No Woman, No Cry,” “Jammin'”—are simple, catchy, optimistic standards that have become part of the global vernacular, and “Get Up, Stand Up” became the de facto anthem of Amnesty International, subject to periodic superstar sing-alongs. More than four decades later, Legend still serves as a synecdoche for all reggae. At the end of 2025, Billboard's year-end reggae chart was once again topped by Legend, while no albums released that year made the cut.

Legend's sales numbers and cultural influence were buoyed by a new perceptual shift that sedimented during the 1990s: After the thawing of the Cold War, a relentlessly marketed new worldview posited, we now lived in a cosmopolitan global village, one that was knit together by satellite and internet linkups, powered by deregulated markets, soundtracked by exoticized musicians who'd never seen the spotlight before, and sold with the multi-culti vibe of a Benetton ad. The record business led the way: the year after Legend's release came “We Are the World,” Live Aid, and Artists United Against Apartheid, reactivating the rock charity spectacle to feed starving Ethiopians and illuminate the horrors of South African apartheid.

The year after that, Paul Simon's Graceland and Peter Gabriel's So demonstrated the aesthetic and discursive value of apolitically integrating South African and Senegalese musicians into rock albums, laying a path that David Byrne took to Latin and South America for his 1989 album Rei Momo. After Billboard debuted its World Albums chart in May 1990, anything pop or rock-oriented that didn't derive from North America or Western Europe fell under the umbrella of “world music,” and artists like Youssou N'Dour, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and Ziggy Marley & the Melody Makers (featuring a few of Marley's children) found wide audiences on their own merits. Predicting this moment of a globally empathetic, mildly progressive record industry was Legend, the modest compilation that was also the era's biggest beneficiary.

“No one in rock'n'roll has left a legacy that matters more, or one that matters in such fundamental ways,” wrote Rolling Stone critic Robert Palmer upon Marley's 1994 induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Though Marley explicitly foreswore what he called “politricks” and pledged support only to his fellow Rastafarians, few musicians have ever woven themselves so deeply into their nation's political sphere, and no other could remotely touch Marley's global popularity. Through his music, he communicated with the Jamaican poor and working class with a depth that politicians couldn't touch. Jamaican radio stations were reportedly loath to play his music in favor of more respectable representations of their local culture, but Democratic Socialist Prime Minister Michael Manley wedged himself into Marley's 1976 “Smile Jamaica” benefit concert, and scheduled the country's elections for 10 days later to ride the wave of public relations.

Though Marlon James' sprawling 2014 novel A Brief History of Seven Killings is a fictionalized account of Marley's attempted murder the night before that concert, it's rooted in Marley's symbolic position in Cold War battles over Caribbean politics that—like all stories about CIA interventionism—toe the line between outlandish and “of course.” In exile in London for his safety, Marley titled his next album Exodus, and later translated his survival into a living musical myth. Marley's return to Jamaica in 1978—brokered by party-affiliated local gang leaders—was the island's biggest arrival since Haile Selassie's 1966 visit, and he brought the opposing parties together in a symbolic display of unity during the epochal “One Love” concert that followed. In the years before his death, Marley became an unofficial ambassador for Pan-Africanist freedom movements, culminating with a performance at the official ceremony declaring Zimbabwe's independence in 1980.

You'll learn little of this listening to Legend, which essentially replaces Marley's politics and the religious beliefs that inspired them with the easier-to-swallow rags-to-riches story told in the compilation's liner notes. This was by design. Marley's reintroduction to the world was guided by Island executive Dave Robinson, whose goal was clear from the start: “My vision of Bob from a marketing point of view was to sell him to the white world,” and “stay out of the more political songs,” he explained. Mission accomplished. According to Blackwell, Robinson even insisted on keeping the word “reggae” out of the album's marketing, because consumer research reported an aversion among the buying public to the term's association with red-eyed Rastas chanting about revolution. The version of Marley's ghost most amenable to the global marketplace is the one on the cover of Legend: a handsome, pensive Black singer-songwriter, not the class-conscious roots activist who recorded “Burnin' & Lootin',” “Slave Driver,” “War,” “Talkin' Blues” and “Them Belly Full (But We Hungry).” Legend's reinvention of Marley, to one critic, “magically crossed over all national and racial boundaries with a pluralist vision of ‘one love' that legitimated the national narrative of a multicultural America.”

Tracking “One Love”—the song and the sentiment—across the 20 years from its first recording to its opening Side B of Legend reveals much about Marley's ascent from rude boy to global superstar. The song was originally cut in 1965 by the Wailing Wailers—Marley, Tosh, and Bunny Livingston—belting spirited but amateurish three-part harmony over a hopscotching ska rhythm recorded by local impresario Coxsone Dodd on his two-track board. Marley's lyrics, yet to be influenced by Rastafarianism, sampled and tweaked Curtis Mayfield's epochal “People Get Ready,” released the same year and soon adopted by Martin Luther King, Jr. as the U.S. civil rights movement's unofficial anthem. While Mayfield was slightly exclusionary regarding who could board the forthcoming train to salvation—“There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner/Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own” is obliquely addressed to the racist political infrastructure of the U.S. south—Marley leaves salvation an open question, asking, “Is there a place for the hopeless sinner?”

Fast-forward to 1977, Marley is holed up in a four-story flat on Oakley Street in Chelsea, working on Exodus, listening to the Clash and the Damned, and spending his downtime with the reigning Miss World Cindy Breakspeare. Marley re-cut “One Love” with Blackwell in a posh London studio, slowed by a third and guided by Tyrone Downie's glimmering piano and backing vocals by the I-Threes: Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Rita Marley. Marley was famous now, and Blackwell insisted that the song, which closed Exodus, be subtitled “People Get Ready” to acknowledge co-authorship (and possibly avoid the courtroom). The re-recorded “One Love” wasn't issued as a single until Legend's release in 1984, promoted by a Don Letts music video that starred a dreadlocked biracial child, featured appearances from Madness, Bananarama, Aswad, Musical Youth, and Paul McCartney, and spliced in archival footage of Marley dancing with a multiracial group of children. Three years after his death, Letts and Island had effectively re-cast Marley as a benevolent father figure, spreading love to the world's young people. He was now the secular saint of “world music,” avant la lettre.

“One Love” has become Marley's “Give Peace a Chance” or “All You Need is Love,” a simple tune with a politically naive message that arose out of specific conditions before spiraling into eternal circulation. Marley was unrivaled at delivering catchy slogans, and the only protest song to appear on Legend, 1973's “Get Up, Stand Up,” is his best. Weaving Rasta grievance politics into the Black Power movement that had found many willing believers among the Caribbean underclass, “Get Up” expresses the Wailers' disdain for the standard-bearers of Jamaican Christianity, who'd refused to officially acknowledge their religious beliefs. More politically confrontational than Marley, Tosh castigates the “-ism schism” of religious division in a seething proto-rap in the song's third verse. The rest of the band, perhaps the most locked-in of the early 1970s, sounds flush with the thrill of introducing a genuinely new package of Black rhythm, image, and ideology from Kingston to the world.

Because “Get Up” is such a quintessential reggae tune—maybe the quintessential reggae tune—it's easy to forget the flourishing world of early-1970s Black and Latin rock that the Wailers were dialoguing with at the time. They weren't playing reggae, but what poet Linton Kwesi Johnson called “international reggae,” which broke from the more localized sounds of Kingston and London to lean into soul, R&B, and funk, courting the international rock market that had sent albums by War and Santana to No. 1 in 1973. The immediate context of the song was the religious economy of Jamaica, but it was cast in the mold of funky '70s art-soul: a Stevie Wonder-style clavinet weaves its way through the sulfurously funky, deep-pocket groove dug by drummer Carlton Barrett and his bassist brother Aston, while Marley pushes his threadbare smoker's rasp to its breaking point. Sharpening the hook from War's “Slippin' Into Darkness” for its chorus, “Get Up” also echoes the soulful calls to action of erstwhile Wailer tourmates Sly and the Family Stone, channels the sinister spirit beneath “Payback”-era James Brown, and dialogues with the funk-inspired Afrobeat of Nigerian bandleader Fela Kuti. Looking back, it's shocking that “Get Up” didn't hit more broadly in the U.S. during this moment, amid a loose coalition of funky Black rock bands (including Parliament/Funkadelic and the Isley Brothers) that would soon be programmed out of existence by record labels and radio executives who insisted that rock was a white person's format.

Speaking of which: In 1974, Marley and the Wailers hitched a ride into that other crossover lane: a famous white musician covering your song. Eric Clapton's wan take on “I Shot the Sheriff” introduced Marley to most of America, and once listeners started digging out the copies of Catch a Fire and Burnin' lingering on record store shelves, significantly raised his profile. Marley's original version was a take on the Marty Robbins-style gunfighter ballads that were so popular on the island in the 1950s and 1960s, mixed with a bit of the pseudo-mythmaking perfected by Dylan and Johnny Cash, its chorus sung in high, '60s-style harmonies by Tosh and Wailer. Marley swaggers through his imagined self-defense—unfurling “but they say it was a cap-i-tal oh-fense” like Muhammad Ali rapping at a crowded press conference.

Endless discussions about the lyrics' putative “reality” are feints: “Sheriff” instead mythologized the heated late 1960s ferment, in the U.S. and Jamaica alike, when many existentially threatened young Black men were—symbolically and literally—taking aim at authority figures. Five years earlier, Black Panther Party co-founder Huey Newton was convicted of killing a real cop (in self-defense) and injuring (but not killing) that cop's partner in an Oakland showdown that was witnessed by no one and instantly transformed into legend. The same year “Sheriff” was released as a single, Newton, whose conviction was overturned, released Revolutionary Suicide, covered with an image of the activist in full Panther regalia, sitting in a peacock chair holding a spear. While Clapton's version spoke directly to white AOR radio programmers, Marley's original was participating in a parallel conversation, with Newton, Ali, Angela Davis, Dick Gregory, and many other Black public figures in what the scholar Paul Gilroy dubbed the alternative public sphere of the Black diaspora.

Thanks to “I Shot the Sheriff” and the slow absorption of the 1972 Jamaican music biz/gangster flick The Harder They Come into American counterculture, reggae blew up in the U.S. Throughout 1975 and 1976, seemingly every newspaper and magazine sent reporters to Kingston, where Marley entertained their oft-oblivious questions while sitting on the hood of his BMW in the yard of his Hope Road compound, spouting Rasta theology, chain-smoking spliffs, and leaning hard into his Kingston dialect. Though Marley “could moderate the sometimes nigh-impenetrable patois enough to facilitate greater understanding,” speculated Lester Bangs in his Creem profile, “then he would not be so apparently the most prominent media front-man for the Rasta Revolution.” Regardless, Marley's music—especially in concert—spoke volumes: critics and musicians alike cite Marley and the Wailers' 1975 tour of the U.S. and UK as the moment that sealed them as the most exciting band in the world. Letts called the July 1975 Lyceum Theatre concert he attended “probably the single most exciting music moment of my life…the closest I ever got to a religious experience.” Future PiL bassist Jah Wobble cites Aston Barrett's bass playing during the show as a formative influence on his musical future. Veteran critic David Hepworth, who wrote a terrific book on the subject, said that the Lyceum show “anoint[ed] Bob Marley as the first rock star of the third world,” and he still rates it as the best concert he's ever seen. A year later, Marley was flinging his dreads on the cover of Rolling Stone.

Blackwell was moved to record the Lyceum shows—later released as the 1975 Live! album—after seeing the rapturous reception that a reworked “No Woman, No Cry” was generating from the Wailers' U.S. audiences during the Natty Dread tour. A semi-biographical origin story drawn from Marley's youth in the government yards of Trench Town that blossoms into a life-affirming chant for the global underclass, the LP version of “No Woman, No Cry” was lighter and faster than its live counterpart, incorporating a then-novel drum machine that dovetails the record with American soul experimentalism of the era, like Sly Stone on “Family Affair,” Timmy Thomas' “Why Can't We Live Together” and Shuggie Otis' “Aht Uh Mi Hed.”

In a live setting, however, Marley and his band were transforming “No Woman, No Cry” into soulful gospel-rock, drenched with Downie's solemn organ drones and the bluesy guitar of newly hired American player Al Anderson. Reviewing Live!, critic Robert Christgau admitted, “I used to think Natty Dread's ‘No Woman, No Cry' was definitive.” It's a fair bet that a majority of the nearly 20 million people who've purchased Legend, and the millions more who've heard the live version of “No Woman, No Cry” ambiently over the past several decades, haven't heard the original album cut. I first fell for Legend during freshman year of college, and was in my mid-twenties before I heard the original and the revelation was potent, though milder than the one that came with hearing Marley's “Talkin' Blues” lyric, “I feel like bombing a church/Now that you know that the preacher is lying” later on Natty Dread. Bob Marley sang that? “No Woman” sounded like this? What else am I missing with only Legend in my collection?

Actually, there are three versions of “No Woman, No Cry.” Statistically, there must be a handful of poor souls who know neither the Natty nor the Live! Version of “No Woman,” but the remix that mixer/engineer Eric “E.T.” Thorngren souped up to sound like a beer commercial, and which was included on the first run of Legend, before it was swapped out for the live cut. My U.S. vinyl copy contains the Thorngren version, though the back cover text and liner notes refer to the Live! version, suggesting that Robinson, Thorngren, and/or Blackwell had fairly immediate second thoughts. One of the vagaries of upstreaming regional rebel music to an international audience was the involvement of industry types like Robinson—who, before Island, helped launch the careers of reggae-curious white acts like Elvis Costello and Madness on his Stiff label—and Thorngren, a respected engineer-for-hire who met Blackwell while working on the Difford & Tilbrook album after Squeeze's breakup. Thorngren was a highly respected studio artist in his day, engineering a handful of classic Sugar Hill singles before working on Legend and Talking Heads' Little Creatures and True Stories after it, but his four remixes on the first issue of Legend are not only unnecessary but kind of insulting to the original records. Island has seemingly realized this: On streaming platforms, Thorngren's remixes are relegated to the status of “deluxe” addenda to Legend, and the superior original versions have been retconned into the album's tracklist.

As an attempt to spiff up the original Wailers tracks for modern pop's new age of gated drums and expensive synths, Thorngren's remixes were a C-suite approach to one of the core creative impulses that Afro-diasporic creative culture lent the global recording industry: versioning. Caribbean vernacular art, in particular, is less interested in originals than palimpsests, where recordings serve as templates for others to creatively repurpose—sometimes removing the vocals to toast over, sometimes changing the tempo or adding instrumentation to enhance the vibe. But Thorngren's ears, like Blackwell's a decade earlier, were more tuned to the industry dictates of securing copyrights and polishing up raw records for a fecund global marketplace. Blackwell once referred to himself as Marley's “translator,” and playfully called Catch a Fire, the Wailers' Island debut, the most “pasteurized” version of the band, laden with overdubs designed to appeal to reggae-curious stateside radio programmers and collegiate rock fans. With Marley joining him at the boards, Blackwell helped codify international reggae's appeal on Catch a Fire, initially packaging it with a Zippo lighter that actually opened, and later substituting a desaturated, high-contrast image of Marley puffing an enormous spliff, a nod to the fact that his target market likely had a National Geographic-level appreciation for Jamaicans and their music.

Musically, Blackwell's Catch a Fire pasteurization was primarily used on the ragged ghetto-survival anthem “Concrete Jungle” and the sultry “Stir It Up.” You can hear an estimation of the starker, Jamaican version of “Stir” on the early 2000s Catch reissue, before Blackwell added a dank Moog swirl to the intro and a clavinet throughout, both played by Houston-born former Johnny Nash sideman Rabbit Bundrick. Fond of the Muscle Shoals Sound Studio's band on records by Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, and the Rolling Stones, Blackwell asked Alabama-born guitarist Wayne Perkins, who happened to be in London, to add a solo to “Stir It Up.” Like a lot of American musicians weaned on funk and R&B, Perkins had trouble deciphering the track's reggae pulse—understandable, given that “one drop” beat was so named because the first beat of the bar (The One, in funk parlance) was left empty. “Anything I'd ever heard—the R&B, the church music—this was backwards,” Perkins recalled. But the octave-spanning solo he eventually laid, run through a sustain pedal and slathered with echo, turned the song into an entirely new reggae/rock/R&B hybrid that was born in Kingston, mixed in London, and sweetened with the warm twang of the American South.

In the background of “Stir It Up” is the voice of the song's inspiration, Marley's wife Rita, who fills out the mix with her friend Marcia Griffiths. The smoothest and horniest of Marley's love songs, “Stir” predicts London's late-70s “Lovers Rock” moment and evokes the best of the early-1970s U.S. bedroom soul boom of Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Roberta Flack, and Barry White. Legend has no shortage of Marley's love songs, opening with the luminous, folksy optimism of 1977's “Is This Love,” cantering out of the speakers on Carlton Barrett's stepper's rhythm (a more active take on the one-drop, his kick drum hitting every quarter-note). Yet like Side B's ultra-vulnerable slow jam “Waiting in Vain,” “Is This Love” wasn't about Rita, but Breakspeare.

Like a lot of other powerful men, not to mention his 1970s rock star cohort, Marley's politics were progressive until they were applied to women, though Rita herself publicly tolerated Marley's dalliances, acknowledging the ostensible necessity (encouraged by Rastafarian beliefs) for him to not just engage intimately with other women, but have children with them (12 children with eight women, to be specific). She certainly seems to have made her piece with this reality: in her book, Rita noted that when Bob bought her a BMW in the late 1970s, it was “as a consolation…when he became more friendly with Cindy [Breakspeare].” According to journalist and Island A&R employee Vivien Goldman, who was with Marley when he recorded “Vain” during the London period, Rita specifically abstained from recording backing vocals on the track.

Apart from demonstrations of their sexual prowess, the recipe for a successful '70s and '80s rock star required knitting their persona and music into far larger narratives, confusing scale and impact through spectacle and generating worshipful behavior from their consumer-acolytes. Marley was one of the few who didn't have to invent much. The CIA conspiracies and political lore surrounding his attempted murder made him a bona fide political refugee, and his capacity to weave his ancient Rastafarian ethos into some of the most forward-thinking music of its time made a late-1970s Wailers concert occasionally resemble a traveling revival meeting, with Marley leading call-and-response chants of Jah Rastafari's name to crowds equally populated by hipster spliff-puffers and others legitimately interested in the path to Zion.

Marley may have sold his soul to Babylon in the eyes of his Jamaican reggae contemporaries, but by the time of his 1977 album Exodus, he only had two contemporaries in the Pan-African imagination: Fela Kuti, whose Lagos commune was raided by the Nigerian military after being savaged on his 1977 album Zombie, and Stevie Wonder, whose 1974 No. 3 hit “Boogie on Reggae Woman” established a dialogue with Marley that led to a 1975 charity concert in Kingston (they duetted on “Sheriff,”) and whose 1976 double-album masterpiece Songs in the Key of Life cemented him as a cheerful global diplomat for Black music. Marley's sui generis stardom was the context for “Exodus,” which drew a conceptual line between the Israelites leaving Egypt, the Rastafarians seeking a return to their own motherland, and, of course, Marley's own displacement in London. Between the Barrett brothers' fervent reggae/funk fusion, Downie's robotic talkbox, and the guitar of Junior Marvin (who chose the Wailers over Wonder's band that year), “Exodus” earned Marley his first significant play on Black radio stations, while club DJs were working it into their sets.

As on Legend, Exodus' title track is followed by “Jamming,” on which Marley descends from the mountaintop to walk among the flock. Though it's become a synecdoche for laid-back party culture in the decades since, “Jamming” is, in its own way, as swaggering and pious as any southern American soul singer who picked the pop charts over the pulpit. It's preternaturally chill, but “Jamming” is also a cocky clapback, the kind of strutting public statement of invincibility that Tupac Shakur would turn into his calling card a couple decades later. “No bullet can stop us now,” Marley responds to his putative Kingston assassins—the choice of “us” effectively transferring his own fearlessness to his followers—over a groove so good that the lyrics are left to recursively comment on the instrumentation. In a surprisingly negative Rolling Stone review (that he later dialed back), Greil Marcus wrote that, on “Jamming,” “Marley sometimes sounds like an obsequious nightclub singer.” I agree with that take, but not as the insult Marcus intended; he seems to be purposefully dialing up reggae and Rastafarianism's flow-state of blunted ecstasy to demonstrate how impossibly unbothered he is by the actions of non-believers.

By the end of the Exodus tour, Marley knew something was wrong. He'd had a melanoma removed from his toe, but had refused a surgeon's recommendation for amputation. It wasn't only his religious beliefs stopping him from treatment, but more pressing issues like how to run and jump around on stage when he's missing a toe. So he kept getting sicker, a secret he kept from all but his closest confidantes, until he collapsed while jogging in Central Park in September 1980. In retrospect, however, you can hear Marley's confrontation with mortality in “Redemption Song.” Aligning his personal history with millions of others who trace their ancestry to Africa, Marley telescopes through time, from the horrors of the Middle Passage to a paraphrased Marcus Garvey speech addressing “mental slavery” down to the apocalyptic current moment of “atomic energy” (a significant topic for politically minded rockers of the era). Blackwell convinced him to record it solo, accompanied only by acoustic guitar. Weathered by sickness and decades of ganja smoking, Marley's voice sounds a thousand years old, befitting lyrics that place him fully in prophetic mode. The minimalist production recalls Otis Redding's posthumously released “Sittin' On the Dock of the Bay,” and predicts the solemnity of Rick Rubin casting Johnny Cash's cover of “Hurt” as a deathbed tone-poem (fittingly, Cash covered “Redemption Song” with Joe Strummer during those sessions). It's a song by a man equally sure of his legacy, his faith, and his soon-come mortality, and it sounds nothing like reggae. It's the most Legend song on the compilation.

Learning about reggae, or even Bob Marley himself, by listening to Legend is like learning about a big city by sticking to its downtown. You'll no doubt have a good time amid the most publicly accessible art and cultural opportunities that require little work to access, but your trip won't nearly represent the broader cultures and hidden treasures that take years or decades to fully understand. I first encountered Marley through Naughty By Nature's 1991 interpolation of “No Woman, No Cry” on “Everything's Gonna Be Alright,” and soon after, asked the Sam Goody clerk what song was playing on the P.A., I discovered “Could You Be Loved,” which as a teenage music nerd I connected to the glimmering disco-pop moment that made up my earliest musical memories. As I took ethnomusicology courses and tested the outer reaches of substance-enhanced consciousness at a Big Ten university in the 1990s, I witnessed firsthand the retrofitting of Bob Marley's elegant, difficult, transcendent Legend image into the avatar of DIY gravity bongs and drunken bar singalongs that freed frat boys from bonds of oppression, but I also saw Legend circulate on dubbed cassettes like a Gideon hotel bible, spurring further investigations for the genuinely curious.

In the 1990s, two Irish rock stars who'd themselves come of age amid religious fundamentalism and violent politics helped feed Marley's growing legend, in divergent ways. For the second song of her 1992 Saturday Night Live performance, Sinéad O'Connor sang Marley's “War” a capella while staring directly at the camera, ending the performance by tearing up a photo of Pope John Paul II and telling viewers to “fight the real enemy.” derailing her career. Then there was U2, who signed with Island the year before Marley's death, and who covered him in concert often. For better and worse, it was Bono was granted the privilege of continuing Bob Marley's mission of bringing the world together through song. He inducted Marley into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994, his speech ending with a litany of Marley's various identities: “showman, shaman, human…Jamaican!”

One's appreciation for that speech hinges upon one's tolerance for Bono, but he got something right: Bob Marley was a lot of things. Throughout that decade, his image was transformed into an endlessly redefinable vernacular, scrawled across dorm posters, t-shirts, weed paraphernalia, tribute albums, documentaries, murals, biopics, novels, academic conferences, “experiences,” all-inclusive vacation tours of his childhood home and Kingston compound, and Universal Orlando's “Tribute to Freedom” restaurant, which invites visitors to “Get Up, Stand Up, Eat Up.” Though his mortal fame paled when compared to Elvis Presley's, Marley's ghost certainly shares The King's gift of infinite posthumous marketability. And in the center of it all was Legend—the most consequential hits compilation in pop history, and one that barely scratches the surface of its elusive subject.

Saturday Night Live kicked off with top members of the Trump administration defending Immigration and Customs Enforcement amid the backlash to an agent shooting and killing Renee Nicole Good earlier this month.


Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson) introduced Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem (Ashley Padilla), who was unapologetic about the fatal incident. 


	“Now obviously there's been clashes on both sides in Minneapolis. And have we been perfect? Yes,” she insisted. 


	Noem then encouraged more people to sign up to join ICE, the agency which has seen a massive influx of money from the GOP's budget bill and yet has reportedly been hiring underqualified applicants.


	“Is your neck wider than your head? Are you currently wearing a Punisher t-shirt? Have you ever punched a hole in the wall because your son took a dance class?” she asked, in what was reminiscent of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler's ICE recruitment ad last October. “If the answer is yes, grab a gun, any gun, and saddle up, big boy, and just know you can always count on me because my last name is ‘Noem,' as in, ‘Do I have this situation under control? Noem, I don't.'”

	Trump then brought out Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth (Colin Jost), who had no problem depicting Good's killing as an example of American exceptionalism. 


	Regarding tensions with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and how thousands of anti-regime protesters have reportedly been killed in recent weeks in Iran, Hegseth said, “I'm going to tell him, ‘If Ayatollah once, Ayatollah a thousand times: you don't dare kill your protesters. That's our thing!”

John Mayer delivered an emotional rendition of “Ripple” as well as a heartfelt eulogy for the late Bob Weir at a public memorial for the Grateful Dead guitarist on Saturday in San Francisco.


	Taking the stage at the Civic Center Plaza celebration in front of thousands of Dead Heads, Mayer opened his eulogy by noting that he and Weir, his friend and Dead & Company band mate, were born on the same day (October 16) 30 years apart (1947 and 1977).


	“In the 30 years that preceded me, Bob had become a countercultural icon. I was a child of the 1980s. I come from a world of structural thinking, the concept, the theorizing, the reassessing, the perfecting,” Mayer said. “Bob learned early on that spirit, heart, soul, curiosity, and fearlessness was the path to glory. We both found success with each of our templates, and then we found each other.”


	Mayer then talked about joining Dead & Company, and how that gig turned into a friendship with the Weir family.

	“Over the course of a decade, we came to trust each other,” Mayer said of Weir. “He taught me, among many other things, to trust in the moment, and I'd like to think I taught him a little bit to rely on a plan, not as a substitute for the divine moments, but as a way to lure them in a little closer. I guess maybe what I was really doing was showing him he could rely on me. Bob took a chance on me. He staked his entire reputation on my joining a band with him. He gave me musical community, he gave me this community.” Mayer then broke into tears as the Deadheads saluted him.

	











	“He lent me his songbook, invited me into the worlds he'd constructed, and taught me what the songs meant and what it meant to perform them,” Mayer continued. “In return, I gave him everything I had night after night, year after year.”

	Mayer closed out his eulogy by saying, “There are a lot of Grateful Dead lyrics that give comfort at a time like this, but the line I find myself thinking about the most is from a Leon Russell song called ‘A Song for You.'

A$AP Rocky debuted on Saturday Night Live with three songs from his new album, Don't Be Dumb, which dropped Friday.


	The Harlem-born rapper, who held an album release party not far from the SNL studio late Thursday night, opened with lead single “Punk Rocky.”


Don't Be Dumb is Rocky's fourth studio album and first since 2018's Testing. The 37-year-old isn't concerned about the frequency of his output, but taking the time to craft a legacy.


	“I don't do all these different endeavours just because I got to be the first at the top of the mountain and plant the flag. Because it's not really about who did it first. It's about who did it the best,” he told Perfect Magazine last fall. “I don't do things to just try and stay relevant, or keep my name in the conversation. I try to do natural things, creative, ambitious things that really satisfy me.”


	Rocky's second performance was a medley of “Helicopter” and the album's title track.

	The 15-track album features collaborations with nearly as many artists; the list includes Will.i.am, Doechii, Gorillaz, Jon Batiste and Tyler, the Creator. Filmmaker Tim Burton created the album's cover art, which shows Rocky's six personas.


	There's no word yet from Rocky on a tour in support of his latest album. His next scheduled show is headlining the Governors Ball in Queens, New York in June.

For more than three quarters of a century, reports of strange objects in the sky have unsettled pilots, challenged scientists, and tested the credibility of governments.What began in the late 1940s as scattered sightings of so-called flying saucers has evolved into a modern national security issue discussed openly in Congress under the term Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAP. Two men, separated by generations but united by military service and a refusal to accept official dismissals, played defining roles in that transformation. Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe and Luis Elizondo each forced the United States to confront uncomfortable questions about what is operating in its airspace and how much the government should tell the public.Related: The 1952 UFO Washington sighting that upended decades of denial

Their work reflects not only changing technologies but also changing attitudes toward secrecy, transparency, and the responsibilities of democratic institutions. Together, they form a continuous historical thread linking the earliest UFO debates of the Cold War to today's formal federal reporting systems.

Donald Edward Keyhoe was born in 1897, at a time when human flight was still experimental. By the time he reached adulthood, aviation had become a defining feature of modern warfare and national power. Keyhoe graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and went on to serve as an officer and aviator in the U.S. Marine Corps. His military service placed him at the forefront of early 20th century aviation, giving him firsthand experience with the limits and possibilities of aircraft technology.

An injury forced Keyhoe to retire from active duty earlier than planned, but it did not end his involvement with aviation. He went on to work with the Civil Aeronautics Branch and established himself as a respected aviation writer. His articles for major magazines translated complex technical developments into language the public could understand. This reputation as a serious aviation journalist would later distinguish him from the sensationalists who crowded the UFO field.

As the Cold War intensified in the late 1940s, reports of mysterious objects in the sky began to proliferate. Many came from military pilots, radar operators, and air traffic controllers, individuals trained to identify aircraft and atmospheric phenomena. Keyhoe was struck by the consistency of these reports and by how often official explanations seemed inadequate. Unlike many observers, he did not dismiss the sightings as mass hysteria or simple misidentifications.

In 1950, Keyhoe published an article in True magazine titled “The Flying Saucers Are Real.” The response was immediate and overwhelming. Later expanded into a book of the same name, the work presented detailed case studies involving credible witnesses and emphasized the apparent technological superiority of the objects described.

Keyhoe argued that these objects were not secret American projects or foreign aircraft. Instead, he suggested they were extraterrestrial in origin. More controversially, he claimed that the U.S. government, particularly the Air Force, was aware of this possibility and deliberately withholding the truth from the public. In the context of Cold War secrecy, when nuclear weapons programs and intelligence operations were hidden behind layers of classification, this accusation resonated deeply.

The book became a bestseller and propelled Keyhoe into the national spotlight. UFOs were no longer a fringe topic. They were discussed in mainstream media, debated in living rooms, and increasingly viewed as a potential national security issue.

Keyhoe's growing prominence brought him into conflict with military authorities. He believed that official explanations of UFO sightings were often inconsistent or misleading, designed more to reassure the public than to reflect the available evidence. According to Keyhoe, the Air Force had adopted a policy of debunking by default, even when cases remained unresolved.

To counter this, he became the leading figure in the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, or NICAP. As its director, Keyhoe sought to professionalize civilian UFO investigation. NICAP focused on collecting reports from credible witnesses, especially military personnel and pilots, and documenting cases with as much rigor as possible.Related: Official CIA documents reported that a UFO turned a Soviet infantry unit to stone

Keyhoe was careful to distance NICAP from overt sensationalism. He insisted that UFOs be treated as a serious scientific and security issue, not entertainment. This approach earned NICAP a degree of legitimacy, even as it drew criticism from skeptics and hostility from some government officials.

Keyhoe's confrontational stance made him a frequent subject of media interviews. His televised exchanges with journalists such as Mike Wallace exposed millions of Americans to the idea that UFO secrecy was a deliberate policy choice rather than a matter of ignorance.

Public pressure generated by Keyhoe and others played a role in prompting the U.S. Air Force to formalize its response to UFO sightings. Launched in 1948, Project Sign represented the first official attempt to study the phenomenon. While some analysts within the project reportedly considered extraterrestrial explanations plausible, the program was short-lived.

Project Sign was followed by Project Grudge, which adopted a more dismissive approach, often attributing sightings to misidentifications or psychological factors. This stance reinforced Keyhoe's belief that the Air Force was more interested in minimizing the issue than understanding it. Project Blue Book, established in 1952, became the longest-running UFO investigation, lasting until 1969.

Although Blue Book cataloged thousands of cases, it concluded that UFOs posed no threat to national security. Keyhoe rejected these conclusions, arguing that unresolved cases and classified data told a different story. Even so, the existence of these programs demonstrated that UFOs could not be entirely ignored, a reality shaped in part by Keyhoe's persistent advocacy.

Unlike many UFO proponents, Keyhoe attempted to anchor his arguments in scientific and technical frameworks. He drew on speculative theories from figures such as Wilbert Smith and rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth, discussing the possibility that UFOs employ gravitational manipulation for propulsion.

Such technology, he argued, could explain the extreme acceleration, silent hovering, and sharp maneuvers reported by witnesses without subjecting occupants to lethal forces. While these ideas remained unproven, they reflected Keyhoe's desire to move the discussion beyond mysticism and toward physics and engineering.

Keyhoe continued writing and speaking on UFOs until his death in 1988. By then, official interest had waned, and public attention had shifted. Yet his influence endured, shaping the foundations of modern ufology and leaving unresolved questions that would resurface decades later.

The modern revival of government interest in unidentified aerial phenomena occurred in a very different technological and political environment. Advances in radar, infrared sensors, satellite surveillance, and data analysis transformed how the military monitored airspace. At the same time, growing concern about advanced foreign weapons systems reframed unexplained sightings as potential intelligence threats.

Luis Elizondo, a former U.S. Army counterintelligence officer, emerged as a key figure in this shift. He served as the director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, or AATIP, a classified effort within the Defense Intelligence Agency tasked with examining encounters between U.S. forces and unidentified objects.

Unlike earlier programs, AATIP was not primarily concerned with extraterrestrial life. Its focus was national security. The central question was whether these objects represented advanced technologies capable of penetrating controlled airspace and outmaneuvering U.S. aircraft.

Under Elizondo's leadership, AATIP investigated incidents involving objects with no visible propulsion systems, no wings or control surfaces, and performance characteristics beyond known aerospace platforms. These included extreme acceleration, sudden directional changes, hypersonic speeds, and seamless operation across different environments.

Crucially, AATIP relied on multi-sensor data. Radar tracks, infrared imagery, and eyewitness accounts from trained military personnel provided a level of evidentiary rigor rarely seen in earlier UFO investigations. For Elizondo, this data suggested that the phenomenon could not be dismissed as simple misidentification or equipment error.

The implications were profound. If such objects were foreign technology, they represented a serious intelligence failure. If they were something else entirely, they raised even more unsettling questions.

Elizondo eventually concluded that bureaucratic resistance and institutional stigma were preventing meaningful investigation. In 2017, he resigned from his position, later stating that some within the Pentagon were unwilling to confront data that challenged existing assumptions.

After his resignation, Elizondo helped bring AATIP into public view. Media reporting confirmed the program's existence, and declassified military videos showing encounters with UAPs were released. The reaction was markedly different from the Cold War era. Rather than ridicule, the disclosures prompted serious discussion among journalists, scientists, and lawmakers.

Elizondo became a leading advocate for transparency, emphasizing that UAPs should be studied systematically and without stigma. He argued that acknowledging uncertainty was not a sign of weakness, but of intellectual honesty.

Elizondo's actions helped reshape how the federal government approaches UAPs. Congressional interest led to briefings, hearings, and new legislative requirements. One of the most significant outcomes was the establishment of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO.

Unlike earlier programs, AARO was created by Congress and designated as the Department of Defense's single focal point for UAP investigation. Its mandate extends across air, sea, space, and other domains, coordinating efforts across DoD, the intelligence community, and allied partners.

This represents a fundamental departure from the secrecy and ad hoc investigations of the past. UAPs are now treated as a legitimate category of analysis within national security planning, rather than an embarrassment to be ignored.

One of the most important changes in the post-Elizondo era is the formalization of reporting pathways. The U.S. federal government, primarily through the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, now emphasizes systematic and stigma-free reporting of UAP encounters.

The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office serves as the central hub for these efforts. Current or former U.S. government employees, service members, and contractors with direct knowledge of UAP programs or activities are eligible to submit reports through official AARO reporting forms. These forms are designed to preserve data integrity and allow for follow-ups when necessary.

Civilian pilots also play a role. The Federal Aviation Administration collects pilot reports related to UAP encounters, which are then shared with AARO for analysis. This integration ensures that aviation safety and national security concerns are addressed together.

Reports may include multi-sensor data such as radar tracks, infrared imagery, and visual observations, as well as descriptions of unusual flight characteristics like extreme acceleration or the absence of propulsion signatures. The overarching goals are safety, intelligence awareness, and transparency. By reducing stigma and encouraging reporting, the government aims to build a comprehensive dataset suitable for scientific and operational analysis.

AARO publishes annual unclassified reports to Congress through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, providing the public with insight into trends and findings while protecting sensitive information.

The long arc of America's engagement with unidentified aerial phenomena reveals a clear evolution. What began as fragmented sightings and guarded military assessments has steadily matured into a structured, multi-disciplinary effort that blends national security, scientific inquiry, and public transparency. Major Donald E. Keyhoe forced the first serious public reckoning, challenging Cold War secrecy and insisting that unexplained aerial objects were real and worthy of investigation. Decades later, Luis Elizondo helped push the issue into the modern era, reframing UAPs as a legitimate defense and intelligence concern and helping catalyze formal federal mechanisms such as AARO. Together, they transformed ridicule into responsibility.

Yet the elevation of UAP study has not occurred solely within government halls. In parallel, private scientific efforts have expanded the scope of inquiry beyond military encounters and into controlled, data-rich environments. Few examples illustrate this shift more clearly than Brandon Fugal's work at Skinwalker Ranch.

Since acquiring the 512-acre Utah property in 2016, Fugal has fundamentally changed how one of the world's most infamous anomaly sites is studied. Previously shrouded in secrecy and associated with classified government research under prior ownership, the ranch has been reimagined as a transparent, instrumented laboratory. Fugal's approach reflects a new phase in UAP research, one that emphasizes empirical data, repeatable measurement, and interdisciplinary collaboration rather than speculation alone.

Under his leadership, Skinwalker Ranch hosts a sustained scientific investigation into what researchers often describe as “high strangeness,” including UFO sightings, unexplained energy emissions, and anomalous physical effects. The investigative team combines expertise in physics, astrophysics, engineering, and security, with figures such as physicist Erik Bard, astrophysicist Travis Taylor, and security chief Bryant “Dragon” Arnold forming a core group focused on disciplined observation rather than sensational conclusions. The use of advanced technologies, including ground penetrating radar, thermal imaging, spectrum analysis, and custom artificial intelligence systems, represents a level of technical rigor rarely applied to such phenomena in the past.

Fugal's decision to support and publicize this work through “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch” has also played a cultural role similar to that once filled by Keyhoe's books and Elizondo's disclosures. By placing data-driven investigation before a mainstream audience, the series has helped normalize serious discussion of anomalous phenomena. Importantly, Fugal has emphasized that he reinvests media proceeds back into research and charitable causes, reinforcing the idea that the ranch is not a commercial curiosity but a long-term scientific endeavor. Even ambitious initiatives, such as deploying a dedicated satellite to monitor the property from orbit, underscore how far the field has moved from anecdote to instrumentation.

Taken together, the legacies of Keyhoe, Elizondo, and Fugal reveal a profound shift. UAPs are no longer confined to whispered rumors, tabloid headlines, or classified filing cabinets. They are studied through federal reporting systems, analyzed as potential safety and intelligence risks, and examined in controlled environments using cutting-edge technology. While definitive answers remain elusive, the methodology has changed dramatically.

The study of UAPs has been elevated from secrecy and stigma to structure and science. Whether the ultimate explanations prove mundane, revolutionary, or something entirely unexpected, the groundwork now exists for honest inquiry. That transformation stands as the shared achievement of those who refused to accept dismissal, demanded better questions, and insisted that the unknown be met not with fear or mockery, but with disciplined curiosity.

For more than three quarters of a century, reports of strange objects in the sky have unsettled pilots, challenged scientists, and tested the credibility of governments.What began in the late 1940s as scattered sightings of so-called flying saucers has evolved into a modern national security issue discussed openly in Congress under the term Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAP. Two men, separated by generations but united by military service and a refusal to accept official dismissals, played defining roles in that transformation. Maj. Donald E. Keyhoe and Luis Elizondo each forced the United States to confront uncomfortable questions about what is operating in its airspace and how much the government should tell the public.Related: The 1952 UFO Washington sighting that upended decades of denial

Their work reflects not only changing technologies but also changing attitudes toward secrecy, transparency, and the responsibilities of democratic institutions. Together, they form a continuous historical thread linking the earliest UFO debates of the Cold War to today's formal federal reporting systems.

Donald Edward Keyhoe was born in 1897, at a time when human flight was still experimental. By the time he reached adulthood, aviation had become a defining feature of modern warfare and national power. Keyhoe graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy and went on to serve as an officer and aviator in the U.S. Marine Corps. His military service placed him at the forefront of early 20th century aviation, giving him firsthand experience with the limits and possibilities of aircraft technology.

An injury forced Keyhoe to retire from active duty earlier than planned, but it did not end his involvement with aviation. He went on to work with the Civil Aeronautics Branch and established himself as a respected aviation writer. His articles for major magazines translated complex technical developments into language the public could understand. This reputation as a serious aviation journalist would later distinguish him from the sensationalists who crowded the UFO field.

As the Cold War intensified in the late 1940s, reports of mysterious objects in the sky began to proliferate. Many came from military pilots, radar operators, and air traffic controllers, individuals trained to identify aircraft and atmospheric phenomena. Keyhoe was struck by the consistency of these reports and by how often official explanations seemed inadequate. Unlike many observers, he did not dismiss the sightings as mass hysteria or simple misidentifications.

In 1950, Keyhoe published an article in True magazine titled “The Flying Saucers Are Real.” The response was immediate and overwhelming. Later expanded into a book of the same name, the work presented detailed case studies involving credible witnesses and emphasized the apparent technological superiority of the objects described.

Keyhoe argued that these objects were not secret American projects or foreign aircraft. Instead, he suggested they were extraterrestrial in origin. More controversially, he claimed that the U.S. government, particularly the Air Force, was aware of this possibility and deliberately withholding the truth from the public. In the context of Cold War secrecy, when nuclear weapons programs and intelligence operations were hidden behind layers of classification, this accusation resonated deeply.

The book became a bestseller and propelled Keyhoe into the national spotlight. UFOs were no longer a fringe topic. They were discussed in mainstream media, debated in living rooms, and increasingly viewed as a potential national security issue.

Keyhoe's growing prominence brought him into conflict with military authorities. He believed that official explanations of UFO sightings were often inconsistent or misleading, designed more to reassure the public than to reflect the available evidence. According to Keyhoe, the Air Force had adopted a policy of debunking by default, even when cases remained unresolved.

To counter this, he became the leading figure in the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena, or NICAP. As its director, Keyhoe sought to professionalize civilian UFO investigation. NICAP focused on collecting reports from credible witnesses, especially military personnel and pilots, and documenting cases with as much rigor as possible.Related: Official CIA documents reported that a UFO turned a Soviet infantry unit to stone

Keyhoe was careful to distance NICAP from overt sensationalism. He insisted that UFOs be treated as a serious scientific and security issue, not entertainment. This approach earned NICAP a degree of legitimacy, even as it drew criticism from skeptics and hostility from some government officials.

Keyhoe's confrontational stance made him a frequent subject of media interviews. His televised exchanges with journalists such as Mike Wallace exposed millions of Americans to the idea that UFO secrecy was a deliberate policy choice rather than a matter of ignorance.

Public pressure generated by Keyhoe and others played a role in prompting the U.S. Air Force to formalize its response to UFO sightings. Launched in 1948, Project Sign represented the first official attempt to study the phenomenon. While some analysts within the project reportedly considered extraterrestrial explanations plausible, the program was short-lived.

Project Sign was followed by Project Grudge, which adopted a more dismissive approach, often attributing sightings to misidentifications or psychological factors. This stance reinforced Keyhoe's belief that the Air Force was more interested in minimizing the issue than understanding it. Project Blue Book, established in 1952, became the longest-running UFO investigation, lasting until 1969.

Although Blue Book cataloged thousands of cases, it concluded that UFOs posed no threat to national security. Keyhoe rejected these conclusions, arguing that unresolved cases and classified data told a different story. Even so, the existence of these programs demonstrated that UFOs could not be entirely ignored, a reality shaped in part by Keyhoe's persistent advocacy.

Unlike many UFO proponents, Keyhoe attempted to anchor his arguments in scientific and technical frameworks. He drew on speculative theories from figures such as Wilbert Smith and rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth, discussing the possibility that UFOs employ gravitational manipulation for propulsion.

Such technology, he argued, could explain the extreme acceleration, silent hovering, and sharp maneuvers reported by witnesses without subjecting occupants to lethal forces. While these ideas remained unproven, they reflected Keyhoe's desire to move the discussion beyond mysticism and toward physics and engineering.

Keyhoe continued writing and speaking on UFOs until his death in 1988. By then, official interest had waned, and public attention had shifted. Yet his influence endured, shaping the foundations of modern ufology and leaving unresolved questions that would resurface decades later.

The modern revival of government interest in unidentified aerial phenomena occurred in a very different technological and political environment. Advances in radar, infrared sensors, satellite surveillance, and data analysis transformed how the military monitored airspace. At the same time, growing concern about advanced foreign weapons systems reframed unexplained sightings as potential intelligence threats.

Luis Elizondo, a former U.S. Army counterintelligence officer, emerged as a key figure in this shift. He served as the director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, or AATIP, a classified effort within the Defense Intelligence Agency tasked with examining encounters between U.S. forces and unidentified objects.

Unlike earlier programs, AATIP was not primarily concerned with extraterrestrial life. Its focus was national security. The central question was whether these objects represented advanced technologies capable of penetrating controlled airspace and outmaneuvering U.S. aircraft.

Under Elizondo's leadership, AATIP investigated incidents involving objects with no visible propulsion systems, no wings or control surfaces, and performance characteristics beyond known aerospace platforms. These included extreme acceleration, sudden directional changes, hypersonic speeds, and seamless operation across different environments.

Crucially, AATIP relied on multi-sensor data. Radar tracks, infrared imagery, and eyewitness accounts from trained military personnel provided a level of evidentiary rigor rarely seen in earlier UFO investigations. For Elizondo, this data suggested that the phenomenon could not be dismissed as simple misidentification or equipment error.

The implications were profound. If such objects were foreign technology, they represented a serious intelligence failure. If they were something else entirely, they raised even more unsettling questions.

Elizondo eventually concluded that bureaucratic resistance and institutional stigma were preventing meaningful investigation. In 2017, he resigned from his position, later stating that some within the Pentagon were unwilling to confront data that challenged existing assumptions.

After his resignation, Elizondo helped bring AATIP into public view. Media reporting confirmed the program's existence, and declassified military videos showing encounters with UAPs were released. The reaction was markedly different from the Cold War era. Rather than ridicule, the disclosures prompted serious discussion among journalists, scientists, and lawmakers.

Elizondo became a leading advocate for transparency, emphasizing that UAPs should be studied systematically and without stigma. He argued that acknowledging uncertainty was not a sign of weakness, but of intellectual honesty.

Elizondo's actions helped reshape how the federal government approaches UAPs. Congressional interest led to briefings, hearings, and new legislative requirements. One of the most significant outcomes was the establishment of the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, or AARO.

Unlike earlier programs, AARO was created by Congress and designated as the Department of Defense's single focal point for UAP investigation. Its mandate extends across air, sea, space, and other domains, coordinating efforts across DoD, the intelligence community, and allied partners.

This represents a fundamental departure from the secrecy and ad hoc investigations of the past. UAPs are now treated as a legitimate category of analysis within national security planning, rather than an embarrassment to be ignored.

One of the most important changes in the post-Elizondo era is the formalization of reporting pathways. The U.S. federal government, primarily through the Department of Defense and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, now emphasizes systematic and stigma-free reporting of UAP encounters.

The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office serves as the central hub for these efforts. Current or former U.S. government employees, service members, and contractors with direct knowledge of UAP programs or activities are eligible to submit reports through official AARO reporting forms. These forms are designed to preserve data integrity and allow for follow-ups when necessary.

Civilian pilots also play a role. The Federal Aviation Administration collects pilot reports related to UAP encounters, which are then shared with AARO for analysis. This integration ensures that aviation safety and national security concerns are addressed together.

Reports may include multi-sensor data such as radar tracks, infrared imagery, and visual observations, as well as descriptions of unusual flight characteristics like extreme acceleration or the absence of propulsion signatures. The overarching goals are safety, intelligence awareness, and transparency. By reducing stigma and encouraging reporting, the government aims to build a comprehensive dataset suitable for scientific and operational analysis.

AARO publishes annual unclassified reports to Congress through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, providing the public with insight into trends and findings while protecting sensitive information.

The long arc of America's engagement with unidentified aerial phenomena reveals a clear evolution. What began as fragmented sightings and guarded military assessments has steadily matured into a structured, multi-disciplinary effort that blends national security, scientific inquiry, and public transparency. Major Donald E. Keyhoe forced the first serious public reckoning, challenging Cold War secrecy and insisting that unexplained aerial objects were real and worthy of investigation. Decades later, Luis Elizondo helped push the issue into the modern era, reframing UAPs as a legitimate defense and intelligence concern and helping catalyze formal federal mechanisms such as AARO. Together, they transformed ridicule into responsibility.

Yet the elevation of UAP study has not occurred solely within government halls. In parallel, private scientific efforts have expanded the scope of inquiry beyond military encounters and into controlled, data-rich environments. Few examples illustrate this shift more clearly than Brandon Fugal's work at Skinwalker Ranch.

Since acquiring the 512-acre Utah property in 2016, Fugal has fundamentally changed how one of the world's most infamous anomaly sites is studied. Previously shrouded in secrecy and associated with classified government research under prior ownership, the ranch has been reimagined as a transparent, instrumented laboratory. Fugal's approach reflects a new phase in UAP research, one that emphasizes empirical data, repeatable measurement, and interdisciplinary collaboration rather than speculation alone.

Under his leadership, Skinwalker Ranch hosts a sustained scientific investigation into what researchers often describe as “high strangeness,” including UFO sightings, unexplained energy emissions, and anomalous physical effects. The investigative team combines expertise in physics, astrophysics, engineering, and security, with figures such as physicist Erik Bard, astrophysicist Travis Taylor, and security chief Bryant “Dragon” Arnold forming a core group focused on disciplined observation rather than sensational conclusions. The use of advanced technologies, including ground penetrating radar, thermal imaging, spectrum analysis, and custom artificial intelligence systems, represents a level of technical rigor rarely applied to such phenomena in the past.

Fugal's decision to support and publicize this work through “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch” has also played a cultural role similar to that once filled by Keyhoe's books and Elizondo's disclosures. By placing data-driven investigation before a mainstream audience, the series has helped normalize serious discussion of anomalous phenomena. Importantly, Fugal has emphasized that he reinvests media proceeds back into research and charitable causes, reinforcing the idea that the ranch is not a commercial curiosity but a long-term scientific endeavor. Even ambitious initiatives, such as deploying a dedicated satellite to monitor the property from orbit, underscore how far the field has moved from anecdote to instrumentation.

Taken together, the legacies of Keyhoe, Elizondo, and Fugal reveal a profound shift. UAPs are no longer confined to whispered rumors, tabloid headlines, or classified filing cabinets. They are studied through federal reporting systems, analyzed as potential safety and intelligence risks, and examined in controlled environments using cutting-edge technology. While definitive answers remain elusive, the methodology has changed dramatically.

The study of UAPs has been elevated from secrecy and stigma to structure and science. Whether the ultimate explanations prove mundane, revolutionary, or something entirely unexpected, the groundwork now exists for honest inquiry. That transformation stands as the shared achievement of those who refused to accept dismissal, demanded better questions, and insisted that the unknown be met not with fear or mockery, but with disciplined curiosity.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Supernatural","Supernatural Wasted the Potential of One Villain in the Final Seasons","https://vocal.media/horror/supernatural-wasted-the-potential-of-one-villain-in-the-final-seasons","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 16:09:21 GMT","

While Supernatural has become one of my favorite shows, there are several flaws that I wish could have been given far better potential. I think when it comes to their use of several villains, some of them are either overused, or extremely underused for the show. 

One specific villain that I was disappointed with both the little use of screentime and storyline, was the cosmic terror known as The Empty. This villain instantly caught my attention, when we got the first glimpse of this thing after Castiel dies again. He awakens in The Empty, where he meets an entity that takes on his own form, mocking him. This creature came off so threatening upon first meeting, and I was looking forward to seeing more of this villain. 

Unfortunately, I felt that the villain didn't get a proper storyline for the show.

The Empty was such an interesting villain. This thing reminded me of Lovecraft horror, an unknown horror that obviously did not belong. I also loved how the entity could take on so many forms, shape shifting has always been of my favorite attributes in horror. 

And the best thing about this monster, was the motivation behind its actions against the main cast. 

It was angry that it had woken up, and all it wanted, was to go back to sleep. Due to the insanity that was going on with the Winchesters and their friends, the Empty had woken up, and was pretty pissed off. It wanted to sleep, but due to the madness and the other battles taking place, it struggled to go back to sleep. 

The Empty started to use pain as its main factor, going after anyone that would dare to mess with it. The Empty also become victorious in season 15, when it was able to claim the soul of Castiel, after he was told that if he is ever happy, he will die.

There was also a really cool scene with The Empty before Castiel was told this messed up deal, when it had possessed a random angel. The acting of this scene made me a little uncomfortable, probably because I knew that this thing was not human. It also kept on smiling at Castiel, heavily implying that The Empty was stuck in its own madness.

I really believed that The Empty was going to become the main villain of either season 14 or the final season. It was pretty disappointing to find this out, because in my opinion, The Empty could have been one of the final villains for the ending of the show. I did mention that Jack should have been the villain in another article, but I think The Empty would have been a much better choice.

It's a huge shame that The Empty was treated more like a side villain compared to the other villains that I thought were kind of tame compared to this entity. I would have loved a storyline of Jack being forced to take down The Empty, after the death of Castiel. This revenge storyline also would have been more much impactful, since Castiel literally confessed his love to his best friend before his death.

A Lovecraftian horror attempting to take over the Earth would have been a fantastic storyline, all because it was angry that many forces had awoken this thing from its eternal slumber.

That would have been an awesome ending for the show. Of course, the Winchesters would have won the fight in the end, but the stakes would have been on another level. 

Man, how I wished The Empty was written as more of a threat for the final seasons!

I have seen so many films that focus on the downfall of humanity during the end of the world, and I think the first film in the franchise of 28 Days Later, is one of the best. We get a small glimpse of how the 'zombie' virus spread, and it quickly infected the entire world.

Do not drink the water. Do not eat the food.

 Your stomach is so empty, when it growls the echoes bounce around your innards. There is no-one to speak to, but if there was, speech would be unavailable to you. Your throat cracks.

I have a confession to make: I am obsessed with European history, specifically castles. There's something about a stone fortress that feels like a magnet for the paranormal. In my mind, every castle is haunted, usually by a lady in a white dress, a headless nobleman, or (the absolute worst) creepy ghost children.

Here is a supernatural music video short film for you to enjoy titled Buddha Was A Rich Boy by the band The Handsom Devil. 

In the video, after a concert flyer turned paper airplane lands into the laps of two kid sisters, they infiltrate the venue to find a mindless mosh crowding a supernatural bathroom. 

The video was directed by Hunter Wayne. It is shared in collaboration with the FilmQuest Film Festival, where we are looking to expose some of the great indie genre films and shorts that filmmakers are creating.

I've included an interview with the filmmaker below along with the short!

What was the inspiration for your film? How did you come up with the idea?

I dm'd the band on Instagram in the hopes that I could be considered to direct a music video for them alongside some of my friends that I've always wanted to work with in such a capacity. 

Despite having no evidence to indicate that I would be a good director, the singer (Godforbid) graciously told me that he liked my work. We ended up filming two music videos in two days. This one was primarily Godforbid's idea (down to the two child actors being his kids). A handful of the visual gags were ones I made on the fly.

Tell us about yourself. What is your background? How long have you been a filmmaker?

I first-time directed two music videos for That Handsome Devil last year. The trajectory of my work in relativity to the film festival circuit was beating Jeremy Renner for an award at our world premiere in addition to being officially selected for 4 Academy Award Qualifying film festivals so far. One of my stops on the film festival tour being Film Quest...

What inspires you to work within genre cinema and tell these kind of stories?

Much like That Handsome Devils discography, it stems from having a taste that doesn't neatly fit me into any one box. I don't blindly love horror movies. I don't blindly love any one decade's culture. I don't blindly love black t-shirts. I subscribe more to the idea that everything has something to offer. Makes the dish the chef brings out more interesting...

What was your favorite part of the filmmaking process for this project?

Filming with a band that I've loved's music for years, alongside my friends who's respective works I've loved for years, was what made maxing out two credit cards (one per video) worth it. Getting to make new friends with inspirng filmmakers on the film festival circuit (such as Kai Straw) has made my priorities as an artist stronger. I can't wait to put all of what I learned into practice on my next project.

What are you most proud of with this film?

I've been doing research on the odds of a first time filmmaker getting showcased in 4+ academy award qualifying film festivals, and beating out an a-list actor for an award. 

I'm happy to learn that gambling on myself has paid off in the regard that I'm in a single-percentile of filmmakers to have achieved the accolades that I have at the time of doing this interview. When I factor my research as a first time filmmaker going into music videos, this is an even harder niche to crack, considering I'm not working with a Billboard 100 artist.

What is a favorite story or moment from the making of the film you'd like to share? 

I had a layover in Vegas on the way to our shoot locations in New York. I had enough time to take the bus to The Mirage and put $20 into the slots. I had no budget remaining at this point and I was literally gambling on myself. I excitedly called my producer to inform him that my winnings from the slots could afford me a production assistant for both days. If I didn't do this, production surely would have suffered.

What was your most challenging moment or experience you had while making your film?

The lack of time, money, and control was not for the faint of heart. Being beholden to the unpredictable nature of the baby actor was probably the most tense moment of the whole thing. We were lucky to have gotten a wide spectrum of emotional range from her. Godforbid's want to make a video with his kids is the star of the show here.

If it did, how did your film change or differ from its original concept during pre-production, production, and/or post-production? How has this changed how you'll approach future projects as a result?

The two references I beat into the heads of everyone was Son of the Mask and Pepper by Butthole Surfers. I originally wanted to do more greenscreen style puppeteering of the baby, having her run up on the bar, being crowdsurfed, etc. 

I softpitched Godforbid on puppets in this one because I wanted to work with my friend Jamie Shannon (Nanalan, Mr. Meaty, etc.). He nicely put the idea down, but I wanted originally to have the kids watch a puppet show on tv and have the final gag being the baby ripping it's head open and the puppets from the show come out of the opening. 

The reality of what I had to work with has led me to the final result we have now. It is funny to see that between the two videos I did with THD, the video I had the least control over is the one that is performing the best. Though I must say that the other video, Before You Were Born, was pre-selected for Chelsea Film Festival. Truthfully, I wouldn't change a thing between both videos...

Who were some of your collaborators and actors on the film? How did you start working with each other?

Brent Bailey is an amazing cinematographer whom I got to admire on sets I'd work on with him as an assistant director. Me being a fan of his eye on works like The Quiet Room & Dragula made me intimidated to reach out to him right away despite he and I being friends haha Brandon Torres & Gina Torres were my producer super-couple remotely working from Austin Texas as we simultaneously worked in New York. 

We were basically the big 4 that spearheaded this thing. Supporting crew members were primarily found through Brandon's vetting process with our amazing production assistant, Ryan Cervasio, being recommended to my by Scott Klausen. Both Ryan and Scott are part of the Terrifier 2 & 3 crew for anyone reading that's a fan :)

What is the best advice you've ever received as a filmmaker and what would you like to say to new filmmakers?

If I was a money person and you reached out to me having no movies under your belt, I would not trust you with my money. Similarly, no one gave me permission or a budget to make these videos. Gamble on yourself. Max out credit cards, pull favors, submit to every film festival. Even submit to the ones you don't think you're a good fit for. Betting on yourself is scary but it will pay off. Metaphorically, not financially :p Live your life...

What are your plans for your career and what do you hope this film does for it? What kind of stories would you like to tell moving forward?

I am in the midst of creating a stopmotion animation sequence for a wildlife documentary proof-of-concept. I will be submitting that for grants to flesh into a bigger project. I'm using the long time it takes to animate to contemplate what my first short film will be. I have a couple fun ideas I'd be happy to talk about if you ask me.

What is your next project and when can we expect to see it? 

The wildlife documentary pitch is called Island of Garbage. It follows a nature reserve in Texas where 60 tons of trash, throughout all of the world and throughout all of time wash ashore daily. Homer Flynn of The Residents has been kind enough to lend his voice for the narration. 

I been talking to my friend/grammy-award-winner Carla Patullo about possibly contributing music. I highly recommend everyone get tickets for The Residents' world tour of Eskimo and listening to Carla's latest album Nomadica. Those will give you an idea of where I'm going artistically, also both works respectively made me cry haha

Where can we find more of your work and where can interested parties contact you? Do you have a website or YouTube/Vimeo channel? Social media handles?

Bonus Question #1: What is your all-time favorite film?

I'll say Norbit as a placeholder

Bonus Question #2: What is the film that most inspired you to become a filmmaker and/or had the most influence on your work?

The paedophile financier's younger brother is claiming that ‘more autopsy facts' coming out in February will prove Epstein's death was murder, not suicide. Katie Rosseinsky looks at the complex relationship between the two siblings and what he knows

Removed from bookmarks

Ever since the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was found dead in his prison cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking, speculation and conspiracies have run riot in the darker corners of the internet. 

The financier's death was ruled as a suicide, and a Department of Justice report four years later found no credible evidence of foul play. Yet that hasn't stopped many from claiming that Epstein, who cultivated an array of rich and famous friends, was murdered before he could blow the whistle on powerful associates.

And among the loudest voices asserting that Epstein was killed to protect the interests of those wealthy friends is his younger brother, Mark. The 71-year-old property developer has spent the past few years doubling down on the theory that his older sibling's death was murder, not suicide. He has reiterated his scepticism of the official verdict in a series of interviews with major news platforms and programmes, from CNN to Newsnight, typically with his camera turned off, bringing what was once the stuff of the online rumour mill into the mainstream. 

“There are only three ways to die in prison,” he declared to the US channel NewsNation earlier this month. “Suicide, natural causes or murder. And Jeff was murdered. I want to know who killed him and on whose behalf.” He then cryptically claimed that “more autopsy facts will be coming out in February that prove” Jeffrey was killed. “Why the cover-up?” he asked. “Why the charade? Who are they trying to protect?” 

Strong words indeed. What's particularly striking is how the younger Epstein brother, who maintained a very low public profile throughout his sibling's life, has decided to stick his head above the proverbial parapet to become a part of this grim circus of intrigue and insinuation. Despite being only a year or so apart, “most people didn't know Jeff had a brother,” he told The Telegraph last year. 

In stepping out from the shadows, he has inadvertently invited scrutiny into his own life; in the same interview, he admitted that he'd been protected by “armed guards for a while” after receiving threats in the wake of his brother's death. His finances have also become a source of fascination: although his rumoured wealth hardly compares to his brother's millions, Mark, has reportedly been “semi-retired” since the age of 39 and is thought to have donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to charity. “Wealth of Jeffrey Epstein's brother is also a mystery,” claimed the headline of one Wall Street Journal article from 2019. 

Also notable? His willingness to make bold claims about Jeffrey's relationship with Donald Trump. “He didn't tell me what he knew, but Jeffrey definitely had dirt on Trump,” Mark suggested last year (the president has always vehemently maintained that he did not know about Epstein's crimes, and says that they ended their friendship sometime in the 2000s). 

Born a year and a half after Jeffrey in 1954, Mark (nicknamed “Puggy”) grew up in the quiet gated community of Sea Gate in New York's Coney Island. He went on to study art at the prestigious Cooper Union College, then founded a silkscreen printing company, Izmo. Later, though, he swapped these more creative pursuits for property development. And it's here that Mark's business affairs become more complicated. 

In the early Nineties, he launched another company, Ossa Properties, which at one time possessed more than 500 renter-occupied apartments across four co-op projects in New York City. But since Jeffrey's death, it is one particular building, a nondescript block of flats at 301 East 66th Street, that has been the focus of most scrutiny.

Out of the 200 units in this building, the vast majority were owned by Ossa; Mark reportedly bought the property from Leslie Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret, who employed Jeffrey to manage his finances for two decades (Wexner also previously owned the sprawling townhouse at 9 East 71st Street, where Jeffrey later lived and allegedly abused underage girls). Wexner has always maintained that he was “never aware” of Epstein's activities and that he “severed all ties” with him around 2007. “I would not have continued to work with any individual capable of such egregious, sickening behaviour as has been reported about him,” he wrote in a memo to employees in 2019.

Jeffrey is thought to have rented a number of apartments at number 301 from his brother; the building's address was listed in his notorious “black book” as “apt. for models”. 

The 71-year-old property developer has spent the past few years doubling down on the theory that his older sibling's death was murder, not suicide

It is here that the eldest Epstein is alleged to have housed associates and models linked to MC2, the modelling agency funded by Jeffrey and founded by his friend Jean-Luc Brunel (who was later accused in court documents of procuring girls for the financier, as well as sexual harassment and rape; he denied the charges before he died in prison in 2022). Mark, meanwhile, has repeatedly stressed that he did not know his brother's actions or his alleged crimes. “I don't live in that building, I don't monitor who uses those apartments,” he told Crain's in 2019. “I'm not sure who pays it, but Jeff's been renting there for years.” 

Mark has also shut down any attempts to link Ossa with J Epstein & Co, his brother's business. Documents filed by a Harlem-based charter school suggested that Jonathan Barrett, a proposed board member for the school, worked for both Ossa and J Epstein & Co over four years in the Nineties. Despite Barrett's employment seeming to connect the two companies, Mark said this was a “mistake”, and told Crain's that “there's no business relationship between those entities”.

When he has been asked about his financial affairs and how they might have overlapped with his brother's, Mark has offered only brusque responses. “I don't have time to talk about it, and I don't see any purpose in talking about it with anybody,” he told the Wall Street Journal in the summer of 2019, shortly after Jeffrey's death. “Since the president of the USA won't divulge his business info, and there are many more compelling reasons for him to do so, and since I have not been accused of wrongdoing by any government agency, I see no reason why I or any other American should either,” he hit back at The Daily Beast around the same time. 

Should Jeffrey have died without a will, Mark, as his only close living relative, would have inherited the entirety of his estimated $577m estate. However, just two days before his death, he made a new will, one that placed his assets into a private trust. And in doing so, he shielded the identities of his beneficiaries from public view (Mark, for his part, has said he was not among them). 

The developer has painted a somewhat contradictory picture of his relationship with his disgraced brother. According to one interview with The Guardian, they'd only occasionally been in touch after their mother died in 2004; he's also said that when he identified Jeffrey's body after his death, it marked the first time he'd seen him in seven years. Yet when his sibling had pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking of minors a few months before, Mark had offered his home in Florida to guarantee Jeffrey's bail bond (the request was denied). 

He has also repeatedly claimed (including in a 2009 deposition) that he once flew on his older sibling's private plane with Donald Trump in the late Nineties; emails unveiled during the release of the Epstein files, meanwhile, appear to show the pair joking about Trump as recently as 2018. 

It's far from the only time that Mark has poured scorn on the president, distancing himself from his former friend. He's described Trump and Epstein as “extremely close”, and cast doubt upon the POTUS's assertions that they'd ceased all contact in the early Noughties – and he has even claimed that they'd spoken in the aftermath of the 2016 election. 

“Jeffrey told me that… it was after the election that Trump called him and it was sort of like, ‘Can you believe this?' Because nobody believed Trump was going to win,” Mark told CNN in November. (Trump, meanwhile, has said he has “nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein” and “threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert”.)

But, it is Mark's firm conviction that his brother was murdered that has generated the most headlines. Shortly after identifying his brother's body, he hired the forensic pathologist and former New York City chief medical examiner Dr Michael Baden, who disputed the official conclusion of suicide. According to Baden, Jeffrey had a number of injuries that are “extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation”.

In 2023, a report from a US justice department watchdog admitted that “negligence, misconduct and outright job performance failures” at Manhattan's Metropolitan correctional centre provided [Epstein] with the opportunity to take his own life”. It also cited issues with security cameras, and guards failing to check in on the prisoner as required. Yet it did not find “evidence contradicting the FBI's determination there was no criminality in connection with how Epstein died”. 

This, however, does not seem to have satisfied Mark, who has again and again called for “a full investigation” into his older brother's death; in the same year the watchdog report was released, he even submitted a tip to the FBI, writing: “Jeffrey Epstein was murdered in his jail cell. I have reason to believe he was killed because he was about to name names.” 

The exact nature and source of the new “autopsy facts” that Mark promises will be released in February remain unknown for now. But if this case has taught us anything, we can surely expect that any such details will probably raise more questions than answers – and only lead conspiracy theorists further down the rabbit hole.

A decade of observations of four planets around the young planetary system V1298 Tau revealed a rare, long-sought missing link in planet formation.

Astronomers have gotten a rare glimpse at four baby planets as they're growing up, and it reveals something surprising: These toddler worlds are getting lighter as they age.

The quadruplet worlds orbit in tightly packed paths around the star V1298 Tau, a young system that's just 20 million years old (compared with our sun's 4.5 billion years) located about 350 light-years from Earth. A new analysis, which drew on a decade of observations, shows that the planets are surprisingly lightweight, with low densities — so puffed up, in fact, that researchers likened them to Styrofoam.

The findings offer a rare snapshot of planetary architecture just after formation, the researchers said — a long-sought-for ""missing link"" between newborn disks of gas and dust and the mature planetary systems astronomers commonly observe across the Milky Way.

Those older systems are often crowded with planets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune on tight, Mercury-like orbits. The origins of such worlds have remained one of astronomy's enduring mysteries.

""What's so exciting is that we're seeing a preview of what will become a very normal planetary system,"" study lead author John Livingston, an assistant professor at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, said in a statement. ""We've never had such a clear picture of them in their formative years.""

Over time, the bloated worlds around V1298 Tau are expected to shrink as they shed their thick atmospheres, eventually becoming super-Earths and sub-Neptunes — planetary types that are absent from our own solar system but ubiquitous throughout the galaxy.

By capturing the planets at such a pivotal stage of development, the study, published Jan. 7 in the journal Nature, enables astronomers to trace the chaotic processes that sculpt planetary systems over billions of years.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The four planets orbiting V1298 Tau were first identified in 2019 in data from NASA's Kepler space telescope. One is roughly Jupiter-size, while the other three fall between the sizes of Neptune and Saturn.

What immediately set the system apart was its crowded layout of multiple oversized planets packed into relatively tight orbits — a configuration known in only one other system, Kepler-51, among more than 500 known multi-planet systems.

 




While the planets' existence was clear, their fundamental properties remained elusive. To pin them down, Livingston and his team embarked on a nearly decade-long observation campaign using half a dozen telescopes in space and on the ground. They tracked the planets as they passed in front of their star — events known as transits, which cause tiny dips in starlight that reveal a planet's size and orbital period.

Crucially, small variations in the timing of the transits, caused by the planets tugging gravitationally on one another, enabled the team to measure their masses. The technique is especially powerful because it is largely immune to interference from stellar flares common around young stars, the study noted.

But the method only works if astronomers know each planet's orbital period precisely — and for the outermost planet, V1298 Tau e, that information was missing. Only two of its transits had ever been observed, separated by 6.5 years across observations from Kepler and NASA's exoplanet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) telescope, leaving astronomers unsure how many transits had gone unseen in between, according to the study.

A stroke of good luck came when the ground-based Las Cumbres Observatory network — which operates telescopes in the United States, Chile and South Africa — spotted a third transit, enabling the researchers to finally lock down the planet's orbit and model the system's full gravitational choreography.

""I couldn't believe it!"" study co-author Erik Petigura, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCLA, said in the statement. ""The timing was so uncertain that I thought we would have to try half a dozen times at least. It was like getting a hole-in-one in golf.""

The results showed that despite being five to 10 times Earth's radius, the planets have masses only five to 15 times greater than Earth's, making them among the least dense planets ever discovered, Livingston said.

""By weighing these planets for the first time, we have provided the first observational proof,"" study co-author Trevor David, an astrophysicist formerly at the Flatiron Institute in New York, who led the system's discovery in 2019, said in the statement. ""They are indeed exceptionally 'puffy,' which gives us a crucial, long-awaited benchmark for theories of planet evolution.""

—Some objects we thought were planets may actually be tiny black holes from the dawn of time

—Giant cosmic 'sandwich' is the largest planet-forming disk ever seen — Space photo of the week

The team then simulated the planets' evolution and found that they have already lost much of their original atmospheres and cooled faster than predicted by standard models.

""But they're still evolving,"" study co-author James Owen, an associate professor of astrophysics at Imperial College London, said in the statement. The planets are expected to continue shedding gas and contracting into super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, he said.

""Over the next few billion years, they will continue to lose their atmosphere and shrink significantly, transforming into the compact systems of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes we see throughout the galaxy,"" Owen added.

We've all dealt with bad internet connections. But could the entire internet ever collapse?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Whether it disrupts access at work or makes your favorite show buffer at its most suspenseful moment, the inconvenience of an unreliable internet connection is something we've all experienced. Large-scale outages over the years have served as reminders that the internet can also face more widespread issues and bring everyday tasks to a halt. But would it ever be possible for the entire internet, all across the world, to go down?

The internet is often called a ""network of networks,"" including those linking devices across homes, businesses, public spaces and more. For the entire internet to go down, therefore, many pieces of infrastructure would need to be impacted within a short time.

""It is possible but would require significant resources and/or huge coincidences which makes it a highly unlikely, but possible, event,"" George Cybenko, a professor of engineering who specializes in information systems and theory at Dartmouth College, told Live Science in an email.

 




Sign up for our weekly Life's Little Mysteries newsletter to get the latest mysteries before they appear online.

Quite a bit of ""heterogeneity, randomness and distributed asynchronicity"" were built into the internet from the start, so a whole-system failure is very unlikely and would be extremely difficult to cause, Cybenko said. ""We have local networks as well, say within a home or a business, that could continue to function even if the global nature of the internet has failed,"" he explained.

When information is shared over the internet — for example, as a text message is sent from one smartphone to another — it is broken into small packets of information, each of which is routed through the quickest available path through the network. That means that, even if one of these routes is compromised, the message can still travel because it has a long list of alternatives, according to The Open University.

This design consideration alone protects the entire network from completely failing due to either physical damage — for example, if an undersea cable were cut or a large internet hub lost power — or software damage, whether caused by systems issues or hackers. Even when a large infrastructure provider, like Cloudflare, goes down, the disruption may last only a few hours and cannot spread to other providers or systems.

If a larger outage were to occur — for instance, from a powerful and unexpected solar storm — repairs could take time to resolve. However, many governments and large companies have plans for how to recover from a large internet outage and resume operations as quickly as possible, which often include tools like cloud storage systems and backup power generators, Cybenko said.

 




Conversely, some governments have shut off the internet in times of massive protests. This is accomplished by dismantling or destroying internet infrastructure like power grids and fiber optic cables, or throttling — intentionally limiting the processing speed of an internet connection via broadband providers, according to the World Economic Forum. But even those intentional outages can be resolved relatively quickly.

""It is surprising how rapidly people can recover [the internet] — it continues to befuddle people how resilient the internet is,"" William Dutton, a senior fellow and advisory board member at the Oxford Internet Institute and the University of Oxford's first professor of internet studies, told Live Science.

In the meantime, though, the impacts of such an outage could go much further than inconvenience. Critical infrastructure, such as hospital IT systems, often depend on the internet, and essential services, like power grids and traffic management, could be shut off indefinitely.

—What happens when a plane makes an emergency landing?

—Why do AI chatbots use so much energy?

—Will we ever have quantum laptops?

""The more central the internet becomes to so many different functions, from health care to even warfare, the more critical it is that it be secure and that it be reliable,"" Dutton said. ""These kinds of outages and so forth are obviously concerning, even for short periods of time.""

Since the internet's invention, fears have circulated that as it continues to expand, its foundations run the risk of being strained or overloaded. But Dutton said this is a common misconception.

""The more you add nodes and so forth, the internet actually becomes more resilient — growth actually makes it stronger rather than weaker,"" Dutton said. ""It's certainly possible, but I doubt that it will collapse at all.""

In this episode, Michael Shermer talks with filmmaker James Fox, whose work has helped push UFOs, now often called UAPs, out of the tabloid shadows and into congressional hearings, radar logs, and sworn testimony.

Fox has spent three decades interviewing fighter pilots, radar operators, intelligence officials, scientists, and firsthand witnesses. His conclusion is not that we know what these objects are, but that dismissing them no longer works. Around 90 to 95 percent of sightings collapse under scrutiny. The remaining cases do not.

The question is: What are we supposed to do with what's left?

James Fox is a film director widely regarded as one of the leading voices in UFO filmmaking. He is known for documentaries such as The Phenomenon, The Program, and Moment of Contact, several of which are frequently cited among the best UFO documentaries ever made.

Iran's president warned on Sunday that any U.S. strike would trigger a “harsh response” from Tehran after an Iranian official in the region said at least 5,000 people – including about 500 security personnel – had been killed in nationwide protests.

Iran's protests, ‍sparked last ​month in Tehran's Grand Bazaar over economic grievances, swiftly turned political and spread nationwide, drawing participants from across generations and income groups – shopkeepers, students, men and women, the poor and the well-off – calling for the end of clerical rule.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if protesters continued to be killed on the streets or were executed. He said in an interview with Politico on Saturday: “it's time to look for new leadership in Iran.”

Iran indicated on ⁠Sunday it might go ahead with execution of people detained during the unrest, and with its clerical rulers facing mounting international pressure over the bloodiest unrest since the 1979 Islamic revolution, is seeking to deter Trump from stepping in.

Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian on X warned that Tehran's response “to any unjust aggression will be harsh and regrettable,” adding that any attack on the country's supreme leader is “tantamount to an all-out war against the nation.”

No sign of further protests in Iran as senior cleric calls for executions, threatens Trump

Opinion: Can Donald Trump make Iran great again?

Protests dwindled ‌last week following a violent crackdown.

U.S.-based rights ‍group HRANA said on Saturday the death toll had reached 3,308, with another 4,382 cases under review. It said it had confirmed ‍more than 24,000 arrests.

On Friday, Trump thanked Tehran's leaders in a social ‌media post, saying they had called off scheduled executions of 800 people. He has moved U.S. military assets into ⁠the region but has not specified what he might do.

A day later, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei branded Trump a “criminal,” acknowledging “several thousand deaths” that he blamed on “terrorists and ​rioters” linked to the U.S. and Israel.

Iran's judiciary indicated that executions may go ahead.

“A series of actions have been identified as Mohareb, which is among the most severe Islamic punishments,” Iranian judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir told a news conference on Sunday.

Mohareb, an Islamic legal term meaning to wage war against God, is punishable by death under Iranian law.

The Iranian official told Reuters that the verified death toll was unlikely to “increase sharply,” adding “Israel and armed groups abroad” ​had supported and equipped those taking to the streets.

The clerical establishment regularly blames unrest on foreign enemies, including the U.S. and Israel, an arch foe of the Islamic Republic which launched military strikes in June.

Internet blackouts were partly lifted for a few hours on Saturday but internet monitoring group NetBlocks said they later resumed.

One resident in Tehran said that last week he had witnessed riot police directly shooting at a group of protesters, who were mostly young men and women. Videos circulating on social media, some of which have been verified by Reuters, have shown security forces crushing demonstrations across the country.

The Iranian official, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, also said some ⁠of the heaviest clashes and highest number of deaths were in the Iranian Kurdish areas in the country's northwest.

Kurdish separatists have been active there and flare-ups have been among the most ‌violent in past periods of unrest.

Three sources told Reuters on Jan. 14 that armed Kurdish separatist groups sought to cross the border into Iran from Iraq in a sign of foreign entities potentially seeking to take advantage of instability.

Faizan Ali, a 40-year-old medical doctor from Lahore, said he had to cut short his trip to Iran to visit his Iranian wife in the central city of Isfahan as “there was no internet or communication with my family in Pakistan.”

“I saw a violent mob burning ‌buildings, banks and cars. I also witnessed an individual stab a passerby,” he told Reuters upon his arrival back in Lahore.

Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Rashid Shaheed runs a kickoff return in for a touchdown during Saturday's game against the San Francisco 49ers.Stephen Brashear/The Associated Press

Richard Sherman, Kam Chancellor and Doug Baldwin hyped up the famed “12th Man” crowd in Seattle, providing a throwback to the Seahawks' fearsome “Legion of Boom” teams from the 2010s.

Then, in their first playoff game in front of home fans in nearly a decade, the Seahawks found a new level of dominance.

Rashid Shaheed returned the returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown, Kenneth Walker III rushed for three scores and Seattle forced three turnovers in a never-in-doubt 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers on Saturday night that sent the top-seeded Seahawks to the NFC championship game.

“One of our most complete games, for sure,” defensive lineman Leonard Williams said. “(Shaheed) starting the game off like that set the tone.”

Sam Darnold threw a touchdown pass and got his first career playoff win in his first season with the Seahawks (15-3), who will host either the Chicago Bears or the Los Angeles Rams next Sunday with a trip to the Super Bowl at stake.

The Seahawks led 7-0 13 seconds into the game thanks to Shaheed, who fielded the opening kick and took it 95 yards to the end zone. It was the fourth kickoff return for a touchdown to open a playoff game since 2000 and the longest postseason kick return in franchise history.

“I was so hyped,” defensive lineman Byron Murphy II said. “I wasn't expecting that, but when he did it, I knew the game was over then. I already knew.”

Darnold, who had been listed as questionable because of an oblique injury, guided the Seahawks on two more scoring drives before San Francisco got on the board with the first of its two field goals. As he has all season, Darnold impressed his teammates with his toughness.

“He told us he was going to do whatever it takes to get back and play for us,” offensive lineman Grey Zabel said. “That was a gutsy performance by him, not feeling his best. He continues to just be a leader in the huddle, on the field, on the sidelines.”

After he flopped in his playoff debut last season with the Minnesota Vikings by taking nine sacks in a 27-9 loss to the Rams, Darnold completed 12 of 17 passes for 124 yards and connected with Jaxon Smith-Njigba for a touchdown in the star receiver's playoff debut.

Seattle hadn't played in the postseason since the 2020 season, when it lost at home to the Rams with no fans in the stands because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The 49ers (13-6) were never competitive in the second-most lopsided playoff loss in franchise history. San Francisco lost 49-3 to the New York Giants in the divisional round in the 1986 season.

The Niners were missing three injured All-Pros: tight end George Kittle, linebacker Fred Warner and defensive end Nick Bosa. Star left tackle Trent Williams, who played through a hamstring injury, was proud of his team for getting as far in the playoffs as it did.

“When you're playing with guys you're signing off the practice squad,” Williams said, “guys (you are) taking off the street – you got to temper expectations a bit.”

Brock Purdy completed 15 of 27 passes for 140 yards with an interception and a lost fumble against the Seahawks' “Dark Side” defense. Seattle also recovered a fumble by tight end Jake Tonges.

“Everything's working for us, to be honest,” safety Nick Emmanwori said. “Everything's working. We fly to the ball, we've got (a) great scheme, great coaches, great players. I (think) it's hard for teams to find a way to score on us or beat us straight up.”

Walker's three rushing touchdowns tied him with Shaun Alexander for the most in a playoff game in franchise history. Two of the scores came after halftime, and he celebrated one by chucking the ball into the crowd.

“I'd do it more,” Walker said, “but I'd get fined for it.”

Walker finished with 116 yards rushing, his most since his rookie year in 2022, and he picked up the slack after Zach Charbonnet was injured during the game. The Seahawks ran for 175 yards, their third most this season.

“You can see it, how they're breathing, they're tired, they're slow to get up,” Walker said. “You can see it's demoralizing to them.”

The Seahawks' front seven made life difficult for Purdy, chasing him across the field while sacking him twice. With the Niners thin at receiver, Purdy scrambled five times for 37 yards and frequently threw on the run.

“It's no secret in terms of their style of play,” Purdy said. “Trying to make a quarterback check it down and play deep to short. Then within that, have a good pass rush. That's a good defense, man.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","How dangerous are Iranian secret services in Germany?","https://www.dw.com/en/how-dangerous-are-iranian-secret-services-in-germany/a-75538204","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:54:56 GMT","

Iranians in exile are being targeted by the regime's secret services, which is believed to be responsible for thousands of deaths since the start of the mass protests in Iran.

While Iran's rulers attempt to crush the popular uprising with extreme brutality and ruthlessness, exiled Iranians around the world fear for the fate of their family members and friends. According to Germany's Federal Statistical Office, around 295,000 people with Iranian roots live in Germany (as of 2024). In 2021, almost half of them had a German passport.

Along with worrying about their relatives back in Iran, many of them are also concerned about their own safety. This is especially true if they are politically active or work in journalism. Such individuals can quickly become targets of Iranian intelligence services, which are very active — and dangerous — in Germany, according to the country's domestic intelligence agency.

""It can be assumed that Iranian intelligence services will increase their persecution abroad, partly due to current events,"" wrote the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, in response to a query from DW. 

It added: ""Transnational repression measures by Iranian intelligence services against dissident organizations and individuals from the diaspora include targeted espionage, discrediting, intimidation, threats, and even the use of violence."" Their aim, the statement added, is to suppress opposition activities and coerce cooperation in order to spy on the regime opposition abroad.

In light of the escalating violence of the Islamic regime in Iran, such assessments are frighteningly real. Several thousand people are said to have already been killed, though the information on arrests and deaths cannot be independently verified.

It is also difficult to gauge whether Iranian intelligence services are now stepping up their activities in Germany in the immediate aftermath of the mass protests. In principle, what the BfV has been observing for many years still applies: ""Espionage activities by Iranian intelligence services often serve to plan state-sponsored terrorist activities, including the abduction or even killing of the target person.""

The BfV has also warned that people living in Germany could fall victim to such operations, referring specifically to the case of a man with Iranian and German citizenship. During a trip to a country neighboring Iran in 2020, Jamshid Sharmahd was abducted and, based on initial reports, executed four years later. Later reports indicated that he had died shortly before the planned execution.

The BfV sees a pattern at work here: ""It can be assumed that Iran will continue to arrest Western nationals under fabricated pretexts and use them as leverage in a kind of 'hostage policy.'""

In light of such fates, the BfV has often warned against traveling to Iran and neighboring countries: ""Iranian intelligence services use offensive and aggressive approaches to establish contact with people entering Iran, which can also lead to detention and interrogation lasting several days.""

The German government responded to the death of Jamshid Sharmahd in 2024 by closing the three Iranian consulates general in Frankfurt am Main, Munich, and Hamburg. Some of the diplomatic staff had to leave Germany. Iran's only diplomatic presence in Germany is now its embassy in Berlin.

The closure of the consulates is likely to have made it more difficult for the regime to deploy spies disguised as diplomats in Germany, a practice that is widespread internationally. The long-standing economic sanctions on Iran mean that espionage abroad is particularly important for the country to find expertise for its controversial nuclear program.

According to the BfV, cyberespionage has been part of the Iranian secret service's repertoire since at least 2013. Economic interests play just as much a role in this as attempts to intimidate those whom the regime considers its worst enemies: People who are committed to freedom of expression and human rights.

""This involves attacking the private email and social media accounts of members of the diaspora. Iranian intelligence services can then use the stolen data to create movement profiles of those affected, investigate their everyday lives, and uncover their private and professional networks,"" the BfV told DW.

Iran's intelligence activities in Germany go far beyond industrial espionage and spying on the Iranian opposition diaspora.

In November 2022, a school located in the neighborhood of the synagogue in Bochum (North Rhine-Westphalia) was damaged by an incendiary device. The following year, the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court sentenced a man to several years in prison for the crime. The court found that the attack had been planned by an Iranian government agency.

White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller explains how federal law applies regarding Minnesota and illegal immigration on 'My View with Lara Trump.'

President Donald Trump's administration is preparing 1,500 troops for potential deployment to Minnesota, a senior U.S. official confirmed to Fox News.

The official says the U.S. Army's 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska and specializes in cold-weather and mountain warfare, has given prepare to deploy orders. The Washington Post was first to report the Pentagon's readiness.

""The Department of War is always prepared to execute the orders of the Commander-in-Chief if called upon.,"" Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement to Fox News.

Trump on Thursday threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy U.S. military forces to Minnesota if state officials do not start cracking down on anti-ICE agitators.

""If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

Minneapolis and St. Paul are already hosting some 3,000 federal agents deployed there after a massive fraud scandal rocked the state late last year.

Protesters across the Twin Cities have followed and harassed federal agents as they carry out operations, leading to confrontations and the killing of activist Renee Nicole Good by federal agents in the opening days of January.

Trump toned down the pressure in a statement on Friday, saying he did not see at that point a reason to invoke the Insurrection Act.

""I believe it was Bush, the elder Bush, he used it, I think 28 times,"" Trump told reporters while departing the White House. ""It's been used a lot. And if I needed it, I'd use it. I don't think there's any reason right now to use it, but if I needed it, I'd use it. It's very powerful.""

The readiness order for the 11th Airborne Division was given prior to the Friday statement.

The Insurrection Act reportedly has not been invoked since the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which began after four police officers were acquitted in the beating of Rodney King.

Despite Trump's threat, some Republicans are resistant to the idea of using the centuries-old law.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., seemed to downplay Trump's threat, placing his hope in local law enforcement's ability to ""settle things down.""

""Hopefully the local officials working with not only the federal law enforcement, ICE and other agencies, but also the local law enforcement officials, will be able to settle things down,"" Thune told reporters.

 A 'Fox News Sunday' panel debates whether President Donald Trump's restrained tone on Iran signals caution or preparation as protests continue, the latest on the death toll and more.

The World Economic Forum is facing calls to freeze out members of the Iranian regime from a summit in Davos this week.

The Iran watchdog group United Against Nuclear Iran sent a letter to WEF President Borge Brende on Friday urging the group not to invite any officials from the Islamic Republic of Iran. The group tells Fox News Digital that WEF did not respond to the letter, and instead the forum added an interview with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to the summit's schedule on Sunday.

WEF did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

UANI CEO Mark Wallace, who previously served as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under President George W. Bush, cited human rights group reports regarding the mass slaughter of Iranian civilians by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime.

""Just this month, the Iranian regime has carried out what some believe to be the largest massacre in its history,"" Wallace wrote to Brende. ""Araghchi is a member of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), which reportedly issued an order to use live fire on Iranian civilians protesting. Estimates suggest the regime killed at least 12,000 and up to 20,000 Iranians over the course of a few days in January as they exercised their fundamental rights to demonstrate against the Ayatollah and his tyranny.""

""Hosting Iranian regime officials, such as Araghchi, who whitewash this record is deeply offensive and would be wholly inappropriate to platform at a Forum whose theme this year is 'A Spirit of Dialogue.' Instead of dialogue, the Islamic Republic offered bullets to these brave Iranians,"" Wallace continued.

Iran's supreme leader publicly acknowledged for the first time Saturday that thousands of people were killed during recent anti-government protests, according to reporting from the BBC.

U.S.-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency estimates that more than 3,000 people were killed over roughly three weeks of unrest, though Iranian authorities have not released an official death toll and other estimates have been higher.

Videos authenticated by BBC Persian and BBC Verify show Iranian security forces firing on demonstrators during the unrest.

Trump told Politico on Saturday that ""it's time to look for new leadership in Iran,"" after being read a series of hostile posts from Khamenei's X account accusing the president of responsibility for the violence.

""What he is guilty of, as the leader of a country, is the complete destruction of the country and the use of violence at levels never seen before,"" Trump said, according to Politico. ""Leadership is about respect, not fear and death.""

The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers in Alaska to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota, the site of large protests against the government's deportation drive, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Sunday.

The army placed the units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence in the midwestern state escalates, the officials said, though it is not clear whether any of them will be sent.

President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to use the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces if officials in the state do not stop protesters from targeting immigration officials after a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

But if the troops are deployed, it is unclear whether the Trump administration would invoke the Insurrection Act. Even without invoking the act, a president can deploy active-duty forces for certain domestic purposes such as protecting federal property, which Trump cited as a justification for sending Marines to Los Angeles last year.

In addition to the active-duty forces, the Pentagon could also attempt to deploy newly created National Guard rapid-response forces for civil disturbances.

The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment on the order, which was first reported by ABC News.

""If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

The soldiers subject to deployment specialize in cold-weather operations and are assigned to two U.S. Army infantry battalions under the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, the officials said.

Confrontations between residents and federal officers have become increasingly tense in Minneapolis, Minnesota's most-populous city, after an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Good, a U.S. citizen and mother of three, on January 7 as she was driving away after being ordered to exit her car.

Trump, a Republican, has sent nearly 3,000 federal agents from ICE and Border Patrol to Minneapolis and neighboring St. Paul since early last week, as part of a wave of interventions, mostly to cities run by Democratic politicians.

He has said troop deployments in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Memphis and Portland, Oregon, are necessary to fight crime and protect federal property and personnel from protesters. But this month he said he was removing the National Guard from Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland, which have faced legal setbacks and challenges.

Local leaders have accused the president of federal overreach and of exaggerating isolated episodes of violence to justify sending in troops.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, against whom the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation, has mobilized the state's National Guard to support local law enforcement and emergency management agencies, the state Department of Public Safety posted on X on Saturday.

Trump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending in immigration agents. The president and administration officials have singled out the state's community of Somali immigrants.

The Insurrection Act is a federal law that gives the president the power to deploy the military or federalize National Guard troops inside the U.S. to quell domestic uprisings.

At least 5,000 people have been killed in protests in Iran, including about 500 security personnel, an Iranian official in the region said on Sunday, citing verified figures and accusing ""terrorists and armed rioters"" of killing ""innocent Iranians.""

Nationwide protests erupted on Dec. 28 over economic hardship and swelled over two weeks into widespread demonstrations calling for the end of clerical rule — resulting in the deadliest unrest since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if protesters continued to be killed on the streets or were executed. In a social media post on Friday, he thanked Tehran's leaders, saying they had called off scheduled executions of 800 people.

A day later, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a public speech, branded Trump a ""criminal"" for the casualties he inflicted on Iran by supporting protesters.

""We will not drag the country into war, but we will not let domestic or international criminals go unpunished,"" Khamenei said, acknowledging ""several thousand deaths"" that he blamed on ""terrorists and rioters"" linked to the U.S. and Israel.

Iran's judiciary indicated that executions may go ahead.

""A series of actions have been identified as Mohareb, which is among the most severe Islamic punishments,"" Iranian judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir told a press conference on Sunday.

Mohareb, an Islamic legal term meaning to wage war against God, is punishable by death under Iranian law.

Trump said in an interview with Politico on Saturday: ""It's time to look for new leadership in Iran.""

U.S.-based rights group HRANA said on Saturday the death toll had reached 3,308, with another 4,382 cases under review. It said it had confirmed more than 24,000 arrests.

The Iranian official said the verified death toll was unlikely to ""increase sharply"", adding ""Israel and armed groups abroad"" had supported and equipped those taking to the streets.

The clerical establishment regularly blames unrest on foreign enemies, including the U.S. and Israel, an arch foe of the Islamic Republic, which launched military strikes in June.

The violent crackdown appears to have broadly quelled protests, according to residents and state media.

One resident in Tehran said he had witnessed riot police directly shooting at a group of protesters, who were mostly young men and women. Videos circulating on social media, some of which have been verified by Reuters, have shown security forces violently cracking down on demonstrations across the country.

The Iranian official, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, also said some of the heaviest clashes and the highest number of deaths were in the Iranian Kurdish areas in the country's northwest.

Kurdish separatists have been active there and flare-ups have been among the most violent in past periods of unrest.

Three sources told Reuters on January 14 that armed Kurdish separatist groups sought to cross the border into Iran from Iraq in a sign of foreign entities potentially seeking to take advantage of instability.

""I am against this regime and have taken part in protests, but I witnessed some armed individuals disguised as protesters shooting at civilians. They were not ordinary protesters; they carried guns and knives,"" an Iranian in a northwestern town told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

The Norway-based Iranian Kurdish rights group Hengaw has said some of the heaviest clashes during the protests that erupted in late December were in Kurdish areas in the northwest.

Getting information out of Iran has been complicated by internet blackouts, which were partly lifted for a few hours early on Saturday. But the internet monitoring group NetBlocks said the blackout appeared to have been reimposed later.

Faizan Ali, a 40-year-old medical doctor from Lahore, said he had to cut short his trip to Iran to visit his Iranian wife in the central city of Isfahan as ""there was no internet or communication with my family in Pakistan"".

""I saw a violent mob burning buildings, banks and cars. I also witnessed an individual stab a passer-by,"" he told Reuters upon his arrival back in Lahore.

                Reading time 3 minutes
      

According to the Sunday Times, a former analyst at the Bank of England (BoE), which is the central bank of the United Kingdom, has written to the bank's governor, Andrew Bailey, regarding the need to prepare for the potential disclosure of alien life by the Trump administration in the United States. The former BoE analyst, Helen McCaw, previously worked in financial security at the bank and helped develop plans for theoretical economic crises, such as the one she now sees as a possibility in a full disclosure scenario.

According to prediction market Polymarket, the potential for alien disclosure is not as farfetched as previously thought, with the odds currently sitting at 12% for such a revelation before 2027, albeit on low trading volume.

There has been an increasing number of credible, high-level government officials speaking up about the UFO (now referred to as UAPs) phenomenon over the past few years, culminating in appearances by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and many others in an associated documentary, the Age of Disclosure. The director of the documentary, Dan Farah, has shared his belief that it's only a matter of time until a sitting U.S. president makes such a disclosure.

Disclosure could cause widespread cases of ontological shock among the general public, which is why McCaw sees the need to make economic preparations in advance. Notably, it is claimed in the Age of Disclosure that former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin once received a briefing on the topic of extraterrestrials due to similar concerns.

“There might be extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence if market participants feel uncertain on how to price assets using any of the familiar methods,” McCaw reportedly wrote in her letter. “If there is an official announcement and we get presented with very clear evidence that nobody is going to dispute, I would say that in a matter of hours, you are going to have total financial instability.”

McCaw also outlined a few different potential scenarios that could occur if disclosure of alien life does indeed take place. One of those scenarios included a flight to bitcoin as a safe haven asset due to the potential destruction of trust in traditional, governmental power structures.

“There might be a rush to digital currencies such as bitcoin, which may prove appealing if people question the legitimacy of government and lose trust in government-backed assets,” wrote McCaw.

The former BoE analyst also shared two differing theories on what could happen with the traditional, analog alternative to bitcoin, which is gold. On the one hand, McCaw saw the potential for the precious metal to enjoy a similar experience to bitcoin as a source of financial safety and security, but on the other hand, there is the potential for fear to enter the gold market due to the potential for “new space-faring technologies” to massively increase the supply of precious metals via new mining projects.

 

This point about gold eventually facing a large devaluation due to space-based mining projects is one that is brought up in debates by bitcoin proponents somewhat often. For example, it was a key point made by the Winklevoss twins when they tried to make the case for bitcoin to Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in a somewhat infamous discussion a few years ago. While mining in space is currently thought to be uneconomical, NASA did launch a research mission to a metal-rich asteroid in 2023.

Bitcoin's difficulty adjustment algorithm (DAA), where the difficulty associated with mining bitcoin is increased when more computing power is pointed at the network, prevents a similar massive increase in supply occurring with the crypto asset. In terms of changes to Bitcoin's monetary policy, social attack vectors are likely the bigger issue, where users are convinced to simply opt into a new, alternative crypto network where the 21 million bitcoin cap has been removed. Quantum computers may also eventually pose a threat to Bitcoin; however, developers are already working on improvement proposals that could be implemented, if necessary.

Going into the weekend, the price of Bitcoin was unable to sustain the bullish momentum it displayed earlier in the past week. Since Friday, January 16th, the world's leading cryptocurrency, repudiated by the price resistance above, now trades in a tight consolidatory bracket. Interestingly, this period of silence has been deemed transient, as recent on-chain data suggests an exciting time ahead for the BTC price.

Kimchi Premium Flips Positive As Local Demand Sees Buildup 

In a January 17 post on the X platform, DeFi asset management platform XWIN Finance released an on-chain report, which suggests that Bitcoin might be closer to reaching a turning point than is apparent in its price action. 

This hypothesis is based on the Bitcoin Kimchi Premium indicator. This measures the percentage difference between a cryptocurrency's price (in this case, Bitcoin) on South Korean exchanges and its price on global exchanges. Simply put, it shows how much more Korean traders are willing to pay for Bitcoin.

When the Kimchi Premium transitions steadily from low or negative levels to cross above historically significant levels, this is typically viewed as a long signal from the metric. This interpretation is because a rising Kimchi Premium reflects growing local demand in South Korea, usually often influenced by retail buyers. 

In essence, Korean buyers are willing to pay more for Bitcoin, hence overwhelming the available supply and consequently pushing prices upwards.

In the post on X, XWIN Finance highlighted that this long signal had been sighted on the indicator. History also attests to the bullish significance of this signal; there have been major price moves to the upside following sustained increases in the Kimchi Premium. 

An example is the last sighting of the long signal in October 2023, where the index rose above a major threshold, as shown in the chart above. The price of Bitcoin witnessed a 370% rally after this signal went off in 2023. 

According to XWIN Research, this same pattern seems to be playing out again in 2026. Hence, if the Kimchi Premium completes its long-signal formation, it could be a sign that buyers are occupying favourable positions for a bullish ride. 

If history does repeat itself, the Bitcoin price could be on track to witness another exciting voyage, with the flagship cryptocurrency possibly putting in a more than 300% surge in the next cycle. 

However, it is worth noting that macro conditions, institutional demand, and derivatives activity would be playing their roles to augment the pattern's plausibility, as it should not be viewed as a standalone bullish sign.

Bitcoin Price At A Glance

As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $95,280, reflecting no significant change in the past 24 hours.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned that excessive protocol complexity undermines the network's fundamental promises of trustlessness and self-sovereignty.

The blockchain architect argued that even networks with thousands of nodes can fail basic decentralization tests if their protocols become too complex for independent verification.

""An important, and perennially underrated, aspect of trustlessness, passing the walkaway test and self-sovereignty is protocol simplicity,"" Buterin wrote.

Buterin identified protocol bloat as Ethereum's critical long-term risk, stemming from the tendency to add features without removing outdated ones.

The developer proposed explicit ""simplification"" and ""garbage collection"" mechanisms to counteract this trend.

He outlined three key metrics for measuring simplification: minimizing total lines of code, avoiding dependencies on complex cryptographic components, and adding protocol invariants that strengthen security guarantees.

Examples of successful simplification include Ethereum's transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, EIP-6780 which limited the selfdestruct opcode's functionality, and EIP-7825 which capped per-transaction gas usage.

The warning signals a philosophical shift in Ethereum development after what Buterin characterized as a 15-year ""adolescence stage"" focused on rapid experimentation.

Complex protocols create dependencies on specialized experts who understand intricate technical details, contradicting cryptocurrency's promise of permissionless verification.

Buterin suggested future changes could include Rosetta-style backwards compatibility, where legacy features become smart contract code rather than mandatory protocol requirements.

The developer also proposed eventually transitioning from the Ethereum Virtual Machine to simpler alternatives like RISC-V, with EVM functionality preserved through smart contracts.

""These first fifteen years should in part be viewed as an adolescence stage where we explored a lot of ideas and saw what works and what is useful and what is not,"" Buterin stated.

The comments come as Ethereum faces mounting competition from alternative layer-1 blockchains that prioritize different trade-offs between complexity and functionality.

Veteran trader Peter Brandt has issued one of his most sweeping and pessimistic warnings yet on the future of altcoins. He sees them as collateral damage in what he sees as the early stages of a broader monetary reset.

Brandt argued that the erosion of trust in government-issued money is already underway. In his view, this process will not benefit all digital assets equally (or at all). 

""...the destruction of fiat has begun. Gold will return to the world's most dependable store of wealth. USD denominated assets will lose value to physical commodities — which, BTW, may or may not include Bitcoin. Altcoins will become more worthless than USDs,"" Brandt said.

The problem with digital gold

At the same time, Brandt argues that Bitcoin has already surpassed gold as a store of value

The popular chartist claims that digital gold can simply be reproduced by the next improved digital gold.

Digital gold can simply be reproduced by the next improved digital gold

A unique phenomenon 

Recently, Brandt reiterated that Bitcoin is an unprecedented market phenomenon. 

Throughout Bitcoin's roughly 15‑year history, as Brandt said, there has never been anything like it, and there may never be anything like it again. 

Brandt expanded on this by pointing to Bitcoin's repeating cycle of explosive growth followed by deep drawdowns. 

Over the past decade and a half, Bitcoin has experienced five major “parabolic advances” when plotted on a logarithmic scale, and each has been followed by declines of at least 80 % from peak. 

In his interpretation, that pattern is still in play, and the current cycle has not yet completed its downward phase.

Ras Al Khaimah, United Arab Emirates, January 18th, 2026, Chainwire

Trusted Smart Chain has reached a significant milestone in this context by completing a comprehensive security audit conducted by CertiK, a firm widely recognized for its work in blockchain security research and smart contract auditing.

The audit represents an important step in Trusted Smart Chain's broader strategy to serve as a blockchain purpose built for launching tokenized securities and real world assets, with security and compliance embedded at the base layer of the network.

Security has become foundational for blockchain infrastructure because failures at the protocol level no longer remain isolated. When blockchains support tokenized financial assets that represent real economic value, vulnerabilities can affect applications, investors, issuers, and capital markets simultaneously. As a result, base layer security has become a prerequisite for any blockchain that aims to support real world asset tokenization at scale.

Modern security audits play a critical role in addressing this risk. Rather than serving as surface level validations, audits are technical examinations designed to assess smart contract logic, execution paths, permissioning structures, and system behavior under adversarial conditions. For a blockchain intended to host tokenized securities and regulated assets, this scrutiny is especially important because every application and issuance built on the network inherits its security model.
		



Completing a CertiK audit signals that a blockchain's core infrastructure has undergone independent review using methodologies designed to reflect real world threat environments. It also establishes a baseline for ongoing monitoring and continuous improvement as the network evolves.

Trusted Smart Chain's approach reflects a broader architectural philosophy focused on enabling compliance on chain finance. Rather than accelerating toward deployment and addressing risk later, the network prioritized verification and alignment early in its development. This includes security at the protocol level as well as alignment with regulatory considerations that are increasingly relevant as real world assets move on chain.

That alignment is central to Trusted Smart Chain's long term focus on real world asset tokenization. As tokenized securities, private market assets, and other regulated instruments are issued on blockchain infrastructure, networks must support requirements around accountability, record integrity, and operational reliability. Security and compliance function together as foundational elements rather than separate layers.

According to Brant Frank, CTO of Trusted Smart Chain, the CertiK audit fits within a broader effort to design blockchain infrastructure capable of supporting regulated financial activity and real world asset issuance at scale.

Frank brings more than a decade of experience designing large scale systems across enterprise software, healthcare, government technology, and blockchain. His background as a software architect and blockchain engineer has informed Trusted Smart Chain's emphasis on disciplined development, security review, and infrastructure designed to support real world use cases.
		



As blockchain infrastructure continues to converge with traditional financial systems, expectations around verification, auditability, and regulatory alignment are likely to increase. Networks that aim to support tokenized real world assets must demonstrate that they can operate within these constraints while maintaining the benefits of on-chain settlement and programmability.

The completion of the CertiK audit positions Trusted Smart Chain within this next phase of blockchain infrastructure development. A secure and compliant foundation enables issuers to launch tokenized securities with greater confidence, allows developers to build applications that interact with real world assets, and supports ecosystem growth without compounding hidden risk.

Security and compliance remain ongoing commitments rather than static achievements. Protocols evolve, regulatory frameworks develop, and infrastructure must adapt accordingly. The audit provides a foundation from which Trusted Smart Chain can continue refining its role as a blockchain designed specifically for tokenized securities and real world asset tokenization.

As real world assets increasingly move on chain, blockchains built with security, regulatory alignment, and infrastructure discipline are likely to define the future of this market.

With the completion of its CertiK audit, Trusted Smart Chain continues to position itself at the intersection of blockchain security, compliance, and real world asset tokenization.

Scientists are raising new concerns after a study found that microplastics are interfering with the ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide, a process that plays a vital role in regulating Earth's temperature.

Microplastics are tiny plastic particles measuring less than five millimeters. Over time, they have spread across nearly every part of the planet. Researchers have detected them in deep ocean waters, lakes and rivers, the air, soil, Arctic ice, and even inside the human body. Their widespread presence poses growing environmental risks. These particles can carry toxic substances that are consumed by wildlife and people, contributing to disease, ecosystem disruption, harm to marine organisms, and declining soil quality.

Despite the urgency of climate change, scientists say the connection between microplastics and climate systems has received far less attention than it deserves, especially in marine environments. As researchers explain in a study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials: Plastics, ""Climate disruption and plastic pollution are two major environmental challenges that intersect in complex ways. MPs (microplastics) influence biogeochemical processes, disrupt oceanic carbon pumps, and contribute directly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.""

In ocean ecosystems, microplastics interfere with natural carbon storage by affecting phytoplankton and zooplankton, organisms that are essential to carbon cycling. The study also highlights the role of the plastisphere, a community of microbes that forms on the surface of microplastics. According to the researchers, this microbial layer contributes to GHG (greenhouse gas production) through its complex biological activity.

Microplastics are already recognized as harmful pollutants, but the study points to an additional and less visible danger. ""Our study shows they also interfere with the ocean's ability to absorb carbon dioxide, a process critical for regulating Earth's temperature,"" said Dr. Ihsanullah Obaidullah, Associate Professor of Integrated Water Processing Technologies at the University of Sharjah and the study's corresponding author.

Dr. Obaidullah added, ""Microplastics disrupt marine life, weaken the 'biological carbon pump,' and even release greenhouse gases as they degrade. Over time, these changes could lead to ocean warming, acidification, and biodiversity loss, threatening food security and coastal communities worldwide.""

A Hidden Climate Threat in Plain Sight

Dr. Obaidullah described the research as a ""collaborative perspective"" involving scientists from China, Hong Kong, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates. ""We have highlighted an overlooked link between microplastics and climate change. We call for urgent global action to address this emerging threat.""

Published under the title ""Microplastics and Global Warming: A Hidden Climate Threat Uncovered in a New Perspective,"" the study provides a scoping review of existing research. By examining where evidence already exists and where gaps remain, the authors identify a largely unrecognized greenhouse effect linked to microplastics.

""Oceans are Earth's largest carbon sink,"" Dr. Ihsanullah explained. ""Microplastics are undermining this natural shield against climate change. Tackling plastic pollution is now part of the fight against global warming.""

The researchers emphasize that ""biological carbon pumping"" -- the ocean's natural process that transfers carbon from the atmosphere into the deep sea layers -- is the main mechanism connecting microplastics to climate change. ""MPs interfere with this process by reducing phytoplankton photosynthesis and impairing zooplankton metabolism,"" the authors write.

Another important factor is the plastisphere. This microbial layer forms biofilms on plastic surfaces in aquatic environments and includes organisms involved in nitrogen and carbon cycles. The researchers warn that microplastics also release greenhouse gases as they degrade, further amplifying their impact on the climate system.

How the Research Was Conducted

Instead of following a traditional systematic review process, the researchers used an integrative narrative approach to examine previous studies. Their work relied on desktop research and drew from peer reviewed articles, international organization reports, and other authoritative sources focused on microplastics, ocean health, climate change, and related social and environmental issues.

Dr. Ihsanullah noted that, unlike protocols such as PRISMA, the study did not apply strict inclusion or exclusion criteria. The goal was to connect concepts and themes across disciplines. In total, the team reviewed 89 studies published mainly after 2015, covering research from 2010 to 2025. This broader approach allowed the authors to assess emerging evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and discuss policy implications related to climate change, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and human rights.

The authors point out that much of the existing research has focused on detecting microplastics and developing cleanup methods. As they write, ""The extent to which microplastics affect climate change, ocean health, and associated systems is currently unknown. This can be mostly because the issue is novel, intricate, and multifaceted. The significant ecological effects of plastic pollution in the oceans are well recognized, but its exact connections to these extensive environmental processes are not well understood.""

To close these gaps, the researchers call for future studies that examine how microplastics interact with climate dynamics. They argue that better understanding these links could lead to a shift in ""perspective in research and policymaking.""

By addressing both ecological and economic impacts, the study aims to support more effective strategies for reducing plastic pollution and limiting its role in worsening problems such as oxygen depletion and ecosystem instability.

Why Plastic Pollution Is So Widespread

Plastics are deeply embedded in modern life because they are durable, affordable, and versatile. They are used in food packaging, medicine, construction materials, insulation, electronics, aircraft components, consumer products, and healthcare applications.

This widespread use has led to enormous production levels. A 2025 U.N. report estimates that more than 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced each year. About half of this material is designed for single use, and less than 10 percent is recycled. Without intervention, annual plastic production could triple by 2060.

So far, humans have produced more than 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic. Around 80 percent of it has ended up in landfills or the environment, while only nine percent has been recycled.

Although plastics offer clear benefits, the authors warn that ""their environmental footprint across the entire life cycle has become a growing concern. These plastics, being highly persistent, have become a pressing global environmental challenge.""

They also note that ""The increasing demand for and excessive consumption of plastic have led to serious challenges for human and ecosystem health, posing threats to environmental sustainability and food safety.""

Calls for Coordinated Global Action

The researchers caution policymakers against overlooking the long term effects of microplastics, even if current impacts seem limited. They write that ""while their (microplastics) current impacts may seem minor, their growing accumulation suggests future significance. The impact of MPs on ocean health, particularly concerning potential ocean warming and acidification, remains an area of concern.""

The authors stress that plastic pollution and climate change must be addressed together. ""In this way, the effects of climate change could be lessened by taking appropriate action to slow down the production of microplastics,"" they state.

Among their recommendations, the researchers urge the United Nations to reconsider how plastics are addressed within the Sustainable Development Goals. They point out that ""plastics are currently represented by a single indicator, which may not adequately capture the widespread risks posed by microplastics across diverse ecological systems.""

They also call for coordinated governance frameworks that address both microplastic pollution and climate change, particularly in relation to ocean warming and acidification.

To protect the oceans and maintain their ability to absorb carbon dioxide, the authors highlight several priorities. These include cutting back on single use plastics, improving waste management systems, encouraging biodegradable alternatives, and expanding research into how microplastics affect ocean temperatures and carbon cycles. They also recommend using AI driven monitoring tools and new materials to reduce plastic waste.

Looking ahead, Dr. Ihsanullah said, ""Our next step is to quantify the climate impact of microplastics and develop integrated solutions. This is not just an environmental issue; it's a global sustainability challenge.""

Unless you're a few centuries old, you haven't. You've had the potential to be competing agaist industrial and computational technology your whole life. Go back further, and the prevalence of slaves served as a similar cost differential (free humans versus enslaved, human versus AI).

Slaves at least still need to be fed and housed, but I'm sure they were tough competition indeed for independent laborers.

Then you've constructed a tautology. Humans remain competitive in various applications of their labour, broadly defined, despite entire categories having become uncompetitive. If we exempt those categories then the historical record looks static. But only because we defined away the change.> Slaves at least still need to be fed and housed, but I'm sure they were tough competition indeed for independent laborersI believe there is evidence for this all over the place. By analogy, however, AI is orders of magnitude less power efficient than humans. This places a floor on the price of AI and thus human labour that competes with it.

It is both more and less power efficient, depending on the task.

I would say they are making the current cost of one's labor ""obsolete"". Most jobs are like this. If you work for yourself, you're trying to make the cost of your labor obsolete in place of cheaper work. If you work for a company, the company  will be trying to make the cost of your labor obsolete in place of cheaper work. Any value captured in the arbitrage of product price and employee pay is seen as the value of management.

You still have to pay taxes, and doing this means giving up on a lot of your existing human connection, joining a community in no small part comprised of crackpots, tanking your quality of life, and losing your influence over the future of broader society.Furthermore, it's a personal solution to a systemic problem. It'll work for a few people, but it's not a fix.

The real risk here is the military implications of pairing AI and robots. If the army doesn't need lots of people then there is a real problem. But robotics will take a long time to get there even in an optimistic case. Labour will still have value for a long time to come.

The issue is if bread becomes insanely cheap and cloth becomes insanely cheap, then a very inefficient weaver can still afford food. It runs in to comparative advantage theory eventually - just because someone else is much more efficient than you at literally everything doesn't mean you can't still do something inefficiently and set up a win-win situation. Although there might still be something better to put your time towards. I recommend managing your own capital - maybe even building it and maintaining it yourself - but people seem dead set against the idea for some reason.I dunno why geohotz thinks in this article that shares in a granary are a bad idea, someone has to profit from storing food. May as well be me. I'll do it if he won't. I like granaries.

So you go after high-income earners who are not concerned with price, but this requires proximity, networking, and then on-going relationship management with a much smaller group of people who are all much more likely to talk to each other.Effectively, this is the problem the grandparent comment outlined with extra steps; it isn't your labor by itself that is uniquely valuable, it is your relationship with buyers, and those relationships can sour. Vendors who signed on with Walmart experienced something similar where they began scaling to meet demand only to find themselves completely reliant on Walmart's orders to service their loans. Walmart was then free to dictate the terms of the relationship. This is a very familiar dynamic in societies that never successfully divorced themselves from feudal ideas (e.g. Most of South Asia, parts of South America).

Mass market handicrafts have never been a viable means of subsistence anywhere, ever, if we benchmark against what I think a reasonable lifestyle looks like. That is why we stopped doing things that way.Nevertheless mass market handicrafts are still a theoretical option. It hasn't become a worse option over time, it is in fact a better option now than it ever was in the past. Today is the best day in history to be a weaver, even for those that do it by hand. A weaver in the 1700s would weep tears of joy at the opportunity to weave things by hand today at market rates. They would say things like ""wow, I can afford a much better life than in the 1700s with my weaving skills"", ""what just happened to me? What was that time portal?"" and ""maybe I should learn to code, they earn even more money than I do"".

There were plenty of craftsmen who lived lifestyles that were acceptable for the time periods they were living in. From around 1400, to around the early 1900s, European settlements consisting of more than a few hundred people would have had blacksmiths, cobblers, tailors, furniture makers, and various other craftsmen. It wasn't until the late 19th century that this arrangement started to be replaced by the economies of scale made possible by the factory system.> A weaver in the 1700s would weep tears of joy at the opportunity to weave things by hand today at market rates.The idea that a medieval peasant would be envious of our standard of living is doing nothing to further the point you are trying to make.

It is a fair chunk of the point I'm making - you still have the option of living like a medieval peasant if that is important to you. The option never went away. It is still on the table. People could have kept doing what they did before and maintained the lifestyle that they were used to. It is more that people choose not to do that and I've been saying a variant of that in every comment in this thread so far. The only people who chose to do it that way wouldn't have if they'd had any alternatives because the lifestyle it enabled was terrible.Having better options available doesn't mean the old option isn't available, more that someone'd need to be either a bit stupid or very motivated to live a particular lifestyle to choose it. it has been a lousy option that led to a mean existence for all of human history. It still does. But in absolute terms, it would be a better option in the modern economy than the ancient one.

I actually did very menial work in a food processing plant while still in education, I'm not better than the people working there but I'm different from them in interests and in upbringing (even though I didn't come from wealth, the people I studied with, shared hobbies with did). I wasn't able to discuss the things I read with these people and they weren't able to talk about their interests. I believe if I had to work there for years or decades it would lead to dysfunction.

When your community was a village of a few hundred collectively sharing resources as a tribe, being a Weaver was extremely valuable and viable. Becsuse a Weaver wasn't worried about weaving 200 baskets to afford a home. We're in a very different model now. So saying it was ""never"" viable is myopic to history.

This is why the population of labor animals plummeted in the 20th century. And to put it plainly, it means that there's no guarantee you can always sell labor for enough to keep your home from getting paved over for a data center.

Comparative advantage has some assumptions built in, which can be violated in practice, especially by technology, especially when you can (we can't yet in general but can in specific domains) build compute and power supplies for that compute for less than it costs to raise a human to the point of being economically productive.There's a few isolated tribes around the world, most famously North Sentinel Island. They have nothing to trade with us, nothing we want to buy. We let them be because even their land itself isn't important to us.

In general, yes. For many groups, no.It assumes that there is something of value for them to do and as shown by masses of long term unemployed in many areas, that is not always the case.For example, people on the autism spectrum and with disabilities have persistently high unemployment. Because of various limitations, there is nothing for them to do in many cases. The market should have corrected this (especially over the long term) if reconstitution was consistently possible.If AI makes all humans seem limited in a similar fashion, the idea of labour reconstitution falls apart.There is also a large portion of the population on social assistance so while there are things they can do, the market value of what they can do is often well below their needs.

> If AI makes all humans seem limited in a similar fashion, the idea of labour reconstitution falls apart.I think the problems here is you're comparing a relative minority to “all humans”. Unfortunately, what affects a minority of society, inherently, has a small effect on society as a whole. If “all humans” now have no employment value because AI or automation can do it all, there will still be a cost to that production. Even if you assume the AI part is $0, the power needed or the raw materials becomes the main cost as opposed to labor. Then you need to have enough demand from those non-working non-wage-earning humans for whatever that AI is producing. Otherwise, what is the point of the production in the first place.Maybe extreme automation would put the wealth gab on hyper drive. Only those handful who happen to own an automated production company can have any income. However, what do you imagine the final outcome of that would be in a democratic society? Like I know it's fashionable to cry at the state of democracy, but despite the recent inflation and affordability crisis and income insecurity etc, we don't have an “all humans” levels of unemployments. What do you think would happen if we automate, and subsequently fire, “all humans”?Let's assume AI will actually replace 99% of jobs eventually. Society will completely change at that time to adapt. What else is the point? Are AIs gonna be producing stuff for other AIs leisure?The problem is that the road to there might be painful before society is forced to change to adapt. It won't all happen at once so it'll keep happening in waves and waves will be painful until they get better then another wave again. That's assuming the prophecy of “all humans” labor is no longer needed.

The post industrial revolution jobs market from 1880-1940s was pretty crappy for labor, and we have no idea how things turned out for the average displaced workers. We do know that there were whole sections of towns called skid rows, we know that there were flop houses. We know huge sections of men lived in boarding homes, and women stayed living with their parents. We've read things like Steinbeck and get a glimpse of the life of desperation at the time.Don't let people fool you that the labor market will look like post WW2 America. It will look like 1880-1940s, during which there were huge labor fights and things were so bad there were 2 world wars.

Before I say why though, there's a lot of bad futures possible even with remote controlled humanoid robots whose only true AI are the basics, to keep themselves standing upright and to walk and run on command without falling over. All those people (even here on HN) who claim (to quote a recent exchange) ""Every $1 taken by illegal workers is $1 stolen from Americans"", how are they going to react to finding every minimum wage job in the US has been replaced with a Tesla Optimus whose ""AI"" is ""actually Indians"" thanks to a low-latency Starlink connection to Jodhpur? How do anti-authority protests (whether anti-ICE or anti-Iranian-government) work with any robots where the ""AI"" is smoke and mirrors of remote control? This is plenty enough for techno-feudalism, even without AI replacing all jobs.But back to the original. As a proof of possibility that tech can, in fact, delete labour: Labour is made of atoms.

Most of those things were actually possible.

What we're saying is that big tech has been too powerful, and too unregulated, for far too long.

However, I wasn't talking specifically about libraries. The web did still exist 20 years ago. Wikipedia is more than 20 years old. And newsgroups have been around much longer too.The web was also mobile accessible for more than 20 years (WAP, for example, was introduced in 1999).There were also phone numbers you could ring who could provide quick searches for information look up. People are most familiar with them in terms of telephone directory services (eg ring an operator to ask for the phone number of someone else) but there were other general knowledge services too. In fact I used one once when my bike chain broke, I walked to a local pay phone, and enquired how to put a chain back on.Even know, there's a plethora of information at local government information and audit offices, which isn't available online. most of which is store on microfilm. A friend needed to visit one office recently to look at historic maps to trace the origins of a public right of way (which is a legal public footpath though farmland in the UK)Like I said before, we weren't living in the dark ages before smartphones came along.

It's not ranting to not ack every positive if the negative clearly outweighs it. I would much rather live 20 years ago than live now without a job. Wouldn't you?Alternatively suppose you get to keep your job. What percentage of the population being unemployed do you think would make it worse for you personally than going back 20 years. Because there is going to be more unemployment and it will affect your environment unless you have got a private island (some people do - some ai owners do)

That's not true. All of the examples you mentioned are possible without Big Tech. There are F/LOSS and community supported alternatives for all of them. Big Tech might've contributed to parts of the technology that make these alternatives possible, but that could've been done by anyone else, and they are certainly not required to keep the technology functional today.Relying on Big Tech is a personal choice. None of these companies are essential to humanity.> none of them is based on surveillance, ads or social media.That's not true either. All Alphabet and Meta products are tied to and supported in some way by advertising. All of these companies were/are part of government surveillance programs.So you're highly overestimating the value of Big Tech, and highly underestimating the negative effects they've had, have, and will continue to have on humanity.

In my home country several old people had to close their shop as they were forced to move to a digital accounting system, they didn't have a choice. My bank only allows me to go to their office without an appointment 1 day a week (maybe not even). My grandpa who doesn't have a phone (he never even got a landline), doesn't have internet and barely even drives, he has to depend on others to call and make appointments. If you want to apply for a job, you need internet connection. Many won't even hire you without owning a car (even if you could perfectly commute with a bicycle or public transport).If you think we're at the end of this 'evolution', we're just getting started. My grandpa could perfectly do everything on his own until 2010, by 2018 it was getting almost impossible, 2026 he feels like a burden for not being into technology.

Until supply grows to saturate demand in whatever market, comparative advantage points to the fastest way to make more money, that money then gets used to construct more servers and data centres, which gets used to saturate supply for the next most profitable market, etc. until there's none left.I wouldn't say ""never"" for AI that can economically substitute all human labour. I think that meaning of AGI/ASI is slightly easier than the ""AI which learns from as few examples as humans do"" meaning, which I also think is possible eventually but don't know how far away it is.

I work for one of these companies. I also have pay bills to pay. I'd like to understand what a real, good alternative is.Frontier labs such as Google DeepMind are not just going to shutter their doors because 10% of the peons dropped their jobs. I believe, at least, that we should be demanding political accountability and safeguards for society. I only get to live once: if I am to spend it for social change, I best maximize by expected return.And quitting a job in a capitalist society probably has negative return overall.

The ""real, good"" part all depends on your expectations of life.There's a real shortage in trades people and I'd love to see ChatGPT fix a leaky pipe, build a house or make a chair. So switching to the trades/manual labor, while financially tough at the beginning might be a good long term choice. But this requires much more physical work than most of us on HN are used to.Moving away from capitalist society into a cheap tiny off grid house in a rural area and leading a much more basic life is also an option. You don't need 100k to survive, but you do need it in populated areas. (Also, I'm European and therefore not dependent on employment for health care, so I'm ignoring that part.)There are many choices we can make that remove our dependence on big tech. But big tech is hella convenient and so is having expendable income, so it's a tough choice to make.

From my experience, the problem I saw, and why I really respect OPs post, is that many good and smart people were lying to themselves in those environments. They'd do exactly what you do and try find reasons to justify working in tech.Go into your average modern tech engineering team at e.g. Amazon, and ask them how many of the engineers in there use and support the software they're creating. They tiny fraction of people who say they do use it and support it, go check their usage, and you'll see half of them were overinflating it. HN knows it better than anywhere: many of these tech companies are not producing great tech to improve people's lives.To you point ""no constructive alternative"" - think about it this way, if you're spending your life writing something you won't even use for reason that boil down to ""it's just not valuable for me, especially knowing how its made"", then doing literally anything other than working there is a more valuable use of _your_ time for you.Look at your household and figure out what you need and what would improve your lives. If it's ""6 figures salary and a world owned by megacorps"", then working in places like Amazon is the best thing you can do for your family.If you're a small household without kids, like a lot of people in these engineering environments, then instead of spending 12 hours a day mon - fri addicted to trying to solve this really cool little engineering problem (which just so happens to help e.g Amazon), you'd be far better solving some really cool little engineering problem that just so happens to help your family, like building some cool home automation thing for them, or working on your own house to make it more efficient so you can use less energy so anyone else working in your house can retire earlier with smaller outgoings. Or even just being a housewife/husband will improve the lives of the people you care about in more valuable and appreciated ways than anything you could do working at Amazon.Now, I appreciate I'm in a lucky place to be able to do this, but if you've been  able to work as an engineer in top engineering environments and this post is relevant to you, then you are already more than lucky enough to be able to walk away from those environments do things that are consciously useful and appreciated by other humans whom you value.

Working to make your home more efficient is not going to suddenly make anyone retire early. That's the stupidest take I have heard. If you have some cool idea which makes home energy usage lower like a revolutionary heat pump, you should build your own company and sell that to everyone and scale up. You sound like a FatFIRE person that has quit professional life and is now trying to justify why sitting at home and helping your family members is a virtuous thing to do as opposed to working for some BigTech.A lot of the danger with BigTech is just the fact they are very big and so have accrued a lot of power. A simple solution is to use the anti-trust laws to break them up into smaller entities. I don't think the problem is the products/services they build.

There is some nuance in what ""not working for big tech"" means though. The general gist is to not take work making tools that can foreseeably be used to hurt people and the social fabric at large. Reject ""disruption."" Don't take money to make your life worse. That sort of thing.

This won't actually work though. The only reason we even have this discussion is because we're rich enough that pure survival isn't even really in our instinct anymore. Most of us haven't experienced actual hardship for years and we live in luxury.There are plenty people in the world who are smart and poor and living tough lives, who are ready to replace people who quit because they have te luxury to quit. Just look at the huge amount of Indian people moving across the world to work in tech. These people aren't going to let the opportunity to significantly improve their lives go because they're going to work on software that might negatively impact society at some point. You could see this exact thing happen when Elon took over Twitter. Many people left because they disagreed with Elon, while many H-1B stuck around because they (and their families) actually had something to lose.I don't think many of us on HN realize how incredibly spoiled we are with the lives we live.

We can see this logic reflected at times in business history. Ford paid workers double the daily wage so they could afford the cars they built and Costco pays employees 50% more than Walmart. They're not doing these things out of the goodness of their heart but out of greed to increase long term profits.

Once the robots, energy, and weapons all belong to the same small group, that group no longer needs to sell anything to anyone. Production continues, but only for themselves and their enclosed system. The rest of humanity becomes a surplus population that can simply be allowed to die off.In other words: the economy you're worried about preserving is already obsolete the moment the owners of the machines no longer require wage slaves or consumers to keep the system running. At that point, mass demand is no longer a feature, it's a bug that gets patched out.

If there is so much of something that everyone can have one, effectively prices would drop until everyone could afford one. Like how even homeless people can afford air, because there is so much of it that there is no point charging people for access. Or YouTube they just let anyone watch it because it is so cheap to push bytes out over the internet.Removing humans from the production process would, in theory, be similar. There is a certain amount that gets produced and we come up with some way to allocate it. Prices and wages adjust to that reality.> We can see this logic reflected at times in business history. Ford paid workers double the daily wage so they could afford the cars they built...That just so story is probably a lie. The math wouldn't work out and Ford would know it - he was just competing with other companies for labour. It is like programmers getting paid huge amounts - it isn't because the companies think it helps them because of some vague circular logic about what happens in the broader market. They just need the skills, now.

Markets and consumers would still exist, unless the AI is smart enough to solve the local knowledge problem via centralized computation.A consumer doesn't have to be a person. It's an abstraction, and behind it sits any entity with capital. That includes non-human entities.An example would be bidirectional trade between an AI company who mines resources, and an AI company who makes robots to mine resources.Or if it's one big monopoly, they can have an internal market to facilitate competition and cooperation, like how Samsung operates.

What we've also seen in recent decades is a massive shift to people borrowing money to pay for luxury goods. This means that businesses can still continue to tank the economy because their profits are propped up by other people's debts.And in fairness, it's not just consumer goods that are sold this way either. Entire businesses are run on borrowed money and suppressed wages with the hope that they win the “business lottery” and receive a massive buyout. Often they're deliberately selling their products below cost price to boost their client portfolio and thus making it entirely uneconomical for normal businesses to compete on price.And then we wonder why the economy is so volatile. The whole thing is held together by gum and prayers and the only people benefiting are those who are already wealthy.

His argument is based on comparative advantage, and he says""The key difference here is that everyone — every single person, every single AI, everyone — always has a comparative advantage at something!"".This is why everyone in the world has a job and a decent salary today, just as humanity will in the future(!!). In reality it is not like this, and he talks about some of the reasons for this in the above mentioned paragraph.I also disagree massively with his discounting of the scenario where energy gets relocated to AI instead of food production. He paints that as unlikely, while I think it is almost inevitable. I don't necessarily think it will happen in one fell swoop with force, but it can definitely happen over a generation through pure market forces. The owners of AI just have more money, and will use this to buy energy. Cost of food will rise compared to the value of labour, aka cost of living will rise, and it will be harder and harder to sustain a family. Since we somehow think that taxing wealth is absurd, we will keep taxing labour.It seems to me that he tries to wave away the fact that if AI becomes much more productive than humans in everything, then economy predicts that it will be allocated the energy, not humans. And he waves this away with 'politics will save us', which I find unlikely.

There's a lot of fear around what will happen with AI, not so much of extinction but rather of two things: fear of losing income, and arguably more importantly, fear of losing identity.People often are invested in what they do to the point that it's who they are. That being replaced or eliminated might be a bigger psychological threat than lack of income, at least to those of us fortunate enough to be well off right now.However, these threats are outweighed by the benefits that AI can eventually bring. Medical advances, power generation, manufacturing capability. Our systems for running society have a lot of problems, economically, politically, epistemologically. These can also be improved with AI assistance.The real problem is the transition, it's such a huge shift, and it will happen all at once to everyone, uprooting our idea of the world and our place in it.What we need is to embrace AI and find a way to make sure that the transition and benefits of AI are distributed instead of concentrated.For me this looks like the following: companies must commit to retaining some minimum number of employees in every currently existing function, to be determined proportional to their profit taking. This sets a floor on the job losses that can come later when AI really comes on stream.The justification for this is three fold: firstly, it's a safety mechanism, it ensures that regardless of the capabilities of an AI system, there are multiple humans working with it to verify its results. If they aren't verifying diligently, then they're not doing their jobs.Secondly, jobs aren't just a way of making income, they're wrapped up in identity and meaning for at least some people, and this helps to maintain that existing identity structure across a meaningful cross section of society.Third, it keeps the economy running, money circulating. You can't have a market economy without consumers. UBI is one component of this too, but this is both more direct, more useful and more meaningful.

Let me be clearer: I said “companies must commit to” where the stronger phrasing is “companies are forced to by legislation”. But to begin with this might be voluntarily done by some number of companies.Also, in this vision of society the AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, google etc) are taxed heavily.

This is echoing a term made by Varoufakis about an increasing amount of money being held by a smaller and smaller group, not a return to literal peasant existence. It's not feudalism, it's ‘neo-feudalism'.The argument that labour can move is true, except where it can't. Look at the entire towns of miners made irrelevant with no replacement to their jobs. Sure you might say they can move half way across the country to clean toilets but they have skills, a family and houses somewhere else.Where the argument of a feudal analogy really rings true is the increasing attempt to do back to extraction of rent for everything. Subscriptions for everything, including homes are becoming more and more normal. Are we really okay with a world in this form?

It's not always the case that given an opinion, both extremes are wrong. But in this specific case, it certainly is. Neither the ""LLMs will usher in the post-scarcity economy"" view nor the ""LLMs will doom everyone to unemployment"" view (which are remarkably closer to each other than it would appear at first glance) are correct. LLMs are a useful tool with inherent, fundamental limitations that mean that they will never be able to do everything. AGI is currently a pipe dream, and LLMs are not going to be the technology that achieves it.

The nub is something I've thought about before. My contingency plan for AI turning the industry I work in upside down is to make hay while the sun shines before that point. Have enough saved or invested for a (lean) retirement (depending on how far away that point is).But what if AI turns every industry upside down. Will there be enough overall economic activity to actually invest in at all. Then we're all poor regardless of how much we've individually saved, or what kind of social safety net exists, simply because there's not enough economic activity to fund it.That is, at the moment, and I hope forever, a very remote possibility. For a whole host of reasons, technological and economic ones. But if that did happen in the next 20-30 years...

- ""In the future, when labor is fully marginalized..."" Hasn't happened in the history of the world, not going to happen in the future either. Some forms of labor were replaced by machines, which then gave rise to new types of jobs, such as building and maintaining the machines. The human cost cannot be neglected, because many people do find it difficult to retrain to other jobs. But on the whole, there are more jobs and higher-paying jobs now than there were a hundred years ago. Higher-paying not just in absolute financial terms, but also in terms of what can be purchased with that money. The richest man of the 19th century couldn't buy an air-conditioned house, not with all his millions.- ""GPT$$$ is surely smart enough to separate you from whatever you have..."" Assumes an unbounded growth curve in the ""smarts"" of AI, and worse than that, assumes that that AI will take the form of an LLM. This is laughable. LLMs will not ever achieve AGI; they are simply not capable of it. If AGI is achievable at all (which I doubt), it will come from one of the currently-neglected avenues of research whose funding is currently being neglected because LLMs are sucking all the metaphorical oxygen out of the room.- ""the neofeudal world"": assumes that all companies are like that. Yes, there are many companies that suck to work for because they treat their workers as mere cogs in a machine, instead of as human beings. But not all companies operate that way. If you are being treated as a cog in a machine, start looking for opportunities to jump ship to a better working environment. I've worked in both types of places, and I would be willing to take a big pay cut to work for company that didn't treat me as a cog. They're out there, but it might take some looking. Tip: ask employees what it's like working for the comapny, don't just take the interviewers' word at face value.

If one feels morally compelled to pay with their own income to stop these parasites, hats of to them. It is nasty that people are being put in this position. They need support from a society. Society needs information and debate about real issues, which requires them to be free from the barrage of falsehoods and yellow journalism.

Even with the poor judgement to join Musk's twitter at all, he left a few weeks after joining, soon after ChatGPT was released. Before ChatGPT, the idea that the singularity was anywhere near was utterly fringe: tech version of all the new-age stuff, I think Charlie Stross described it as ""Rapture for atheists"" or something like that.It's now… well, a lot of people with a lot of power are trying to *make it* be the singularity. I still don't think this is ""it"", despite how useful I find what we do have, but of the top 10 valued companies by market cap in Q4 last year, 9 are chasing it, the money is definitely interested, in a way it just wasn't when he worked at those places.

Yes, the transition can be painful and some people will lose out and face hard career changes.But overall, the multiplicative power of investment only increases, helping to make everything cheaper, and everyone richer.People focus too much on their own small part of experience - like Claude Code replacing CRUD developers. Without appreciating that the LLM revolution (and broader AI like AlphaFold) also includes PhD students that don't need to lose time programming tooling, interns that might have spent their time on tooling that can now use LLMs to learn faster and actually contribute to their fields, disadvantaged students that can learn more directly and in a personal way, without it being dependent on their physical location.All of this means you get more experimentation, more ideas, and more successes.

1) Instead of LLMs, imagine large models trained end-to-end on ALL online content and the impact it has on public opinion and discourse.

You might be resistant(but probably aren't), but in aggregate this will be effective mind control over society.2) Money directs human effort. Every quantum of bargaining power the worker/middle class lose due to being less needed is the reduction in our ability to have a say in who society should serve and how.3) Don't forget regulatory capture is a thing.

The system is flawed for different reasons. Tolerance for high vertical integration and oligopolies have seriously damaged the efficiency of the market and limited people's ability to disrupt. Capital concentration has created a new form of aristocracy. They have successfully lobbied to significantly weaken the mechanisms supposed to spread this money,  notably inheritance tax. The Supreme Court has significantly altered how democracy functions by lifting limits on fundings and given far too much power to the richest.The last forty years have basically torn down all the foundations Tocqueville saw as fundamental to the success of the young USA. People should fight to get things back on track.AI is mostly incidental in that. It doesn't matter if AI temporary concentrates some wealth if the mechanisms for it to then be spread again are in place.

Capital leads to class difference, often immense class difference, which is not a claim against our society as primarily capitalistic but in favor of it. If you took away all the food grown in America and the clothes woven in Bangladesh and the laptops manufactured in China, there would be no Amazon, no Google, no Microsoft, no ""technofeudalism."" The economic base is still defined by the exchange of commodities, its just that the US does not produce many industrial goods anymore, so the US economy is mostly a service based economy. Chinese citizens do not experience their lifeworld in terms of service based industries, they are surrounded by mass markets and complex factories and very material evidence of mechanization which we often do not see directly in the West, only the end product. So to many Americans it feels like they live in a magical society where they click some keys on their laptop and food and clothes and whatever they need shows up on their doorstep--but there are real workers out there tooling all the machines and developing all the architecture to make those things appear, to reduce the basic struggles of life to give time for greater and more advanced forms of social organization beyond the need to survive.This is not what peasants had; for them, despite having a relatively complex existence, a bad season could and often would kill their entire family. Or a raiding band would take all their food, or they'd die of the plague...life was far more tenuous, and the basic made of production was not commodity production, it was growing food and animal husbandry. International trade, artisanal crafts, and capital improvements on industrial production were nowhere near the level they were in even the early modern period. Nothing about our contemporary society resembles this way of living.Addendum: The claim that somehow everyone in tech could just ""stop,"" like consciously decide to stop creating things, is absurd. Amazon is very good at what it does, but it does not have exclusive control over the trade of all goods in the whole world. Rakuten is a major competitor in Japan, there are many other companies that have strong holds in their local markets. You take a Bolt in Germany, not an Uber. Chinese users can query DeepSeek, which is surely more proficient in Mandarin than ChatGPT. Even if a state uses its sovereign power to artificially control industry, it only slows the development of capital, since other states may allow their own companies and technologies to flourish, like China is doing now with its electric vehicles. If Amazon does not meet its projections, it fails, its employees all lose their jobs, Jeff Bezos might even go bankrupt. There is a constant pressure of competition.As a worker, your goal should not be to arbitrarily stop working--you may not enrich others but you certainly won't be enriching yourself either. The goal should be to capture far more wealth that is the result of your labor.

Or would you build your own rockets to mine asteroids, fortresses and weapons systems to protect yourself, and palaces for you to live in?I don't agree that this is where we are headed, but that is the idea. Thinking about this in relation to our current economy is missing the point.

The xTool F2 Ultra is a superfast, premium laser that beautifully engraves metal with accurate positioning cameras and comes with good software to run it. The 60-watt MOPA and 40-watt diode lasers cut through 2 mm metal and 23 mm wood with ease. It's a bit pricey for a hobby laser, but it's worth the price as an artist's tool or business investment.

The xTool F2 Ultra is a large, premium, and superfast galvo laser that can cut and engrave anything from metal and wood to acrylic. It has a 60-watt MOPA (Master Oscillator Power Amplifier) fiber laser for metal and a 40-watt blue diode laser for everything else. It is powerful enough to deeply engrave metal, cut through thin metal, and even “color” engrave stainless steel. This makes it the perfect laser for professional jewelry makers and small businesses who offer custom engraving on nearly any object.

The machine has an incredibly accurate positioning camera that you can access from the design software. This is critical for use in engraving jewelry or accurately placing personalization on one-of-a-kind items.

The F2 Ultra should not be confused with the F2, which is a portable machine. Clocking in at 47 pounds and requiring a massive air filter for safer operation, the F2 Ultra is far from portable. Its 220 x 220 mm work surface makes it comparable in size to a CORE One 3D printer.

Galvo lasers make the F2 Ultra extremely fast. It has a fixed laser, with the beam aimed by galvanometer mirrors that move at an insane 15,000 mm/s. However, this means the work area is somewhat cone-shaped, and on lesser machines, it often does not reach the corners of the work area. I didn't have any issues with the laser being inconsistent when engraving out to the edges.

This machine is a Class 4 laser, which can burn skin and damage vision. It requires the respect of those around it. When the laser's enclosure cover is down, it is safe for everyone to be around. But when using accessories like the conveyor or a rotary tool, the machine must be operated with the safety overridden and the enclosure open. You will need to get a pair of laser safety glasses for these times, as xTool inexplicably does not provide them.

xTool updated its software to AI-assisted “xTool Studio”, which, at launch, lacked the thousands of tutorials from the maker community that made the old xTool Creative Space a joy to use. It took a while to sort out, but xTool Studio turned out to be a great design tool and operating system for the laser. I'm not a fan of having to pay for tools to use a machine I own, but thankfully, you only need exchange tokens for art tools. This reduces it to a minor annoyance if you have your own source of art.

The retail price for the F2 Ultra starts at $4,999 for a MOPA-only laser (and no extras), making even the “budget” version of this machine rather expensive. However, this is the best experience we've had with metal engraving, and one of the best lasers we've seen for a small business.

The xTool F2 Ultra arrives fully assembled, with a nice corded touch screen, exhaust hose, power cable, slatted panel for cutting, and even includes a USB cable for initial setup with a PC. The included material pack has a few samples of wood, acrylic, metal, and more. We were also provided with a wax seal project kit, the xTool Safety Pro AP2, and the Auto Streamline Conveyor, which are optional.

 




The xTool F2 Ultra has an integrated cover that slides down to safely enclose the chamber. When using the conveyor or laser items larger than the bottom plate, the F2 Ultra can operate with the lid up after the safety shut-off is disabled in xTool Studio. The lid is counterbalanced nicely and will stay securely at whatever level you leave it.

For safety, there is a USB equipment key that can be removed to prevent the machine from unauthorized use, and a red emergency stop button on the right side you can slap if you need to quickly power down. Below the power button is a USB-C port to hook the laser to a computer and a USB-A slot to move files directly to the machine.

 




The machine has a very nice touch screen which enables manual red and blue dot focusing of the laser, starting and stopping prints and framing, controlling the machine when using files from a USB drive, and restarting the machine after fire detection or other alerts.

 




The xTool F2 Ultra is a dual 60-watt MOPA and 40-watt blue diode galvo laser. Unlike a flatbed laser, where an X and Y axis motion system moves the laser around the work surface, a galvo laser is fixed, and the laser beam is aimed with galvanometer mirrors. Since the mirrors weigh very little, they can be moved extremely fast at an advertised 15,000 mm/s.

The xTool F2 Ultra has all the features you'd expect on a premium machine. The autofocus and camera positioning are perfectly accurate down to .2 mm with dual 48 mp AI cameras, although I did need to go through the camera calibration routine.

The instructions say not to place anything on top of the unit because the top can pop up to adjust the laser focus point on tall, up to 150 mm, or curved objects. The laser has led lighting in the chamber, which is great when working with everything but the most reflective materials.

The integrated bottom plate of the laser is anodized aluminum with threaded holes to attach brackets or jigs to quickly reset objects when batch printing. xTool also includes a slatted panel for cutting that allows airflow under materials while cutting.

 




For fume extraction, xTool sent us the Safety Pro AP2 air purifier. While the laser itself has a powerful dust/fume extractor, the output hose has to be routed through a window or door to the outside. When that is not practical, a purifier is needed. The Safety Pro AP2 is a beast with a 5-stage filter that connects to the F2 Ultra via Bluetooth, and it does a remarkable job. There is literally no hint of that campfire smell associated with laser cutting. The individual filters are replaceable separately, and range in cost from $20 to $50. The service life ranges between 100 hours for the least expensive filter to 600 hours for the most expensive one. This filter system is expensive, but seeing as the F2 Ultra can produce fine metal powders, it's better safe than sorry.

 




The xTool F2 Ultra is fully assembled, you only need to attach the exhaust to the back, plug in the cord for the touch screen, and pop in the equipment key and plug it in.

 




The F2 Ultra is a Class 4 laser, which can cause severe damage to the eyes, burn skin, ignite combustible materials, and produce toxic fumes. The machine does have an enclosure that will protect your eyes when it is completely closed. There is a safety shutoff if the cover is opened while the laser is in use. This needs to be turned off in the device settings of the software when using material larger than the machine's base or when using the conveyor. It needs to be turned back on manually.

The machine has a flame sensor, which is very sensitive and can be turned off to prevent nuisance stoppages when closely monitoring the laser. Since the laser is literally burning material, it's a good idea to have a fire extinguisher handy as well. There is also a tilt/movement shutoff.

 




Like many industrial machines, the F2 Ultra has an equipment key that needs to be inserted into the rear of the machine for it to work. This can be removed to prevent the machine from unauthorized use. The F2 also has a red emergency quick stop button.

An exhaust fan on the rear of the unit removes smoke from the laser area to an exhaust hose, which can be vented to the outside or to a purifier. Some materials should not be burned with a laser due to their chemical makeup – they could melt, catch fire, or produce toxic fumes. Dallas Maker Space has published a list of safe and hazardous materials to use with their laser. The list of no-nos includes some plastics like PVC, fiberglass, and certain foams. The laser lens can get dirty from smoke and fumes. You will need to wipe it clean – while unplugged – before each laser session. If it's allowed to become dirty, the laser will lose some of its capability.

No safety glasses are provided with the machine. You will need to buy a pair if you are going to use the laser with the cover-up. xTool has them available for purchase separately.

 




xTool has replaced its free software with xTool Studio, a powerful and intuitive platform that is just different enough from the old system to be a little frustrating. At the time of this review, all the color laser tutorials on xTool's website were done in the old xTool Creative Space and were not helpful. The tutorials have since been updated, so if you're looking at buying this machine today, you won't suffer as I did. The software is still missing a few material presets, which hopefully will be added soon.

xTool Studio has the best and worst of AI. Personally, I'm a little leery of AI assistants and tend to avoid them. But xTool's assistant is actually full of helpful knowledge on operating the machine. If you run into trouble, a quick query to the AI is much faster than digging through the forums for help.

 




I abhor microtransactions, especially inside the software needed to operate tools that are quite pricey. The addition of AI design tools that cost credits to use is annoying. Sure, the credits aren't super expensive and can be earned for uploading projects or answering questions, but given the marketing of xTool machines for business, the social media aspects of this credit rewards system are jarring.

 




The xTool F2 Ultra is a powerhouse with the ability to cut through 2mm stainless steel, brass, and titanium with the 60-watt MOPA laser and up to 23 mm in wood and 20 mm in acrylic, with the 40-watt diode laser. For most materials, the xTool settings are very good. Many of the materials provided by xTool have a QR code, which will automatically load settings when read by the camera.

 




The first test I ran was cutting a Standing Reindeer from user Comp 56 on xTool Studio, using the 3mm basswood provided. It took just 2 minutes using the diode laser with 70% power at 40 mm/s in 4 passes. The deer came out of the sheet with just a little coaxing and shows minimal charring.

 




Next, using the same settings and only 55 seconds of processing time, I cut a much more delicate design using the free earring generator app from xTool Studio. The result is very nice with a bit more charring, but nothing a tiny bit of sanding wouldn't cure completely.

 




The diode laser cuts through black acrylic like butter. This took only 20 seconds for 2 passes to create the hole at 90% power. The engraved Canva clip art and a line from Shakespeare's King Lear were etched at 40% power, with a 60 dot duration and 250 DPI. This has excellent detail while being scary fast.

 




Again, using clip art from Canva, I was able to make an excellent rubber stamp using the diode laser. However, there was some trial by fire, literally. I ultimately found the right settings to avoid scorching the stamp material by using 4 passes with 40 % power at 600 DPI with a dot duration of 300. Running slowly and safely, the engraving took 1 hour and 33 minutes to complete. The recommended settings were the same, but 1 pass at 85% power, which led to a pretty impressive fire in the chamber. The flame sensor cut the laser off, which killed the flames. This was a good reminder to keep an extinguisher nearby when working with combustible materials.

 




The xTool F2 Ultra has the ability to engrave on curved surfaces. After lining up the framing light on the surface of the material, the laser will take measurements on a grid, much like a 3D printer doing an auto bed level. This feature worked perfectly when engraving a curve stainless steel hip flask.

 




I used the diode laser at 70% power and 1500 mm/s sec for the text, and 60% power with a dot duration of 120 at 380 dpi for the art. The engraving was finished in under 2 minutes and looks fantastic. The image was an AI-generated line drawing of the late, great actor, Robert Shaw, to go along with one of my husband's favorite lines from the movie, “The Deep.”

 




The 60-watt MOPA laser has some intriguing color capabilities, and I was able to run a fairly impressive test array on the stainless steel sheet xTool provided. The engraving took 2 hours and 58 minutes to run. It did warp the thin metal, so some extra testing might be needed, but I ran out of stainless steel.

 




The MOPA laser has impressive embossing power, but the material presets left me guessing. I ran the embossing for 256 layers at 100% power at a speed of 1500 mm/s and 300 lines per cm. The design is the ship's patch from my dad's Navy boat. My depth map could've used a little less contrast, but the result was still pretty good and took 1 hour 51 minutes to complete. I would have liked to test more settings, but I only had one sample coin for the review. If you're getting this laser, be sure to stock up on test materials to perfect your settings.

 




Using the same settings and only 30 layers, I was able to emboss my logo surrounded by a wreath from xTools' clip art onto a brass seal in a little over 25 minutes. The stamp is cleanly engraved and makes a crisp impression. The seal is melted bronze wax, highlighted with a silver marker.

The MOPA laser has the power to engrave jewelry in just a few seconds, and the camera positioning is amazingly precise. These tags are crisp and clean, and even using small items, I had no problem getting the designs exactly where I wanted them.

Overall, the xTool F2 Ultra delivers exactly what it promises: speed, precision, and serious capability. The combination of a 60W MOPA fiber laser and a 40W blue diode laser gives it an unusually broad material range, allowing one machine to handle work that would normally require multiple specialized tools. From deep metal engraving and stainless steel color marking, to wood, acrylic, and coated items, the F2 Ultra feels purpose-built for production work rather than hobby experimentation.

Its galvo system is impressively consistent across the full work area, and the positioning camera adds a level of confidence that is essential when working with high-value, one-of-a-kind pieces.

This is not a casual desktop laser. It requires respect for safety and a good external air filter. The updated xTool Studio software ultimately supports that professional workflow well, even if the AI features and token system may frustrate users who prefer fully offline or self-contained tools.

Starting at $4999 for a single laser unit, and going up to $8099 for a fully loaded system with an air purifier, the F2 Ultra is a hefty investment. But it earns its keep by delivering outstanding metal engravings with exceptional speed. For jewelry makers and entrepreneurs looking into personalization businesses, the xTool F2 Ultra stands out as one of the most capable and refined desktop galvo lasers currently available.

If you're not ready to make such a sizable investment, the portable xTool F1 laser is $1099 and great for taking to festivals for personalizing merch on the go. If you want to laser large things safely tucked inside an enclosure – including clear acrylic – check out the xTool P2 CO2 laser, which is on sale for $3,399.

Claudio Echeverri has joined Girona on loan for the rest of the 2025/26 season, subject to international clearance.

 Club News 

The Argentine midfielder will now link up with our CFG sister Club after spending the first half of the campaign on loan in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen.

The 20-year-old, who signed for City in January 2024 before remaining on loan at River Plate until February 2025, will join City team-mate Vitor Reis at the Spanish Club.

Echeverri has made three appearances for Pep Guardiola's side - with his debut coming in our FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace at Wembley in May 2025.

A first goal for the Blues followed in the summer at the FIFA Club World Cup, when he scored a superb free-kick against Al-Ain before he was forced off with an injury at half-time.

He made 11 appearances for Leverkusen – six in the Bundesliga and five in the Champions League, although he remained on the bench for the German side's visit to the Etihad Stadium.

Echeverri will now look to gain more first-team experience after completing his switch to Girona in La Liga.

Everyone at Manchester City would like to wish Claudio the very best during his time in Spain.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Vinicius attempts to applaud the Madrid fans after the win over Levante - he did not get the same love back Jose Breton/Pics Action/NurPhoto/Getty Images

Real Madrid returned to winning ways after defeats that cost them the Spanish Super Cup, their place in the Copa del Rey and led to a change of coach inside a week — but the home fans made their feelings clear throughout the victory over Levante.

While Xabi Alonso, who was dismissed on Monday, enjoyed the sea air in San Sebastian in northern Spain, Alvaro Arbeloa, promoted from the Real Madrid Castilla, took charge of his first La Liga match.

Advertisement

On his 43rd birthday, he started with a win, a dull 2-0 against a relegation-threatened team but it was surrounded by a lot of noise. There were many boos directed at the players, with particular intensity against Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham, and repeated chants against president Florentino Perez.

Perez, in charge since returning to the club in 2009, was re-elected in January 2025 until 2029, after an election without opposition. The attacks towards the 78-year-old had not happened at the stadium since 2015, when Rafael Benitez was head coach.

Arbeloa must have known what was coming as he appealed for calm in his pre-match press conference on Friday when he referred to the iconic figure of Juan Gomez ‘Juanito'. The coach had used the famous phrase of Juanito, a former Madrid player who died in a traffic accident in 1992 aged 37 and whose name is remembered in the seventh minute of every home match.

“I understand that the Madrid fans are hurt and disappointed with us, but I'm going to ask them to support their players,” Arbelosa said. “Juanito said that 90 minutes at the Bernabeu are ‘molto longo (very long)' and it did not mean the stadium against the players.”

The request was nowhere near being fulfilled, with the atmosphere in the Bernabeu reaching its most tense in decades.

In the build-up in the city, there had been banners on roads calling for Perez to step down. At the same time, fans on social media organised protests for the game, including a chant in the fifth minute aimed at the president. That happened, with cameras capturing the president in the VIP box reacting with a forced laugh.

The “Florentino resign!” chant was repeated at least twice more, the loudest of which was heard at half-time, when the players were back in the dressing room.

Arbeloa was critical and cryptic about that at the press conference. “I know where the boos and the campaigns are coming from, they are not from people who don't like Florentino, but from people who don't like Madrid,” he said.

“They're not going to fool me, we're lucky to have him because he's the most important person in the history of the club alongside Santiago Bernabeu.”

The players were not spared criticism either.

The reception to the bus arriving at the Bernabeu, so characteristic on big nights — especially in the Champions League, due to the connection between the supporters and the team — was hostile.

It soon became even clearer that this would be the norm for the next few hours. The few fans who went into the ground early booed Thibaut Courtois — one of the few players who had escaped criticism — and the other goalkeepers as they came out to warm up.

The noise level rose when the players appeared on the field, and again when they retired to the dressing room before kick-off.

And it continued when the Madrid team was announced to the crowd too. The players most singled out were Vinicius, Bellingham, and, to a lesser extent, vice-captain Fede Valverde.

These three players were among those who reportedly did not believe in Alonso's ideas, which led to internal tensions over the methods the Basque coach tried to implement.






Kylian Mbappe, who would go on to win and score the penalty to break the deadlock, was not booed.

At the start of the match, there were even whistles between the local fans. The rest of the stadium protested when the Grada fans, the club's organised fan group located behind one of the goals, cheered on the team.






Vinicius took centre stage at the end of the game — part of the crowd applauded him, but the majority reacted negatively.

Sound off, clearer reaction: lots of whistles at the Santiago Bernabeu from Real Madrid supporters.

Whistles also for the Grada Fans when they have started to cheer. @TheAthleticFC pic.twitter.com/n82zhqvFmG

— Mario Cortegana (@MarioCortegana) January 17, 2026



Mbappe pleaded for the boos to stop while Vinicius asked for encouragement by raising his arms. When he didn't get it, he was the first to leave the pitch after the final whistle, consoled on his way by team-mates and staff.

“The only thing I'm going to do is work to get the best out of Vinicius,” Arbeloa told the media in his post-match press conference. “I'm going to demand that his team-mates look for him because he's one of the most unbalancing players, if not the most, in the world. I'm very proud to be his coach.”

Mistakes by Dean Huijsen and Eduardo Camavinga were greeted by boos but the crowd did recognise the efforts of academy products Gonzalo Garcia and Raul Asencio, who made it 2-0 with a great header. Asencio was playing with a mask after having his nose broken. Arda Guler, who had a big impact after coming on at half-time, was named man of the match.

In the final minutes, the Grada fans chanted the new coach's name, with some boos in response. Arbeloa's birthday present was three points, but his celebrations will not last long with the amount of work needed to lift the mood on and off the pitch at the Bernabeu.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Despite historic night, Venus Williams falls to Danilovic in Australian Open first round","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4436345/historic-night-venus-williams-first-round-loss-australian-open","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:56:15 GMT","

Olga Danilovic of Serbia thwarted Venus Williams' historic attempt to become the oldest woman to win a main-draw singles match at the Australian Open. Williams, aged 45, fell short in a three-set thriller, with Danilovic prevailing 6-7, 6-3, 6-4. Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, will now focus on the women's doubles event, while Danilovic looks ahead to a challenging second-round match.

Serbia's Olga Danilovic came from the brink of defeat to end Venus Williams' historic bid to become the oldest woman to win a main-draw singles match at the Australian Open on Sunday.

Williams had already made history the moment she stepped onto John Cain Arena, becoming the oldest woman to compete in a main-draw singles match at the season's first Grand Slam. The 45-year-old former World No. 1 fell just short of breaking the record held by Japan's Kimiko Date-Krumm, who won a first-round match in Melbourne in 2013 at age 42, losing 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-4 to Olga Danilovic in 2 hours, 17 minutes.

Ranked No. 576 in the world, Williams started strongly, breaking Danilovic to take a 2-0 lead in the opening set. Danilovic, a left-hander ranked No. 68, soon found her rhythm to level the set. The Serb saved a set point in the 10th game to force a tiebreak and fought off two more before Williams sealed the set with a forehand winner down the line.

Danilovic, more than two decades younger than the seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, broke early in the second set and held serve to take it 6-3 and force a decider.

Williams, seeking her first Grand Slam singles main-draw victory since Wimbledon in 2021, surged to a 4-0, double-break lead in the final set before Danilovic responded by winning four straight games to level at 4-4.

The match turned in a pivotal ninth game that lasted more than 14 minutes. Williams saved two break points, while Danilovic fought off six game points before breaking on her third opportunity for a 5-4 lead. Serving for the match, the Serb rallied from 15-30 down, to win two extended rallies – one with a passing shot and the other with a volley winner - to set up match point. A forehand error from Williams sealed the result in Danilovic's favor, sending the Serb into the second round for the third time in her career.

Williams, making her 22nd Australian Open appearance, is scheduled to return later in the week to compete alongside Ekaterina Alexandrova in women's doubles. She is a four-time women's doubles champion here, winning each time with sister Serena Williams.

The American, a two-time runner-up in Melbourne, left the court with her trademark infectious smile and acknowledged the crowd support she received.

""It was such a great game, such a great moment,"" Williams said. ""The energy from the crowd was amazing. That lifted me up so much. She played a great game. Also some luck there, as well. That's just the sport. That's how it works sometimes.""

Williams added that she was proud of her efforts and feels that she is playing better with every match of her comeback.

""I'm really proud of my effort today because I'm playing better with each match, getting to the places that I want to get to,"" she said. ""Right now I'm just going to have to keep going forward and working on myself and working to control my errors. Those are things, too, that come with playing extra matches, like getting your feet in the exact right position, choosing the right shots, all of those things that I'm still learning. It's kind of weird, but it's super exciting to have played that well and to get myself in that position and come very close.""

Danilovic, who reached the fourth round here 12 months ago, will face either third-seeded Coco Gauff or Kamilla Rakhimova for a place in the third round.

Olga Danilovic of Serbia thwarted Venus Williams' historic attempt to become the oldest woman to win a main-draw singles match at the Australian Open. Williams, aged 45, fell short in a three-set thriller, with Danilovic prevailing 6-7, 6-3, 6-4. Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, will now focus on the women's doubles event, while Danilovic looks ahead to a challenging second-round match.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

I think the media just blew it up just because they didn't like me with the fact of it happening. I mean, who cares about posts, right?

Potapova shared that she didn't discuss with Kasatkina, asserting that “nobody cares” about the matter.“I don't find anything wrong with that because you cannot say it in a better way. And why not? It was perfect words. I loved it. We loved it with my team, with everyone,” she explained.“So, gave it a shot. I don't think that it's something terrible happened.

Donald Trump plans to sign an executive order to block out an exclusive window for the Army-Navy Game, an effort to preserve its date and its lack of competition from other games.


	His post on Saturday comes amid proposal to expand the College Football Playoffs, a potential conflict to the Army-Navy Game.


	Trump wrote on Truth Social, “The Army-Navy Game is one of our Greatest American Traditions — Unmatched Patriotism, Courage, and Honor! This incredible Tradition is now at risk of being pushed aside by more College Playoff Games, and Big TV Money. NOT ANYMORE!  “Under my Administration, the second Saturday in December belongs to Army-Navy, and ONLY Army-Navy! I will soon sign a Historic Executive Order securing an EXCLUSIVE 4 hour Broadcast window, so this National Event stands above Commercial Postseason Games. No other Game or Team can violate this Time Slot!!!”

	It is unclear whether the president — or the FCC— has the authority to essentially mandate a programming decision by the other broadcast networks. Stations enjoy a lesser degree of First Amendment protection than other forms of media, but the Supreme Court has ruled that restrictions have to be “narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest.” That has given the agency the legal ability to regulate such things as indecency and obscenity, as well as commercials in children's programming. Meanwhile, sports rights have been migrating to streaming platforms, which are outside the FCC's oversight.




			Watch on Deadline		







	FCC Chairman Brendan Carr reposted Trump's message on X, but did not comment.


CBS Sports has broadcast the game since 1996 and holds the rights through 2038. A spokesperson for Paramount, parent company of CBS, did not immediately return a request for comment.


	Trump's comments — made amid ongoing ICE raids in Minneapolis, and the president's announcement of tariffs on European countries that don't agree to the U.S. taking control of Greenland — may merely be a way of pressuring college football officials into backing off of any plan to schedule games in the traditional Army-Navy timeslot.

	











	In 2024, a group of lawmakers in both parties urged college officials to preserve the second Saturday for the Army-Navy games, amid concerns over the increased schedule of playoffs and bowl games in the final month of the year.

	With filming on Season 2 of The Hunting Wives underway, Brittany Snow is immersed back in the drama and bloodshed of Maple Brook, Texas.


	The actress, who plays Sophie O'Neil in the Netflix adaptation of May Cobb's novel, teased that “someone dies” in the highly-anticipated sophomore season, which will make audiences “very shocked” and “angry.”


	“Every script is a new adventure. They said that we couldn't top last year and somehow I think we are doing it,” she told Entertainment Tonight.

	“I'm surprised. And I even knew what was coming, a little bit. So, I think people are going to be very shocked, I think people are going to be angry.

	Snow added of her reaction to one Season 2 script, “I stood up on my couch. Someone dies. I won't tell you who. That is a wild play. Wild behavior.”


	Production on Season 2 kicked off in November after Netflix renewed the Rebecca Cutter-created series back in September. The show is set to return to the streamer in 2026.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","R.I.P. Tucker Zimmerman: Cult folk hero dead at 84","https://www.avclub.com/r-i-p-tucker-zimmerman-cult-folk-hero-dead-at-84","Sun, 18 Jan 2026 17:59:35 GMT","

In a post shared to his Instagram page, management has confirmed via Belgian media that Tucker Zimmerman and his wife Marie-Claire have passed away. Tucker was 84 years old, and his death date is listed as January 17, 2026: “There are very sad reports from Belgian media this morning regarding a tragedy,” the post reads. “They report Marie-Claire and Tucker have lost their lives. Our love and prayers go to their family. When there is more news from the family we will post again. Love to all.” This morning, I located and translated a Belgian news article posted on January 17 that reports Tucker and Marie-Claire “lost their lives to asphyxiation after a fire broke out in their home.” 

I had the great honor of writing about Zimmerman when he released his last album, Dance of Love, in 2024. He was a kind, patient man who graciously spoke about his life in music. During our conversation, Marie-Claire (who Zimmerman lovingly called “Bear”) would roam in the background, pulling books off shelves or tidying up their “cubby hole.” She sang on “Leave It On the Porch Outside,” a stroke of normalcy for her and Zimmerman. “We sing a lot together around the house,” he told me. “In the ‘70s, when I was doing many of those gigs across Belgium and Germany, she was driving me—because I don't drive—so I asked her to come on stage and we would just reproduce a couple of songs—what we'd done at the house, singing together, harmonies. She sang quite a bit with me in public during the ‘70s, and she's even on a couple of the albums from during that time.” And, as I wrote two years ago, through their shared music, we got to step into their lifetime and share that intimacy with them.

Most people knew of David Bowie's feelings about Zimmerman, that the Thin White Duke thought of him to be “way too qualified for folk [music]” and considered Ten Songs by Tucker Zimmerman to be one of his favorite albums ever. But Zimmerman was more than that. I wrote in 2024 that “because his music was a little off-the-nose and zany 55 years ago, some folks—even Bowie—used to say that Zimmerman wanted to be like another Zimmerman, Bob Dylan. His body of work supports the opposite, as he walked on as a cult troubadour particularly drawn to scuffling drum beats, steel guitars gleaned from busking resonance and a magic wreathed in well-worn obscurity.”

Zimmerman was born in San Francisco during World War II. He took violin lessons as a child but liked the piano better. He hated taking lessons, preferring to copy Little Richard and Fats Domino instead. He went to school for composition and even got a Fulbright Scholarship to study theory under Gofreddo Petrassi in Rome. Zimmerman dodged the Vietnam War draft, left America, and didn't come back for years and years. While in Rome, he realized that he cared more about writing songs than composing for orchestras. “I used the scholarship as a free ride, but I made use of it. I didn't waste it,” he told me. “I wrote a lot of songs, and my head got around to the right place—as to what I wanted to do with my life.”

He and Marie-Claire moved to London, where he met Tony Visconti and struck up a musical partnership. Zimmerman wrote the song “Droppin' Out” for the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and Visconti had been working with Marc Bolan. Visconti helped Zimmerman get on. “He helped me a lot, more than just getting me on record and getting me into a studio, taping. He supported me financially in many, many ways. I owe so much to Tony. Not only was he sneaking me jobs under the table in the studio, as a studio musician, but we became good friends.”

Eventually Zimmerman and his wife settled down in Belgium. He made a living playing gigs around there and Germany. He found a niche in being the “lonely American” who Belgian and German audiences would look to for insight into American culture. When the cultural apogee of Woodstock made it to Europe in 1970, he was summoned to Switzerland, France, and Holland. ““They really wanted to have some American to hang onto, and I was one of the very few that came and played for them,” Zimmerman said. “I had really good audiences. They were mostly students, especially in Germany. I was accepted really very warmly.”

After Big Potato Records reissued Zimmerman's 1974 album Over Here in Europe in 2023, he made Dance of Love with Big Thief serving as his producers and backing band. Big Thief took care of everything: recording sessions, arrangements, label stuff. “I think, for the first time, I really trusted everybody around me,” Zimmerman said. “I let them make the decisions. There's definitely a spiritual bond between us; I enjoyed the vibrations of the moment. Nobody was in charge, nobody was telling anybody what to do. We just did it, and it was very, very special. It was mystical, because all I had to do was sit back and not cause any trouble.”

Adrianne Lenker had long championed Zimmerman's work, calling him “one of the greatest songwriters of all time.” “I have a great affection for her as a person, as a writer,” he said. “I've learned from her, and she tells me she's learned from me.” Dance of Love was like a memoir interwoven with mythology and gratitude—all done live with no overdubs. Whether it's a 12-bar blues melody or a piano-based melody that conjures the styles Zimmerman was trying to copy nearly 70 years ago, the record arrives full of anecdotes reconstructed into timeless tales. My favorite song from that record is still “Lorelei,” a duet with Lenker. He takes the tragedy of the titular Germanic legend and makes her perspective a tranquil, revisionist still of triumph. “Sing my siren songs,” Lenker declares, before Zimmerman finishes her thought: “But only as a guiding light to better times and safer shores.”

Zimmerman was as gentle as they come. “I would really, really be so happy if a lot of people could listen to this album,” he confided to me, “because I feel good about it. Really good.” “I have a good feeling about it, Tucker, I really do,” I responded. “That's good to hear, because I don't pay attention,” he replied. “I would like it to go out into the world and make its way, but I don't even listen to music anymore. I have no idea what's going on in the world. [Laughs] I'm in my little cubby hole right now, and I have been for many, many years. I like being alone, I like working alone.”

During our conversation, I asked Zimmerman if making Dance of Love taught him anything about the vocation of music he'd so deeply studied, pursued, and serenaded all his life. “I probably will discover more things later than I know now,” he said back. “All I have now is a great desire to do it again, to make another album. I could probably come up with an answer for you in ten years.” It was 7 p.m. in Belgium then, nearly time for us to depart one another. “I think we're saying goodbye, aren't we?” he said, after peering at the light over his shoulder. He had a couple of shows in Europe coming up, so I wished him well on his travels and told him how lovely it was to see him. “I might need a little luck, because it's going to be a long one and I get tired pretty quickly,” he responded, before taking a beat and looking around his room, giving off a smirk I know I'm gonna miss. “But, you know, I think we'll make it. We'll make it okay.”

Oops, something went wrong

In mid-January 2026, High Roller Technologies, Inc. announced a binding Letter of Intent with Crypto.com | Derivatives North America to power an exclusive, regulated U.S. event-based prediction markets platform spanning finance, entertainment, and sports via HighRoller.com.

Layered on top of this core infrastructure deal, High Roller is lining up large social and sports media partners to funnel already-engaged, prediction-focused audiences into its upcoming U.S. prediction markets offering.

Against this backdrop, we'll explore how the Crypto.com-powered, regulated prediction markets launch could reshape High Roller's investment narrative.

AI is about to change healthcare. These 109 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early.

To own High Roller today, you have to believe it can evolve from a small, volatile iGaming operator into a regulated prediction-markets gateway, using Crypto.com's CFTC-registered infrastructure and a web of social-first media partners to pull in already-engaged, odds-literate users. The binding LOI with Crypto.com, alongside LOIs with Forever Network, Leverage Game Media, and Spike Up Media's Lines.com, shifts the near-term catalyst set toward execution: securing definitive agreements, hitting the targeted HighRoller.com launch, and proving that these large audience funnels can translate into compliant, paying customers. At the same time, the stock's very large recent re-rating, thin balance sheet, and unprofitable history keep valuation risk and funding needs front and center. The recent news adds credible distribution and product story, but also raises the bar for delivery.

But against that excitement, one near term risk stands out that investors should not ignore. Our valuation report here indicates High Roller Technologies may be overvalued.

Explore another fair value estimate on High Roller Technologies - why the stock might be worth as much as $15.57!

Disney's called it: Zootopia 2 has officially become the Motion Picture Association's highest-grossing animated film of all time.

As of this weekend, the Disney flick has made $1.7 billion worldwide since its release last Thanksgiving. A lot of that—specifically, $1.313 billion's worth—comes from the international market. Strong word of mouth has kept it going for months, and it'd already reached $1 billion in two weeks. With this new milestone, Zootopia 2 is the biggest animated movie in both China and international markets, and in all of 2025. It's also the second highest-grossing animated flick behind Ne Zha II and the ninth-highest overall after Spider-Man: No Way Home.

In a statement, Disney co-chairman Alan Bergman credited the milestone “first and foremost to the fans around the world whose enthusiasm made it possible. We're incredibly proud of our filmmakers Jared Bush, Byron Howard, and Yvett Merino and the entire team at Walt Disney Animation Studios for creating a film that connects so deeply with audiences everywhere. [This] is an extraordinary achievement, and we're grateful to everyone who helped bring it to life.”

Zootopia 2 is still currently in theaters, so it's gonna keep making money. And don't be surprised when that third one gets officially revealed in a few years.

She also impressed with her big heart.The 23-year-old Turkish qualifier was receiving serve in the ninth game of the second set against No. 11 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova when a ball kid stationed near the umpire's chair suddenly lost balance and stumbled backwards in the midday Sunday sun on 1573 Arena. Determined to return to her post, the ball kid stood up quickly but started wobbling again. Sonmez quickly sprung into action, held up her hand to suspend play, and moved to aid the youngster.Tournament officials, from the chair umpire to the tournament medical staff, rushed to the girl's aid as Sonmez supported her into a more shady spot, and lifted her into a chair courtside.

""She was really struggling,"" Sonmez later told BBC Sport. ""She said she was fine but it was really obvious she was not fine. So I went to grab her and said 'Sit down and drink something, you're not fine.'""As we were walking she fainted so luckily I grabbed her. She was really shaking.""I always say it is more important to be a good human being than a good tennis player. It was just my instinct to help her and I think everyone would do the same. I'm happy I got to help.""Read more: Aryna Sabalenka talks jewelry collab, selfies with Rod Laver, Roger Federer at Australian Open

Sonmez ultimately came from 3-0 down in the final set to defeat Alexandrova 7-5, 4-6, 6-4, making two other headlines in the process. She is the first Turkish woman to win an Australian Open main-draw match in the Open Era, and Alexandrova was the highest seed to fall on the opening day of the year's first Grand Slam event.","{'href': 'https://www.tennis.com', 'title': 'Tennis.com'}","tennis"

Tina Fey and Robert Carlock (co-creator with Sam Means) are among executive producers of the comedy about a disgraced football star hoping a documentary will change his life.


							By

Chief Television Critic


	I don't mean to tell Hollywood's creative forces what to do, but the pace of sports mockumentary production has fallen well behind the pace of sports documentary production. The latter is a genre that — as much as I watch it vociferously — is always in need of a little ego deflation.


	There are great sports mockumentaries, like the HBO Sports tennis comedy 7 Days in Hell or the When We Were Kings-inspired “How They Threw Rocks” episode of Documentary Now!. It's harder to do a sports mockumentary as an ongoing series, but the American Vandal guys tackled e-sports fairly well (at times) in Paramount+'s Players.

The Bottom Line

	
	Gets better as it goes.
	



Preview: Sunday, January 18, after the NFL Playoffs (NBC)Time period premiere: Monday, February 23 (NBC)Cast: Tracy Morgan, Daniel Radcliffe, Erika Alexander, Bobby Moynihan, Precious Way, Jalyn HallCreators: Robert Carlock and Sam Means			
			







	Premiering after the NFL playoff game on Sunday (January 18) on NBC a full month ahead of its February 23 launch, The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins is still establishing its potential within the genre.


	Like so many of Tina Fey and Robert Carlock‘s comedies, including 30 Rock, The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins doesn't start with full confidence in its overall voice or characters, settling to get most of its laughs from familiar cutaways and asides. As with shows including Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Great News, Girls5eva and even the lesser Mr. Mayor, the improvement is swift and evident through the four episodes sent to critics


	So watch the pilot for the unlikely comic pairing of Tracy Morgan and Daniel Radcliffe, but know that while I chuckled at the first couple of episodes, the third and fourth episodes were the ones that really made me eager to watch more.


	Morgan plays Reggie Dinkins, a Brooklyn-born former top NFL draft pick and two-time MVP who signed with the Jets in 2005 ready to lead the team to the Super Bowl and become a legend. Instead, Reggie accidentally confessed to an extensive gambling problem and became a national disgrace.

	











	Two decades later, Reggie is still doing surprisingly well, economically, thanks to the management of his ex-wife Monica (Erika Alexander). He has a nice house in New Jersey, a loving son (Jalyn Hall's Carmelo), a best friend who lives in his basement (Bobby Moynihan's Rusty) and an attractive young fiancée (Precious Way's Brina). But what he really wants is to be universally loved again. And what he really, REALLY wants is to be reinstated into the NFL so that he can go into the Hall of Fame.


	Reggie's solution is to hire Arthur Tobin (Daniel Radcliffe), an Oscar-winning documentarian, to make an adulatory film about him, changing public perception and opening new doors.


	But Arthur, covering up a disgrace, has his own ethics and his own ideas about what this documentary could be. He doesn't seem to want it to be a hatchet job — the approach is vérité meets The Last Dance, give or take — but he wants to capture reality.


	Monica doesn't think either documentary is a good idea.


	I understand completely that NBC will never have get a bigger lead-in audience than the one watching the Rams and Bears on Sunday night, but the pilot of The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins isn't the best way to hook anybody.


	Created by Carlock and frequent collaborator Sam Means, directed by Documentary Now! co-creator and “How They Threw Rocks” co-director Rhys Thomas, the opener is an only semi-necessary premise pilot, introducing Reggie and Arthur in some detail, Monica as a disapproving wet blanket, and both Carmelo and Brina as occasionally present appendages.

	











	The conceit is probably most similar to Mark Monroe's Charlie Hustle & The Matter of Pete Rose, a four-part HBO film that the baseball career hits leader and reluctantly admitted degenerate gambler hoped would reopen establishment doors and set him up for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Instead, Rose came across as unrepentant and wholly incapable of getting out of his own way.


	Reggie Dinkins is not Pete Rose. He is, unsurprisingly, a Tracy Morgan archetype — a perpetual man-child prone to malapropisms, naïveté and unexpected bursts of wisdom, capable of misjudgments in the moment, but generally lovable. He attributes the ongoing opulence of his lifestyle to Monica's business savvy, but this is the sort of thing you don't want to think very hard about — either in terms of how few rough edges Reggie has for a degenerate gambler or any awareness Monica must have had about his proclivities.


	I'm sure some of that will eventually be discussed — presumably that's what led to the divorce — but through four episodes there's no indication that Reggie ever hit rock bottom or even a minor level of discomfort.


	Since we know the documentary is going to happen — because otherwise there's no show — the first 22 minutes are mostly Monica shaking her head in disapproval, being the quintessential sitcom wife.


	Morgan has always been a unique comic voice, and few people know how to channel that voice better than Carlock and Fey. But it takes three or four episodes before they also find a way to tap into the dramatic undercurrents that emerged in the better moments of his TBS comedy The Last O.G.












	He's got a good match in Radcliffe, who has spent the decade+ since that boy wizard franchise proving time and time again what an eager and generous comic foil he is. The pilot isn't quite sure what makes Arthur funny, alternating between jokes about his artistic pretensions and his extreme whiteness. The former gets downplayed subsequently, and the latter gets dropped entirely.


	Instead, in the third and fourth episodes, the series finds what's sympathetic in Reggie and Arthur's intersecting desperation, and benefits from it.


	What the show really benefits from, starting with the second episode, is finding what's funny and insecure about Monica. Once she isn't a wet blanket she becomes a real character, and Alexander, who Hollywood has only periodically found ways to fully utilize since Living Single, is great. Moynihan gets better as the series finds a way to expose the loneliness behind his goofball exterior, just as Precious Way begins to pop when Brina isn't just being put out there as a future trophy wife. So far, Carmelo has had the least chance to develop a real character, but the fourth episode, in which Monica considers dating an agent, gives hints of what Hall can do with stronger material.


	(Why is the camera crew filming extended conversations about Monica's dating life? Is the documentary aesthetic really being consistently applied at any point? These are questions you'll have to assume will either be answered or smoothed over.)


	The series hasn't really built an ensemble yet. Arthur's crew seems to be one cameraman, entirely off-camera. Monica has an inept assistant played by Unstable scene-stealer Rachel Marsh, who might be good for regular laughs but so far she's only recurring.

	











	But it feels like things are coming together.


	In the short-term, though, The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins is, like the lesser stages of Fey/Carlock shows, beholden to the hit-and-miss nature of its cutaways — including various products Reggie has endorsed, one odd commercial Arthur directed (unclear why a commercial shot by the director of the documentary is being included in the documentary), and several big laughs generated by outside projects Reggie made thanks to his fame.


	I'd say the pilot is a little more miss than hit, but the ratio gets better with each episode I've seen.
