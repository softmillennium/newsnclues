                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The former BoE analyst, Helen McCaw, previously worked in financial security at the bank and helped develop plans for theoretical economic crises, such as the one she now sees as a possibility in a full disclosure scenario. According to prediction market Polymarket, the potential for alien disclosure is not as farfetched as previously thought, with the odds currently sitting at 12% for such a revelation before 2027, albeit on low trading volume. There has been an increasing number of credible, high-level government officials speaking up about the UFO (now referred to as UAPs) phenomenon over the past few years, culminating in appearances by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and many others in an associated documentary, the Age of Disclosure. Disclosure could cause widespread cases of ontological shock among the general public, which is why McCaw sees the need to make economic preparations in advance. Notably, it is claimed in the Age of Disclosure that former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin once received a briefing on the topic of extraterrestrials due to similar concerns. “There might be extreme price volatility in financial markets due to catastrophising or euphoria, and a collapse in confidence if market participants feel uncertain on how to price assets using any of the familiar methods,” McCaw reportedly wrote in her letter. “If there is an official announcement and we get presented with very clear evidence that nobody is going to dispute, I would say that in a matter of hours, you are going to have total financial instability.” McCaw also outlined a few different potential scenarios that could occur if disclosure of alien life does indeed take place. One of those scenarios included a flight to bitcoin as a safe haven asset due to the potential destruction of trust in traditional, governmental power structures. “There might be a rush to digital currencies such as bitcoin, which may prove appealing if people question the legitimacy of government and lose trust in government-backed assets,” wrote McCaw. The former BoE analyst also shared two differing theories on what could happen with the traditional, analog alternative to bitcoin, which is gold. This point about gold eventually facing a large devaluation due to space-based mining projects is one that is brought up in debates by bitcoin proponents somewhat often. In terms of changes to Bitcoin's monetary policy, social attack vectors are likely the bigger issue, where users are convinced to simply opt into a new, alternative crypto network where the 21 million bitcoin cap has been removed. Quantum computers may also eventually pose a threat to Bitcoin; however, developers are already working on improvement proposals that could be implemented, if necessary. Arizona, New Hampshire, and Texas have enacted laws aimed at creating their own reserves. Turns out people might like to circumvent centralized financial infrastructure in times of political upheaval.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Explore how these two crypto ETFs differ in cost, risk, and portfolio approach -- key factors for aligning with your investment strategy. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT +0.44%) tracks Bitcoin itself with a lower expense ratio and much larger assets under management, while the Bitwise Crypto Industry Innovators ETF (BITQ +4.12%) offers exposure to crypto-related equities, higher volatility, and a more diversified portfolio of 33 holdings. Both IBIT and BITQ target investors interested in the crypto economy, but their approaches are fundamentally different. IBIT provides direct Bitcoin price exposure, while BITQ invests in companies that operate in the crypto sector, such as exchanges and mining firms. This comparison highlights key differences in cost, performance, risk, and portfolio makeup to help clarify which may align better with specific investor goals. BITQ charges a higher management fee than IBIT, making it less affordable on cost alone, though its recent performance has outpaced IBIT over the past year. BITQ focuses on the broader crypto economy by investing in 33 companies across financial services, technology, and consumer cyclical sectors. IBIT, by contrast, is a pure-play vehicle holding only Bitcoin and cash. This results in a single-asset exposure, tracking the digital currency's price movements almost one-for-one. Unlike BITQ, IBIT does not hold equities or diversify across companies, so its performance is tied directly to Bitcoin's price. There are no notable structural quirks or thematic tilts in IBIT, and its large size provides ample liquidity for most investors. For more guidance on ETF investing, check out the full guide at this link. These funds offer regulated exposure to crypto assets without the complexity of managing digital wallets or navigating exchanges. BITQ invests in crypto-related companies like miners, exchanges, and service providers, holding around 30 stocks with a hefty 0.85% expense ratio -- meaning a $10,000 investment will cost you $85 in fees. Its $400 million in assets and beta above 4 signal extreme volatility, so this ETF is not for the faint of heart. In contrast, IBIT holds physical Bitcoin directly through institutional custody, tracking Bitcoin's price movements with a 0.25% expense ratio and massive $71 billion in assets from BlackRock's backing. These ETFs suit investors who understand cryptocurrency's extreme volatility and want regulated exposure without direct coin ownership. For diversified exposure to crypto industry growth, choose BITQ. But only allocate capital you can afford to lose entirely, as crypto remains highly speculative and prone to dramatic swings. ETF (Exchange-traded fund): A pooled investment that trades on an exchange like a stock.Expense ratio: Annual fund operating costs, expressed as a percentage of the fund's average assets.Assets under management (AUM): The total market value of all assets managed by a fund.Bitcoin ETF: An ETF designed to track the price of bitcoin, without investors holding bitcoin directly.Crypto-related equities: Stocks of companies whose main business involves cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology.Max drawdown: The largest peak-to-trough decline in an investment's value over a specified period.Beta: A measure of an investment's volatility compared with the overall stock market, typically the S&P 500.Liquidity (in ETFs): How easily ETF shares can be bought or sold without significantly affecting the price.Management fee: The portion of the expense ratio paid to the fund manager for running the fund.Diversified portfolio: A collection of different investments intended to reduce risk from any single holding.Single-asset exposure: When a fund's performance depends mainly on one underlying asset, such as bitcoin.Total return: An investment's overall gain or loss, including price changes and any income, over a given period.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA's latest drone test shows how blockchain could protect future flights from cyber threats. In a move that signals a bold leap for aviation cybersecurity, NASA is testing blockchain technology to protect air travel systems from data tampering and disruption. A recent test at NASA's Ames Research Center used drones to validate a decentralized data infrastructure designed to secure communication between aircraft and ground control. This initiative, part of the agency's Air Traffic Management and Safety project, could transform the backbone of future airspace operations. This setup allowed researchers to evaluate how a blockchain-based framework performs in an actual operational environment. Unlike traditional databases, blockchain operates as a distributed ledger. This ensures that flight data remains authentic, immutable, and transparent even under cyber pressure. The system enables secure real-time transactions of sensitive aviation data such as telemetry, operator registration, and flight plans. This aspect is particularly significant in an era where cyberthreats are becoming more sophisticated and the integrity of air traffic management systems is constantly at risk. The test highlighted that such decentralized architecture could be fundamental to supporting autonomous vehicles, urban air mobility, and even high-altitude operations. Unlike previous efforts that relied heavily on layered security where multiple software and hardware barriers are built to block intrusions, NASA's blockchain approach embraces zero-trust principles. As noted in the original NASA report, the test demonstrated how blockchain systems could remain resilient even under intentional cyberstress simulations. The blockchain framework responded well, maintaining data integrity throughout. This marks a significant step toward creating scalable and secure airspace operations especially as traffic from drones, high-altitude aircraft, and electric vertical takeoff vehicles (eVTOLs) continues to grow. As more uncrewed systems take to the skies from delivery drones to flying taxis, the need for secure communication channels becomes critical. Traditional systems rely on centralized command-and-control models that are vulnerable to single-point failures or external attacks. NASA's research suggests that the technology could support secure digital identity verification, real-time flight plan validation, and operator accountability, key features in managing future urban and commercial skies. As cities plan for low-altitude air corridors filled with semi-autonomous aircraft, blockchain could serve as the guardian layer, maintaining order, traceability, and security.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Interestingly, this period of silence has been deemed transient, as recent on-chain data suggests an exciting time ahead for the BTC price. Kimchi Premium Flips Positive As Local Demand Sees Buildup In a January 17 post on the X platform, DeFi asset management platform XWIN Finance released an on-chain report, which suggests that Bitcoin might be closer to reaching a turning point than is apparent in its price action. This hypothesis is based on the Bitcoin Kimchi Premium indicator. This measures the percentage difference between a cryptocurrency's price (in this case, Bitcoin) on South Korean exchanges and its price on global exchanges. Simply put, it shows how much more Korean traders are willing to pay for Bitcoin. When the Kimchi Premium transitions steadily from low or negative levels to cross above historically significant levels, this is typically viewed as a long signal from the metric. This interpretation is because a rising Kimchi Premium reflects growing local demand in South Korea, usually often influenced by retail buyers. In essence, Korean buyers are willing to pay more for Bitcoin, hence overwhelming the available supply and consequently pushing prices upwards. The price of Bitcoin witnessed a 370% rally after this signal went off in 2023. Hence, if the Kimchi Premium completes its long-signal formation, it could be a sign that buyers are occupying favourable positions for a bullish ride. However, it is worth noting that macro conditions, institutional demand, and derivatives activity would be playing their roles to augment the pattern's plausibility, as it should not be viewed as a standalone bullish sign.

The Last of Us and Uncharted 4 game director Bruce Straley is back with a game that basically sells itself from the word go: Coven of the Chicken Foot has you play as a witchy grandma with chicken feet as she builds a bond with a hulking fantasy creature. And Straley's taking some inspiration from lots of places, from his own post-apocalyptic work and a Studio Ghibli classic to Fumito Ueda. "Ueda's games have definitely had an influence on our game," Straley explains. "ICO was the first game to ever make me cry. While Straley doesn't outright mention it, Coven of the Chicken Foot most reminds me of The Last Guardian, which is also about a sometimes helpless protagonist's push-and-pull relationship with a fantasy beast that's several times stronger and bigger than him. Coven of the Chicken Foot's Steam description even makes reference to "innovative technology" that lets our companion learn based on our behaviour while also pushing back based on its own motivations, which sounds a lot like Trico's role in The Last Guardian. Ueda's design by subtraction has left its mark on countless games, including The Last of Us, so it's no surprise to see it carried over here.

Ethereum's biggest risk may no longer be competition, regulation, or scaling. According to Vitalik Buterin, the real threat is something more subtle: complexity. In a recent warning, Buterin argued that Ethereum's long-term goals, trustlessness, self-sovereignty, and resilience, are being quietly undermined as the protocol grows larger, more technical, and harder to understand. A blockchain does not become stronger just because it adds features. Ethereum is often praised for its decentralization. Thousands of nodes verify transactions, and no single party controls the network. But Buterin argues that decentralization alone is not enough. If a protocol becomes so complex that only a small group of experts can fully understand it, trust creeps back in. Users end up trusting developers, auditors, or cryptography specialists to explain what the system does and whether it is safe. Buterin calls this failing the “walkaway test.” If today's client teams disappeared, could new developers realistically rebuild Ethereum clients from scratch and reach the same level of safety and quality? Each interaction is another chance for something to break. Buterin warns that Ethereum development has often favored adding features to solve specific problems, while rarely removing old ones. Backward compatibility makes subtraction difficult, so the protocol slowly accumulates technical debt. To counter this, Buterin calls for an explicit simplification process. Not just optimizing code, but actively removing unnecessary parts. His idea of simplification focuses on three things: reducing total lines of code, minimizing reliance on highly complex cryptography, and strengthening core invariants, rules the protocol can always rely on. The move from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake was a form of large-scale cleanup. Future changes, such as leaner consensus designs or moving complexity into smart contracts instead of the core protocol, could follow the same logic. Perhaps the most uncomfortable part of Buterin's argument is his conclusion. Ethereum may need to change less, not more. He describes Ethereum's first fifteen years as an experimental adolescence. The danger now is allowing failed or outdated ideas to become permanent baggage. If Ethereum wants to survive for decades, or even a century, Buterin suggests it must prioritize simplicity over ambition.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin warned that excessive protocol complexity undermines the network's fundamental promises of trustlessness and self-sovereignty. The blockchain architect argued that even networks with thousands of nodes can fail basic decentralization tests if their protocols become too complex for independent verification. Read also: Genius Terminal Hits $650M Single-Day Volume Record As CZ-Backed Platform Sees EVM Surge Buterin identified protocol bloat as Ethereum's critical long-term risk, stemming from the tendency to add features without removing outdated ones. The developer proposed explicit "simplification" and "garbage collection" mechanisms to counteract this trend. He outlined three key metrics for measuring simplification: minimizing total lines of code, avoiding dependencies on complex cryptographic components, and adding protocol invariants that strengthen security guarantees. Complex protocols create dependencies on specialized experts who understand intricate technical details, contradicting cryptocurrency's promise of permissionless verification. Buterin suggested future changes could include Rosetta-style backwards compatibility, where legacy features become smart contract code rather than mandatory protocol requirements. The comments come as Ethereum faces mounting competition from alternative layer-1 blockchains that prioritize different trade-offs between complexity and functionality.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Security has become foundational for blockchain infrastructure because failures at the protocol level no longer remain isolated. When blockchains support tokenized financial assets that represent real economic value, vulnerabilities can affect applications, investors, issuers, and capital markets simultaneously. Modern security audits play a critical role in addressing this risk. Rather than serving as surface level validations, audits are technical examinations designed to assess smart contract logic, execution paths, permissioning structures, and system behavior under adversarial conditions. For a blockchain intended to host tokenized securities and regulated assets, this scrutiny is especially important because every application and issuance built on the network inherits its security model. It also establishes a baseline for ongoing monitoring and continuous improvement as the network evolves. That alignment is central to Trusted Smart Chain's long term focus on real world asset tokenization. As tokenized securities, private market assets, and other regulated instruments are issued on blockchain infrastructure, networks must support requirements around accountability, record integrity, and operational reliability. Security and compliance function together as foundational elements rather than separate layers. According to Brant Frank, CTO of Trusted Smart Chain, the CertiK audit fits within a broader effort to design blockchain infrastructure capable of supporting regulated financial activity and real world asset issuance at scale. Frank brings more than a decade of experience designing large scale systems across enterprise software, healthcare, government technology, and blockchain. His background as a software architect and blockchain engineer has informed Trusted Smart Chain's emphasis on disciplined development, security review, and infrastructure designed to support real world use cases. Networks that aim to support tokenized real world assets must demonstrate that they can operate within these constraints while maintaining the benefits of on-chain settlement and programmability. A secure and compliant foundation enables issuers to launch tokenized securities with greater confidence, allows developers to build applications that interact with real world assets, and supports ecosystem growth without compounding hidden risk. Security and compliance remain ongoing commitments rather than static achievements. Protocols evolve, regulatory frameworks develop, and infrastructure must adapt accordingly. The audit provides a foundation from which Trusted Smart Chain can continue refining its role as a blockchain designed specifically for tokenized securities and real world asset tokenization. As real world assets increasingly move on chain, blockchains built with security, regulatory alignment, and infrastructure discipline are likely to define the future of this market. With the completion of its CertiK audit, Trusted Smart Chain continues to position itself at the intersection of blockchain security, compliance, and real world asset tokenization. Digital rewards on Trusted Smart Chain are earned through participation and network activity, are not investments, and carry no promise of profit or financial return. Trusted Smart Chain is a purpose-driven Layer 1 blockchain uniquely engineered to support the tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWAs), from real estate to commodities, with secure smart contracts, fast finality, and low-cost transactions.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It now sits just 4.8% away from its all-time high. While Bitcoin stays flat after new peaks, altcoins like XRP are leading a huge market rally. XRP broke through a key resistance level at $2.60. This move opens the door for even higher prices. Experts say if XRP pushes past $3.40, it could enter price discovery mode. That means new highs with no clear top in sight. The XRP price surge shows strong buyer interest. Trading volume is up, and whales are accumulating. Bitcoin hit fresh all-time highs but couldn't hold gains. Meanwhile, the altcoin market cap exploded 47% in 90 days to $1.44 trillion. This shift signals the start of altseason, where coins like XRP outperform BTC. Dogecoin (DOGE) bounced back above $0.20 for the first time in six weeks. Meme coins are resurging with hype from social media and big endorsements. Its fast network and DeFi growth keep it popular. Ethereum's market share climbed above 10% for the first time since March. DeFi tokens like Aave and Uniswap also rallied hard. Market watchers point to stablecoin adoption as a key driver. Stablecoins like USDT and USDC are flowing into altcoins, boosting liquidity. Bitcoin's dominance fall means money is rotating into alts. Lower interest rates and ETF inflows could extend this trend. Galaxy analyst Michael Harvey highlighted rallies in SOL, XRP, Aave, and Uniswap. “Strong rallies in Solana, XRP, and DeFi tokens are fueled by stablecoin growth.” – Market Expert RSI is in the green but not overbought. Watch for Bitcoin moves – a BTC dip could spark more XRP gains. Investors rotate profits from BTC to alts for higher returns. This week proves alts can outperform even in bull markets. Broader market depends on macro news like Fed decisions. With altcoins on fire, this rally has legs. Don't miss out – DYOR and trade smart. The <33% Weekly Climb to $3.26> puts XRP in spotlight. As altcoins outperform Bitcoin, the market feels alive again. Whether you're HODLing XRP or eyeing DOGE and SOL, excitement is high.
