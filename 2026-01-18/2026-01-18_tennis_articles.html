                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 60th-ranked Frenchwoman came from a set and 5-3 down, saving one match point serving down 6-5 in the second set, and eventually pulled through in 3 hours and 31 minutes -- the longest match of the season so far, and just two minutes shy of 2025's longest match. The result was also Jacquemot's first career Top 20 win. But the fluidity and consistency the Ukrainian displayed two weeks ago was lacking against Jacquemot: Kostyuk fired 67 winners, but they were outweighed by 68 unforced errors. Jacquemot, the 2020 Roland Garros junior champion who cracked the Top 100 last year, lured Kostyuk into over-pressing with superb defense, but also sprinkled in moments of well-timed aggression. A pair of ferocious forehand returns denied Kostyuk as she served for the match at 5-3 in the second set, and Jacquemot fended off match point with a service winner. Serving down 6-5 in the decider, Kostyuk required a medical time-out after rolling her ankle. She was nonetheless able to force a tiebreak, only for her volleys to let her down badly as Jacquemot took a 5-1 lead. Kostyuk managed to level matters at 7-7, but at that point Jacquemot unleashed at the perfect time again, hammering her two biggest forehands of the tiebreak to reach match point of her own. A cagy rally ensued, and ended when Kostyuk netted her drop shot attempt. The result was Jacquemot's first match win of 2026, having lost her openers to Ajla Tomljanovic in Brisbane and Magdalena Frech in Hobart. It was also the third time in the past four majors that Kostyuk had lost her first round to a player ranked outside the Top 50, having exited at Roland Garros to Sara Bejlek and at Wimbledon to Veronika Erjavec. Kostyuk's loss means that a brand new Australian Open quarterfinalist is guaranteed to come out of her section of the draw. The only two players remaining who have reached any major quarterfinal are No. At tour level, Jacquemot's win was the 13th triple-tiebreak match of this decade so far, but the second of 2026 already following Madison Keys' 6-7(5), 7-6(5), 7-6(5) defeat of Diana Shnaider in the Brisbane third round. Putintseva lays down marker for celebration of the year 20 Yulia Putintseva, who laid down a marker for the best celebration of the tournament -- maybe the season -- after defeating Beatriz Haddad Maia 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 in 2 hours and 53 minutes from a set and a break down. 32 Marketa Vondrousova, the former Wimbledon champion, who was forced to withdrew from the tournament due to ongoing shoulder issues. "I'm really sorry that I had to withdraw from the Australian Open due to ongoing shoulder issues," the Czech said in a statement. Thank you all for your understanding and support." Lucky loser Taylor Townsend took Vondrousova's spot in the draw, but fell 6-3, 6-7(3), 6-3 to fellow American Hailey Baptiste. Elsewhere, Polina Kudermetova defeated qualifier Guiomar Maristany Zuleta De Reales 6-2, 6-3 to become the first woman representing Uzbekistan to win a Grand Slam main-draw match in 13 years -- since Akgul Amanmuradova defeated Mathilde Johansson in the first round of the 2013 Australian Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka won her opening match at the 2026 edition with a straight sets victory over Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah. 1 in the first set, but Sabalenka's power and experience prevailed. 1 Aryna Sabalenka's quest to make a fourth straight Australian Open final started on a high note Sunday, defeating Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah, who tested Sabalenka in the first set. "I think I didn't really start at my best and was struggling to find my rhythm," Sabalenka said to reporters. "But then I feel like in the last two games of the first set I found my rhythm, and I was able to step in and play a little bit better tennis." Quickly, the second-set lead blossomed to a 3-0. It was evident Sabalenka's power behind her shot was too much for Rakotomanga Rajaonah, who often hit returns into the net or out of bounds. In the second set, Sabalenka began to control Rakotomanga Rajaonah's movement, opening the court and finishing points at the net, where she ventured forward 22 times, or forcing errors under pressure. The difference in weight of shot was clear on serve: Sabalenka averaged 104 miles per hour on her first delivery, compared with 93 mph for Rakotomanga Rajaonah. That edge carried over on return, where Sabalenka won 42% of points against first serves and 64% against second serves, steadily tightening her grip on the match. "I was definitely working on serve and volley," Sabalenka said. On the practice is one thing, but to be able to be kind of fearless and go there at the match is something else. Winning the coin toss, she elected to receive, and set herself up with triple break point. Sabalenka did force a deuce, but her return into the net gave Rakotomanga Rajaonah the early break. After Sabalenka broke to level at 1-1, Rakotomanga Rajaonah stayed in it by holding her serve across her next three service games. She even saved a break point to avoid going down 5-3, and hit a solid forehand winner to tie at 4-4. It was a performance to be very proud of even in defeat as Rakotomanga Rajaonah left the court in smiles and waved to the Rod Laver Arena crowd, who showered her with applause. I haven't really watched her games before and kind of lose her out of my radar. I didn't really know much about her. I was just struggling to find the rhythm of her shots. Rakotomanga Rajaonah was serving to remain in the first set down 5-4. Ultimately, Sabalenka saved the game points and created a set point of her own. Sabalenka will face Zhuoxuan Bai in the second round. 702 as she returns from injury and competing in her first Grand Slam main draw since Wimbledon 2024, saved one match point in the super-tiebreak to defeat Anastasia Pavluchenkova 6-4, 2-6, 7-6[10]. Two-time Australian Open champion Aryna Sabalenka won her opening match at the 2026 edition with a straight sets victory over Tiantsoa Rakotomanga Rajaonah. 1 in the first set, but Sabalenka's power and experience prevailed.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Olga Danilovic of Serbia thwarted Venus Williams' historic attempt to become the oldest woman to win a main-draw singles match at the Australian Open. Williams, aged 45, fell short in a three-set thriller, with Danilovic prevailing 6-7, 6-3, 6-4. Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, will now focus on the women's doubles event, while Danilovic looks ahead to a challenging second-round match. Serbia's Olga Danilovic came from the brink of defeat to end Venus Williams' historic bid to become the oldest woman to win a main-draw singles match at the Australian Open on Sunday. Williams had already made history the moment she stepped onto John Cain Arena, becoming the oldest woman to compete in a main-draw singles match at the season's first Grand Slam. 1 fell just short of breaking the record held by Japan's Kimiko Date-Krumm, who won a first-round match in Melbourne in 2013 at age 42, losing 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-4 to Olga Danilovic in 2 hours, 17 minutes. 68, soon found her rhythm to level the set. Age is but a number, kinda like 7-6(5)...Venus Williams winds back the clock to take an absorbing first set off Olga Danilovic! Danilovic, more than two decades younger than the seven-time Grand Slam singles champion, broke early in the second set and held serve to take it 6-3 and force a decider. Williams, seeking her first Grand Slam singles main-draw victory since Wimbledon in 2021, surged to a 4-0, double-break lead in the final set before Danilovic responded by winning four straight games to level at 4-4. The match turned in a pivotal ninth game that lasted more than 14 minutes. Williams saved two break points, while Danilovic fought off six game points before breaking on her third opportunity for a 5-4 lead. Serving for the match, the Serb rallied from 15-30 down, to win two extended rallies – one with a passing shot and the other with a volley winner - to set up match point. Williams, making her 22nd Australian Open appearance, is scheduled to return later in the week to compete alongside Ekaterina Alexandrova in women's doubles. She is a four-time women's doubles champion here, winning each time with sister Serena Williams. Williams added that she was proud of her efforts and feels that she is playing better with every match of her comeback. "I'm really proud of my effort today because I'm playing better with each match, getting to the places that I want to get to," she said. Those are things, too, that come with playing extra matches, like getting your feet in the exact right position, choosing the right shots, all of those things that I'm still learning. It's kind of weird, but it's super exciting to have played that well and to get myself in that position and come very close." Danilovic, who reached the fourth round here 12 months ago, will face either third-seeded Coco Gauff or Kamilla Rakhimova for a place in the third round.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz made a winning start in his quest to complete the Career Grand Slam at this year's Australian Open, where he overcame a resilient performance from Australian Adam Walton to reach the second round in Melbourne. 1 moved past Walton 6-3, 7-6(2), 6-2 in the night session on Rod Laver Arena. Alcaraz, who ended his seven-year relationship with former coach Ferrero in December, is aiming to become just the sixth man – and youngest – in the Open Era to win all four major titles at least once. The Spaniard was not at his free-flowing best against Walton but found enough consistency when needed to shake off the World No. 79 in the pair's second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting (2-0 Alcaraz). It could not have been better, playing here on the Rod Laver Arena,” Alcaraz said. I felt great and Adam pulled off some great shots, a great level in the match, so I had to stay there at this kind of level.” Alcaraz struck 38 winners and showed his fighting qualities in the second set, rallying from 1-3 to stamp further authority on the clash. Walton was trying to advance to the second round of his home Slam for the first time and gave a good account of himself throughout the two-hour, 13-minute clash, troubling Alcaraz at times with his deep groundstrokes. "It felt he was always in a good position. Alcaraz, led by coach Samuel Lopez, is chasing his seventh major this fortnight. 10 player in the PIF ATP Rankings Alexander Bublik earned his first win at the Australian Open since 2022. Competing as a Top 10 player for the first time, the 28-year-old overcame Jenson Brooksby 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to set a second-round clash with Marton Fucsovics. American qualifier Michael Zheng earned a dream win on his tour-level debut, upsetting Sebastian Korda 6-4, 6-4, 3-6, 6-7(0), 6-3. The 21-year-old Zheng, who will next play Corentin Moutet, is currently studying at Columbia University in New York, where he is a senior.

British lefty Norrie defeated Benjamin Bonzi 6-0, 6-7(2), 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 and has now won his past three matches that have gone to five sets, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Qualifier Zeynep Sonmez delivered sportsmanship, hot shots and ultimately a slice of Turkish history after coming from 3-0 down in the third set to upset No. 11 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 in the Australian Open first round. Australian Open: Scores | Draws | Order of play Last year, she became the second Turkish woman to compete in the main draw here following Cagla Buyukakcay, who fell in the 2017 first round in her only main-draw appearance. The 2-hour, 37-minute contest was marked by wild momentum swings -- Sonmez won the first set from 5-2 down, saving one set point, with a run of seven straight games; she lost the second set from 3-1 up as Alexandrova took eight of the next nine games; but from 3-0 down in the decider, Sonmez hit her stride again to take six of the last seven games, converting her fourth match point as Alexandrova netted a backhand. She followed it by pulling Alexandrova into net with a drop shot, and although Alexandrova still managed to get decent pace on to her own reply, Sonmez anticipated it and managed to slot a forehand pass at full stretch for a winner. She later received medical attention and left the site. "She was really struggling," Sonmez later told BBC Sport. "As we were walking she fainted so luckily I grabbed her. "I always say it is more important to be a good human being than a good tennis player. It was just my instinct to help her and I think everyone would do the same. Not that the crowd needed any further encouragement to get behind Sonmez. She enjoyed fervent Turkish support throughout; a plethora of the country's flags were waved, and Sonmez adorned herself with one of them for a victory lap after the match. It's not the first time she's attracted this kind of excitement by breaking new ground. Last year, London's Turkish diaspora turned out for Sonmez at Wimbledon as she became the first Turkish player to reach the third round of a Grand Slam in the Open Era -- a run that was halted by none other than Alexandrova. Sonmez, who dropped just 13 games in three qualifying matches last week, is bidding to return to the Top 100 after reaching a career high of No. A post shared by Australian Open (@australianopen)</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British qualifier Arthur Fery earned the first win of the 2026 Australian Open men's draw on Sunday when he upset 20th seed Flavio Cobolli 7-6(1), 6-4, 6-1. “Incredible experience here,” said Fery in his on-court interview. “My first time playing a main-draw Slam outside of Wimbledon and it didn't disappoint on such a great court with great fans as well.” Fery, 23, has claimed two of his three tour-level victories at Slam level. A former two-time ITA All-American at Stanford University, Fery produced superb shotmaking throughout the two-hour, 12-minute clash and converted six of his 10 break-point chances. Cobolli took a medical timeout after three games and received several visits from the doctor across the match, seemingly struggling with a stomach issue. 22 was unable to find rhythm and counter Fery's fearless baseline play at John Cain Arena. Fery, who began the season's first major at a career-high No. 185 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will look to build upon his momentum against Miomir Kecmanovic or Tomas Martin Etcheverry. Cobolli helped guide Italy to a third consecutive Davis Cup title in November. Cobolli was clutch that week, not only clinching the final victory against Spain, but also saving seven match points against Belgium's Zizou Bergs in the semi-finals. He went 1-1 at the United Cup, earning a three-set victory against Stan Wawrinka before falling to Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech 6-7(4), 7-6(5), 7-5 in a three-hour, 21-minute nailbiter. Third seed Alexander Zverev overcame early trouble against dangerous Canadian Gabriel Diallo to begin his campaign in winning fashion, posting a 6-7(1), 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 victory after claiming six service breaks. Making his 40th major appearance, last year's finalist quickly rebounded from a below-par performance in the first-set tie-break, during which he struggled to find rhythm on his forehand. By earning a break in Diallo's first service game of the second set, Zverev loosened up and stood closer to the baseline to dictate rallies while swinging freely at the ball. In the third set alone, the German landed 86 per cent of his first serves and won 95 per cent (18/19) of those points, according to Infosys ATP Stats. He finished with 15 aces and just one double fault. Get official marketing communications from the ATP and WTA!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During the Australian Open, ATPTour.com will bring fans insight into the leaders of key statistical categories, showing how performances throughout 2025 all added up to successful seasons and the promise of more good times ahead in 2026. He embraces any and all risk behind his lethal weapon, putting the returner in a constant battle. American Reilly Opelka ranked a distant second at 130.6 mph. "His technique is so fluid," said Craig O'Shannessy, the Frenchman's strategy analyst. "With his height, looseness in his arm and wrist and energy coiling up through the body, he's able to hit the ball harder than anyone else in the game. He has a very lively wrist at the end of that kinetic chain." What distinguishes Mpetshi Perricard from his peers is his refusal to ease off when hitting a second serve. Rather than prioritising safety, as many players would, Mpetshi Perricard doubles down on aggression. He averaged a fearless 117 mph on his second delivery in 2025, rarely giving any breathing room for his opponents. Valentin Vacherot ranked second in average second-serve speed at 112.5 mph. "He needs to be a player who mixes in a number of second serves that he hits as hard as his first serve," O'Shannesy said. "He doesn't need to hit two first serves all the time; it needs to be strategic.
