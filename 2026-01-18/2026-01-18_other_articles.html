                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In this episode, Michael Shermer talks with filmmaker James Fox, whose work has helped push UFOs, now often called UAPs, out of the tabloid shadows and into congressional hearings, radar logs, and sworn testimony. Fox has spent three decades interviewing fighter pilots, radar operators, intelligence officials, scientists, and firsthand witnesses. His conclusion is not that we know what these objects are, but that dismissing them no longer works. Around 90 to 95 percent of sightings collapse under scrutiny. James Fox is a film director widely regarded as one of the leading voices in UFO filmmaking. He is known for documentaries such as The Phenomenon, The Program, and Moment of Contact, several of which are frequently cited among the best UFO documentaries ever made.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here is a supernatural music video short film for you to enjoy titled Buddha Was A Rich Boy by the band The Handsom Devil. In the video, after a concert flyer turned paper airplane lands into the laps of two kid sisters, they infiltrate the venue to find a mindless mosh crowding a supernatural bathroom. It is shared in collaboration with the FilmQuest Film Festival, where we are looking to expose some of the great indie genre films and shorts that filmmakers are creating. How did you come up with the idea? I dm'd the band on Instagram in the hopes that I could be considered to direct a music video for them alongside some of my friends that I've always wanted to work with in such a capacity. Despite having no evidence to indicate that I would be a good director, the singer (Godforbid) graciously told me that he liked my work. This one was primarily Godforbid's idea (down to the two child actors being his kids). I first-time directed two music videos for That Handsome Devil last year. The trajectory of my work in relativity to the film festival circuit was beating Jeremy Renner for an award at our world premiere in addition to being officially selected for 4 Academy Award Qualifying film festivals so far. What inspires you to work within genre cinema and tell these kind of stories? Much like That Handsome Devils discography, it stems from having a taste that doesn't neatly fit me into any one box. I don't blindly love any one decade's culture. What was your favorite part of the filmmaking process for this project? Filming with a band that I've loved's music for years, alongside my friends who's respective works I've loved for years, was what made maxing out two credit cards (one per video) worth it. Getting to make new friends with inspirng filmmakers on the film festival circuit (such as Kai Straw) has made my priorities as an artist stronger. What are you most proud of with this film? I've been doing research on the odds of a first time filmmaker getting showcased in 4+ academy award qualifying film festivals, and beating out an a-list actor for an award. I'm happy to learn that gambling on myself has paid off in the regard that I'm in a single-percentile of filmmakers to have achieved the accolades that I have at the time of doing this interview. When I factor my research as a first time filmmaker going into music videos, this is an even harder niche to crack, considering I'm not working with a Billboard 100 artist. I excitedly called my producer to inform him that my winnings from the slots could afford me a production assistant for both days. If I didn't do this, production surely would have suffered. We were lucky to have gotten a wide spectrum of emotional range from her. I originally wanted to do more greenscreen style puppeteering of the baby, having her run up on the bar, being crowdsurfed, etc. I softpitched Godforbid on puppets in this one because I wanted to work with my friend Jamie Shannon (Nanalan, Mr. Meaty, etc.). The reality of what I had to work with has led me to the final result we have now. Though I must say that the other video, Before You Were Born, was pre-selected for Chelsea Film Festival. Truthfully, I wouldn't change a thing between both videos... Who were some of your collaborators and actors on the film? How did you start working with each other? Brent Bailey is an amazing cinematographer whom I got to admire on sets I'd work on with him as an assistant director. Me being a fan of his eye on works like The Quiet Room & Dragula made me intimidated to reach out to him right away despite he and I being friends haha Brandon Torres & Gina Torres were my producer super-couple remotely working from Austin Texas as we simultaneously worked in New York. We were basically the big 4 that spearheaded this thing. Supporting crew members were primarily found through Brandon's vetting process with our amazing production assistant, Ryan Cervasio, being recommended to my by Scott Klausen. Both Ryan and Scott are part of the Terrifier 2 & 3 crew for anyone reading that's a fan :) What is the best advice you've ever received as a filmmaker and what would you like to say to new filmmakers? If I was a money person and you reached out to me having no movies under your belt, I would not trust you with my money. Similarly, no one gave me permission or a budget to make these videos. Max out credit cards, pull favors, submit to every film festival. Betting on yourself is scary but it will pay off. What are your plans for your career and what do you hope this film does for it? What kind of stories would you like to tell moving forward? I will be submitting that for grants to flesh into a bigger project. I'm using the long time it takes to animate to contemplate what my first short film will be. What is your next project and when can we expect to see it? The wildlife documentary pitch is called Island of Garbage. I been talking to my friend/grammy-award-winner Carla Patullo about possibly contributing music. I highly recommend everyone get tickets for The Residents' world tour of Eskimo and listening to Carla's latest album Nomadica. Those will give you an idea of where I'm going artistically, also both works respectively made me cry haha Bonus Question #1: What is your all-time favorite film? Bonus Question #2: What is the film that most inspired you to become a filmmaker and/or had the most influence on your work?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Supernatural has become one of my favorite shows, there are several flaws that I wish could have been given far better potential. I think when it comes to their use of several villains, some of them are either overused, or extremely underused for the show. One specific villain that I was disappointed with both the little use of screentime and storyline, was the cosmic terror known as The Empty. This villain instantly caught my attention, when we got the first glimpse of this thing after Castiel dies again. He awakens in The Empty, where he meets an entity that takes on his own form, mocking him. This creature came off so threatening upon first meeting, and I was looking forward to seeing more of this villain. Unfortunately, I felt that the villain didn't get a proper storyline for the show. The Empty was such an interesting villain. This thing reminded me of Lovecraft horror, an unknown horror that obviously did not belong. I also loved how the entity could take on so many forms, shape shifting has always been of my favorite attributes in horror. Due to the insanity that was going on with the Winchesters and their friends, the Empty had woken up, and was pretty pissed off. The Empty started to use pain as its main factor, going after anyone that would dare to mess with it. The Empty also become victorious in season 15, when it was able to claim the soul of Castiel, after he was told that if he is ever happy, he will die. There was also a really cool scene with The Empty before Castiel was told this messed up deal, when it had possessed a random angel. The acting of this scene made me a little uncomfortable, probably because I knew that this thing was not human. It also kept on smiling at Castiel, heavily implying that The Empty was stuck in its own madness. I did mention that Jack should have been the villain in another article, but I think The Empty would have been a much better choice. It's a huge shame that The Empty was treated more like a side villain compared to the other villains that I thought were kind of tame compared to this entity. I would have loved a storyline of Jack being forced to take down The Empty, after the death of Castiel. A Lovecraftian horror attempting to take over the Earth would have been a fantastic storyline, all because it was angry that many forces had awoken this thing from its eternal slumber. That would have been an awesome ending for the show. Man, how I wished The Empty was written as more of a threat for the final seasons! I love to learn about the history of horror, I write about all kinds of horror topics, and I love to write short horror stories! There are no comments for this story We get a small glimpse of how the 'zombie' virus spread, and it quickly infected the entire world. By Emy Quinna day ago in Horror By Charlie Pratt20 days ago in Horror In my mind, every castle is haunted, usually by a lady in a white dress, a headless nobleman, or (the absolute worst) creepy ghost children. Earlier that day, her family had visited her in the retirement home where she had lived for eight years.</p>

Two men, separated by generations but united by military service and a refusal to accept official dismissals, played defining roles in that transformation. Together, they form a continuous historical thread linking the earliest UFO debates of the Cold War to today's formal federal reporting systems. By the time he reached adulthood, aviation had become a defining feature of modern warfare and national power. His military service placed him at the forefront of early 20th century aviation, giving him firsthand experience with the limits and possibilities of aircraft technology. An injury forced Keyhoe to retire from active duty earlier than planned, but it did not end his involvement with aviation. He went on to work with the Civil Aeronautics Branch and established himself as a respected aviation writer. His articles for major magazines translated complex technical developments into language the public could understand. Unlike many observers, he did not dismiss the sightings as mass hysteria or simple misidentifications. Keyhoe argued that these objects were not secret American projects or foreign aircraft. In the context of Cold War secrecy, when nuclear weapons programs and intelligence operations were hidden behind layers of classification, this accusation resonated deeply. Keyhoe's growing prominence brought him into conflict with military authorities. He believed that official explanations of UFO sightings were often inconsistent or misleading, designed more to reassure the public than to reflect the available evidence. According to Keyhoe, the Air Force had adopted a policy of debunking by default, even when cases remained unresolved. As its director, Keyhoe sought to professionalize civilian UFO investigation. NICAP focused on collecting reports from credible witnesses, especially military personnel and pilots, and documenting cases with as much rigor as possible.Related: Official CIA documents reported that a UFO turned a Soviet infantry unit to stone Keyhoe was careful to distance NICAP from overt sensationalism. He insisted that UFOs be treated as a serious scientific and security issue, not entertainment. Keyhoe's confrontational stance made him a frequent subject of media interviews. His televised exchanges with journalists such as Mike Wallace exposed millions of Americans to the idea that UFO secrecy was a deliberate policy choice rather than a matter of ignorance. Public pressure generated by Keyhoe and others played a role in prompting the U.S. Air Force to formalize its response to UFO sightings. Project Blue Book, established in 1952, became the longest-running UFO investigation, lasting until 1969. Although Blue Book cataloged thousands of cases, it concluded that UFOs posed no threat to national security. Keyhoe rejected these conclusions, arguing that unresolved cases and classified data told a different story. Even so, the existence of these programs demonstrated that UFOs could not be entirely ignored, a reality shaped in part by Keyhoe's persistent advocacy. Unlike many UFO proponents, Keyhoe attempted to anchor his arguments in scientific and technical frameworks. He drew on speculative theories from figures such as Wilbert Smith and rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth, discussing the possibility that UFOs employ gravitational manipulation for propulsion. Such technology, he argued, could explain the extreme acceleration, silent hovering, and sharp maneuvers reported by witnesses without subjecting occupants to lethal forces. Keyhoe continued writing and speaking on UFOs until his death in 1988. Yet his influence endured, shaping the foundations of modern ufology and leaving unresolved questions that would resurface decades later. Advances in radar, infrared sensors, satellite surveillance, and data analysis transformed how the military monitored airspace. At the same time, growing concern about advanced foreign weapons systems reframed unexplained sightings as potential intelligence threats. Unlike earlier programs, AATIP was not primarily concerned with extraterrestrial life. The central question was whether these objects represented advanced technologies capable of penetrating controlled airspace and outmaneuvering U.S. aircraft. Under Elizondo's leadership, AATIP investigated incidents involving objects with no visible propulsion systems, no wings or control surfaces, and performance characteristics beyond known aerospace platforms. These included extreme acceleration, sudden directional changes, hypersonic speeds, and seamless operation across different environments. Radar tracks, infrared imagery, and eyewitness accounts from trained military personnel provided a level of evidentiary rigor rarely seen in earlier UFO investigations. For Elizondo, this data suggested that the phenomenon could not be dismissed as simple misidentification or equipment error. If such objects were foreign technology, they represented a serious intelligence failure. Elizondo eventually concluded that bureaucratic resistance and institutional stigma were preventing meaningful investigation. After his resignation, Elizondo helped bring AATIP into public view. Media reporting confirmed the program's existence, and declassified military videos showing encounters with UAPs were released. Rather than ridicule, the disclosures prompted serious discussion among journalists, scientists, and lawmakers. Elizondo became a leading advocate for transparency, emphasizing that UAPs should be studied systematically and without stigma. Elizondo's actions helped reshape how the federal government approaches UAPs. Congressional interest led to briefings, hearings, and new legislative requirements. Unlike earlier programs, AARO was created by Congress and designated as the Department of Defense's single focal point for UAP investigation. UAPs are now treated as a legitimate category of analysis within national security planning, rather than an embarrassment to be ignored. Current or former U.S. government employees, service members, and contractors with direct knowledge of UAP programs or activities are eligible to submit reports through official AARO reporting forms. These forms are designed to preserve data integrity and allow for follow-ups when necessary. The Federal Aviation Administration collects pilot reports related to UAP encounters, which are then shared with AARO for analysis. This integration ensures that aviation safety and national security concerns are addressed together. The overarching goals are safety, intelligence awareness, and transparency. The long arc of America's engagement with unidentified aerial phenomena reveals a clear evolution. What began as fragmented sightings and guarded military assessments has steadily matured into a structured, multi-disciplinary effort that blends national security, scientific inquiry, and public transparency. Major Donald E. Keyhoe forced the first serious public reckoning, challenging Cold War secrecy and insisting that unexplained aerial objects were real and worthy of investigation. Decades later, Luis Elizondo helped push the issue into the modern era, reframing UAPs as a legitimate defense and intelligence concern and helping catalyze formal federal mechanisms such as AARO. Yet the elevation of UAP study has not occurred solely within government halls. In parallel, private scientific efforts have expanded the scope of inquiry beyond military encounters and into controlled, data-rich environments. Few examples illustrate this shift more clearly than Brandon Fugal's work at Skinwalker Ranch. Previously shrouded in secrecy and associated with classified government research under prior ownership, the ranch has been reimagined as a transparent, instrumented laboratory. Fugal's approach reflects a new phase in UAP research, one that emphasizes empirical data, repeatable measurement, and interdisciplinary collaboration rather than speculation alone. Under his leadership, Skinwalker Ranch hosts a sustained scientific investigation into what researchers often describe as “high strangeness,” including UFO sightings, unexplained energy emissions, and anomalous physical effects. The investigative team combines expertise in physics, astrophysics, engineering, and security, with figures such as physicist Erik Bard, astrophysicist Travis Taylor, and security chief Bryant “Dragon” Arnold forming a core group focused on disciplined observation rather than sensational conclusions. The use of advanced technologies, including ground penetrating radar, thermal imaging, spectrum analysis, and custom artificial intelligence systems, represents a level of technical rigor rarely applied to such phenomena in the past. Fugal's decision to support and publicize this work through “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch” has also played a cultural role similar to that once filled by Keyhoe's books and Elizondo's disclosures. By placing data-driven investigation before a mainstream audience, the series has helped normalize serious discussion of anomalous phenomena. Importantly, Fugal has emphasized that he reinvests media proceeds back into research and charitable causes, reinforcing the idea that the ranch is not a commercial curiosity but a long-term scientific endeavor. Even ambitious initiatives, such as deploying a dedicated satellite to monitor the property from orbit, underscore how far the field has moved from anecdote to instrumentation. Taken together, the legacies of Keyhoe, Elizondo, and Fugal reveal a profound shift. UAPs are no longer confined to whispered rumors, tabloid headlines, or classified filing cabinets. While definitive answers remain elusive, the methodology has changed dramatically. That transformation stands as the shared achievement of those who refused to accept dismissal, demanded better questions, and insisted that the unknown be met not with fear or mockery, but with disciplined curiosity. He is passionate about inspiring curiosity and a love for learning in his students.

He insisted that UFOs be treated as a serious scientific and security issue, not entertainment. Keyhoe's confrontational stance made him a frequent subject of media interviews. His televised exchanges with journalists such as Mike Wallace exposed millions of Americans to the idea that UFO secrecy was a deliberate policy choice rather than a matter of ignorance. Public pressure generated by Keyhoe and others played a role in prompting the U.S. Air Force to formalize its response to UFO sightings. Project Blue Book, established in 1952, became the longest-running UFO investigation, lasting until 1969. Although Blue Book cataloged thousands of cases, it concluded that UFOs posed no threat to national security. Keyhoe rejected these conclusions, arguing that unresolved cases and classified data told a different story. Even so, the existence of these programs demonstrated that UFOs could not be entirely ignored, a reality shaped in part by Keyhoe's persistent advocacy. Unlike many UFO proponents, Keyhoe attempted to anchor his arguments in scientific and technical frameworks. He drew on speculative theories from figures such as Wilbert Smith and rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth, discussing the possibility that UFOs employ gravitational manipulation for propulsion. Such technology, he argued, could explain the extreme acceleration, silent hovering, and sharp maneuvers reported by witnesses without subjecting occupants to lethal forces. Keyhoe continued writing and speaking on UFOs until his death in 1988. Yet his influence endured, shaping the foundations of modern ufology and leaving unresolved questions that would resurface decades later. Advances in radar, infrared sensors, satellite surveillance, and data analysis transformed how the military monitored airspace. At the same time, growing concern about advanced foreign weapons systems reframed unexplained sightings as potential intelligence threats. Unlike earlier programs, AATIP was not primarily concerned with extraterrestrial life. The central question was whether these objects represented advanced technologies capable of penetrating controlled airspace and outmaneuvering U.S. aircraft. Under Elizondo's leadership, AATIP investigated incidents involving objects with no visible propulsion systems, no wings or control surfaces, and performance characteristics beyond known aerospace platforms. These included extreme acceleration, sudden directional changes, hypersonic speeds, and seamless operation across different environments. Radar tracks, infrared imagery, and eyewitness accounts from trained military personnel provided a level of evidentiary rigor rarely seen in earlier UFO investigations. For Elizondo, this data suggested that the phenomenon could not be dismissed as simple misidentification or equipment error. If such objects were foreign technology, they represented a serious intelligence failure. Elizondo eventually concluded that bureaucratic resistance and institutional stigma were preventing meaningful investigation. After his resignation, Elizondo helped bring AATIP into public view. Media reporting confirmed the program's existence, and declassified military videos showing encounters with UAPs were released. Rather than ridicule, the disclosures prompted serious discussion among journalists, scientists, and lawmakers. Elizondo became a leading advocate for transparency, emphasizing that UAPs should be studied systematically and without stigma. Elizondo's actions helped reshape how the federal government approaches UAPs. Congressional interest led to briefings, hearings, and new legislative requirements. Unlike earlier programs, AARO was created by Congress and designated as the Department of Defense's single focal point for UAP investigation. UAPs are now treated as a legitimate category of analysis within national security planning, rather than an embarrassment to be ignored. Current or former U.S. government employees, service members, and contractors with direct knowledge of UAP programs or activities are eligible to submit reports through official AARO reporting forms. These forms are designed to preserve data integrity and allow for follow-ups when necessary. The Federal Aviation Administration collects pilot reports related to UAP encounters, which are then shared with AARO for analysis. This integration ensures that aviation safety and national security concerns are addressed together. The overarching goals are safety, intelligence awareness, and transparency. The long arc of America's engagement with unidentified aerial phenomena reveals a clear evolution. What began as fragmented sightings and guarded military assessments has steadily matured into a structured, multi-disciplinary effort that blends national security, scientific inquiry, and public transparency. Major Donald E. Keyhoe forced the first serious public reckoning, challenging Cold War secrecy and insisting that unexplained aerial objects were real and worthy of investigation. Decades later, Luis Elizondo helped push the issue into the modern era, reframing UAPs as a legitimate defense and intelligence concern and helping catalyze formal federal mechanisms such as AARO. Yet the elevation of UAP study has not occurred solely within government halls. In parallel, private scientific efforts have expanded the scope of inquiry beyond military encounters and into controlled, data-rich environments. Few examples illustrate this shift more clearly than Brandon Fugal's work at Skinwalker Ranch. Previously shrouded in secrecy and associated with classified government research under prior ownership, the ranch has been reimagined as a transparent, instrumented laboratory. Fugal's approach reflects a new phase in UAP research, one that emphasizes empirical data, repeatable measurement, and interdisciplinary collaboration rather than speculation alone. Under his leadership, Skinwalker Ranch hosts a sustained scientific investigation into what researchers often describe as “high strangeness,” including UFO sightings, unexplained energy emissions, and anomalous physical effects. The investigative team combines expertise in physics, astrophysics, engineering, and security, with figures such as physicist Erik Bard, astrophysicist Travis Taylor, and security chief Bryant “Dragon” Arnold forming a core group focused on disciplined observation rather than sensational conclusions. The use of advanced technologies, including ground penetrating radar, thermal imaging, spectrum analysis, and custom artificial intelligence systems, represents a level of technical rigor rarely applied to such phenomena in the past. Fugal's decision to support and publicize this work through “The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch” has also played a cultural role similar to that once filled by Keyhoe's books and Elizondo's disclosures. By placing data-driven investigation before a mainstream audience, the series has helped normalize serious discussion of anomalous phenomena. Importantly, Fugal has emphasized that he reinvests media proceeds back into research and charitable causes, reinforcing the idea that the ranch is not a commercial curiosity but a long-term scientific endeavor. Even ambitious initiatives, such as deploying a dedicated satellite to monitor the property from orbit, underscore how far the field has moved from anecdote to instrumentation. Taken together, the legacies of Keyhoe, Elizondo, and Fugal reveal a profound shift. UAPs are no longer confined to whispered rumors, tabloid headlines, or classified filing cabinets. While definitive answers remain elusive, the methodology has changed dramatically. That transformation stands as the shared achievement of those who refused to accept dismissal, demanded better questions, and insisted that the unknown be met not with fear or mockery, but with disciplined curiosity. He is passionate about inspiring curiosity and a love for learning in his students.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Military culture and entertainment direct to your inbox with zero chance of a ‘Reply All' incident For more than three quarters of a century, reports of strange objects in the sky have unsettled pilots, challenged scientists, and tested the credibility of governments.What began in the late 1940s as scattered sightings of so-called flying saucers has evolved into a modern national security issue discussed openly in Congress under the term Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena, or UAP. Two men, separated by generations but united by military service and a refusal to accept official dismissals, played defining roles in that transformation. Together, they form a continuous historical thread linking the earliest UFO debates of the Cold War to today's formal federal reporting systems. By the time he reached adulthood, aviation had become a defining feature of modern warfare and national power. His military service placed him at the forefront of early 20th century aviation, giving him firsthand experience with the limits and possibilities of aircraft technology. An injury forced Keyhoe to retire from active duty earlier than planned, but it did not end his involvement with aviation. He went on to work with the Civil Aeronautics Branch and established himself as a respected aviation writer. His articles for major magazines translated complex technical developments into language the public could understand. Unlike many observers, he did not dismiss the sightings as mass hysteria or simple misidentifications. Keyhoe argued that these objects were not secret American projects or foreign aircraft. In the context of Cold War secrecy, when nuclear weapons programs and intelligence operations were hidden behind layers of classification, this accusation resonated deeply. Keyhoe's growing prominence brought him into conflict with military authorities. He believed that official explanations of UFO sightings were often inconsistent or misleading, designed more to reassure the public than to reflect the available evidence. According to Keyhoe, the Air Force had adopted a policy of debunking by default, even when cases remained unresolved. As its director, Keyhoe sought to professionalize civilian UFO investigation. NICAP focused on collecting reports from credible witnesses, especially military personnel and pilots, and documenting cases with as much rigor as possible.Related: Official CIA documents reported that a UFO turned a Soviet infantry unit to stone Keyhoe was careful to distance NICAP from overt sensationalism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A decade of observations of four planets around the young planetary system V1298 Tau revealed a rare, long-sought missing link in planet formation. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Astronomers have gotten a rare glimpse at four baby planets as they're growing up, and it reveals something surprising: These toddler worlds are getting lighter as they age. The quadruplet worlds orbit in tightly packed paths around the star V1298 Tau, a young system that's just 20 million years old (compared with our sun's 4.5 billion years) located about 350 light-years from Earth. A new analysis, which drew on a decade of observations, shows that the planets are surprisingly lightweight, with low densities — so puffed up, in fact, that researchers likened them to Styrofoam. Those older systems are often crowded with planets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune on tight, Mercury-like orbits. "What's so exciting is that we're seeing a preview of what will become a very normal planetary system," study lead author John Livingston, an assistant professor at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, said in a statement. "We've never had such a clear picture of them in their formative years." Over time, the bloated worlds around V1298 Tau are expected to shrink as they shed their thick atmospheres, eventually becoming super-Earths and sub-Neptunes — planetary types that are absent from our own solar system but ubiquitous throughout the galaxy. Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. What immediately set the system apart was its crowded layout of multiple oversized planets packed into relatively tight orbits — a configuration known in only one other system, Kepler-51, among more than 500 known multi-planet systems. While the planets' existence was clear, their fundamental properties remained elusive. To pin them down, Livingston and his team embarked on a nearly decade-long observation campaign using half a dozen telescopes in space and on the ground. They tracked the planets as they passed in front of their star — events known as transits, which cause tiny dips in starlight that reveal a planet's size and orbital period. But the method only works if astronomers know each planet's orbital period precisely — and for the outermost planet, V1298 Tau e, that information was missing. Only two of its transits had ever been observed, separated by 6.5 years across observations from Kepler and NASA's exoplanet-hunting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) telescope, leaving astronomers unsure how many transits had gone unseen in between, according to the study. study co-author Erik Petigura, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCLA, said in the statement. "The timing was so uncertain that I thought we would have to try half a dozen times at least. "They are indeed exceptionally 'puffy,' which gives us a crucial, long-awaited benchmark for theories of planet evolution." —James Webb telescope confirms a supermassive black hole running away from its host galaxy at 2 million mph, researchers say —Some objects we thought were planets may actually be tiny black holes from the dawn of time The team then simulated the planets' evolution and found that they have already lost much of their original atmospheres and cooled faster than predicted by standard models. "But they're still evolving," study co-author James Owen, an associate professor of astrophysics at Imperial College London, said in the statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The paedophile financier's younger brother is claiming that ‘more autopsy facts' coming out in February will prove Epstein's death was murder, not suicide. The financier's death was ruled as a suicide, and a Department of Justice report four years later found no credible evidence of foul play. Yet that hasn't stopped many from claiming that Epstein, who cultivated an array of rich and famous friends, was murdered before he could blow the whistle on powerful associates. And among the loudest voices asserting that Epstein was killed to protect the interests of those wealthy friends is his younger brother, Mark. I want to know who killed him and on whose behalf.” He then cryptically claimed that “more autopsy facts will be coming out in February that prove” Jeffrey was killed. What's particularly striking is how the younger Epstein brother, who maintained a very low public profile throughout his sibling's life, has decided to stick his head above the proverbial parapet to become a part of this grim circus of intrigue and insinuation. Despite being only a year or so apart, “most people didn't know Jeff had a brother,” he told The Telegraph last year. In stepping out from the shadows, he has inadvertently invited scrutiny into his own life; in the same interview, he admitted that he'd been protected by “armed guards for a while” after receiving threats in the wake of his brother's death. His willingness to make bold claims about Jeffrey's relationship with Donald Trump. “He didn't tell me what he knew, but Jeffrey definitely had dirt on Trump,” Mark suggested last year (the president has always vehemently maintained that he did not know about Epstein's crimes, and says that they ended their friendship sometime in the 2000s). He went on to study art at the prestigious Cooper Union College, then founded a silkscreen printing company, Izmo. Later, though, he swapped these more creative pursuits for property development. And it's here that Mark's business affairs become more complicated. In the early Nineties, he launched another company, Ossa Properties, which at one time possessed more than 500 renter-occupied apartments across four co-op projects in New York City. But since Jeffrey's death, it is one particular building, a nondescript block of flats at 301 East 66th Street, that has been the focus of most scrutiny. “I would not have continued to work with any individual capable of such egregious, sickening behaviour as has been reported about him,” he wrote in a memo to employees in 2019. Jeffrey is thought to have rented a number of apartments at number 301 from his brother; the building's address was listed in his notorious “black book” as “apt. It is here that the eldest Epstein is alleged to have housed associates and models linked to MC2, the modelling agency funded by Jeffrey and founded by his friend Jean-Luc Brunel (who was later accused in court documents of procuring girls for the financier, as well as sexual harassment and rape; he denied the charges before he died in prison in 2022). “I'm not sure who pays it, but Jeff's been renting there for years.” Mark has also shut down any attempts to link Ossa with J Epstein & Co, his brother's business. Documents filed by a Harlem-based charter school suggested that Jonathan Barrett, a proposed board member for the school, worked for both Ossa and J Epstein & Co over four years in the Nineties. Despite Barrett's employment seeming to connect the two companies, Mark said this was a “mistake”, and told Crain's that “there's no business relationship between those entities”. When he has been asked about his financial affairs and how they might have overlapped with his brother's, Mark has offered only brusque responses. “I don't have time to talk about it, and I don't see any purpose in talking about it with anybody,” he told the Wall Street Journal in the summer of 2019, shortly after Jeffrey's death. “Since the president of the USA won't divulge his business info, and there are many more compelling reasons for him to do so, and since I have not been accused of wrongdoing by any government agency, I see no reason why I or any other American should either,” he hit back at The Daily Beast around the same time. Should Jeffrey have died without a will, Mark, as his only close living relative, would have inherited the entirety of his estimated $577m estate. And in doing so, he shielded the identities of his beneficiaries from public view (Mark, for his part, has said he was not among them). According to one interview with The Guardian, they'd only occasionally been in touch after their mother died in 2004; he's also said that when he identified Jeffrey's body after his death, it marked the first time he'd seen him in seven years. Yet when his sibling had pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking of minors a few months before, Mark had offered his home in Florida to guarantee Jeffrey's bail bond (the request was denied). “Jeffrey told me that… it was after the election that Trump called him and it was sort of like, ‘Can you believe this?' Because nobody believed Trump was going to win,” Mark told CNN in November. (Trump, meanwhile, has said he has “nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein” and “threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert”.) Shortly after identifying his brother's body, he hired the forensic pathologist and former New York City chief medical examiner Dr Michael Baden, who disputed the official conclusion of suicide. According to Baden, Jeffrey had a number of injuries that are “extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation”. In 2023, a report from a US justice department watchdog admitted that “negligence, misconduct and outright job performance failures” at Manhattan's Metropolitan correctional centre provided [Epstein] with the opportunity to take his own life”. It also cited issues with security cameras, and guards failing to check in on the prisoner as required. Yet it did not find “evidence contradicting the FBI's determination there was no criminality in connection with how Epstein died”. This, however, does not seem to have satisfied Mark, who has again and again called for “a full investigation” into his older brother's death; in the same year the watchdog report was released, he even submitted a tip to the FBI, writing: “Jeffrey Epstein was murdered in his jail cell. But if this case has taught us anything, we can surely expect that any such details will probably raise more questions than answers – and only lead conspiracy theorists further down the rabbit hole.
