                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fifa says it still ‘strongly' supports the peace prize There is a growing sense of embarrassment among mid-level and senior officials within Fifa over the awarding of its peace prize to Donald Trump. This is what we want to see from a leader and you definitely deserve the first Fifa Peace Prize.” Since then, the US has launched airstrikes across Venezuela and captured the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife, Cilia Flores, and flown them to the US, where he was put in jail. Maduro appeared in court on 5 January, pleading not guilty to drugs, weapons and “narco‑terrorism” charges. Multiple officials have expressed their unease about the way it was handled. It is understood that Infantino has been left to deal with the “political matters” concerning Trump for the World Cup as others fear it may tarnish their reputations. “Involving myself in the politics surrounding this World Cup is something I stay far away from. My job concerns football on the pitch and nothing else,” a Fifa source said. Fifa notes the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [the Venezuelan opposition leader, María Corina Machado] has given her medal to President Trump.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ter Stegen is no longer the first-choice stopper at Barca after losing his starting spot to summer signing Joan Garcia. The club made a huge financial effort to win the race for Espanyol goalkeeper Garcia last summer, and after missing much of this season already through injury, Ter Stegen is utilising the January window to secure a move away and increase his playing time ahead of Germany's World Cup 2026 campaign. According to talkSPORT, one of the clubs who showed an interest in Ter Stegen this month were West Ham. The Hammers signed Mads Hermansen from Leicester City last summer, but he started only four Premier League games before being dropped for predecessor Alphonse Areola. Amid this uncertainty between the sticks and their ongoing battle against relegation, West Ham reached out to gauge Ter Stegen's interest in a loan move, but found he was not considering swapping Spain for England. Ter Stegen is hoping to be Germany's starting goalkeeper at this summer's World Cup following the international retirement of Manuel Neuer, and head coach Julian Nagelsmann has already stated he will not call on players if they are not starting regularly at club level. Even since returning from injury last month, Ter Stegen has found himself on the Barcelona bench, including for their 2-0 win away at Racing Santander in the Copa del Rey, during which starter Garcia made several fine saves to keep his side afloat. He's made 423 appearances for the club and won 19 trophies, including their last Champions League back in 2015. Add GOAL.com as a preferred source on Google to see more of our reporting Ter Stegen should immediately become Girona's No.1 goalkeeper ahead of Croatian legend Dominik Livakovic and ex-Tottenham star Paulo Gazzaniga, with the Spanish side looking to qualify for Europe after their one-season jaunt in the Champions League. Barcelona, meanwhile, can open up a four-point gap at the top of La Liga on Sunday when they travel to Real Sociedad. Real Madrid reduced that deficit to one point with a 2-0 victory against Levante on Saturday, during which many of their star players were booed and jeered following their Supercopa de Espana loss to Barca and the subsequent shock sacking of Xabi Alonso. They are now five points from safety after beating rivals Tottenham Hotspur 2-1, while 17th-place Nottingham Forest drew 0-0 with Arsenal.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Clint Dempsey has teamed up with Unilever Personal Care, the FIFA 2026 World Cup's official personal care sponsor, to give soccer fans in the U.S. a chance to win tickets to the world's biggest tournament in North America this summer. “I was really excited about engaging with fans, giving them the opportunity to get these difficult tickets that everybody's struggling to try to find,” the former U.S. Men's National Team (USMNT) captain and current CBS Sports analyst told amNY. Fans who buy products from brands Axe, Dove, Closeup, LUX, Lifebuoy, Pepsodent, and Rexona can upload their receipts to UnileverWorldCup26.com for a chance to win tickets to the final at MetLife Stadium, outdoor watch parties, and other prizes, such as a Walmart+ membership and a $500 Walmart gift card. Each product purchased counts for one entry, and fans of the beautiful game can earn more entries by checking out other Unilever brand content and games. “That's what's difficult about this World Cup — the ticket situation, right?” Dempsey said. FIFA has received over 20 million requests for tickets to the 104 matches spanning 16 cities and three countries. Newly elected New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani has been an outspoken critic of the prices, which could range from $60 for a group stage game to over $6,000 for the final at MetLife Stadium. These prices might fluctuate even more based on FIFA's “variable pricing” model. “You don't want to price out the working class from an opportunity to go and represent their country in the sport that they're passionate about,” Dempsey said. “I would like to see everybody have a fair shake at it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a strongly worded statement, Three Lions Pride said hopes that the tournament would allow travelling LGBTQ fans to focus on football rather than personal safety had been “well and truly shattered”. The men's FIFA World Cup, due to be hosted across the USA, Canada and Mexico, had been seen by many supporters as offering a contrast to recent tournaments held in Russia and Qatar. England are among the favourites to win FIFA World Cup 26, but for Three Lions Pride (3LP), a “dangerous rollback of human rights” in the U.S. means they will not be in attendance this summer. The group, which has around 350 members – many of whom regularly attend games home and away – says it no longer has confidence that the tournament will provide a safe and inclusive environment. In particular, 3LP have highlighted the heightened risks of discrimination and violence in the U.S. and how these could impact members who are trans or gender non-conforming. Should they progress into the knockout stages by winning their group, Thomas Tuchel's side would also play matches in one or more of Atlanta, Mexico City, and Miami. Finishing second in Group L would present potential trips to one or more of Toronto, Dallas and Los Angeles. Eight teams that finish third in their groups will also go through. There are 16 host cities in total, and the Pride House United 2026 project is hoping to offer welcoming venue spaces for LGBTQ people and allies in every one. “We see this as an enormous opportunity to show up for LGBTIQ+ human rights while participating in a sport that we love,” says the official website. In its statement, 3LP also raises broader human rights issues, including U.S. travel bans affecting certain nationalities, visa refusals linked to social media activity, and fears around immigration enforcement disproportionately impacting fans of diverse ethnicities. It cited the recent killing of an American citizen by ICE agents in Minneapolis as evidence of the risks posed by aggressive policing and law enforcement. It is “FIFA's choice to extort fans for financial gain whilst generating revenue of $483 million in 2024 alone (exceeding their 2024 budget by 65%),” the group said. The group's announcement comes amid suggestions of a potential boycott by other supporters' associations, and the wider community of football fans, stakeholders and even governments. For its part, 3LP says it cannot endorse FIFA's “appalling decisions” in relation to the World Cup “by tacit acceptance through our visible attendance as a group”. “This is a tournament that had so much promise,” the 3LP statement concludes, warning that the event risks empty seats, exclusion of loyal fans and “numerous human rights violations based on disability, race, gender and sexuality”. 10 reasons to register for the Football v Homophobia Month of Action (January 2026) We're also a digital publisher and can help with your content requirements.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The FIFA 2026 World Cup is heading to Toronto, and ysou know what that means – a massive influx of energy and excitement! For businesses looking to connect with clients and employees during this global event, a photo booth rental can be a real game-changer. Think about it: people are already in a festive mood, looking to celebrate and make memories. It's more than just silly pictures; it's a smart marketing tool that can really boost your brand presence when everyone's attention is on the beautiful game. When thinking about a photo booth for a corporate event during the FIFA World Cup, the backdrop is your first big chance to get people excited. You want something that screams ‘soccer' without being too generic. Using a mix of bold colors and dynamic lines can really make the photos pop. You could also go for a more abstract design that uses green and white to evoke a pitch, perhaps with subtle textures that mimic grass. This is where things get a bit tricky, but it's totally doable. You can't just slap the official FIFA World Cup logo everywhere without permission, that's a big no-no. If you want to use official logos, you'll need to look into licensing agreements, which can be complex and costly for a single event. A safer bet is to create custom graphics that are inspired by the World Cup's aesthetic – think stylized soccer balls, pennants, or laurel wreaths that hint at victory without infringing on trademarks. You can have inflatable soccer balls, mini flags of participating nations (maybe focus on the ones your guests are most likely to support), referee whistles, and even custom-made cardboard cutouts of famous soccer players or trophies. Having a variety of props ensures everyone can find something they like to use in their photos. This blend creates a unique and memorable photo opportunity for your guests. When planning your corporate event during the FIFA 2026 World Cup in Toronto, you want more than just a static photo backdrop. You need something that gets people talking and participating. Modern photo booths can use digital props and augmented reality (AR) to add a whole new layer of fun. Imagine guests virtually donning soccer jerseys, holding up championship trophies, or even having animated confetti rain down around them – all without touching a physical object. This tech is pretty cool and really makes the photos pop. Plus, AR elements can be customized to include your company's branding, making each shot a subtle advertisement. Photo booths are naturally social, but you can push that further. Set up challenges that encourage groups to pose together. Think about prompts like “Recreate your favorite World Cup celebration” or “Show your team's spirit animal.” You could even have a leaderboard for the most creative group photo submitted throughout the event. People love sharing their experiences online, especially during a big event like the World Cup. Make it super easy for guests to share their photo booth creations directly to social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn. You can even set up a custom event hashtag, like #YourCompanyNameWorldCupBash, to track all the shares. Check out some ideas for photo booth rentals in Toronto that offer these features. When guests are involved in creating the content, they feel a stronger connection to the experience and, by extension, your brand. This active engagement is far more impactful than passive observation. When planning a corporate event in Toronto during the FIFA 2026 World Cup, the venue itself plays a big role in what kind of photo booth setup will work best. They often have a wider entrance and can accommodate more guests posing at once. A well-placed outdoor booth can become a hub of activity, drawing people in with its design and the fun they see happening inside. Mirror booths, on the other hand, offer a sleek, elegant look. They're interactive, with the mirror surface displaying prompts and animations. If your venue has a specific architectural style or a beautiful view, you can design your backdrop to either blend in or stand out. This attention to detail shows your guests that you've put thought into every aspect of the event. Or, if the venue has a specific color scheme, incorporating those colors into the backdrop can create a cohesive look. When you're planning a corporate event, especially one tied to a big occasion like the FIFA World Cup, you want everything to scream ‘your brand.' Think of it as a mini billboard that people actually want to interact with. This is where you make the photo booth truly yours. It's not just about slapping your logo on a printout. We're talking about integrating your brand identity into the whole experience. These printouts become mini-advertisements that guests will likely keep, sharing them with others and keeping your brand top-of-mind. A company like Moment In Time Photo Booth Rental can help you nail these custom print details. Beyond the immediate fun, modern photo booth rentals can provide data that's surprisingly useful for marketing. Analyzing this data helps you understand what aspects of the photo booth experience were most popular and how effectively your event generated online engagement. This information can inform future marketing strategies and event planning. By thoughtfully integrating your brand into every aspect of the photo booth rental, you transform a fun activity into a powerful marketing tool that leaves a lasting impression on your corporate guests. Want to make your corporate event during the FIFA 2026 World Cup in Toronto truly unforgettable? It's all about keeping your guests entertained and involved. Imagine this: your guests step into the booth, ready for a fun picture, but instead, they're greeted with a quick trivia question related to the World Cup. You could have a rotating set of questions, perhaps with different difficulty levels. This gamified approach not only entertains but also subtly educates guests about the tournament, making the photo booth a hub of friendly competition and learning. It's a smart way to tie the event's theme directly into the booth's functionality, creating a unique event experience. People love to personalize their photos, and digital filters and overlays offer a simple yet effective way to do this. Think custom World Cup-themed frames, team crests, or even animated elements that guests can add to their pictures. You could offer a selection of filters that mimic different eras of World Cup history or allow guests to choose their favorite participating country's flag to overlay on their image. While digital sharing is great, there's still something special about a physical photo. Offering instant printing means guests can take home a tangible memory of the event right away. Pair this with a digital photo gallery where all the event's photos are uploaded and accessible. When planning your corporate event, especially one tied to a global event like the FIFA World Cup, it's super important that everyone feels welcome and can join in the fun. This means thinking about how your photo booth rental can be used by all your guests, no matter their abilities or background. Can someone using a wheelchair easily get into the booth and operate it? Look for options that have a lower profile or a design that allows someone to stand or sit comfortably in front of it. It's about removing physical obstacles so everyone can get a great shot. Toronto is a diverse city, and your guests likely are too. Having instructions and signage for the photo booth in multiple languages can make a big difference. If you know you'll have a significant number of guests who speak a particular language, consider having those instructions printed. It shows you've put thought into making everyone feel comfortable and understood. Props are a huge part of the fun, right? Instead of just generic soccer balls, think about props that represent different countries or cultures. Also, consider props that are easy to hold and use for people with different dexterity levels. It turns a simple activity into an inclusive celebration, which is exactly what a big event like the World Cup should be about. Getting your team together for the FIFA World Cup 2026 in Toronto is a fantastic chance to boost morale and build some serious camaraderie. Think about how you can use it to get everyone interacting and feeling more connected. You can easily turn your photo booth into a contest zone. Have teams or departments create their own group photos, perhaps representing their favorite World Cup team or coming up with a unique company-themed soccer celebration. You can then have a company-wide vote for the “Best Group Photo.” This not only gets people talking and laughing but also encourages creative collaboration. It's a simple way to inject some energy and fun into the event. Imagine sending your employees home with a personalized photo badge or a small, branded keepsake featuring their team's photo from the booth. These little mementos can really help solidify the positive memories. With the World Cup being all about national pride, why not let your employees show theirs? Encourage teams to pick a country they want to support during the tournament and use props and backdrops that reflect that. You could even set up a digital gallery where all the team photos are displayed, perhaps categorized by the country they're cheering for. This visual representation of team spirit can be quite engaging and makes for a great talking point throughout the event and beyond. It's a great way to see who's backing whom! Using a photo booth for team building during a major sporting event like the World Cup isn't just about taking silly pictures. It's about creating shared experiences that strengthen bonds and foster a more connected workplace. Here are a few ideas to get your teams involved: Want to boost team spirit at your next event? Think about fun themes for your photo booth rental! It's a great way to get everyone laughing and creating memories together. Visit our website to explore exciting photo booth options! So, as the FIFA World Cup excitement builds for Toronto in 2026, remember that a photo booth can be more than just a fun add-on. Think about how you can tie it into the soccer theme, maybe with custom props or a backdrop that screams ‘World Cup.' It's a simple way to make your corporate event stand out and give everyone something to smile about long after the final whistle blows. You can make it look like a soccer field or use colors from the World Cup. Adding props like soccer balls, jerseys, and flags makes it even better. Think about using fun props like referee whistles, championship trophies, or even cardboard cutouts of famous players. Just make sure you're allowed to use official logos and colors. It's like a moving billboard that people will want to share because the photos are so fun. Modern photo booths can do more than just take pictures. They can add digital effects, let people use fun filters, or even put virtual soccer players in the photos using augmented reality. Some can also share pictures instantly on social media. You can get booths that are open and allow lots of people in at once, or enclosed ones for more privacy. There are also fancy ones like 360-degree booths that spin around you, or mirror booths that look like mirrors but take pictures. You can even pick one that fits the style of your event venue. This means making sure someone in a wheelchair can get in, having instructions in different languages if needed, and offering a variety of props that everyone can relate to, not just specific teams or countries.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crystal Palace have made a decision on Oliver Glasner's future as the club's manager, with sack talk being played down at Selhurst Park. He has spoken of feeling “abandoned” after seeing club captain Marc Guehi sold to Manchester City and transfer speculation rage around Jean-Philippe Mateta. Palace enjoyed a historic 2024-25 campaign, as they savoured FA Cup glory and captured a first piece of major silverware. They went on to beat Premier League champions Liverpool in the traditional Community Shield curtain-raiser and have graced European competition in the Conference League. They did, however, sell talismanic playmaker Eberechi Eze to London rivals Arsenal in the summer of 2025. Star striker Mateta, who has become a full international with France in a World Cup year, is now generating transfer talk as he registers on the recruitment radar at Serie A giants Juventus. Glasner feels his efforts are being undermined by a lack of support from those above him. We've been playing with 12 to 13 players for weeks now. On the bench I had just kids.” He has decided that he “would like Glasner to see out his contract until the end of the season.” The Austrian has been involved in transfer discussions with the winter window open, acquiring Brennan Johnson from Tottenham in a club-record deal, and Palace “expect him to turn things around after a run of 10 games without a win in all competitions.” Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Glasner had said in the wake of a disappointing reversal on Wearside that he did not “care” if he remained in charge at Selhurst Park through to the end of the campaign. The 51-year-old said of big decisions needing to be made on and off the field: “I don't need any support. Crystal Palace are fine to end the season like this – with Oliver Glasner, with another manager, I don't know, I don't care. For me, it feels like we just wait until all the players are back. It doesn't matter how we are acting.

Glasner will not be overseeing a rebuild at Palace, as his successor will dictate transfer business in the summer, and it could be that he finds himself lining up against the Eagles next season having been identified as a top target for Manchester United - with the Red Devils in the market for a permanent replacement for ousted Portuguese tactician Ruben Amorim.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Guehi's private jet was forced to abort its landing at Manchester Airport at the last minute and loop over the city before safely touching down. Guehi flew to Manchester on Sunday morning but there was drama as his flight aborted its planned landing just before 9am, as reported by The Sun. A larger plane was unexpectedly moved onto the runway which forced Guehi's private jet to take emergency action and postpone its landing when it was very close to the ground. The flight did subsequently land safely at Manchester Airport, with Guehi then travelling onto City to finalise his transfer. Guehi is into the last year of his contract at Crystal Palace and came close to a move to Liverpool last summer. However, his sale has left Oliver Glasner furious, with the manager revealing he only found out a day before their game against Sunderland. Glasner told Sky Sports: "I heard yesterday at 10.30am for the first time that we were selling Marc. I think the negotiations were a few days long so nobody would have called at 10am and by 10.30am, everything was agreed. Glasner's own future at Crystal Palace is now in doubt. He revealed earlier this week he will leave at the club of the season but could now be sacked following his angry "we've been abandoned" comments after Palace's win over Sunderland.

Guardiola's side slumped to a 2-0 defeat to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday, with City currently having to make do without injured centre-backs John Stones, Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol. Guardiola has started inexperienced defender Abdukodir Khusanov and Max Alleyne in City's last four matches and admitted his side were second best against Michael Carrick's side. Guardiola told reporters: "They were the better team. But today we were not the level required to win these types of games. We had that energy four days ago against Newcastle but not today. It was a football game and they were better. They have a new manager, and they had the energy in a derby that we didn't have. This [type of] game can happen; it's more about the previous three. We change a lot in the last 12 months.

The Norwegian side are yet to manage a single win in the Champions League this season and have three draws and three defeats from their first six matches.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Real Madrid returned to winning ways after defeats that cost them the Spanish Super Cup, their place in the Copa del Rey and led to a change of coach inside a week — but the home fans made their feelings clear throughout the victory over Levante. While Xabi Alonso, who was dismissed on Monday, enjoyed the sea air in San Sebastian in northern Spain, Alvaro Arbeloa, promoted from the Real Madrid Castilla, took charge of his first La Liga match. There were many boos directed at the players, with particular intensity against Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham, and repeated chants against president Florentino Perez. Arbeloa must have known what was coming as he appealed for calm in his pre-match press conference on Friday when he referred to the iconic figure of Juan Gomez ‘Juanito'. The coach had used the famous phrase of Juanito, a former Madrid player who died in a traffic accident in 1992 aged 37 and whose name is remembered in the seventh minute of every home match. “I understand that the Madrid fans are hurt and disappointed with us, but I'm going to ask them to support their players,” Arbelosa said. In the build-up in the city, there had been banners on roads calling for Perez to step down. That happened, with cameras capturing the president in the VIP box reacting with a forced laugh. Arbeloa was critical and cryptic about that at the press conference. “I know where the boos and the campaigns are coming from, they are not from people who don't like Florentino, but from people who don't like Madrid,” he said. “They're not going to fool me, we're lucky to have him because he's the most important person in the history of the club alongside Santiago Bernabeu.” The players were not spared criticism either. The players most singled out were Vinicius, Bellingham, and, to a lesser extent, vice-captain Fede Valverde. These three players were among those who reportedly did not believe in Alonso's ideas, which led to internal tensions over the methods the Basque coach tried to implement. Kylian Mbappe, who would go on to win and score the penalty to break the deadlock, was not booed. Sound off, clearer reaction: lots of whistles at the Santiago Bernabeu from Real Madrid supporters. Whistles also for the Grada Fans when they have started to cheer. When he didn't get it, he was the first to leave the pitch after the final whistle, consoled on his way by team-mates and staff. I'm very proud to be his coach.” Mistakes by Dean Huijsen and Eduardo Camavinga were greeted by boos but the crowd did recognise the efforts of academy products Gonzalo Garcia and Raul Asencio, who made it 2-0 with a great header. Asencio was playing with a mask after having his nose broken. Arda Guler, who had a big impact after coming on at half-time, was named man of the match.
