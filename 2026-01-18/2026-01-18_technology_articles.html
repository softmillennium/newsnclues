The next part of the clip shows an additional a gun contraption that probably delivers recoil with every shot and also revealed the firework launcher's capability to launch multiple pyrotechnics in succession to simulate machine gun fire. It is also in this part of the video that we see the player's smoke or wind machine fall apart during operation. The last few seconds show the player wearing some sort of electrical contraption zapping them every time they get shot in game. This does not just give them a whole-body shock — instead, it only electrifies the specific limb that received damage, like an arm or a leg. This gaming feedback rig isn't practical at all, especially as you will have to reload the fireworks after every encounter — so you either have to pause your game after every fire fight, or you need to pay someone to do it for you. More than that, the electrical zap effect is visibly painful and dangerous, which kind of defeats the purpose of playing fps games. Still, the post gained a lot of admiration from the gaming community, with even tech mogul Elon Musk commenting, “Hardcore,” followed by a laughing emoji.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>SwitchBot, the company behind a button-pressing robot that turns dumb buttons smart, has been rapidly expanding its catalog of smart home devices in recent years. For one of the company's newest products, the SwitchBot Smart Video Doorbell, the gimmick is a connected indoor display that acts as a chime, digital peephole, and video storage device, among other things. SwitchBot isn't the only company to offer such a combo, but it is the cheapest I'm aware of at $149.99. That's compared to something like the $380 Eufy Smart Display E10 and Video Doorbell E340 combo or pairing a $100 Google Nest Hub with a $180 Google Nest Doorbell Cam. And it has a lot of good ideas beyond those I listed above. A dedicated video monitor and local storage aren't enough to save the SwitchBot Smart Video Doorbell from itself for most people. It's a shame, then, that the Smart Video Doorbell itself is one of the worst smart home cameras I've ever used. Despite it all, I still think this camera might have a place. But that place is decidedly not next to my front door. I had a number of reasons to look at SwitchBot's Smart Video Doorbell. Its supposedly 2K resolution video recordings are local by default; it's battery-powered but can also be wired up; it's Matter-compatible (with a big asterisk that I'll get to); it's got a 165-degree field of view (again, asterisk). If you have a paired SwitchBot smart lock, the Smart Video Doorbell can read the NFC chip on your smartphone or a SwitchBot tracking device in order to unlock it. The indoor monitor component is what really caught my eye, though. Below the display are four buttons, including one to view the camera's live feed, one to lock or unlock your door (assuming you have a SwitchBot smart lock), and one to pop up a list of generic, robotic replies asking visitors to leave a message or telling them someone will be at the door soon. A feature in the SwitchBot app supports user-recorded replies, so, obviously, I fired up YouTube to grab soundbites from “Angels With Filthy Souls,” the fake movie inside of Home Alone. The display comes with a microSD card slot already filled with a 4GB microSD card for local recordings, which I think is enough, but the device officially supports up to 512GB memory cards for those who need more. Having the memorycard live inside an indoor device is nice, and not something every local-first video doorbell does, so kudos to SwitchBot. It's part of why this doorbell works without an internet connection, another nice feature. Although, in my testing, the camera didn't actually record video when I used it without connecting it to the SwitchBot app. Its video quality is atrocious, and the camera didn't seem to produce recordings anywhere near the 2K resolution SwitchBot claims it's capable of. Those I checked on the microSD card were 640 x 360 at most, in fact. If there are circumstances in which the camera will actually grab a 2K video, I didn't encounter them. Right after setting the Smart Video Doorbell up, I saw another issue—its 165-degree FOV is great on paper, but SwitchBot's choice to use a 16:9 aspect ratio meant only the edge of my porch floor was in view, despite the camera being mounted at the low end of SwitchBot's recommended mounting height of 1.2 to 1.5 meters. Compare that to the Google Nest Doorbell, which uses a square aspect ratio and captures about as much lateral area as the SwitchBot camera while getting way more of what's above and below it. Not being able to see much of my porch means I couldn't check the camera to see if, say, a package is there—one of the main reasons I even want a video doorbell on my porch in the first place. That wouldn't be as big a deal if I could count on the Smart Video Doorbell to always catch it when someone is delivering a package, but it routinely missed people approaching my porch, especially when they were quickly in and out the way so many delivery drivers are. It's not much better on the software side of things. The SwitchBot app is immediately annoying about promoting its cloud storage service. It was also consistently a struggle to load recordings in the SwitchBot app, either by navigating to the camera's timeline via the app, or by tapping a motion notification on my phone. Most smart home security cameras have these issues here and there, but for the Smart Video Doorbell, it was constant. Third-party support is a little confusing all around. The Smart Video Doorbell has a settings menu labeled “Third-party Services,” but this seems to just be a way of linking your general SwitchBot ecosystem to others. That is to say, the doorbell shows up when I link SwitchBot to Google Home or Amazon Alexa, but not for Samsung SmartThings or Siri Shortcuts. Matter only just gained smart home camera support in version 1.5 of the standard, and as of this writing, only Samsung SmartThings has updated to that version. Lastly, the SwitchBot app is a little light on typical smart camera features. You can set a single detection zone by resizing a rectangle on the video feed, but there's no privacy blackout feature. And human detection is the only specific motion detection category that's included with a free plan; you have to pay for one of SwitchBot's cloud subscriptions for vehicle and pet detection (both are things that my Netatmo camera has been able to do for free since I bought it in 2019). Local storage, the fact that it works without Wi-Fi, easy setup, and its SwitchBot smart lock integration are all great things. But the problems I listed make it a bad choice if you want all the smart home bells and whistles that come with many smart home security cameras. But there's one kind of person the Smart Video Doorbell might be ideal for. Its indoor video monitor makes it ideal for non-tech-savvy folks, especially those with limited mobility, since it means they can see who's at their door without getting up, and they don't have to futz with an app to do it. Bad video quality, inconsistent event sensing, and fancy algorithmic detection features really don't matter, then. There's just too much competition from the likes of Eufy, Reolink, and others whose cameras also prioritize local video storage but that produce better video quality, offer more features, and can detect, record, and show events with much greater reliability. I've never used a smart home security camera that I thought was perfect, doorbell or otherwise, but the SwitchBot Smart Video Doorbell misses the mark in too many areas, making it a doorbell camera for almost nobody. I'm not sure it's worth the coveted space in my toilet bowl. CES 2026 showed us the useless humanoid robots are nowhere close to doing your robot chores.</p>

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency just released a ruling that removes any permitting exemptions for all types of gas turbine generators. According to The Guardian, this move comes as some Memphis residents have been fighting a legal battle against Elon Musk and his xAI startup for its allegedly illegal use of generators to deliver power to his multiple AI data centers. xAI took advantage of this technicality, allowing it to set up and run an AI data center with 100,000 Nvidia H200 GPUs in just 19 days — something that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says usually takes four years. Other AI hyperscalers have also started using this technique while waiting for a connection to the grid, with OpenAI planning to use gas turbines at its first Stargate site for additional power. However, EPA's latest rule now requires air permits for gas turbines, even portables ones that are deployed on a temporary basis. More than that, companies that want to use them now have to abide by the requirements set in the federal Clean Air Act. The U.S. electricity grid is being stretched thin by the sudden influx of power demand from millions of power-hungry AI GPUs, and many hyperscalers are now turning to on-site generators for electrical power while waiting for their site to get a grid connection. While the EPA's ruling is not a ban on portable or even permanent turbines, it increases the regulatory burden for those who want to deploy them. Furthermore, they can no longer rely on legal loopholes in local ordinances, meaning they'll have to follow the higher standard that the federal government has set when it comes to permits and air quality.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. “Floppy disks are the best storage media ever invented,” claims tech tinkerer and maker Mads Chr. The devoted dad has made it his mission to prove that assertion to his three-year-old son, by making an easy, tactile, Smart TV control system that is fed by these distinctive physical manifestations of the save icon. Say hello to the FloppyDiskCast smart TV remote system for kids. Modern Smart TV controls are disempowering for toddlers, reckons Olesen. The tile-based UIs may even cause little ones to develop short attention spans – if they can even successfully navigate the interfaces. The Smart TV meets toddler problem played on Olesen's mind, until he decided that kids would benefit from the floppy disk experience of yore. Putting the idea into practice, the first idea of using a floppy shell to enclose an RFID tag was set aside. Olesen wanted the floppy disk remote control device to exhibit the authentic “click, whirrr, brrr brrr,” feedback that veteran users of this portable removable storage media were familiar with. The maker seems most familiar with retro-Windows ways of loading removable media. Olesen eventually figured that pin 34 on old floppy drives could relay disk change information. Since the disk read bursts are so short, it was feasible to make this floppy disk-driven remote battery-powered, despite the ancient desktop computer tech at its heart. It is a highly intuitive Smart TV control method for the toddler. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

He justified this move by saying that advancements in quantum computing pose a threat to the cryptocurrency's cryptographic protections, thus undermining its argument of durability through network security. According to Bloomberg, Wood recommends replacing Bitcoin with an investment with a 5% allocation to physical gold and another 5% set for gold mining stocks. Wood, who is the Global Head of Equity Strategy at the global investment banking firm Jefferies, first included Bitcoin in his sample portfolio in December 2020. However, advancements in quantum computing have long-term investors concerned about its implications, especially for cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin currently uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which is technically impossible to crack with current computing technology. An event like this would cause chaos in the system, resulting in Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) losing its value overnight, especially if the break comes as a surprise. Because of this, Wood recommended moving away from it, especially for long-term investors. For one, current quantum computing capabilities are nowhere near powerful or stable enough to defeat current cryptography algorithms, so they remain safe for the time being. Besides that, progress in the field of quantum computing is slow and public, meaning developers would have ample warning that they need to upgrade their algorithms. Another big reason that cryptocurrencies aren't particularly concerned about quantum computing right now is that if quantum computers can break Bitcoin security, then they can break cryptography algorithms all across the world. So, if their security protocols were to be broken, then the security of everything else — including traditional banking systems, secured internet protocols, government encryption, and more — will also be affected. Despite this, Wood says that the debate between cryptocurrency developers and quantum computing will only be a “long-term positive for gold.” It has historically held its value, reaching an 11% annual return over the past 50 years. So, investors looking for a stable, long-term asset to park their funds would probably find the precious metal an attractive option.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There will come a point when we've gone too far with health tracking. One could argue we have already arrived, but sometimes we really need to overindulge to rein ourselves in. Case in point: we can now analyze our urine anytime we want, from the comfort of our own toilets. In November, Withings released its long-awaited U-Scan: a home monitoring system for your urine. The gadget resembles an artificial seashell that sits inside your toilet. Do most healthy people need a urine tracker? I can't think of a single person who enjoys providing a urine sample at the doctor's office, myself included. For whatever reason, the concept of collecting details about my urine is way less exciting than knowing how many hours of sleep I had the night before, or how many steps I took, or how high my heart rate got on my run that morning. Despite all this dread, though, I somehow surprised myself. Analyzing my urine for a few weeks turned out to be somewhat surprisingly fun. Withings first debuted the U-Scan back at CES in 2023, so it's taken the company a few years to perfect. This test focuses on your body's overall kidney functioning. With the Intensive Package, you'll get a renewal delivery (of two cartridges) every two to three months for $180 each. For my testing purposes, I chose the Nutrio cartridge. Installing the device on your toilet is equal parts easy and difficult. Because it is going to literally sit inside your toilet, where lots of liquid is spraying everywhere, the scanner must be sealed shut. Withings does this by using a sort of twisting method where you have to hold the palms of your hands on both sides of the device and twist it open and shut. Unless you are a devoted rock climber with the finger and wrist muscles to prove it or a chef who twists open difficult jars on a regular basis, it's likely that you will have difficulty with this step. I eventually got the U-Scan open, but it took a lot of feeling silly and confused. Once unsealed, the U-Scan has an empty place for where the cartridge sits, and it clips in fairly easily. Then you have to reseal the device (equally as hard as unsealing it) and clip it to your toilet. Withings provides three clip sizes; my toilet turned out to be medium-sized. As this is happening, the U-Scan has a thermal sensor that detects the presence of urine via a temperature meter (urine is much warmer than toilet water). Once it detects urine, the U-Scan has a pumping system that pulls urine inside it via a microfluidic channel, which manipulates the flow of liquid through pumps whose diameter is often smaller than a human hair. Once there, according to Withings, a needle injects the sample onto a colorimetric test strip, which changes colors based on various chemical reactions. A built-in LED plus a proprietary algorithm analyzes any color changes that help determine things like pH and vitamin C levels, among other things. From a medical perspective, urine is actually full of surprises. Urine testing has one of the longest continuous histories in medicine. That's mainly because it is easy to collect and reflects many body processes. In fact, during medieval times, ancient physicians would literally taste urine, knowing that sweet-tasting urine often meant that their patient had diabetes. Today, though, there are so many things we can check with a simple urine test. When I tested the device, I did it about once a day (as recommended by Withings) and tried to do it at the same time every day as well (often first thing in the morning). For the most part, my readings were within the normal range, but randomly they'd be a bit off, particularly my pH, the level of vitamin C, or my calculated hydration status. If I got a result like that, I would just focus on eating more vegetables over the next couple of days or drinking more water. Often, though, my results would return to normal even if I didn't do any of those things. Unless you have a diagnosed condition, like diabetes or kidney disease, that you are monitoring (hopefully with the help of a doctor! ), it's unclear how well the U-Scan will improve your health. I can see an extremely healthy person overly obsessing over every single pH or vitamin C reading without those one-off readings having any actionable effect on their health. According to Withings, the battery life can last up to three months on a full charge, but could be significantly less (only about a month) if you use it frequently. Withings claims that with every toilet flush, the U-Scan should stay clean. However, it also comes with a deep cleaning detergent that you can use inside the station (you'll need to remove the cartridge first). The U-Scan seems designed—or at least currently marketed—for health-obsessed yet overtly healthy people. For instance, anytime that my urine reading told me that my hydration level was low, I would make a point to drink water throughout my day, and the next day the reading would be back to normal. It made me feel awesome, yes, but do I need a $400 device that measures my urine every morning to remember that hydrating on the regular is good for my health? On the other hand, I can see the U-Scan having a ton of potential for people with conditions like diabetes or kidney disease, where urine readings for ketones or protein are incredibly important for monitoring their condition. And while there are other devices out there that can test your urine, most of them utilize physical test strips. I don't want to overall dismiss the concept of an at-home urine analyzer, however, even for healthy people. But I think it needs more work on what you are testing and why, and how to use the data it spits out to you.

Lucas Pope did a really nice write up on how he developed his dithering system for Return of The Obra Dinn. Not to take away from this truly amazing write-up (wow), but there's at least one generator that uses shape:https://meatfighter.com/ascii-silhouettify/See particularly the image right above where it says "Note how the algorithm selects the largest characters that fit within the outlines of each colored region. "There's also a description at the bottom of how its algorithm works, if anyone wants to compare. "There's also a description at the bottom of how its algorithm works, if anyone wants to compare.

It was meant to emulate a sharpen filter. He operated over the wrong dimensions (intensity, rather than X-Y)- Dithering should be done with something like Floyd-Steinberg: You spill over errors to adjacent pixels.Most of these problems have solutions, and in some cases, optimal ones.

Acerola worked a bit on this in 2024[1], using edge detection to layer correctly oriented |/-\ over the usual brightness-only pass. I think either technique has cases where one looks better than the other. It reminds me of how chafa uses an 8x8 bitmap for each glyph: https://github.com/hpjansson/chafa/blob/master/chafa/interna...There's a lot of nitty gritty concerns I haven't dug into: how to make it fast, how to handle colorspaces, or like the author mentions, how to exaggerate contrast for certain scenes.

EDIT - a gallery of (Unicode-heavy) examples, in case you haven't seen chafa yet: https://hpjansson.org/chafa/gallery/ Here's a copy-paste snippet where you can try chafa-ascii-fying images in your own terminal, if you have uvx:  uvx --with chafa-py python -c ' from chafa import * from chafa.loader import Loader import sys img = Loader(sys.argv[1]) config = CanvasConfig() config.calc_canvas_geometry(img.width,img.height,0.5,True,False) symbol_map = SymbolMap() symbol_map.add_by_tags(SymbolTags.CHAFA_SYMBOL_TAG_ASCII) config.set_symbol_map(symbol_map) config.canvas_mode = CanvasMode.CHAFA_CANVAS_MODE_FGBG canvas = Canvas(config) canvas.draw_all_pixels(img.pixel_type,img.get_pixels(),img.width,img.height,img.rowstride) print(canvas.print().decode()) ' \ myimage.jpg https://wonger.dev/assets/chafa-ascii-examples.png So I'll revise my claim that chafa is great for unicodey colorful environments, but hand-tailored ascii-only work like the OP is worth the effort. https://wonger.dev/assets/chafa-ascii-examples.png So I'll revise my claim that chafa is great for unicodey colorful environments, but hand-tailored ascii-only work like the OP is worth the effort. and damn that article is so cool, what a rabbithole. Are you planning to release this as a library or a tool, or should we just take the relevant MIT licensed code from your website [4]? No plans to build a library right now, but who knows. Feel free to grab what you need from the website's code!If I were to build a library, I'd probably convert the shaders from WebGL 2 to WebGL 1 for better browser compatibility. The sampling circles, internal and external, would likely need to be positioned differently for different font families. It's not obvious to me how a user of the library would go about that.

Also, I did find myself wondering about the inevitable Doom engineReally nice job! if you wish to render other pixels onto a screen using characters, they are not ascii characters, they are roman or latin character glyphs, no ascii involved. Taking into account the shape of different ASCII characters is brilliant, though! The resulting ASCII looks dithered, with sequences like e.g. :-:-:-:-:. I'd guess that it's an intentional effect since a flat surface would naturally repeat the same character, right? I think there's a small problem with intermediate values in this code snippet:  const maxValue = Math.max(...samplingVector) I feel confident stating that - unless fed something comprehensive like this post as input, and perhaps not even then - an LLM could not do something novel and complex like this, and will not be able to for some time, if ever. I'd love to read about someone proving me wrong on that. Hallucinations are trying to get partial credit for bullshit. The degree to which they do achieve this is amazing, but it is still trained on data that heavily biases their conclusions to the mainstream  thinking.

I've already built my own ASCII rendering engines in the past, and have recently built one with a coding model, and there was no friction. So in that specific narrow case, you have a display mode where text characters very much function as pixels.- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter- https://github.com/drwonky/cgax16demo I'm hoping people who harness ASCII for stuff like this consider using Code Page 437, or similar. Extended ASCII sets comprising Foreign Chars are for staid business machines, and sort of familiar but out of place accented chars have a bit of a distracting quality.437 and so on taps the nostalgia for BBS Art, DOS, TUIs scene NFOs, 8 bit micros.... Everything pre Code Page 1252, in other words. Whilst it was a pragmatic decision for MS, it's also true that marketing needs demanded all text interfaces disappeared because they looked old. That design space was now reserved for functional icons. A bit of creativity went from (home) computing right there and then. Stuffing it all into a separate font ensured it died.But, that stuff is genuinely cool to a lot of people in a way VIM, (for example) has never been and nor will it ever. This is a case of Form Over Function. 437 and so on taps the nostalgia for BBS Art, DOS, TUIs scene NFOs, 8 bit micros.... Everything pre Code Page 1252, in other words.

(I've previously tried pre-transforming on the image side to do color contrast enhancement, but without success: I take the Sobel filter of an image, and use it to identify regions where I boost contrast. However, since this is a step preceding "rasterization", the results don't align well with character grids.) For example 0.1^2=0.01, a 90% reduction, while 0.9^2=0.81, only a reduction of 10%.That's exactly the reason why it works, it's even nicely visualized below. Eg you may have had a problem where you wanted to measure distance from 0 but wanted to remove the sign. You may have tried absolute value and squaring, and noticed that the latter has the additional effect described above.It's a bit like a math undergrad wondering about a proof 'I understand the argument, but how on earth do you come up with this?'. The answer is to keep doing similar problems and at some point you've developed an arsenal of tricks.

Simply trying every character and considering their entire bitmap, and keeping the character that reduces the distance to the target gives better results, at the cost of more CPU.This is a well known problem because early computers with monitors used to only be able to display characters.At some point we were able to define custom character bitmap, but not enough custom characters to cover the entire screen, so the problem became more complex. Which new character do you create to reproduce an image optimally?And separately we could choose the foreground/background color of individual characters, which opened up more possibilities.

And separately we could choose the foreground/background color of individual characters, which opened up more possibilities. I'd probably arrive at a very different solution if coming at this from a "you've got infinite compute resources, maximize quality" angle. For example, limiting  output to a small set of characters gives it a more uniform look which may be nicer. Then also there's the “retro” effect of using certain characters over others. And in the extreme that could totally change things. I found myself thinking, “I wonder if some of this could be used to playback video on old 8-bit machines?” But they're so underpowered… The code for this post is all in PR #15 if you want to take a look. However, the ASCII output quality is nondiverse despite using the same technique, so will need to do significantly more testing and this likely won't be released soon. However, there might still be room for competition, heh. More seriously, using colors (not trivial probably, as it adds another dimension), and some select Unicode characters, this could produce really fancy renderings in consoles!

Gamage insists founders wouldn't be forced to sell. Those with most of their wealth in private stock could open a deferral account for assets they don't want taxed immediately — California would instead take 5% whenever those shares are eventually sold. “If your startup fails, you pay nothing,” he explained. “But if your startup is the next Google, you're giving California a share of your gamble.” He also said founders could submit alternative valuations from certified appraisers reflecting what shares could actually sell for, rather than being stuck with the default voting-control formula. For startups that aren't publicly traded, calculating valuations is “inherently difficult,” tax expert Jared Walczak told the Post. Even with alternative appraisals, founders would still face enormous tax bills on control they hold but wealth they haven't realized. As originally envisioned, they expect to raise about $100 billion from roughly 200 individuals and the tax would apply retroactively to anyone living in California as of January 1, 2026. As reported last weekend by the WSJ, Silicon Valley elite have formed a Signal chat called “Save California” that includes everyone from Trump's crypto czar David Sacks to Kamala Harris mega-donor Chris Larsen. They've called the proposal “Communism” and “poorly defined.” Some are taking just-in-case measures, too, with Larry Page reportedly dropping $173.4 million on two Miami waterfront properties across last month and the first week of the new year, and Peter Thiel's firm leasing Miami office space last month. (Thiel has had ties to Miami for years — including a home — but an uncharacteristic press release about the move was seemingly meant to send a message.) “We're simply trying to keep emergency rooms open and save patient lives,” said executive committee member Debru Carthan to the Journal last weekend.
