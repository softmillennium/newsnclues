Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard discusses plans to release assassination files of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., during a cabinet meeting. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified a Biden-era plan to counter domestic terrorism that called for greater information-sharing with tech companies and a legislative push to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Developed in 2021 after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, the plan outlined a government-wide effort to track how foreign actors use disinformation to radicalize Americans and urged coordination with private industry on domestic threats. It also called for measures to curb in-prison radicalization and study extremism within the military. Among its proposals was a plan to "develop awareness training for active service military members, DOD employees and contractors, and those service members separating or retiring from the military on the threat posed by domestic terrorism, the potential targeting of those with military training by violent extremist actors, and relevant reporting mechanisms." Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified a Biden-era plan to counter domestic terrorism that called for information-sharing with tech companies and pushing for a legislative ban on assault weapons. The Biden administration plan encouraged "teaching and learning of civics education that provides students with the skill to fully participate in civic life," and promoted "literacy education for both children and adult learners and existing proven interventions to foster resiliency to disinformation." It also called for advancing "inclusion" in the Covid-19 response and addressing "hate crime reporting barriers faced by disadvantaged communities by promoting law enforcement training and resources to prevent and address bias-motivated crimes; improve federal hate crimes data and analysis to eliminate hate crimes underreporting; mitigate xenophobia and bias." Former President Joe Biden's administration launched the first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism in 2021, identifying domestic terrorism as a major national security threat in the wake of the Capitol riot. Gabbard declassified the strategy after prompting from conservative groups like America First Legal. The group wrote to Gabbard earlier this month, asking her to declassify the strategy amid concerns of "weaponization" of power by "censoring disfavored speech on the Internet by labeling such speech ‘misinformation,' ‘disinformation,' ‘hate speech,' ‘domestic terrorism.'" Biden's summer 2021 counterterrorism strategy garnered criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union, which said it "reflects the government's ever-expanding authority to surveil and monitor American communities; law enforcement guidance that permits profiling on the basis of race, religion, or national origin; and the use of abusive tools such as the watchlisting system against people for constitutionally protected speech and association."

Heritage Foundation research fellow EJ Antoni on President Trump's slated announcement on semiconductor tariffs and DOGE's new website enabling the American people to recommend potential cuts. The Trump administration placed roughly 75% of full-time AmeriCorps employees on administrative leave on Wednesday as the administration looks to rebuild the Clinton-era volunteer agency from scratch, Fox News Digital learned. A total of 535 full-time AmeriCorps employees out of the agency's 700 staff were placed on leave, an administration official confirmed to Fox News Digital Thursday. Volunteers with AmeriCorps' National Civilian Community Corps, a program that focuses specifically on volunteer opportunities for youth between the ages of 18–26, were preemptively pulled out of the field ahead of the Trump administration placing the agency's full-time staffers on leave Wednesday, Fox Digital learned. Roughly $250 million in AmeriCorps contracts have also been canceled. AmeriCorps is expected to remain in existence, according to the admin official, but the operations will essentially restart from scratch. Then-President Bill Clinton with AmeriCorps youth during an event at the University of Maryland. Former President Bill Clinton created the AmeriCorps National Service Program in 1993, during his first year in office, as a volunteer arm of the government to help aid communities nationwide. The agency has received roughly $1 billion in taxpayer funds every year, the House Higher Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee previously found, but had failed eight consecutive audits across the past decade. "Unfortunately, AmeriCorps has a long history of abusing taxpayer dollars," chair of the House subcommittee, Republican Utah Rep. Burgess Owens, said in a statement in December 2024. This includes being unable to detect fraud. Then-President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden pose with members of AmeriCorps on arrival at Joint Base Charleston in North Charleston, South Carolina, on Jan. 19, 2025. Fox News Digital examined AmeriCorp's budget in recent years and found its 2023 fiscal year budget stood at $1,312,806, which included $99,686,000 in expenses and salaries, while fiscal year 2024 saw a budget of $1,262,806, which included the same figure for expenses and salaries. The Biden administration proposed a budget of $1,342,093,000 for fiscal year 2025. The agency's annual management report for fiscal year 2024 showed that it had $3.7 billion in assets, including over $1.5 billion in investments. Diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change initiatives have been a top priority for the volunteer-focused agency, with the 2024 annual management report identifying "advancing racial and economic equity" as one of its top priorities, Fox Digital found. President Donald Trump gestures to the crowd at a campaign event on July 1, 2023 in Pickens, South Carolina. "AmeriCorps has a decades-long commitment to advancing racial and economic equity through national service and volunteering," the report stated. Owens said in 2024 that while some of the agency's programs are "well-intentioned," taxpayers should not continue funding the office and called for it to land on the Department of Government Efficiency's chopping block. "Every time its representatives come before this Committee, AmeriCorps assures us that they will implement reforms, and year after year nothing changes. We can tell AmeriCorps to modernize and reform until we are blue in the face, but nothing will change unless we recognize the system is built on a flawed idea. It is time to admit that this is a failed program that needs a complete overhaul or elimination. It should be on DOGE's chopping block."

Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman speaks outside of court before a hearing in the case of Erik and Lyle Menendez Thursday, April 17, 2025, in Los Angeles. Attorney Mark Geragos, representing Erik and Lyle Menendez, arrives for a hearing in their case Thursday, April 17, 2025, in Los Angeles. LOS ANGELES (AP) — Erik and Lyle Menendez could learn this week whether they will get reduced sentences — and the chance of freedom — nearly 30 years after they were convicted of murdering their parents. A Los Angeles judge will preside over the resentencing hearing that's expected to last two days starting Thursday. If he shortens their sentences, the brothers would still need approval from the state's parole board to leave prison. Gavin Newsom ordered the assessments in February and the brothers' final risk assessment hearings are scheduled for June 13. Prosecutors said in their filing that one part of the risk assessment has already been completed. While defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance. Supporters of the brothers have flown in from across the country to attend rallies and hearings in recent few months. The resentencing hearing will center on whether the brothers have been rehabilitated in prison and deserve a lesser sentence of 50 years to life. That would make them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law because they committed the crime when they were younger than 26. Former Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón asked a judge last year to reduce the brothers' sentences. He lost reelection to Nathan Hochman, who moved to withdraw the resentencing request and has argued the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes. A resentencing petition laid out by Gascón focuses on the brothers' accomplishments and rehabilitation. The extended Menendez family, with the exception of an uncle who died last month, has said they fully forgive the brothers for what they did and want them to be freed. With Hochman in charge, prosecutors argued last Friday they could not support the brothers' resentencing. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic ruled the resentencing hearings could continue despite their opposition. Prosecutors have said the brothers have not admitted to lies told during their trial about why they killed their parents, or that they asked their friends to lie for them in court. Hochman's office has also said it does not believe that the brothers were sexually abused by their father and that by speaking about their childhood abuse, they have not taken complete responsibility for the crime.</p>

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., chartered a private jet worth up to a staggering $15,000 an hour for several West Coast stops on their "Fighting Oligarchy" tour. Sanders boarded the luxury Bombardier Challenger private jet at the Meadows Field Airport in Bakersfield, California, on Tuesday afternoon, according to a photo captured by a source on the ground and shared exclusively with Fox News Digital. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, whom the source also spotted boarding the private jet, spoke at their "Fighting Oligarchy" event in Bakersfield just hours earlier. Flight records reveal the jet landed at Sacramento Mather Airport on Tuesday evening, which is about a 20-minute drive to Folsom, California, where the self-identified Democratic socialists hosted their second rally of the day. The jet Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were seen boarding made stops in Salt Lake City and Boise prior to landing in Bakersfield, according to flight records. The arrival dates match the duo's "Fighting Oligarchy" events in Salt Lake City and Nampa, which is about a 25-minute drive from Boise Airport. A photo captured by a source on the ground, and shared exclusively with Fox News Digital, confirmed Bernie Sanders boarded the luxury Bombardier Challenger private jet at the Meadows Field Airport in Bakersfield, California, on Tuesday afternoon between stops on his "Fighting Oligarchy" tour with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. "Champagne socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez demand Americans surrender their pick-up trucks, air conditioning and meat from the luxe leather seats of their private jets that cost more per hour than most Americans earn in months. Their hypocrisy is staggering," National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesperson Ben Petersen said in a statement to Fox News Digital. The Bombardier Challenger private jet is operated by Ventura Air Services, which touts "one of the widest cabins of any business jet available today" and provides "superior cabin comfort for its passengers." Sanders has long been ridiculed for relying on luxury private planes while crisscrossing the country, warning Americans about climate change and the threats of billionaires seizing political power. Despite his Democratic socialist platform advocating for universal healthcare, the Green New Deal and ending wealth inequality, Sanders flying private has become infamous. Sanders' campaign committee, Friends of Bernie Sanders, spent over $221,000 chartering private jets during the first quarter of 2025, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings reviewed by Fox News Digital. The filing, which was released on Tuesday, shows that Sanders dropped the massive haul between three private jet companies: Ventura Jets, Cirrus Aviation Services and N-Jet. Sen. Bernie Sanders waves to the crowd during a "Fighting Oligarchy" event in Los Angeles, Saturday, April 12, 2025. The six-figure spending on private jets this year follows Sanders spending over $1.9 million on private jets during his failed presidential campaign in 2020. A Fox News Digital review found that Sanders dished out almost $2 million to Apollo Jets and the Advanced Aviation Team, a Virginia-based private jet company. Private jets have faced the ire of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's fellow climate activists. "For real, how many private jets do these CEOs need? Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez championed the Democrats' failed Green New Deal, the aggressive climate change policy targeting carbon emissions and fossil fuel production. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have welcomed massive crowds to their "Fighting Oligarchy" stops across the country. On Saturday, the two political leaders hosted what they said was their largest rally ever, with 36,000 people in Los Angeles. Fox News Digital can confirm that Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez boarded a private jet at the Meadows Field Airport in Bakersfield, California, on Tuesday afternoon between stops on their "Fighting Oligarchy" events on the West Coast. Sanders started the "Fighting Oligarchy" tour in response to President Donald Trump's second term to "take on the Oligarchs and corporate interests who have so much power and influence in this country." Fox News Digital reached out to the offices of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez for comment. Deirdre Heavey is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

EXCLUSIVE: Former Vice President Mike Pence is urging House Republicans to stand firm against hiking takes on the country's top-earners, as sources tell Fox News Digital the White House is floating a millionaire tax hike proposal to offset the cost of eliminating taxes on overtime pay, tipped wages and retirees' Social Security. Advancing American Freedom (AAF), the conservative policy advocacy group Pence launched in 2021, sent a letter to congressional Republicans, including House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, advising Congress to "stand firm against tax hikes." Republicans should stick to their promises and not pull pages from Kamala Harris' losing policy platform," AAF President Tim Chapman and Board Chairman Marc Short wrote in the letter, referring to Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is set to expire this year. Former Vice President Mike Pence, left, is urging House Republicans to make President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent. Advancing American Freedom calls on Republicans to swiftly renew the across-the-board tax cuts that unleashed prosperity during President Trump's first term and deliver on the promise to make America prosperous again," they wrote. Pence added in a statement to Fox News Digital, "The Trump-Pence tax cuts lowered taxes across the board – for working families and businesses large and small. We got America's economy booming like never before and created more opportunity for all Americans. Republicans know that less taxes mean more jobs." Two sources familiar with the discussions told Fox News Digital that White House aides have been quietly floating a proposal to House Republicans that would raise the tax rate for people making more than $1 million to 40%. The plan is intended to mitigate the cost of Trump's ambitious 2024 campaign promise to cut taxes on overtime pay, tipped wages and retirees' Social Security. Pence responded to Fox News Digital's reporting on Wednesday, urging House Republicans to resist tax increases on the wealthy. "Raising the Top Marginal Rate would be a Huge Tax Increase on Small Business America." President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on March 31, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Getty Images) Pence has often criticized Trump's policies during his second term, most recently critiquing Trump's tariff uncertainty, arguing even 10% tariffs would drive inflation higher and hurt American families. In a call for limited government, Pence also advocated for Congress to reclaim their authority over tariffs during remarks this week. Trump's former vice president refused to endorse him in 2024. Pence, who himself launched a short-lived 2024 presidential campaign, unexpectedly dropped out of the race for the White House during remarks at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual event in Las Vegas in October 2023. Former Vice President Al Gore, left, watches as former Vice President Mike Pence, center, shakes hands with then-President-elect Donald Trump before a State Funeral Service for former President Jimmy Carter at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 9, 2025. However, Trump and Pence were seen shaking hands at former President Jimmy Carter's funeral in December – their first public appearance together in nearly four years. Pence congratulated Trump on winning the 2024 election, despite refusing to endorse him. Pence has distanced himself from his former boss since the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when Pence defied Trump's wishes by affirming that former President Joe Biden rightly won the 2020 election. Rioters called for Pence to be hanged, and the former vice president has faced the ire of Trump's most loyal supporters ever since. Republican presidential candidate former Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the Clinton County GOP Hog Roast on July 30, 2023 in Clinton, Iowa. Among the slim anti-Trump base of the Republican Party, Pence received praise for his courage on that day. As Pence campaigned in Iowa and New Hampshire, voters at town halls often thanked Pence for standing up to Trump. He deserves our thanks as Americans for putting his oath of office and the Constitution of the United States before personal, political and unfair pressure," former Gov. The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment by deadline. Deirdre Heavey is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating after a Frontier Airlines flight made a hard landing at Luis Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Tuesday. Flight 3506, an Airbus A321, was arriving from Orlando International Airport when its first landing attempt failed. Audio from the website Broadcast includes air traffic controllers alerting pilots of “debris on the runway” after an “aircraft landed a bit harsh.” “The last aircraft that tried to land in San Juan hit the surface too hard and apparently (it) lost some things in the runway,” the controller explained to another pilot. Flight 3506 circled the airport and made two more attempts at landing, successfully touching down at 10:20 p.m. local time. A number of other incoming planes had to land at other airports while Luis Marin International was closed. Video from a passenger on the plane showed people onboard cheering as it finally landed. Passengers were deplaned on the taxiway and bussed to a terminal. “The aircraft landed safely and there were no injuries to the passengers or crew,” Frontier Airlines said in a statement.

The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office filed a request late Wednesday to delay Thursday's resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez. District Attorney Nathan Hochman's office said in the filing that the resentencing hearings, set for Thursday and Friday, should be put on hold until the court obtains copies of comprehensive risk assessments for the brothers that were completed by state prison and parole officers. Gavin Newsom's office told Fox News in response that the comprehensive risk assessment is ongoing and will be completed on June 13, 2025. Per California legal regulations, one component of it has been released to the involved parties for their review 60 days before the clemency hearing and is subject to correction, his office said. Newsom's office said it notified Judge Michael Jesic of the status of this report, which is not a stand-alone risk assessment, and offered to share it with the court if he requests it. It was not immediately clear if the DA's filing would affect Thursday's hearing, which is scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m. local time. Lyle, left, and Erik Menendez sit with defense attorney Leslie Abramson in Beverly Hills Municipal Court during a hearing on Nov. 26, 1990. The Menendez brothers' discussed their push for freedom, decades after their parents' brutal murders, in a recent interview with TMZ. In the feature, "TMZ Presents: The Menendez Brothers: The Prison Interview," both brothers were interviewed and discussed how prison has changed them and how they envision life outside of prison walls. The scenes then show a young Erik and Lyle and the grisly crime scene they left behind in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989 after killing their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez. "It was almost the perfect murder," said former Beverly Hills Police Detective Tom Linehan. Now, more than 35 years later, the fate of the brothers lies in the hands of a Los Angeles County judge, who legal experts say will have to answer two simple questions: Do Erik and Lyle pose an unreasonable risk to the public, and does he believe they have rehabilitated? Linehan unequivocally said he would not trust them and what they did was the "worst, most heinous murder case" he has ever seen. This combination of two booking photos provided by the California Department of Corrections shows Erik Menendez, left, and Lyle Menendez. "They are two of the most skilled liars and their notary is what sets them apart from other inmates in similar situations," Linehan said. "If things weren't going their way, they could do this again." Hochman has also said he does not agree with the resentencing but is prepared to move forward. Hochman has said that it is up to the court to factor in whether the "lack of acceptance of responsibility for their murderous actions" is enough to decide whether the Menendez brothers pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the community. "Though this pathway to resentencing has been offered to the Menendez brothers, they have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit and denials," Hochman said. A former inmate, rapper X-Rated, who served 18 years with Lyle and Erik, said they do not belong in prison, even claiming his neighbor's dog was more dangerous than the Menendez brothers. He added that they have helped him and many others get out of prison and rehabilitate in society, showing selflessness, knowing they had "no chance" of getting out while they were helping others. Erik admitted they were "spoiled brats" and that he suffered from severe insecurity issues. Both Lyle and Erik Menendez have come forward in documentaries and on social media claiming their father sexually abused them, offering a different narrative of the killings than the story their attorneys told in the 1990s. After a second trial in the mid-1990s, in which some of their evidence about the alleged sexual abuse was excluded, jurors agreed with prosecutors that their motive was greed. Because they were under 26 years old at the time of the murders, under current California law, new sentences of 50 years to life would immediately make them eligible for a parole hearing. They are already scheduled to appear before the board on June 13 as part of a comprehensive risk assessment report ordered by Newsom, who is considering the brothers' clemency request – a separate potential path out of prison.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The science and technology that have become integral to our daily lives may never have existed, experts say, were it not for research funded by the federal government at American colleges and universities. But as President Trump's administration threatens to withhold billions of dollars in federal funding from colleges across the nation, the future of innovations like those – and America's global leadership in research and development – could be at stake. “It's not hyperbole to say we could destroy a generation's worth of scientific progress in this administration,” Jon Fansmith, senior vice president of government relations at the American Council on Education, told CNN. “The implications are huge for every American, regardless of your political viewpoints.” The Trump administration appears determined to bring America's most elite universities in lockstep with his political ideology by threatening to withhold research funding that has proven critical for the universities. The Ivy League school “will not surrender its independence or its constitutional rights” by giving in to a bevy of demands from the administration in order to maintain its funding levels, the university's president, Alan Garber, has said. But other universities have struck a less defiant tone. Fansmith said some colleges can survive without federal funding – but not for long. Universities are like small cities with thousands of faculty members, students and researchers depending on the school to survive. But no two colleges are funded in the same way. Public universities often rely on revenue from tuition and donations as well as money from state and local governments to provide the bulk of their funding. Because they don't receive financial support from the state, private schools lean heavily on donations. Last year, philanthropy accounted for 45% of the school's revenue. Endowments are meant to literally fund a university forever. So there are rules limiting how much money a school can withdraw from its endowment each year. But crucially, the university said 80% of that money was restricted for specific purposes, like financial aid, professorships and specific scholarships within certain schools. “If I decide to endow a chair in the English department, the institution is legally not allowed to use that money for some other purpose,” Fansmith said, adding universities “don't have the flexibility to just shift (donations) to other purposes if they think it's a more pressing need.” That's where the federal government – and its commitment to funding academic research – comes in. Last year, Hopkins received $1 billion in funding from the agency. Related article Harvard weighs its next moves amid the federal funding standoff But all of that could vanish overnight if the Trump administration follows through with its threats to withhold funds. Hopkins has already cut thousands of employees after dramatic cuts to USAID ﻿cost it $800 million in funding. But the federal government hasn't always played such a critical role in academic research. But President Franklin Roosevelt believed scientific advancements would be crucial to winning the war. So, in 1941, he signed an executive order to create the Office of Scientific Research and Development. And that relationship has endured for more than 70 years, until now. But the money doesn't go straight into Columbia or Harvard's bank accounts. In essence, Smith said, universities are akin to national laboratories. “When you take money away from a Columbia or a Harvard or research or other institutions, you've just taken away funds from the best researchers who were judged by other scientists to do that research on behalf of the American people – in areas like cancer, Alzheimer's, pediatrics, diabetes, and other critical research areas,” Smith said. Many advances in science, he added, were discovered inadvertently by researchers who received federal grants. In fact, the annual “Golden Goose” award recognizes these innovations that have had life-changing impacts. Thanks to funding from the National Science Foundation, economics researchers who were studying markets helped develop the chain model for kidney donations. In 2012, researchers Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley shared the Nobel Prize for economics. Scientists studying rats at Duke University, funded by the NIH, uncovered a breakthrough that led to the practice of “infant massage” and forever changed neonatal care for premature infants. “Other countries will overtake us in science and resulting technology, if we don't recognize and protect the unique system that we have in place.” And ultimately, he said, the American people will lose.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The United States deployed B-1B bombers to East Asia earlier this week for multiple geopolitical assignments, first in South Korea and then in Japan. First, the long-range bombers participated in joint military drills with jets from South Korea on Tuesday, an operation that drew the ire of North Korean government officials. “Two U.S. Air Force B-1 Lancers and two F-16 Fighting Falcons joined two Republic of Korea Air Force F-35A Lightning IIs and KF-16s for combined training in airspace over western ROK April 15,” the release read. The bombers then performed a low pass over the flightline of Osan AB before departing Korean airspace.” “Regular training with strategic assets like long-range bombers and fifth-generation fighters enables Seventh Air Force to maintain its strong, combined readiness posture with the Republic of Korea Air Force and demonstrates its continued ironclad commitment to the ROK-U.S. Alliance,” the release noted. Additionally, CBS News reported that South Korea's Defense Ministry announced the drills were meant to enhance “operational capabilities” between the two countries and promote deterrence against any possible North Korean aggression. North Korean state media blasted the joint military operation, considering it an act of aggression. Reuters reported that a spokesman for North Korea's defense ministry called the drills “reckless bluffing.” Air Force's first-ever Bomber Task Force rotation based in Japan.” The presence of the bomber planes marked an increase in U.S. aerial military might in the Indo-Pacific, reported Air & Space Forces Magazine. During that time, B-52 bombers were at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US Sen. Chris Van Hollen told reporters in El Salvador Wednesday that he was unable to visit Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia in the maximum-security mega-prison where he is being held. “There will be more members of Congress coming,” Van Hollen said in an emotional media availability. “This is an unsustainable and unjust moment, so it cannot continue.” Van Hollen said he specifically asked Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa if he could meet with Abrego Garcia or at least speak with him over the phone or via video conferencing. Pressed on whether he had concerns about the man's health, Van Hollen said: “I don't know about his health status which is why I wanted to meet with him directly.” Related article What to know about Abrego Garcia's deportation case Communications director Steven Cheung called Van Hollen “a complete disgrace” and the Office of Communications accused the senator in a statement of a lack of concern regarding crimes they say were committed by undocumented immigrants against his constituents. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with any crimes in the United States, according to his lawyers. While Abrego Garcia had not been legally in the US prior to his deportation, a 2019 court order said he could not be returned to El Salvador and the Trump administration admitted in court documents he was deported there due to a clerical error. In recent days, however, Trump administration officials have denied that he was mistakenly deported. The Wednesday meeting, Van Hollen said, started with a “point of agreement” that the countries should work together to “crack down” on gangs like MS-13. However, he said the case of Abrego Garcia “does not have to do with MS-13.” Despite a Supreme Court ruling that the US must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return, White House officials have argued it's up to El Salvador whether to do so. Bukele said during the meeting that while he has the power to release Abrego Garcia, he wasn't willing to do so. “I said I am not asking him to smuggle Mr. Abrego Garcia into the United States, I am simply asking him to open the door of CECOT and let this innocent man walk out,” the senator said. Bukele has no plans to meet with the Democratic senator currently visiting the country, a high-level source close to Bukele told CNN. According to the source CNN spoke with, a tour of the maximum security prison Cecot may be arranged for US lawmakers, but they are not expected to be granted access to Abrego Garcia himself — as El Salvador does not permit individual visits with inmates at the facility.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When President Donald Trump named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his choice to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services, one group of health researchers was cautiously optimistic that their cause would finally have a champion at the highest levels of government: those focused on food and nutrition. Related article Ultraprocessed foods make up to 70% of the US food supply. Dr. Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the US National Institutes of Health conducting some of the world's only controlled trials on ultraprocessed foods, shared that optimism. “When I saw the MAHA movement gaining bipartisan support last year, it was music to my ears,” Hall wrote in a letter late last month to Kennedy and incoming NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. “I thought that after years of defunding human clinical research to understand metabolic disease perhaps NIH might finally prioritize the studies needed to uncover its root causes.” Instead, Hall announced his early retirement Wednesday, after 21 years at the NIH, in a post on social media, citing censorship of communication of his research findings. “Recent events have made me question whether NIH continues to be a place where I can freely conduct unbiased science,” Hall wrote, noting that it's been his “life's work” to “scientifically study how our food environment affects what we eat, and how what we eat affects our physiology” and that, given the new administration's interest in those issues, he'd hoped to expand that research program. “It's disappointing that this individual is fabricating false claims,” an HHS spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday. “NIH scientists have, and will, continue to conduct interviews regarding their research through written responses or other means. We remain committed to promoting gold-standard research and advancing public health priorities. Any attempt to paint this as censorship is a deliberate distortion of the facts.” Hall's letter to Kennedy and Bhattacharya, which circulated both within government and in external research circles and was obtained by CNN, sheds more light on what led to the departure of a key nutrition researcher from an administration that has said it's dedicated to improving the nation's nutrition. “We have been hobbled on several occasions with intermittent inability to purchase food for our study participants or obtain research supplies,” he told Kennedy and Bhattacharya in the March 28 letter. Further, Hall wrote, “I've also experienced incidences of censorship in my ability to discuss our research.” “Most concerning,” he said, “was a recent intervention by a HHS communications director regarding media coverage of our study on brain responses to ultra-processed foods.” “Surprisingly,” Hall and his team wrote in the paper, they didn't, at least not large enough to be picked up on PET scans. “HHS denied an interview request from the New York Times and contacted the reporter directly to downplay our study results because our data might be viewed as failing to support preconceived HHS narratives about ultra-processed food addiction,” Hall said in the letter. CNN viewed copies of the written responses, which showed that an approved version sent to a reporter had added a line suggesting the study was small, with 50 participants. Hall noted Wednesday that, in fact, it was actually the largest of its kind. It's not the first time a Trump administration is said to have attempted to interfere with communication of health information from its agencies; in September 2020, a federal health official told CNN that Trump appointees had pushed to change language in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly reports so they didn't undermine the president's political message during the Covid-19 pandemic. “We'll never use this agency to censor scientists who disagree,” Bhattacharya said in an interview on Fox News. “If scientists are censored, we actually can't have excellent science.” And food and nutrition researchers had high hopes for Kennedy, despite the broader public health world's deep concerns about his history of spreading misinformation about vaccines - worries that have only increased as a deadly measles outbreak grows in Texas and surrounding states. On food, Kennedy's priorities have appeared more aligned with most academic health researchers'. “I was hoping the administration would come in and say … ‘this is a big priority for us. Ultraprocessed foods are those that include industrially created ingredients that can't be made in a regular home kitchen and are estimated to make up about 70% of the US food supply. These kinds of trials are especially difficult to do in nutrition because participants' environments must be tightly controlled so their food can be monitored down to the gram; in Hall's studies, participants live at the NIH clinical center - essentially a hospital - for weeks at a time. “His study raises this question – ‘What if it is the processing?' “Then you have an administration coming in that's saying the same thing, and you have a great story for them to tell: that the last administration dragged its feet on this. Just over two months after Kennedy was sworn in, Hall – the NIH's top nutrition researcher working on those answers – is leaving. In his social media post Wednesday, Hall said he “felt compelled to accept early retirement to preserve health insurance for my family,” noting that he'd lose that benefit if he resigned later “in protest of any future meddling or censorship.” “Perhaps I could soon return to government service and lead an effort to expand on our research to rapidly determine what are the most important factors in our toxic food environment that are making Americans chronically sick,” Hall wrote last month.</p>

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified a Biden administration plan to counter domestic terrorism established in the months following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. 

Gabbard declassified former President Joe Biden's Strategic Implementation Plan for Countering Domestic Terrorism at the prompting of conservative groups, including America First Legal. 

AFL wrote in a letter to Gabbard on April 2 about its concerns regarding the Biden administration's “weaponization” of its power in the name of maintaining national security through “censoring disfavored speech on the Internet by labeling such speech ‘misinformation,' ‘disinformation,' ‘hate speech,' ‘domestic terrorism.'”

Gabbard wrote on X on April 5 in response to the AFL letter thanking the group “for your work.”

“We are already on this, and look forward to declassifying this and other instances of the government being weaponized against Americans,” she wrote, vowing to “bring transparency and accountability to end the weaponization of our intelligence community.”

The 15-page declassified plan from June 2021 established four pillars it hoped to achieve: understand and share domestic terrorism-related information, prevent domestic terrorism recruitment and mobilization to violence, disrupt and deter domestic terrorism activity, and confront long-term contributors to domestic terrorism. 

The plan called to “drive other executive and legislative action, including banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,” a frequent effort from Democrats.

The Biden administration also called for sharing with “relevant technology and other private-industry companies” information concerning domestic terrorism.

The proposal also encouraged the “teaching and learning of civics education that provides students with the skill to fully participate in civic life,” including by promoting “literacy education for both children and adult learners and existing proven interventions to foster resiliency to disinformation.”

The plan also talked about “advancing inclusion in the nation's COVID-19 response” and working to “increase voter participation and service as nonpartisan poll workers.”

Biden's summer 2021 outline even garnered the criticism of the American Civil Liberties Union, which called it a reflection of the “ever-expanding authority to surveil and monitor American communities.”</p>
