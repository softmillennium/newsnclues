            A suspect is in custody following a reported shooting at Florida State University on Thursday, according to two law enforcement sources with direct knowledge of the situation.
    


            At least four people have been injured, CNN affiliate WCTV reported, citing hospital officials. A first responder on the scene gave CNN a similar account.
    


            Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare is “actively receiving and caring for patients” from the shooting, a spokesperson said in a statement to CNN. “At this time, details are still unfolding, and we do not yet have specific information to share.”
    


            The extent of those injuries is unclear, according to the law enforcement sources, citing preliminary reports.
    


            “An active shooter has been reported in the area of Student Union,” the university said in a post on X. “Police are on scene or on the way. Continue to seek shelter and await further instructions. Lock and stay away from all doors and windows and be prepared to take additional protective measures.”
    


            CNN has reached out to the Tallahassee Police Department, the Leon County Sheriff's office and the university.
    


            Florida State University student Emily Palmer, 21, was near FSU's student union when she was alerted to a “dangerous situation” on campus.
    


            “Continue to shelter in place,” one of the emergency messages from FSU Alert reads. “Police have responded to an active shooter call at the Student Union. Stay alert for more information.”
    


            “I'm shaking … It's just a lot going on,” Palmer told CNN from the safety of her student housing.
    


            “I'm concerned about my friends,” she said. “I have friends in class right who are getting evacuated by police with their hands up.”
    


            Richard Rind, the university's director of transportation and parking, told CNN he was sheltered in place Thursday as emergency vehicles descended on campus.
    


            “Many emergency vehicles on scene but can't see much as we are locked down in a building across the street,” Rind told CNN, adding he heard shots and saw people running as the incident unfolded Thursday afternoon.
    


This is a developing story and will be updated.

What to know about the judge in the case of a man mistakenly deported to El Salvador","https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/17/politics/paula-xinis-judge-kilmar-abrego-garcia/index.html","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 16:29:00 GMT","

            Federal Judge Paula Xinis is at the center of the case of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration that has emerged as a critical test of Trump's aggressive crackdown on immigration in the United States.
    


            Following a Supreme Court ruling that the US must “facilitate” Kilmar Abrego Garcia's return, Xinis, a New York native who has sat on the federal bench in Maryland for nearly a decade, must now contend with a government whose officials insist it's an issue for the president of El Salvador to decide.
    


            “Our only job legally was to facilitate it if, according to the Supreme Court, President Bukele wanted him to come back to our country and he does not want him back and we do not want him back in our country,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said Wednesday on Fox News.
    


            Since ordering Abrego Garcia's return earlier this month, Xinis has gone toe-to-toe with Justice Department attorneys in her courtroom, appearing confident that the Supreme Court largely endorsed her decision to order the administration to bring Abrego Garcia back.
    


            “We're not going to slow walk this,” Xinis told the government last week. “So you will have a full and fair opportunity to be heard, but we're not relitigating what the Supreme Court has already put to bed.”
    


            Xinis has, at times, appeared frustrated with how the case has unfolded since the Supreme Court ruling. Earlier this week, she allowed for expedited fact finding to see whether the Trump administration is complying with her order.
    


            “It is a fact now of this record that every day Mr. Garcia is detained in CECOT is a day of irreparable harm,” she said, referencing the high-security mega prison where inmates are packed into cells and never allowed outside.
    


            “There will be no tolerance for gamesmanship or grandstanding,” she declared to attorneys when the status conference began.
    


            She has allowed for “two weeks of intense discovery,” including depositions taken by Abrego Garcia's attorneys of the administration officials who have been submitting the daily sworn statements.
    


            And she wants both sides to move quickly: “Well, cancel – cancel vacation. Cancel other appointments,” the judge said at one point during the conference. “I'm usually pretty good about things like that in my courtroom, but not this time. So, I expect all hands on deck.”
    


            Here's what to know about the judge at the center of the Abrego Garcia case:
    


            Like Judge Tanya Chutkan, the federal judge who notably presided over President Donald Trump's criminal case in Washington, DC, Xinis previously served as a public defender.
    


            Xinis spent more than a decade as an assistant federal public defender in Maryland, from 1998 to 2011. Before then, she was a law clerk for Judge Diana Gribbon Motz of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit from 1997 to 1998. In a recent interview with The Washington Post, Motz described Xinis as an “extraordinarily able young lawyer” who was “totally forthright” and “easy to work with.”
    


            Xinis was confirmed by the Senate in 2016 in a 53 - 34 vote, more than a year after she was nominated by President Barack Obama.
    


            Then-Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions scrutinized her record at her confirmation hearing in July 2015, pointing towards her work as a complaint examiner for the Office of Police Complaints for the District of Columbia and her firm's role in a civil suit surrounding the 2015 death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore.
    


            “I've never had an agenda even in my private practice, even in my practice as an assistant federal defender,” Xinis said. “There is no agenda for a well-trained judge. There is no agenda for me, sir, and there would not be if I were confirmed.”
    


            Former Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont later defended Xinis before her final confirmation vote on the Senate floor, pointing towards one case where she provided legal counsel to a Baltimore police officer unfairly accused of criminal wrongdoing.
    


            In 2011, Xinis joined the Baltimore law firm, Murphy, Falcon & Murphy, where she handled civil matters and acted as a lead and co-chair trial attorney on federal civil rights violations, according to a questionnaire she provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee when she was nominated by Barack Obama in 2015.
    


            She described her work in 2021 during a highly personal talk shared by the US Courts, where she looked back on representing “brain injured children poisoned in a lead paint study, a 39-year-old man who suffered a massive stroke after a police officer put him in a choke hold during a traffic stop,” and “patients at a drug rehab center poisoned by carbon monoxide.”
    


            Xinis was born in 1968 in Mineola, New York, a town in Long Island, New York to a family of Greek immigrants. She completed her undergraduate studies at the University of Virginia and graduated from Yale School of Law in 1997.

Follow:


            Police in Germany have raided the home of a teenage boy suspected of making and storing ricin, a highly toxic and deadly biological warfare agent.
    


            The 16-year-old is accused of producing “several vials” containing a mixture of ricin and aconitine, another potent plant toxin, in a makeshift laboratory in the attic of his family home in Zeithain, a municipality in the eastern state of Saxony, police said.
    


            The Saxony State Criminal Police Office has launched an investigation in conjunction with the Dresden Public Prosecutor's Office into the possible violation of Germany's Weapons of War Act, which regulates the production and trade of materials considered weapons of war.
    


            Officers have been searching the suspect's home since the early hours of Thursday morning, according to the Saxony police statement. They are seeking to “secure all toxic substances and other evidence,” the statement said.
    


            Investigators have so far not uncovered any evidence regarding the suspect's intentions for the toxic substance, police said.
    


            An arrest warrant has not been issued. Based on the current status of the investigation, there are no grounds for detention under Germany's Code of Criminal procedure, particularly considering the Juvenile Justice Act, the statement said.
    


            Ricin is a natural, highly toxic compound that is a byproduct of processing castor beans. It is potentially lethal when inhaled, ingested or injected. Less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours due to the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems.
    


            If ingested, it causes nausea, vomiting and internal bleeding of the stomach and intestines, followed by failure of the liver, spleen and kidneys, and finally death by collapse of the circulatory system.
    


            If injected, ricin causes the immediate death of the muscles and lymph nodes near the site of the injection. Failure of major organs and death usually follows.

Barcelona Femení player Mapi León was banned for two matches after appearing to touch the groin area of Espanyol defender Daniela Caracas.
    


            The incident happened in the 15th minute of the Barcelona derby on February 9 when León and Caracas were jostling for position in the penalty area.
    


            “The FC Barcelona player, Mapi León, was banned (for) two matches by the RFEF (Royal Spanish Football Federation) competition committee,” Liga F, the top division of women's football in Spain, told CNN Sports in a statement.
    


            “Liga F is not going to make any further statement on this matter.”
    


            León missed Barça's 5-1 win over Sevilla on Wednesday and the 6-0 win over Atlético Madrid on Sunday due to her ban.
    


            CNN has reached out to Barcelona, Espanyol and RFEF for comment.
    


            After the initial incident, León had denied any wrongdoing and said in a statement shared by Barcelona that there was “NO contact with (Caracas') private parts, and certainly no intention.”
    


            Footage of the incident was widely shared on social media, and in a statement released the day after the match, Espanyol said “violated the intimacy of our player.”
    


            Barça ended up winning the derby match 2-0.
    


            León, who has played more than 50 times for the Spanish national team, is a key player for Barcelona, winning five league titles and three Women's Champions Leagues.

South Africa, once the world's gold powerhouse, is now only the globe's eighth largest producer of the yellow metal and the only real benefit the country is seeing from record prices is the psychological impact on shares in the gold mining sector and the rand.

Overnight, Gold miners, Sibanye Stillwater, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields and Harmony Gold Mining Company advanced 6.8%, 4.1%, 3.1% and 2.9%, respectively, data from Anchor Capital showed.

US President Donald Trump's trade tariff war, especially with escalating tensions between America and China, has caused concerns over a recession on that country and a spillover effect in terms of slower economic growth across the globe.

As a result, the dollar is moving down and gold – long perceived as a safe haven for investors – is hitting record highs having broken through the$3,300 barrier to trade at $3,326 an ounce in New York just after 3am their time.

However, South Africa's economy won't reap the full benefits of the surge in price. Dr Azar Jammine, director and chief economist at Econometrix, told IOL that local gold output has dropped from 1 000 tons in 1970 to 100 tons now – a 90% drop.

”We are not even in the top 10 of the gold producers in the world anymore,” said Jammine. He pointed to the fact that countries such as China, Russia, Australia, Canada, and even the US produce more gold than South Africa.

Andre Botha, head of execution at TreasuryONE, explained that “South Africa has lost much of its lustre in the global gold market due to several factors. Soaring operational costs, driven by ageing infrastructure and the necessity for deep, labour-intensive mining, have eroded profitability. Declining ore grades and stricter regulatory frameworks have further hampered production.”

Botha adds that “frequent labour disputes and unreliable energy supplies, including regular power cuts, have exacerbated these issues, allowing nations like China and Australia to overtake” South Africa's status as a leading gold producer.

Gold's history in South Africa dates back to the late 1800s, when a rush saw an effective shanty town developed in what is now Johannesburg. Pilgrims Rest and Barberton are historical sites for mining, with tourists still being able to pan for alluvial gold in Pilgrims Rest in Mpumalanga's Drakensburg area.

Botha says gold has little material impact on South Africa's economy today. Production peaked in 1993, while the current record low is as of 2022, according to data from CEIC. 

South Africa has diversified significantly in terms of economic contributors, with services, manufacturing, and financial sectors now accounting for over 60% of gross domestic product, said Botha.

“While commodity exports remain important, gold is overshadowed by platinum, coal, and iron ore,” said Botha.

Jammine noted that gold was not irrelevant in terms of total export earnings, especially at current prices. However, calculations he did for IOL show that the yellow metal accounts for about 10% of total export earnings. “It's not insignificant, but it's not going to change everything in terms of South Africa's performance.” 

South Africa's integration into global financial markets, alongside growth in tourism and technology, has diminished reliance on gold revenue, said Botha.

“Domestic factors such as political stability and fiscal policy, combined with global risk sentiment, now exert a far greater influence on the economy and the rand's value than fluctuations in gold prices,” Botha added.

Where gold does have an impact is in its psychological value on shares and the currency, said Jammine. He said that the perception is that South Africa is still a major gold producer and, as people think South Africa will have a large benefit from the metal, there is a psychological advantage for the rand and gold mining shares. 

In addition, said Jammine, because of the way gold miners' costs are structured, there is a positive ratio in terms of a higher benefit from increased prices compared with rising mining costs.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has confirmed he will travel to Russia for the Victory Day celebrations next month, despite warnings from the European Union that the move could jeopardize Belgrade's accession hopes.

Moscow will host its annual military parade on Red Square on May 9 to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. Vucic attended the event in 2020, prior to the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. 

EU foreignpolicy chief Kaja Kallas said on Monday that the bloc does “not want any candidate country to take part in the May 9 events in Moscow.” EU officials have even reportedly threatened to derail Serbia's bid to join the bloc if Vucic attends the celebrations. 

“I have not changed my decision... I am ready for the whole sky to fall on my head from the pressure to go to Moscow. Eight months ago, I announced my visit to Moscow, publicly,” Vucic said on Wednesday, as cited by Serbian media.

According to the president, a unit of the Serbian Army will take part in the parade. During World War II, Serbia, which was then part of Yugoslavia, fell under Nazi occupation and was liberated by Soviet forces in 1944. 

Vucic also said that “a period of enormous diplomatic activity is coming,” citing several upcoming meetings with EU officials and a possible visit to the US. 

The Russian government extended multiple invitations to the May 9 events, including to the leaders of China, India and Brazil, as well as to EU member Slovakia and to Serbia, which was granted EU candidate status in 2012.

Belgrade has declined to provide arms to Ukraine and has voiced opposition to the EU's sanctions against Moscow. Vucic has emphasized the value of maintaining good relations with Russia and has called for a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict.

A Russian-Indian joint venture has submitted a bid for a contract to supply Kalashnikov AK-203 assault rifles to the police force in the southern Indian state of Kerala, Russian arms exporter Rosoboronexport said in a statement on Tuesday.

Indo-Russian Rifles Private Limited (IRRPL), formed by Rosoboronexport and the Kalashnikov Concern along with two state-owned Indian firms – Advanced Weapons and Equipment India Limited and Munitions India Limited – started manufacturing the rifles in India in 2023.

AK-203 rifles are manufactured using Russian technology and certified equipment. They are produced in the town of Korda in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, following the ‘Make in India' initiative of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“The capacities of the Korwa Ordnance Factory make it possible to equip the personnel of the Ministry of Defense and other law enforcement agencies of India with AK-203 assault rifles, which, due to their high adaptability, are suitable for various operators,” Rosoboronexport CEO Aleksandr Mikheev said in a statement. 

In addition, the joint venture will be able to export its products to third countries, according to Mikheev. Manufacturing of AK-203 rifles has progressed rapidly since 2019, when Modi visited the Amethi district where the Korwa ordnance factory is located, reports said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a statement in 2019 that “the new joint venture will manufacture world famous Kalashnikov assault rifles of the newest 200 series and eventually will reach full localization of production. Thus, the Indian defense-industrial sector will have the opportunity to fulfill the needs of national security agencies in this category of small arms, resting upon advanced Russian technologies.”

Since then, more than 35,000 Kalashnikovs have been delivered to the Indian Army by the joint venture, Srihari Pratap Shahi, additional CEO of UP Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), told RT. He added that further manufacturing of nearly 600,000 AK-203 rifles will be spread over ten years. 

UPEIDA is part of the Uttar Pradesh state government, tasked with establishing ‘defense industrial corridors' in the northern part of India. Earlier this year, India proposed exporting the AK-203 rifle to Nepal, potentially replacing the outdated INSAS platform, as part of a broader effort to standardize modern assault rifles, according to a report in media outlet ThePrint.

MOSCOW, April 17. /TASS/. Senior Ukrainian officials are in Paris to discuss what may become a catastrophic outcome of plans by the ""coalition of the willing"" to deploy troops in Ukraine, Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev wrote on X.

""Apparently, the top of Ukraine's fascist clique have come to Paris for talks with the UK, Germany and France on how many European coffins they will be ready to accept after the deployment of the troops of the `coalition of the willing' in Ukraine,"" the Russian politician wrote in an English-language post.

Earlier, Andrey Yermak, the head of the office of Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky, said he along with the Ukrainian defense and foreign ministers, Rustem Umerov and Andrey Sibiga, respectively, had arrived in Paris for talks with senior US officials.

The United States reported earlier that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff will hold a meeting with their European counterparts in Paris on April 17-18.

The ""coalition of the willing"" held a summit in Paris on March 27, where representatives from around 30 countries discussed potential security guarantees for Kiev after the conclusion of the conflict. One of the key issues was the possible deployment of a military force in Ukraine. The United States was absent from this summit.

MOSCOW, April 15. /TASS/. The Ukrainian army carried out strikes on energy facilities in 15 Russian regions between March 18 and April 16, according to TASS estimates.

The Belgorod, Bryansk, Voronezh, Zaporozhye, Kursk, Lipetsk, Rostov, Saratov, Smolensk, Tambov, Kherson and Krasnodar regions, the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics and Crimea came under attack. The majority of strikes were reported in the Kursk, Belgorod and Bryansk regions.

The attacks involved unmanned aerial vehicles, FPV drones and artillery, including HIMARS rocket launchers. A Ukrainian attack almost completely destroyed the Sudzha gas metering station in the Kursk Region.

Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier that Kiev had in fact failed to comply with the energy strike moratorium after March 18. The Russian Defense Ministry reports such attacks almost every day.

US President Donald Trump suggested that the parties to the conflict halt attacks on energy sites for 30 days in a phone call with Russian leader Vladimir Putin on March 18.

French weekly published pictures of Pelicot with a man, described as her ‘companion', walking in the street

Gisèle Pelicot, who survived nearly a decade of rapes by dozens of men, will sue Paris Match magazine for invasion of privacy, her lawyers said on Thursday.

In its latest edition, Paris Match published seven pictures of Pelicot accompanied by a man described as her companion walking in the streets in her new home town.

Pelicot received international acclaim for waiving her right to anonymity in the trial last year of her ex-husband and other defendants.

“It's not us who should feel shame, but them,” she said of the perpetrators.

Dominique Pelicot, her former husband, drugged her for nearly a decade so he and dozens of strangers he recruited online could rape her. Dominique Pelicot, who admitted the charges, kept hundreds of videos of the attacks on his computer in a file entitled “abuse”. A French court sentenced him to 20 years in prison in December.

“Every time the intimacy of our client's personal life is violated, we will react and seek a court decision,” the lawyer Antoine Camus said on Thursday. Camus said it was “shocking” and “disappointing” that Paris Match would secretly take pictures of Pelicot, “whose ordeal was the subject of 3,000 pictures and videos”.

He accused the magazine of “having learned nothing from the four-month trial”.
 Contacted by Agence France-Presse, Paris Match had no comment.

Trump called for university to lose tax-exempt status after it defied him; federal law bars president from requesting the IRS investigate or audit specific targets

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is making plans to rescind Harvard University's tax-exempt status, with a final decision expected soon, according to multiple reports.

Some IRS officials have told colleagues that the treasury department asked the agency on Wednesday to consider revoking Harvard's tax exemption, the New York Times reported.

Linda McMahon, the education secretary, said she doesn't know whether Harvard will lose its tax-exempt status but argued “it was certainly worth looking into.”

“We'll see what IRS comes back with relative to Harvard,” McMahon told CNN.

I certainly think, you know, in elitist schools, especially that have these incredibly large endowments, you know, we should probably have a look into that.

Donald Trump on Tuesday publicly called for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status, hours after his administration announced a $2.2bn freeze in federal funds to Harvard.

“Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting “Sickness?” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!”

According to the Times, federal law bars the president from either directly or indirectly requesting the IRS to investigate or audit specific targets.

The IRS has previously revoked tax exemptions from organizations for political or commercial activities, but federal law gives non-profits the right to appeal the agency's decision in court.

“To my knowledge, this is the first time an administration has tried something like this,” R William Snyder, accounting and taxes professor at George Mason University's Costello College of Business, told CNN.

Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni has invited Donald Trump to visit Italy as the two leaders sat down for talks at the White House.

Their meeting comes a day before Meloni hosts vice-president JD Vance in Rome, and the back-to-back talks could be critical in determining whether she can play a mediator role between the US and Europe.

Meloni added that she expected Italy would announce at the next Nato meeting in June that her country would be able to reach the alliance requirement that each member nation spend 2% of GDP on defense spending.

Donald Trump and Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni have said they are certain they can make a trade deal ahead of talks at the White House.

“I am sure we can make a deal, and I am here to help with that,” Meloni said as she sat across a table from Trump ahead of a lunch on Thursday.

Trump said that broadly speaking he expected he would make an announcement about trade deals but was “in no rush”. Per pool report:

Oh, there will be a trade deal, 100% … Of course there will be a trade deal. They want to make one very much. And we are going to make a trade deal. I fully expect it. And it will be a fair deal.

Asked about what countries were on his priority list, Trump said, “Everybody is on my priority list.”

Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has attacked Comcast, claiming that the media company is “misleading the American public” by describing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year old Salvadorian man living in Maryland who was wrongfully sent to El Salvador, as a “Maryland man.”

Carr, who was appointed to his position by Trump, targeted Comcast outlets and accused them of “news distortion” on X.

The FCC chair's comments come a day after Trump attacked Comcast in a separate Truth Social post this week, writing that Comcast and its leadership “are a disgrace to the integrity of Broadcasting!!!”

Last week, the supreme court unanimously ruled and ordered the administration to “facilitate” the return of Garcia, who was supposed to have been protected from deportation to El Salvador, regardless of whether he was part of the MS-13 gang – a claim that the Trump administration has repeated and which García's family and attorneys staunchly refutes.

Garcia has no criminal record in the US, according to court documents. It's also noteworthy that while members of the Trump administration continue to make the claim on television, the Department of Justice has not made the MS-13 accusation in court papers and has admitted the deportation was an error.

Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni has arrived at the White House ahead of talks with Donald Trump.

Speaking to reporters before their formal bilateral meeting, Trump praised Meloni, calling her a “great prime minister” and “one of the real leaders of the world”.

Meloni said she wants to “speak frankly about the needs that every one of us has” and “find the best way to make us both stronger”.

In respose to whether Meloni will be the one to “mediate your relationship with Europe”, Trump said: “Well, I do like her very much… I'm very proud to be with her…can't do better than that.”

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has cautioned White House officials to avoid firing Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, Politico reports, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Trump's frustration with Powell stems from Powell's refusal to cut interest rates, something which Trump has repeatedly advocated for. On Thursday, Trump took to Truth Social and vowed that Powell's “termination cannot come fast enough”!

Since Trump issued sweeping tariffs – which he later scaled back as part of a 90-day pause on most countries – the president has been calling for lower rates. However, Powell has kept rates elevated in attempts to control rising prices across the country.

Politico reports that according to federal law, members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors are appointed for 14-year terms and are can only be dismissed for “cause”.

Powell has previously said that the removal and demotion of top Federal Reserve officials are “not permitted under the law”.

Republican senator Lisa Murkowski has said a fear of retaliation under the Trump administration is rising to levels she has not seen before. 

“We are all afraid,” the Alaska senator said at leadership summit on Monday. “It's quite a statement,” she continued.

We're in a time and place where – I don't know, I certainly have not – I have not been here before. And I'll tell you, I'm oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice because retaliation is real. And that's not right.

“It is as hard as anything I have been engaged in, in the 20-plus years I've been in the Senate,” she added.

The wife of Kilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland man unlawfully deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador, has strongly criticized the Trump administration's attempt to smear his character, saying a temporary restraining order against him was “out of caution” and that “he is a loving partner and father” who is being denied justice.

Jennifer Vasquez Sura said she “acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar” when she got the civil protective order in 2021, according to a statement emailed to the Baltimore Sun.

Vasquez Sura said she decided not to follow through with the civil court process because “things did not escalate” with her husband. She wrote:

We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling. Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect.

That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation.

The Trump administration has refused to attempt to return Ábrego García to the US after he was mistakenly placed on a deportation flight to El Salvador last month, despite legal rulings ordering his return.

The Trump administration claims that Ábrego García is a member of MS-13, a gang the administration has listed as a foreign terrorist organization. Ábrego García, through his attorneys, has denied any affiliation. He has no criminal record in either the US or El Salvador.

The White House is preparing a budget that could include deep cuts to federal housing, including a sweeping overhaul of aid to low-income families, according to a New York Times report.

The potential changes primarily concern federal housing vouchers, including those more commonly known as Section 8, the paper writes.

Section 8 helps low-income families, elderly persons, veterans and disabled individuals cover the monthly costs of apartments, town homes and single-family residences.

The overhaul would be reportedly included in Donald Trump's new budget, which is expected to be sent to Capitol Hill in the coming weeks.

Talks between Iran and the US over Tehran's nuclear program are in a “very crucial” stage, the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog said.

Iran and US are expected to meet on Saturday in Rome for a new round of talks after last weekend's first meeting in Oman.

“We know that we are in a very crucial, I would say, stage of this important negotiation, so I want to concentrate on the positive,” International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi said.

There is a possibility of a good outcome. Nothing is guaranteed. We need to make sure that we put all of the elements in place ... in order to get to this agreement.

Grossi was speaking during a visit to Iran, during which he met with the country's foreign minister Abbas Araghchi.

Several international students who have had their visas revoked in recent weeks have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing the government denied them due process.

The actions by the federal government to terminate students' legal status have left hundreds of scholars at risk of detention and deportation.

Their schools range from private universities such as Harvard and Stanford to large public institutions such as the University of Maryland and Ohio State University and to some small liberal arts colleges.

At least 901 students at 128 colleges and universities have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since mid-March, according to an Associated Press review of university statements and correspondence with school officials.

In lawsuits against the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), students have argued the government lacked justification to cancel their visa or terminate their legal status.

The Trump administration plans to focus on the financial investments of elite universities as part of the next phase of Donald Trump's war on top universities, according to a report.

White House officials plan to examine investments in areas disfavored by Trump, including clean energy and China, Semafor reports, citing sources.

It comes after Trump announced pauses in federal funding on some of the top US universities he accuses of antisemitism and pushing progressive ideology, and as the IRS is reportedly preparing to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status.

Semafor cites a White House memo from February that states:

It is past time for American universities to stop supporting foreign adversaries with their investment decisions, much as they should stop granting university access to supporters of terrorism.

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer has called on the Department of Justice to investigate whether the arson attack on Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro's home constitutes a hate crime.

In a letter to attorney general Pam Bondi, Schumer wrote:

While the local district attorney has not yet filed hate-crime charges, he acknowledged that Governor Shapiro's religion appears to have factored into the suspect's decisions.

Schumer referred to revelations contained in search warrants made public yesterday about the arson attack suspect's comments signaling support for Palestinians.

According to a search warrant in the case, 38-year-old Cody Balmer identified himself by name in a 911 call and said Shapiro “needs to know that he ‘will not take part in his plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people'”.

The suspect's statements, “in conjunction with the timing of the attack during Passover, Governor Shapiro's visible embrace of his Jewish faith, and the context of rising antisemitism globally and across the country” raise “serious concerns about antisemitic motivation”, Schumer wrote.

Illinois congresswoman Delia Ramirez, a Democrat, has requested a congressional delegation to visit the Salvadorian mega-prison where the Trump administration is sending deportees.

Among those who have been sent to the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) in El Salvador is Kilmar Ábrego García, whom the Trump administration admitted to wrongly deporting but has refused to bring back.

In a statement on Wednesday, Ramirez said she had sent a letter to the Committee on Homeland Security demanding an oversight visit to Cecot, which she described as a “notorious, off-shore prison with a history of gross human rights violations”.

President Trump and Secretary Noem deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, Andry Hernandez Romero, Jerce Reyes Barrios and hundreds of others to Cecot with no due process, resulting in ‘administrative errors'. Their actions are illegal, unconstitutional and inhumane.

Maryland's Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador on Wednesday but said his request to visit Ábrego García was denied.

Several other Democratic lawmakers have signaled that they would like to visit El Salvador to check on Ábrego García, including Adriano Espaillat, chair of the Congressional Hispanic caucus, and Robert Garcia and Maxwell Alejandro Frost, both members of the House oversight committee.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is making plans to rescind Harvard University's tax-exempt status, with a final decision expected soon, according to multiple reports.

Some IRS officials have told colleagues that the treasury department asked the agency on Wednesday to consider revoking Harvard's tax exemption, the New York Times reported.

Linda McMahon, the education secretary, said she doesn't know whether Harvard will lose its tax-exempt status but argued “it was certainly worth looking into.”

“We'll see what IRS comes back with relative to Harvard,” McMahon told CNN.

I certainly think, you know, in elitist schools, especially that have these incredibly large endowments, you know, we should probably have a look into that.

Donald Trump on Tuesday publicly called for Harvard to lose its tax-exempt status, hours after his administration announced a $2.2bn freeze in federal funds to Harvard.

“Perhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting “Sickness?” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Remember, Tax Exempt Status is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!”

According to the Times, federal law bars the president from either directly or indirectly requesting the IRS to investigate or audit specific targets.

The IRS has previously revoked tax exemptions from organizations for political or commercial activities, but federal law gives non-profits the right to appeal the agency's decision in court.

“To my knowledge, this is the first time an administration has tried something like this,” R William Snyder, accounting and taxes professor at George Mason University's Costello College of Business, told CNN.

An immigration judge denied bond to a Tufts University PhD student who was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents outside her Massachusetts apartment because her student visa had been revoked.

Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was targeted by the Trump administration for arrest, detention and deportation in retaliation for an op-ed she co-authored in her student newspaper, according to her lawyers.

Öztürk's attorneys said the immigration ruling on Wednesday was a “complete violation of due process and the rule of law”.

Ms. Öztürk has committed no crime and DHS has provided zero evidence in their case against her. Despite that, the court yesterday relied on a previously submitted State Department memo that points to nothing that Ms. Öztürk said or did — other than her 2024 school newspaper op-ed — to falsely claim she is a danger to her community.

Öztürk is one of several international university students facing deportation over their involvement in pro-Palestinian protests and activism on college campuses.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A small Michigan community banded together to help a beloved local bookstore move its stock to a new storefront

Residents of all ages in a small Michigan community formed a human chain and helped a local bookshop move each of its 9,100 books – one by one – to a new storefront about a block away.

The “book brigade” of about 300 people stood in two lines running along a sidewalk in downtown Chelsea on Sunday, passing each title from Serendipity Books' former location directly to the correct shelves in the new building, down the block and around the corner on Main Street.

“It was a practical way to move the books, but it also was a way for everybody to have a part,” Michelle Tuplin, the store's owner, said. “As people passed the books along, they said ‘I have not read this' and ‘that's a good one'.”

Momentum had been building since Tuplin announced the move in January.

“It became so buzzy in town. So many people wanted to help,” she said on Tuesday.

Tuplin said the endeavour took just under two hours – much shorter than hiring a moving company to box and unbox the thousands of titles. The brigade even put the books back on the shelves in alphabetical order.

Now Tuplin hopes to have the new location open within two weeks.

The bookstore has been in Chelsea, about 60 miles (95km) west of Detroit, since 1997. Tuplin has been the owner since 2017 and has three part-time employees.

About 5,300 people call Chelsea home and residents described it as a place where neighbours help neighbours.

“It's a small town and people just really look out for each other,” said Kaci Friss, 32, who grew up in Chelsea and has worked at the bookstore for a little over a year. “Anywhere you go, you are going to run into someone you know or who knows you, and is going to ask you about your day.”

Friss said Sunday's book brigade reminded her of “how special this community is”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Exclusive: Mark Bridges of Farrer & Co was trustee for Rifaat al-Assad, who was charged with war crimes in 2024

Queen Elizabeth II's private solicitor spent eight years helping to manage the offshore wealth of the uncle of the recently deposed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, an investigation has established.

Rifaat al-Assad became known as the “butcher of Hama” after allegations he played a key role in a massacre of thousands of Syrians at the city of Hama in 1982. In 2024, Switzerland formally charged him with war crimes.

Concerns about Rifaat's activities, including his record as the head of a feared Syrian paramilitary force known as the Defense Brigades, have been publicly raised in Europe and the US by the media, human rights groups and government officials since the 1980s. He left Syria for Europe in 1984 after a failed coup against his brother.

Inquiries by the Guardian and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism have established that Mark Bridges, also known as the third Baron Bridges, served as a trustee on at least five trusts holding assets in France and Spain on behalf of Rifaat al-Assad or his relatives between 1999 and 2008.

During the same period, Bridges also held one of the most prestigious legal positions in Britain: private legal adviser to the British monarch. He was Queen Elizabeth's solicitor from 2002 to 2019.

The findings raise questions about whether it was appropriate for the monarch's personal lawyer to take the ethical and reputational risk of working for an individual accused of human rights atrocities, in view of potential embarrassment to the queen had the connection been discovered while she was still alive.

There is no suggestion of any regulatory wrongdoing by Bridges, who was knighted for his services to the queen in 2019. His firm, Farrer & Co, said the trusts were established on the advice of another leading law firm, that Bridges's work for Rifaat al-Assad was in complete compliance with regulatory requirements in effect at the time and that Bridges had been presented with evidence contradicting the allegations made against him.

The property empire amassed by Rifaat al-Assad after his arrival in Europe spanned the most luxurious postcodes of Paris, London and the Costa del Sol.

His acquisitions, which he claimed were part-funded by cheques worth millions of dollars from the king of Saudi Arabia, included Witanhurst in London's Highgate – the second-largest private residence in the capital after Buckingham Palace – and a seven-storey mansion near Paris's Arc de Triomphe.

Assad held his property empire through offshore companies and trusts, obscuring his ownership. One trust was registered in the Bahamas, while some of the purchases used shell companies in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory, before transfer to Spanish and later Maltese companies.

In 2014, prosecutors in France began investigating whether Rifaat al-Assad's wealth had in fact been obtained through corruption. Bridges had ceased acting as a trustee for Rifaat in 2008, his lawyers said, but continued to provide “limited and ad-hoc” legal advice until 2015 “in circumstances whereby the regulatory requirements imposed on the firm were met”.

Two of the trusts that Bridges had managed were said to own the Spanish portion of Rifaat al-Assad's real estate empire, including a deluxe villa with swathes of land near Marbella.

In 2019, Spanish prosecutors alleged that these same trusts controlled shell companies holding more than 500 properties in Spain worth €695m (£595m). According to the Spanish prosecutors, the offshore setup was designed to “hide the true ownership of the huge amount of real estate properties” and enabled the “laundering [of] dirty money from abroad”, referring to funds allegedly stolen from the Syrian state.

In 2020, a French court convicted Rifaat al-Assad of tax fraud and laundering embezzled public money – primarily about $200m (£151m) stolen from Syrian state funds and $100m in fraudulent loan agreements from Libya. Assad was sentenced to four years' imprisonment. He fled to Syria in 2021 while his conviction was under appeal.

Though not the only trustee serving Assad, Bridges was by far the most eminent. In addition to his services to the queen, he led the private client team at Farrer, an elite law firm with a reputation forged through serving British royals and aristocrats as far back as 1769.

There is no evidence Bridges knew or suspected that Rifaat al-Assad's money was stolen. Assad claimed his wealth came from benefactors, including the Saudi royal family, and in 2018 the Gibraltar supreme court concluded that it had been reasonable for Rifaat's trustees to believe this story.

The question of Rifaat al-Assad's status as an alleged war criminal, however, is more complicated.

In February 1982, armed militias affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood staged an uprising against the Assad regime in the town of Hama, in western Syria. To suppress the uprising, Syria's then president, Hafez al-Assad, Rifaat's brother, dispatched the Syrian army and a paramilitary group called the Defense Brigades.

An Amnesty International report published in 1983 found that while “it is difficult to establish for certain what happened”, allegations against Syrian regime forces included “collective execution of 70 people outside the municipal hospital” and “cyanide gas containers … alleged to have been brought into the city, connected by rubber pipes to the entrances of buildings believed to house insurgents, and turned on, killing all the buildings' occupants”. It is estimated that 10,000 to 40,000 people may have been unlawfully tortured and executed.

As head of the paramilitaries, Rifaat al-Assad was believed to have taken a leading role in the carnage. In a 1989 book, From Beirut to Jerusalem, the journalist Thomas Friedman described how, after initial skirmishes, “Rifaat's tactic shifted from trying to ferret out nests of Muslim Brotherhood men to simply bringing whole neighbourhoods down on their heads and burying the Brotherhood and anyone else in the way.”

Allegations of atrocities against Rifaat al-Assad were widely known by the point Bridges began working as a trustee for his offshore wealth in 1999.

In 2013, Swiss prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into Rifaat al-Assad's role in suppressing the Hama uprising. In 2021 it issued an international arrest warrant for Assad, and in 2024 he was formally charged with war crimes. Assad has always denied these charges. His whereabouts is unknown

Farrer said Assad's trustees, including Bridges, “were provided with credible information, when they were appointed and at different junctures thereafter, which fundamentally contradicted the claims being made in the media about Mr al-Assad”.

The firm added that it and Bridges were restricted by a duty of client confidentiality from revealing what this evidence was, or commenting on whether it was appropriate for the queen's solicitor to also have represented Assad. However, it did share 11 French defamation judgments, dating from the late 1980s and early 1990s, that found in Assad's favour.

The majority related to allegations made in various news outlets that Rifaat al-Assad's wealth was sourced from organised crime. In the case of the two judgments that substantially addressed allegations of human rights abuses, the courts found that the journalists had failed to reflect certain nuances of Amnesty International's report by glossing over uncertainties about whether the Assad regime directly ordered the atrocity.

Public attitudes towards British lawyers acting for foreign politicians with questionable reputations have hardened in recent years.

This month, a taskforce of senior lawyers and civil society experts said law firms must request more “credible explanations” from their clients as to the source of their wealth, and that it was unsustainable to disregard reputational risks to the legal profession.

“Whether the same decision [to act for Assad] would be made today, in the light of further information now available and, arguably, the more stringent demands of the regulatory environment, is a point on which one might speculate,” Farrer said in its response.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday called Harvard a “joke” and said it should lose its government research contracts after the university refused to accept outside political supervision.

Trump's administration also threatened to ban the institute from accepting foreign students unless it bowed to the requirements.

US media reported that officials were considering revoking the university's tax-exempt status.

“Harvard can no longer be considered even a decent place of learning, and should not be considered on any list of the World's Great Universities or Colleges,” Trump said on Truth Social. “Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no longer receive Federal Funds.”

The administration has asked the university to submit to government supervision on admissions, hiring and political slant.

Other institutions, including Columbia University, have bowed to less far-ranging demands from the Trump administration, which says that the educational elite is too left-wing.

Harvard president Alan Garber said that the university refuses to “negotiate over its independence or its constitutional rights.”

Trump this week ordered the freezing of US$2.2 billion in federal funding to Harvard, a global research powerhouse.

He also said on Tuesday that Harvard “should lose its Tax Exempt Status” as a nonprofit educational institution if it did not back down.

CNN and the Washington Post on Wednesday reported that the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was now making plans to do so following a request from Trump.

White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields told reporters by e-mail that “any forthcoming actions by the IRS will be conducted independently of the president.”

Meanwhile, the US Department of Homeland Security said that “if Harvard cannot verify it is in full compliance with its reporting requirements, the university will lose the privilege of enrolling foreign students.”

International students made up 27.2 percent of Harvard's enrollment this academic year, the institution's Web site said.

The payments frozen to Harvard are for government contracts with its leading research programs, mostly in the medical fields where the school's laboratories develop new medicines and treatments.

The White House has said that the action against universities was in response to uncontrolled anti-Semitism and a need to reverse diversity programs aimed at encouraging minorities.

In the case of Harvard, the White House is seeking government control over the inner workings of the university.

In a letter sent to Harvard, the administration's demands included: ending admissions that take into account the student's race or national origins; preventing admission of foreign students “hostile to the American values and institutions”; and ending staff hiring based on race, religion, sex or national origin.

Others were: reducing the power of students in campus governance; auditing students and staff for “viewpoint diversity”; reforming entire programs for “egregious records of anti-Semitism or other bias”; and cracking down on campus protests.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:taipeitimes.com","Telescope spots ‘hints' of life on far-away planet","https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2025/04/18/2003835411","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 16:00:00 GMT","

Astronomers yesterday announced that they had detected the most promising “hints” of potential life on a planet beyond our solar system, although other scientists expressed skepticism.

There has been debate in scientific circles about whether the planet K2-18b, which is 124 light-years away in the Leo constellation, could be an ocean world capable of hosting microbial life.

Using the James Webb Space Telescope, a British-US team of researchers detected signs of two chemicals in the planet's atmosphere long considered to be “biosignatures” indicating extraterrestrial life.

An artist's impression released on Sept. 11, 2019, by the European Space Agency and Hubble depicts the K2-18b exoplanet, right, orbiting its sun.

On Earth, the chemicals dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide are produced only by life, mostly microscopic marine algae called phytoplankton.

The researchers emphasized caution, saying that more observations were needed to confirm the findings and that they were not announcing a definitive discovery.

However, the implications could be huge, said Nikku Madhusudhan, a University of Cambridge astrophysicist and lead author of the study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

“What we are finding at this point are hints of possible biological activity outside the solar system,” Madhusudhan told a news conference. “Frankly, I think this is the closest we have come to seeing a feature that we can attribute to life.”

However, outside experts pointed to disputes over previous discoveries about the exoplanet, adding that the chemicals could have been created by unknown means having nothing to do with life.

More than eight times the mass of Earth and 2.5 times as big, K2-18b is a rare exoplanet that orbits its star in a habitable or “goldilocks” zone.

This means it is neither too hot nor too cold to have liquid water, considered the most important ingredient for life.

Telescopes observe such far-off exoplanets when they cross in front of their star, allowing astronomers to analyze how molecules block the light streaming through their atmosphere.

In 2023, the Webb telescope detected methane and carbon dioxide in K2-18b's atmosphere, the first time such carbon-based molecules were detected on an exoplanet in a habitable zone.

It also detected weak signals of DMS, leading astronomers to turn Webb toward the planet again a year ago, this time using its mid-infrared instrument to detect different wavelengths of light.

They found much stronger signs of the chemicals, although still well below the “five sigma” threshold of statistical significance scientists seek for such discoveries.

Even if the results are confirmed, it would not necessarily mean that the planet is home to life.

Last year, scientists found traces of DMS on a comet, which suggested it can be produced in non-organic ways.

However the concentration of the chemical observed on K2-18b appears to be thousands of times stronger than levels on Earth, strongly suggesting a biological origin, Madhusudhan said.

K2-18b has long been considered the premier candidate for a “hycean planet” — an ocean world bigger than Earth with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

These planets would not be expected to be home to intelligent alien life, but rather tiny microbes.

The executions in three separate provinces brought to 10 the number of men publicly put to death since 2021, according to an Agence France-Presse tally.
Public executions were common during the Taliban's first rule from 1996 to 2001, with most of them carried out publicly in sports stadiums.

With more than 90 percent of the votes counted, the National Election Council said Noboa had an unassailable 12-point lead over his leftist rival Luisa Gonzalez.
Official results showed Noboa with 56 percent of the vote, against Gonzalez's 44 percent — a far bigger winning margin than expected after a virtual tie in the first round.
Speaking to jubilant supporters in his hometown of Olon, the 37-year-old president claimed a “historic victory.”

The European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates yesterday for the seventh time to counter worries about economic growth fueled by US President Donald Trump's tariff onslaught.

The bank's move should support economic activity in the 20 countries that use the euro currency by making credit more affordable for consumers and businesses.

ECB President Christine Lagarde said at a post-decision news conference that “the major escalation in global trade tensions and the associated uncertainty will likely lower euro area growth by dampening exports.”

“And it may drag down investment and consumption,” she said.

The bank's rate-setting council decided at a meeting in Frankfurt to lower its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.25 percent. The bank has been steadily cutting rates after raising them sharply to combat an outbreak of inflation from 2022 to 2023.

Now that inflation has fallen, growth worries have taken center stage. The economy in the 20 countries that use the euro grew a modest 0.2 percent in the final three months of last year. Inflation was 2.2 percent last month, close to the bank's target of 2 percent.

The cut was widely expected by analysts given the sudden shadow cast over the eurozone's growth outlook by Trump's April 2 announcement of unexpectedly high tariffs on goods from other countries starting at 10 percent and ranging as high as 49 percent. The European Union faces a 20 percent tariff.

At the bank's last meeting on March 6, Lagarde had raised the possibility of an upcoming “pause” in the bank's series of rate cuts. But that option was practically eliminated by Trump's announcement.

Trump has suspended the tariffs for 90 days, but the possibility of the 20 percent tariff rate he has proposed for Europe left economists and policymakers concerned that the higher costs will weigh on business activity and lead to slower growth or even a recession if he carries through. 

Earlier yesterday, the Bank of Korea (BOK) held its interest rate steady at 2.75 percent, its third straight decision to keep rates unchanged after a 0.25 percentage point cut in February. 

Given the “significant uncertainty” due to US tariffs and the government's push for economic stimulus, “the board judged it appropriate to keep the base rate unchanged for now while closely assessing changes in domestic and external conditions,” the bank said.

BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong said the decision was driven by tariff-related “uncertainty” going forward, which has grown to an “unprecedented level.” 

“The intensity of US tariff policies and the swift shifts in responses from major economies are evolving so rapidly that it is currently difficult to even establish a baseline scenario for forecasts,” he said at a press conference in Seoul.

Rhee hinted that the board is considering additional cuts next month, but is “closely reviewing both domestic and external economic conditions.”

The country's annual economic growth is expected to fall short of a recent forecast due to sweeping US tariffs and the fallout from the ex-president's martial law declaration, he said.

“This year's annual growth rate is now expected to fall short of the 1.5 percent forecast made in February,” Rhee said.

Sweden is getting up a head of steam for what could be a record number of Eurovision wins this year with a humorous sauna act.

KAJ, a comedy group more accustomed to playing birthday parties than large arena shows, is already the bookies' favorite to triumph at the extravaganza in Basel, Switzerland, on May 17.

With their song Bara Bada Bastu (Just Have a Sauna), the Finnish trio pay homage to sauna culture, clad in brown suits and accompanied by an accordion in a wink to Finland's other big cultural phenomenon, the tango.

Dancers in lumberjack shirts grill sausages over a bonfire before appearing in a sauna with towels around their waists, slapping their backs with birch branches.

“We're gonna have a sauna, sauna, steam up and let go of the stress of the day,” they sing repeatedly in Swedish, in a catchy chorus that sticks to the brain like chewing gum to the sole of a shoe.

“The melody works internationally. Even I am able to hum the chorus, and I absolutely do not speak the language,” said Fabien Randanne, a French Eurovision expert and journalist.

The Swedish public chose the song at its annual Melodifestivalen contest — a national institution broadcast five Saturday evenings in a row that attracts millions of viewers.

KAJ's victory stunned the nation that brought us Abba and two-time winner Loreen, beating out 2015 Eurovision victor and pop heartthrob Mans Zelmerlow, who was broadly seen as the favorite.

“Sweden has usually competed with very slick numbers. Now I have the feeling that the public is a little more open to originality, to something unique,” Randanne said.

Melodifestivalen producer Karin Gunnarsson approached KAJ and asked them to send in a demo for the Swedish contest, said Swedish songwriter Anderz Wrethov, a Eurovision veteran who cowrote and coproduced KAJ's song.

Founded in 2009, KAJ is made up of Kevin Holmstrom, Axel Ahman and Jakob Norrgard, its name formed by their first initials.

Until now they had a niche but steady following in Finland, primarily in the small Swedish-speaking community to which they belong.

Their song was one of 30 selected by Swedish broadcaster SVT — out of almost 2,800 entries — to compete in Melodifestivalen, ultimately winning the contest with 4.3 million votes.

“We've seen all these very polished artists, but underneath it all, the kind of music KAJ makes is very typical of Swedish schlager [popular hits],” said Andreas Onnerfors, professor of intellectual history at Linnaeus University in Sweden.

Randanne said that while it was hard to explain KAJ's success, Swedes “voted with their hearts.”

“In the current context, we all need to destress ... but the vote also just shows what people find entertaining,” Onnerfors added.

He said it was also important to understand the song's popularity in the broader context of Eurovision, a contest created to unite Europeans across borders.

“Eurovision is like a bonfire around which we gather... It doesn't have to be very serious, it can also be eccentric,” he said.

Onnerfors said countries reveal their true selves through their cultural stereotypes — in the case of KAJ, poking fun at the way Swedes view Finns and their sauna culture.

Does KAJ have what it takes to claim Sweden's eighth Eurovision victory in Basel? Onnerfors does not dare make any predictions.

Randanne said he expects them to place well thanks to the tune's catchy melody.

“Eurovision is usually a little more open-minded than Sweden,” Wrethov said.

The Associated Press

10:34 JST, April 17, 2025

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday inserted himself directly into trade talks with Japanese officials, a sign of the high stakes for the United States after its tariffs rattled the economy and caused the administration to assure the public that it would quickly reach deals.

The Republican president attended the meeting alongside Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, top economic advisers with a central role in his trade and tariff policies.

“Hopefully something can be worked out which is good (GREAT!) for Japan and the USA!” Trump wrote in a social media post ahead of the meeting.

Afterward, he posted: “A Great Honor to have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!”

The president's choice to get directly involved in negotiations points to his desire to quickly finalize a slew of trade deals as China is pursuing its own set of agreements. It's an open test of Trump's reputation as a dealmaker as countries around the world seek to limit the potential damage unleashed by his import taxes.

The sweeping tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 triggered panic in the financial markets and generated recession fears, causing the U.S. president to quickly put a partial 90-day hold on the import taxes and increase his already steep tariffs against China to as much as 145%.

The pause temporarily spared Japan from 24% across-the-board tariffs, but there continues to be a 10% baseline tariff and a 25% tax on imported cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports.

With Japan charging an average tax rate of 1.9% on other countries' goods and having a longstanding alliance with the U.S., the talks on Wednesday are a crucial indicator of whether the Trump administration can achieve a meaningful deal that reassures the markets, American voters and foreign allies.

U.S. economic rival China, meanwhile, is trying to capitalize on the turmoil around Trump's announcements, with its leader, President Xi Jinping, touring nations of Southeast Asia and promoting his country as a more reliable trade partner.

Japan is among the first countries to start open negotiations with the U.S. Trump and other administration officials have said the phones have been “ringing off the hook” with dozens of countries calling, eager to strike deals with a president who views himself as a master negotiator to avoid tariffs when the 90-day pause ends. Israel and Vietnam have offered to zero out their tariff rates, but Trump has been noncommittal as to whether that would be sufficient.

On Thursday, Trump is scheduled to meet with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who will likely be carrying messages on behalf of the European Union about how to resolve the tariffs Trump placed on the 27-state group.

Still, the U.S. president may also be feeling increased domestic pressures to settle any tariffs as many voters say they returned Trump to the White House with the specific goal of improving the economy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom filed a lawsuit Wednesday that argues that Trump overstepped his authority by declaring an economic emergency to levy his tariffs, with the Democrat saying in a statement that the tariffs have caused economic chaos.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that Trump's tariff policies would hurt the U.S. economy, a direct warning to a White House trying to sell the import taxes as a long-term positive for the country.

“The level of tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated, and the same is likely to be true of the economic effects which will include higher inflation and slower growth,” Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago.

Japan, like many other nations trying to minimize the possible economic fallout from Trump's tariffs, has been scrambling to respond. It has set up a special task force to assess the impact of the tariffs and offer loans to anxious companies.

Although Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has been working hard to coax exemptions out of Trump, the government has said little officially on what concessions it might offer during these talks.

Nor has the administration been transparent about its asks. The Trump administration is seeking to close the $68.5 billion trade deficit with Japan and seeking greater access for U.S. goods in foreign markets, yet the president has also insisted that tariff revenues can be used to pay down the federal budget deficit.

“Japan is coming in today to negotiate Tariffs, the cost of military support, and ‘TRADE FAIRNESS,'” Trump posted on Wednesday.

U.S. officials met in Washington with Japan's chief trade negotiator, Economic Revitalization Minister Ryosei Akazawa.

“I am prepared for the talks,” Akazawa told reporters at Tokyo's Haneda Airport before boarding his flight. “I will negotiate in order to firmly protect our national interest.”

He said that both Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are “known to be pro-Japan and professionally talented” and that he hopes to build a relationship of trust with them.

“I believe we can have good talks toward a win-win relationship that will serve national interest for both Japan and the United States,” he said.

Japan has contended that Trump's tariff measures are likely to violate bilateral trade agreements or World Trade Organization rules. While Ishiba has said he opposes retaliatory tariffs, he also has said he is in no rush to push for a settlement because he doesn't want concessions.

Xi, meanwhile, stopped in Malaysia on Wednesday and told its leader that China will be a collaborative partner and stand with its Southeast Asian neighbors after the global economic shocks.

Xi is touring Vietnam, Malaysia and Cambodia this week on a trip that likely was planned before the tariffs' uncertainty but that he's also using to promote Beijing as a source of stability in the region and shore up relationships in that part of the world as he looks for ways to mitigate the 145% tariffs that Trump is keeping on China.

“In the face of shocks to global order and economic globalization, China and Malaysia will stand with countries in the region to combat the undercurrents of geopolitical … confrontation, as well as the counter-currents of unilateralism and protectionism,” Xi said in remarks at a dinner with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

“Together, we will safeguard the bright prospects of our Asian family,” he added.

Xi has promised Malaysia and Vietnam greater access to Chinese markets on his visits, although few details were shared.

In Washington, Trump has indicated that he also wants to discuss how much the Japanese contribute to the cost of U.S. troops stationed there, largely as a deterrent to China.

Trump's demand for more defense spending concerns the Japanese government.

Under its national security strategy, Japan aims to double annual defense spending to nearly $10 trillion, or 2% of GDP, in 2027, while there is a concern that Trump may ask for that to be increased to 3% of GDP. Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani said Tuesday that the military budget for this year is about 1.8% of Japan's GDP.

Russian President Vladimir Putin may attempt to seize NATO territory and trigger a global conflict if not stopped in Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky warned in an April 13 interview with CBS News.

""If we do not stand firm, he will advance further,"" Zelensky said, calling the threat ""real."" 

The Ukrainian president warned that Putin's long-term objective is to restore a Russian empire that would include parts of NATO member states. 

""Considering all of this, I believe it could escalate into a world war,"" he said.

Zelensky previously raised alarm at the Munich Security Conference in February, saying Russian troop buildup in Belarus could be aimed not only at Ukraine but also at Poland or the Baltic states. 

According to Ukrainian estimates, Russia is preparing to field 15 divisions — up to 150,000 troops — in the region.

NATO leaders have echoed the warnings. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Feb. 12 that any Russian attack on NATO would be met with a ""devastating"" response. 

""If Putin attacks NATO, the reaction will be devastating. He will lose,"" Rutte said.

U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, has sought to keep diplomatic channels open with Russia, claiming in a March 23 Fox News interview that Putin ""wants peace."" 

When asked about Putin's territorial ambitions beyond Ukraine, Witkoff responded: ""I simply have said that I just don't see that he wants to take all of Europe.""

Zelensky's warnings come as Russia continues to reject U.S.-proposed ceasefire terms and steps up its offensive across Ukraine. 

Tensions between NATO and Russia have risen following Moscow's all-out attack against Ukraine. Western leaders and intelligence agencies have warned of a potential large-scale war in Europe within the next five years, citing Russia's increasingly aggressive posture.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

The U.K. transferred 752 million pounds ($990 million) to Ukraine on April 14 under a G7 loan covered by Russian assets to buy air defense and artillery, the British government announced.

The U.K. has pledged to lend Ukraine 2.26 billion pounds ($2.9 billion) in three equal installments as part of the G7's Extraordinary Revenue Acceleration scheme, worth $50 billion in total.

This installment is the second one. Ukraine received the first part of the loan from the U.K. on March 6, 2025. The final part will be paid in 2026.

""The world is changing before our eyes, reshaped by global instability, including Russian aggression in Ukraine,"" British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves said.

At the onset of the full-scale war in 2022, the G7 countries immobilized some $300 billion in Russian sovereign assets. The $50 billion loan, shouldered mainly by the U.S. and the EU, will be funneled to Ukraine's defense needs and recovery and repaid by proceeds from the frozen assets.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Ukrainian forces have liberated approximately 16 square kilometers of territory near Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast in recent weeks, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi said on April 17.

There has been a notable slowdown in Russia's offensive operations after months of steady territorial gains across eastern Ukraine. According to battlefield monitoring group DeepState, Russian troops have captured just 133 square kilometers in March, the lowest monthly total since June 2024.

The recently recaptured territory by Ukrainian troops includes areas near the settlements of Udachne, Kotlyne, and Shevchenko, according to Syrskyi. He made the announcement after a three-day visit to the Operational-Tactical Group Donetsk, which he described as the strongest formation within the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

""Over the course of three days, I visited almost all brigades of this most powerful grouping of the Ukrainian Defense Forces, which bears the brunt of the enemy's spring offensive and destroys its best forces and means,"" Syrskyi said.

According to Syrskyi, Ukrainian forces are halting around 30 Russian assaults daily in the Pokrovsk sector in Donetsk Oblast, inflicting significant losses on Russian troops.

During his visit, Syrskyi met with commanders at front-line command posts and reviewed operational plans with Brigadier General Oleksandr Tarnavskyi, commander of the operational-tactical group. He said that on-site problems related to logistics, ammunition supply, and combat organization were being addressed.

Despite continued Russian efforts to push Ukrainian troops out of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and reach the administrative borders of these regions, Syrskyi said those objectives remain unfulfilled.

""We continue our defensive operation, carry out counteroffensive actions, and are achieving certain successes,"" Syrskyi said.

As of late 2024, Russian forces controlled around 60% of Donetsk Oblast and approximately 98.5% of Luhansk Oblast.

Moscow does not fully control any of the four Ukrainian regions – Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson – that it illegally claimed to annex in 2022. According to media reports, including from The Moscow Times, Russia is seeking full control over these regions in the negotiations on ending the war with the United States, which started in March 2025.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

The Power Within: The Kyiv Independent's first-ever magazine. Be among the first to get it.

U.S. President Donald Trump's White House is proposing dramatic cuts to the U.S. State Department's budget, including halting nearly all of the department's funding to NATO, the U.N., and over 20 other international organizations, the Washington Post reported on April 14, citing an internal draft document.

The proposed cuts for the next fiscal year would reportedly leave $28.4 billion for all State Department activities, a 48% reduction from the 2025 budget approved by Congress.

The plan would preserve only minimal support for a handful of agencies, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the International Civil Aviation Organization. 

According to Politico, funding for ""contributions to international organizations,"" presumably including U.N. institutions, would be slashed from $1.5 billion to $169 million.

Although the proposal would require congressional approval, the cuts align with broader White House efforts to slash federal spending. 

On March 10, the Trump administration announced the termination of 83% of the foreign aid contracts of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).

The cuts have broad implications for humanitarian efforts, particularly in Ukraine, where USAID has provided $2.6 billion in humanitarian aid, $5 billion in development assistance, and over $30 billion in direct budget support since Russia's full-scale invasion began.

Trump has long expressed hostility toward NATO, repeatedly accusing European allies of underfunding the alliance and threatening to allow Russia to attack non-compliant members. 

The proposal to eliminate NATO funding appears to escalate that stance into formal policy.

Before being appointed under Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio had consistently defended NATO. In 2023, Rubio co-sponsored bipartisan legislation requiring congressional approval before any president could unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from the alliance.

Some members of Trump's circle, including billionaire and advisor Elon Musk, called for the U.S. to exit NATO, and the U.S. is broadly expected to withdraw some troops from the alliance's eastern flank.

As Europe faces growing Russian aggression and war rages in Ukraine, the proposed withdrawal of U.S. support for NATO and the U.N. could drastically reshape the West's security architecture and strain Washington's credibility as a global leader.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

John Turley-Ewart is a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail, a regulatory compliance consultant and a Canadian banking historian.

Good news for Canadian bankers: Ottawa's reported interest in meeting with officials from the largest U.S. banks operating in Canada may signal a regulatory review process that will reduce compliance costs, unnecessary rules and make our banks more competitive in the U.S. and globally.

The initial Bloomberg report framed the proposed meeting between Department of Finance officials and U.S. bank representatives as a response to President Donald Trump's make-believe world where American bankers can't do business in Canada.

Finance and U.S. banks operating here have nothing to gain from sifting through the ill-informed musings the 47th president of the United States had on Canadian banking. U.S. banks are not disadvantaged by Canadian regulations.

Instead, Canadian officials should be eager to quiz U.S. bank executives on changes to American bank regulation that will drive a wedge between Canadian and U.S. bank supervision – changes that will disadvantage our banks if Finance does not take steps to level the playing field.

The most obvious divergence is on Basel III, the 2017 international regulatory reforms that Canada began implementing in the belief that the U.S. would, too – thinking which has proven credulous. Basel III is DOA in the United States. But in Canada banks face increased capital charges (higher operating costs) and endure punitive taxes over and above the usual corporate tax rate.

The differences are likely to grow.

Consider efforts to install Michelle Bowman as the new top bank regulator at the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. Ms. Bowman is a seven-year veteran of the Fed who was nominated by Mr. Trump. In her recent testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Ms. Bowman's agenda was clear: “The U.S. regulatory framework has grown expansively to become overly complicated and redundant, with conflicting and overlapping requirements. This growth has imposed unnecessary and significant costs on banks and their customers.”

Ms. Bowman's agenda is being reiterated by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. He told a meeting of the American Bankers Association last week that the Treasury Department will play a larger role in bank supervision to ensure cost-cutting, support for economic growth and to bring greater public transparency to bank oversight. “Regulation through supervision has too often taken place behind a veil of secrecy that precludes scrutiny by the public and their elected officials.”

This is not a Trumpian exercise in presidential fiat. Demands for bank regulatory reform, from large and small U.S. banks alike, have been bubbling on the political surface for years and the outcome is here – the U.S. is about to embark on a large-scale and material streamlining of its bank regulatory system to reduce compliance costs for American banks.

Reform is needed in Canada as well, to sustain competitiveness and to better serve the public. New U.S. supervisory initiatives make those changes imperative.

Last year, the C.D. Howe Institute conducted a rigorous review of Canadian bank regulation and concluded that The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions' (OSFI) approach to rule-making is reactive and is motivated by an almost exclusive focus on “stability and consumer protection” without any effort to connect that to “innovation and competition.” As such, thorough cost-benefit assessments are not the norm when they should be, leaving banks to pay a high price for unnecessary and excessive rules.

Growing redundancies are examples of excessive rules. Bank supervision is shared between OSFI, Canada's primary prudential supervisor, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), the agency that combats money laundering and terrorist financing, and the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC), which advocates for consumers' interests.

Today, both FINTRAC and OSFI oversee anti-money laundering (AML) frameworks at Canadian banks, which is costly and less effective than leaving OSFI that duty and FINTRAC to devote all its resources to investigations, prosecutions and overseeing nonbank businesses.

While U.S. lawmakers complain about insufficient transparency, compared with Canada, bank regulation in America operates in the bright light of day. Canada's Bank Act prevents OSFI from discussing all supervisory findings and remediation programs imposed on banks found non-compliant with rules. This put OSFI in an invidious spot last October when TD Bank's U.S. AML problems were fully revealed. OSFI could say little, forcing Canadians to depend on U.S. regulators and the Department of Justice to tell them what went wrong and how it was being addressed.

Regulating banks helps ensure stability, but how supervisors do it matters. Canada now has good reason to do better.

Toronto Raptors President Masai Ujiri speaks to members of the media in Toronto, on July 8, 2024.Christopher Katsarov/The Canadian Press

Like a sporty Jacques Derrida, Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri operates in terms of text vs. subtext.

This is why some of his former players and coaches leave unhappy. They were listening to what Ujiri said, but not paying attention to what he meant.

There isn't much to discuss in either sense about the Raptors season just ended. At first the team was bad, but not in a fun way. Then they were better, but that wasn't much fun either. They made a notable trade for Brandon Ingram, but he showed up hurt and never got better.

Unless the draft lottery goes their way (they have a 7.5 per cent chance at landing the top pick), the 2024-25 campaign was the pause that doesn't refresh. They'll try to be better next year. Failing that, better at being worse.

On Wednesday, Ujiri was the last man to speak on behalf of the team before their break begins. These confabs are enjoyable because Ujiri wears the armour of a championship. That gives him a lifetime exemption from the usual mode of Toronto sports talk – dissembling, with a side plate of begging.

At the season's wake, Ujiri judged the results (“it's been a tough couple of years”), the chemistry (“A+”) and the goal going forward (another title, but “when that comes, we don't know”). What else can he say? Sadly, no one offered him Luka Doncic in exchange for a bag of magic beans.

The little thing that struck you was the repeated use of the word “unique.” Ujiri applied it in several contexts, but mostly in terms of the city in relation to the NBA's global aspirations. If you listened very carefully with your Canadian ears, you could hear a dog whistle.

Not so long ago, this league was the resistance HQ to Trump presidency 1.0. If there is any opposition this time around, it's gone underground. The likes of LeBron James, once so anxious to talk politics, are sticking to game talk in their old age.

That puts Ujiri, one of sports' pre-eminent immigrants, in a weird position. He has his opinions, but it's not his place to be out ahead of the talent or his employers. Unlike others, his position has been consistent in that regard.

So what does “unique” mean to you in this sentence, after a question about Canadian-American relations?

“The NBA is going to Europe, no? There's something unique about this market. We're going to be at the forefront of what basketball is,” Ujiri said. “We are the only team that's outside the United States in the NBA, and I believe it's a unique opportunity that's going to be an incredibly unique opportunity in the years to come.”

He leaned really hard into the word “incredibly.”

Europe doesn't really belong in that thought, but he foregrounded it. Why? At a guess, because as basketball becomes more global, America is becoming more provincial. Europe isn't just the counterpoint to that policy. They're also producing the highest quality players in the world.

Is it unimaginable that at some point, the current U.S. regime might start banning athletes from countries it dislikes (which seems to be all of them, minus Russia) or ones who say the wrong thing? I would call it more than imaginable. I would call it well within the realm of possibility.

What happens in a world where everybody wants to play in the NBA, but not everybody can get into America, or wants to?

Asked to focus in on that idea, Ujiri grew more gnomish.

“I think the unique flow of players, the pool of players, is going to be more widespread,” Ujiri said. “I think streaming and media opportunities are going to be even bigger in terms of how people view the game, and really see the game. I mean, international players.”

Was he suggesting that in the near future, non-American players might prefer Canada to the United States?

“I don't know,” Ujiri said. “I think the international stage is just going to be bigger.”

Of course, this could mean anything. But when Ujiri talks, he isn't just stringing clichés together. Everything he says means something. When he says “I don't know,” it usually means he knows.

The NHL and MLB each feature players from fewer than 20 different countries. The NBA has 43 nationalities represented. That number will grow now that teenagers are being paid to play in U.S. colleges. Who would stay home if they could move abroad and get rich studying?

American athletes famously resent keeping track of their passports. Someone like Doncic – a guy who turned pro when most kids are in Grade 11 – speaks four languages. It's the same planet, but different worlds. If Ujiri's right, and the NBA expands to Europe, one could imagine a bifurcated league in every sense.

Picture one where Americans play in America, while the rest of the world plays in Europe. The two polarities meet in the playoffs and the NBA Cup. It's a hybrid of every apex league – a little NFL, a little Premier League, a little Champions League.

It allows the world access to a global game, and lets America play with itself.

Even if that never happens, very recent history suggests that fewer and fewer Africans, Asians and Europeans are going to feel welcome and secure in America. The players won't get hassled because they're players, but they all have relatives who might find themselves on the wrong end of a random ID check.

Wouldn't it be nice to get a piece of the American pie, but not have to run any of those risks while living in a country that doesn't view every outsider as a potential thief?

That would put the Toronto Raptors in the most advantageous spot of any sports franchise in the world, at least for a little while.

I wouldn't bet the future of a multibillion-dollar sports business on any of this coming to pass. But in terms of potential, I would call it a unique opportunity. Maybe even an incredibly unique opportunity.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei speaks during a meeting with government officials in Tehran, Iran, on April 15.Office of the Iranian Supreme Le/Reuters

Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei sent his foreign minister to Moscow on Thursday with a letter for President Vladimir Putin to brief the Kremlin about nuclear negotiations with the U.S., which has threatened to bomb the Islamic Republic.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened Iran with bombing and to extend tariffs to third countries that buy Iranian oil if Tehran does not come to an agreement with Washington over its disputed nuclear program. The United States has moved additional warplanes into the region.

The Trump administration and Iran held talks in Oman last weekend that both sides described as positive and constructive. Ahead of a second round of talks set to take place in Rome this weekend, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Wednesday that Iran's right to enrich uranium is not negotiable.

Russia, a longstanding ally of Tehran, plays a role in Iran's nuclear negotiations with the West as a veto-wielding U.N. Security Council member and a signatory to an earlier nuclear deal Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.

“Regarding the nuclear issue, we always had close consultations with our friends China and Russia. Now it is a good opportunity to do so with Russian officials,” Araqchi told Iranian state TV.

He said he was conveying a letter to Putin that addressed regional and bilateral issues. Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, said Putin would receive Araqchi.

Western powers say Iran is refining uranium to a high degree of fissile purity beyond what is justifiable for a civilian nuclear energy programme and close to the level suitable for an atomic bomb. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says it has a right to a civilian nuclear programme.

Moscow has bought weapons from Iran for the war in Ukraine and signed a 20-year strategic partnership deal with Tehran earlier this year, although it did not include a mutual defence clause. The two countries were battlefield allies in Syria for years until their ally Bashar al-Assad was toppled in December.

Russia's foreign ministry said talks with Iran would focus on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the world powers' 2015 nuclear treaty with Iran from which the United States withdrew during Trump's first presidency.

“We intend to further expand mutually beneficial relations with Iran in the interests of regional stability and international security,” the ministry said.

Putin has kept on good terms with Khamenei as both Russia and Iran are cast as enemies by the West, but Moscow is keen not to trigger a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.

Russia has said that any military strike against Iran would be illegal and unacceptable. On Tuesday, the Kremlin declined to comment when asked if Russia was ready to take control of Iran's stocks of enriched uranium as part of a possible future nuclear deal between Iran and the United States.

A teenager in eastern Germany is accused of producing the deadly biological warfare agent ricin in his family's attic. Police said the suspect remains at large.

Police in Germany searched the home of a 16-year-old in the eastern state of Saxony on Thursday on suspicion of possessing the highly toxic biological warfare agent ricin.

The teenager is alleged to have manufactured and stored several vials of a mixture of the plant toxins ricin and aconitine in a specially equipped laboratory in the attic of his family's house.

The Saxony State Office of Criminal Investigation and the Dresden Public Prosecutor's Office said proceedings were underway into a suspected offense under the Weapons of War Act.

Investigations to date have not revealed any indications as to the purpose for which the suspect was manufacturing the substances.

Police said they were sifting through the ""purpose-built laboratory,"" seeking ""to seize all toxic substances and other evidence.""

Experts from Germany's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), were also at the scene.

The emergency services cordoned off a large area of ​​the premises, and all access roads were also closed. The 16-year-old was said to be at large.

Prosecutors said no arrest warrant had been issued and that the boy currently had no criminal record. As a result, there were no reasons requiring his detention, they said. It was unclear if the teen's parents had any knowledge of his alleged activities.

In January 2023, authorities arrested a 32-year-old Iranian man and his 25-year-old brother in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia on suspicion of planning an Islamist-motivated chemical attack using ricin and cyanide.

In 2018, an Islamist couple in Germany was convicted for plotting a ricin bomb attack using castor seeds, explosives, and ball bearings.

Ricin is one of the deadliest plant-based toxins known to science and is classified as a biological weapon under Germany's Weapons of War Act. 

The substance is extracted from the seeds of the castor oil plant. While all parts of the plant are toxic, this is particularly true of the bean-shaped seeds.

It is lethal in minute doses when swallowed, inhaled or injected, being 6,000 times more potent than cyanide, with no known antidote.

Aconitine is among the fastest-acting and lethal natural poisons affecting the heart. The alkaloid is contained in the aconite plant, also known as wolf's bane, and monkhood.

Around 2 to 6 milligrams of pure aconitine can be fatal for adults, according to the RKI.

A plane carrying scores of Afghan nationals deemed at risk of persecution by the Taliban has prompted a political wrangle in Germany, where an incoming government promises a tougher stance on migration.

Germany's migration debate flared on Thursday as a flight of 138 people who fled Afghanistan and are classified as vulnerable landed in Germany.

Chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) accused the outgoing coalition of rushing through so-called admission flights ahead of a change of government and fueling support for the far right.

But authorities pointed out that those on the flight had previously been cleared to enter the country, and advocates stressed Berlin's humanitarian obligations toward those were now in danger in Afghanistan because they had worked for the German military or other German institutions before the Taliban's takeover of Kabul.

German Interior Ministry figures showed that 45 of those on board the flight were children and young people, and of the remaining adults 76 were female and 62 were male.

The Foreign Office said the passengers were people from various programs who had received a legally binding admission promise.

The plane, chartered by the federal government, took off from the Pakistani capital, Islamabad.

""In these cases, there are concrete, past admission promises from Germany,"" emphasizes a spokesman for the Interior Ministry. No new promises would be made.

The spokesman emphasized that security was the top priority for such admissions and that each individual would be screened accordingly before possible entry.

Three flights landed in Germany in February and March. Several similar flights had previously taken place this year, bringing a total of 461 people from Afghanistan. Planes landed in Berlin on February 25 and March 5, and one landed in Hanover on March 27.

Those arriving include the former staff of German institutions in Afghanistan and their relatives, as well as Afghans at risk of persecution by the Taliban. Some, for example, had previously campaigned for human rights as lawyers or journalists.

According to the Federal Foreign Office, around 2,600 particularly vulnerable people from Afghanistan are currently waiting in Pakistan to be admitted to Germany.

An end to such flights is envisaged in a new coalition package agreed by the conservative CDU/CSU bloc and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD).

""We will end voluntary federal admission programs as far as possible and not launch any new programs,"" said CDU domestic affairs expert Alexander Throm, pointing out the agreement details.

Acting Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, a Green politician, was taking preemptive action before the new federal government took office, he told German broadcaster ARD.

Jens Spahn, deputy chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group told the broadcaster ZDF that the flights would whip up support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD).

""Every plane from Afghanistan is a stronger AfD support program than any chairmanship of any committee could be,"" he said, referring to the AfD's exclusion from parliamentary committee chairmanships.

Former Bundestag President Bärbel Bas (SPD) did not rule out the possibility of Germany accepting more people from Afghanistan after the change of power, referring to legal issues and possible agreements with allies.

She added that helping those who have put their necks on the line for Germany was right, referring to the former local staff.

Green Party politician Konstantin von Notz defended the flights. ""We are talking about people who have undergone extremely intensive security checks by several German authorities. They have a legally binding acceptance agreement from Germany,"" he told the Redaktionsnetzwerk Deutschland.

To stifle the program, he said, would mean ""knowingly breaking commitments and throwing humanity overboard.""

""Such Trumpism must have no place in Germany,"" said von Notz, alluding to the policies of US President Donald Trump.

The CDU's Merz has promised to crack down on irregular arrivals and ramp up deportations after the AfD parties rode a wave of anti-migrant sentiment in February's general election to emerge as the second-largest party in parliament.

Scientists urged caution against raising hopes about the existence of actual living organisms beyond Earth, but said they have uncovered possibly the strongest signs yet that point to possible life on an exoplanet.

A team of scientists said Wednesday they have found the strongest signs yet of possible life on a massive planet beyond our solar system. 

""What we are finding at this point are hints of possible biological activity outside the solar system,"" said Nikku Madhusudhan, an astrophysicist at Cambridge University.

Madhusudhan told a press conference that detecting chemical fingerprints of gases, which on Earth are produced only by biological processes, was the first hint of a potentially inhabited alien world

""This is a revolutionary moment,"" he told reporters at a press conference to mark a potentially life-changing discovery using the James Webb Space Telescope.

The team was also quick to urge caution, saying that they were not announcing the discovery of actual living organisms and more observations were needed to determine exactly what they were seeing.

The study, which was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters, said researchers instead discovered a possible biosignature or an indicator of a biological process on a planet that orbits a star 120 light-years from Earth. 

This potential evidence of microbial life is on a planet named K2-18 b, which is about 8.6 times as massive as Earth and has a diameter about 2.6 times as large as our planet.

The planet lies 120 light-years away and scientists have previously revealed the presence of carbon-bearing molecules including methane and carbon dioxide (carbon-based molecules are the building blocks of life) on the exoplanet, which means a planet that orbits stars outside of our solar system.

Previous studies have suggested that K2-18 b could be a Hycean exoplanet, one that has the potential to possess a hydrogen-rich atmosphere and a water ocean-covered surface.

Christopher Glein, the principal scientist at the Space Science Division of the Southwest Research Institute in Texas, describes K2-18 b as ""a tantalizing world"" but warns that the scientific community ought to be ""careful to test the data as thoroughly as possible.""

Sara Seager, a professor of planetary science at MIT, urges patience, pointing to an instance when earlier claims of water vapor in K2-18 b's atmosphere turned out to be a different gas.

Slovakian lawmakers approved a law that imposes new regulations on non-governmental groups that campaigners say deal a severe blow to civic society in the European Union member country.

Slovakian lawmakers passed a law on Wednesday requiring non-governmental organizations to disclose their funding sources and the names of major contributors.

The law introduces fines for those who fail to comply.

While populist Prime Minister Robert Fico presented the legislation as a move toward greater transparency, critics accused the law of restricting civil society institutions.

There were nationwide protests against the law earlier this month, with the government eventually scaling back some measures. 

Two weeks ago, thousands of demonstrators rallied against the measure in the capital, Bratislava, and other cities.

Opposition groups say the law they dubbed the ""Russian law"" could be used to silence critics.

""We call it a Russian law not because it is a copy of the Russian one but it was inspired by Russia and in variety with the constitution and EU law,"" said Katarina Batkova, director of Via Iuris, one of the oldest civil society organizations in the country.

Before the final vote, the government removed some of the more controversial proposals included in the bill, including a provision to label NGOs as ""lobbyist groups"" and ""foreign agents"" following criticism from the European Commission.

""This law is neither Russian nor American, but clearly European,"" Fico later said during a parliamentary debate.

A similar bill was passed last year by Georgian lawmakers and the move saw protests take place both before and after the passage of the bill.

There too, critics drew parallels to the Russian law that has been in force since 2012 and that has been used by the Kremlin to clamp down on dissidents.

Since December, the Slovak government has seen numerous waves of protests because of its Russia-friendly politics.

Unless vetoed by newly elected President Peter Pellegrini, the law is expected to take effect on June 1.

A man mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison was not an “upstanding Maryland” resident but a wife abuser, a US government department has claimed.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported by Donald Trump's administration in error, had a history of violence and was handed a restraining order against his wife Jennifer Vasquez in 2021, the Department of Homeland Security said on Wednesday.

Ms Vasquez, who is campaigning for Mr Garcia's return and has described him as an “excellent father”, previously told law enforcement he punched, scratched and ripped off her shirt, according to court documents published on Tuesday.

Per the court documents, Mr Abrego Garcia, who entered the US illegally 14 years ago, was ordered to vacate the family home in Maryland and not to contact Ms Vasquez as part of the temporary protective order.

In a statement to Newsweek, Ms Vasquez described her husband's deportation as an abduction and said she had sought the restraining order “out of caution” because of her previous experience with domestic violence.

“After surviving domestic violence in a previous relationship, I acted out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar by seeking a civil protective order in case things escalated,” Ms Vasquez said. 

“Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counselling. Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed.” 

Ms Vasquez noted that the incident was “not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him” and said she would “continue to stand by him and demand justice for him”.

“No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect. That is not a justification for ICE's action of abducting him and deporting him to a country where he was supposed to be protected from deportation. Kilmar has always been a loving partner and father, and I will continue to stand by him and demand justice for him.”

The 29-year-old remains imprisoned in a notorious jail in his native country despite a US federal judge's order backed by the Supreme Court for his return to the United States.

He was protected by a 2019 court order determining that he could not be deported to El Salvador, but he was sent there around a month ago.

The administration has since admitted the mistake and has been ordered by the Supreme Court to “facilitate” the 29-year-old's return.

However it has maintained that Mr Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 criminal gang. The White House insists it has no plans to return Mr Abrego Garcia to the US.

“Deporting him back to El Salvador was always going to be the end result. There is never going to be a world in which this is an individual who is going to live a peaceful life in Maryland,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday.

Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland senator, said authorities in El Salvador had denied him access to Mr Abrego Garcia while on a visit to the country.

The Democrat arrived in the Central American nation on Wednesday and said he would seek to meet with senior Salvadoran officials to secure Mr Abrego Garcia's release.

He later said Felix Ulloa, the country's vice president, told him he could not authorise a visit or a call with Mr Abrego Garcia.

Mr Van Hollen, who is a member of the US Senate foreign relations committee, said Mr Ulloa told him Mr Abrego Garcia would not be released because the US was paying El Salvador to keep him incarcerated.

“Why should the government of the United States pay the government of El Salvador to lock up a man who was illegally abducted from the United States and committed no crime?” Mr Van Hollen said.

In a meeting with Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, Nayib Bukele, El Salvador's president, said he had no plans to return Mr Abrego Garcia.

Patty Morin, whose daughter Rachel was killed in 2023 by an illegal immigrant while exercising on a popular hiking trail north-east of Baltimore, criticised Mr Van Hollen for trying to visit Mr Abrego Garcia.

Victor Martinez-Hernandez was convicted of raping and killing Rachel and concealing her body in a drainage culvert on Monday.

“To have a senator from Maryland who didn't even acknowledge, or barely acknowledged my daughter and the brutal death that she endured, leaving her five children without a mother, and now a grandbaby without a grandmother... so that he can use my taxpayer money to fly to El Salvador to bring back someone that's not even an American citizen,” Ms Morin said on Wednesday.

“Why does that person have more rights than I do, or my daughter, or my grandchildren. I don't understand this.”

Mr Trump's administration has deported hundreds of people who it claims are gang members to El Salvador.

On Wednesday, a federal judge said officials in the administration could face criminal prosecution for contempt of court for violating his order halting deportations of Venezuelan migrants under a wartime law evoked by the president.

Mr Abrego Garcia left El Salvador at age 16 to escape gang-related violence before entering the US illegally, his lawyers have claimed.

While in the US he worked in construction and got married. He had been raising three children with disabilities before his deportation, according to court records.

Mr Abrego Garcia has never been charged with or convicted of any crime, his lawyers say. They have denied the allegations that he is a member of the criminal gang MS-13.

Trump administration officials said the 29-year-old was deported last month based on a 2019 accusation from local police in Maryland that he was an MS-13 gang member.

Later in 2019, an immigration judge shielded Mr Abrego Garcia from deportation to El Salvador because he likely faced persecution there by local gangs that had terrorised his family.

The Trump administration ploughed ahead with the deportation, later describing the mistake as “an administrative error”.","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"

			Department of Homeland Security chief faces fierce criticism for ‘glamourising' her work

When Kristi Noem sported yet another bullet-proof ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) vest last week, her brunette hair extensions tumbling over her shoulders while her neatly manicured fingernails wrapped around the barrel of an assault rifle, one staunchly pro-Trump broadcaster had had enough.

“Stop trying to glamourise the mission and put yourself in the middle of it as you cosplay an ICE agent, which you're not,” Megyn Kelly said, launching into a tirade about the Department of Homeland Security chief.

“Stop with the glam, I mean, she looks like I look right now, but she's out in the field with her gun, being like ‘we're going to go kick some a–.' No one wants you there,” she told her audience.

Kelly went on: “She's cosplaying ICE agent, and she of course is doing it with like 25 pounds of hair only to be outdone by her 30 pounds of makeup and false eyelashes. There's no false eyelashes on an ICE raid.”

Ms Noem's increasingly frequent photo ops have earned her the moniker of “ICE Barbie”.

Since she walked onstage to “Hot Mama” by Trace Adkins during a town hall meeting on her first day in her new role, Ms Noem, 53, has seized every opportunity to put herself front and centre in Donald Trump's mass deportation drive.

Ms Noem, who describes herself as a “wife, mother, grandma, farmer, rancher, and small business owner”, was put at the helm of the DHS when her hopes of becoming Mr Trump's vice-president were dashed after she revealed she had shot her own puppy.

One of Mr Trump's first cabinet picks to be confirmed by the Senate, Ms Noem is in charge of a sprawling agency with a $60 billion budget and more than 230,000 employees that oversee everything from US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Secret Service.

And for weeks the former South Dakota governor has continued to share pictures and videos of herself in a conveyor belt of official uniforms as she leans into her role in Mr Trump's cabinet.

There was the trip to El Salvador where Ms Noem wore a DHS cap and flashed a $60,000 Rolex as she stood in front of dozens of tattooed criminals at the country's mega-prison.

Inmates with shaven heads and bare chests were seen tightly packed into their cells at the maximum security Terrorism Confinement Centre (Cecot) behind her as she warned migrants not to enter the US illegally.

In just one week in March she managed to wear a leather aviator jacket in the cockpit of a Lockheed C-130 Hercules surveillance plane, coastguard fatigues with bright pink lipstick as she steered a patrol boat and a CBP uniform as she congratulated agents for snagging drug smugglers at the border.

She also wore a firefighting uniform and posed with a hose while helping put out a blaze on a training helicopter.

But it was last week's ICE raid in Phoenix, Arizona, in which she was filmed holding a rifle aimed at an agent's head that provoked criticism from Kelly and others.

“She's doing a great job. Like, her actual performance as DHS secretary, in my view anyway, has been amazing,” Ms Kelly said on her eponymous show, before adding: “I can't stand these photo ops, you guys. I think they diminish ICE, they diminish DHS, CPB. She's not an agent. She is an administrative policy person appointed by Trump because she was very loyal to him.”

She said: “They don't want you there, even if you know, you're an attractive lady who just wants – they don't want you. There are lives on the line.”

Kelly also criticised Ms Noem for the El Salvador prison stunt, saying the prisoners were “used as props for her photo op in a skintight shirt, with her hair perfectly curled and coiffed, and again the makeup”.

The broadcaster also shared a post from former Navy SEAL, federal air marshal and FBI special agent Jonathan T. Gilliam, who accused Ms Noem of “devaluing” her work.

“Are you the Secretary of Homeland Security or are you a social media influencer?” he asked, adding: “Unless you are issued that weapon, you shouldn't be holding it for posts and pics. Screwing around with guns for social media would get anyone that works under you fired.

“I can't understand why you and others in this administration continue to parade yourselves in such an unprofessional, juvenile, self-serving way. You aren't running for office, you're running a federal agency. Do that or resign.”

Meghan McCain, the daughter of the late Senator John McCain, and sometimes co-host of The View, also tore into the DHS chief's recent press appearances.

“I don't think that it is productive to have a full face of hair and makeup and hair extensions – and I used to wear 60lbs of hair extensions – when you're doing things like that,” Ms McCain said.

“I'm from Arizona and I've been shooting guns since I was a child... she literally could've blown that man's head off, anybody with even a cursory knowledge of gun safety knows that,” she said of Ms Noem's Phoenix gaffe.

But it is not just broadcasters who have taken umbrage with Ms Noem's approach to the job – officers within DHS are also growing weary of her performance.

According to the Wall Street Journal, framed photographs of Ms Noem, including one of her wearing a cowboy hat on horseback with border patrol agents around her, have been erected in offices around the agency.

ICE officers were also said to have been frustrated by Ms Noem when she joined a pre-dawn raid in New York City on Jan 28 and posted about it on social media while it was still ongoing, which they said undermined the element of surprise.

Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman, said the raid was almost complete when Ms Noem posted on social media.

Agency staff members are also said to be “irritated” that Ms Noem was constantly travelling and only appeared in the DC headquarters for a few hours per week.

Others have defended her frequent outings.

“I think it's great, the fact that she's out in the field. She's with the men and women that are serving, she's been down at the border, she's been to El Salvador,” Republican congressman Michael Guest told the Wall Street Journal.

“I think we need more people willing to get out of their office, get out from behind their desks, get in the field to see the men and women that are working there and be able to see their needs first-hand.”

But, Ms Noem shows no sign of slowing down on her media blitz.

Asked about the criticism of her so-called “ICE Barbie” antics, she brushed off the complaints.

“Every day I wake up and there's new criticisms. It's something different every single day, so I try not to pay attention to the noise,” Ms Noem said during an interview with Jesse Watters on Fox News.

“Obviously I'm guided by the folks that I work with every day to be appropriate for the situation that I'm in and to take the same that precautions they do,” Ms Noem said.

“I will tell you that I oversee 26 different components of the Department of Homeland Security, and they are so proud of the fact that I'm willing to wear an ICE hat, that I'm willing to wear an HSI vest, that I'm willing to go into there and wear something and be proud of them and the work that they do. They didn't have that with the last leadership team,” she added.

George Clooney has defended his decision to publicly call for Joe Biden to drop out of last year's US election as his “civic duty”.

The actor said he wrote the op-ed for the New York Times in July last year – which was credited with helping to force the former president out of the election – because Democrats were “not telling the truth”.

The scathing article criticised Mr Biden's mental capacity weeks after his shambolic performance in the presidential debate in which he mumbled words and was unable to complete sentences.

Mr Clooney, 63, who has long been a friend to Mr Biden, said the former president, 82, the oldest person to do the job, should drop out.

The actor wrote: “It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at [a] fund-raiser was not the Joe “big f------ deal” Biden of 2010.

“He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.”

Mr Clooney went on to say that “this is about age. Nothing more. But also nothing that can be reversed. We are not going to win in November with this president”.

Speaking to CNN's Jake Tapper on Wednesday, Mr Clooney said he felt compelled to act.

He said: “I don't know if it was brave. It was a civic duty because I found that people on my side of the street – you know, I'm a Democrat. I was a Democrat in Kentucky, so I get it – when I saw people on my side of the street not telling the truth, I thought that was time.”

Mr Clooney acknowledged some Democrats were still angry with him for his intervention, which led to Kamala Harris becoming the party's candidate and losing to Donald Trump, but he was fine with that.

“Take a stand, stand for it and then deal with the consequences,” Mr Clooney said.

“That's the rules, so when people criticise me – they criticised me for my stance against the war 20 years ago, people picketed my movies…I have to take that, that's fair. I'm OK with that”.

Mr Clooney was speaking to CNN from New York City's Winter Garden Theatre, where he is starring in “Good Night, and Good Luck”, a Broadway adaptation of the 2005 film he directed of the same name.

He plays the journalist Edward R. Murrow during the McCarthy era of the 1950s and said there were parallels with the current administration.

Mr Clooney said: “We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and a conviction depends on evidence and due process of law, and we will not walk in fear of one another”.

Looking ahead to the 2028 presidential election, Mr Clooney said he liked Andy Beshear, the Kentucky governor, and Gretchen Whitmer, the Michigan governor.

But above all of those was Wes Moore, the Maryland governor, who Mr Clooney said was “spectacular” and a “proper leader”.

            The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating after a Frontier Airlines flight made a hard landing at Luis Marin International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Tuesday.
    


            Flight 3506, an Airbus A321, was arriving from Orlando International Airport when its first landing attempt failed.
    


            Audio from the website Broadcast includes air traffic controllers alerting pilots of “debris on the runway” after an “aircraft landed a bit harsh.”
    


            “The last aircraft that tried to land in San Juan hit the surface too hard and apparently (it) lost some things in the runway,” the controller explained to another pilot. “He has declared an emergency.”
    


            Flight 3506 circled the airport and made two more attempts at landing, successfully touching down at 10:20 p.m. local time.
    


            A number of other incoming planes had to land at other airports while Luis Marin International was closed.
    


            Video from a passenger on the plane showed people onboard cheering as it finally landed.
    


            “It was truly terrible. To fear for your life and not know what was going to happen, to not know if you were going to land safely or how everything was going to end,” Jeffrey Cerda said in a video he posted to Instagram. “The accidents happen, and we don't know when or how they'll happen. They're accidents and they happen the moment we least expect it.”
    


            Passengers were deplaned on the taxiway and bussed to a terminal.
    


            “The aircraft landed safely and there were no injuries to the passengers or crew,” Frontier Airlines said in a statement. “The incident is under investigation.”

            Imagine a world without the internet, or GPS, MRNA vaccines or the touchscreen on your iPhone. The science and technology that have become integral to our daily lives may never have existed, experts say, were it not for research funded by the federal government at American colleges and universities.
    


            But as President Trump's administration threatens to withhold billions of dollars in federal funding from colleges across the nation, the future of innovations like those – and America's global leadership in research and development – could be at stake.
    


            “It's not hyperbole to say we could destroy a generation's worth of scientific progress in this administration,” Jon Fansmith, senior vice president of government relations at the American Council on Education, told CNN.
    


            “The implications are huge for every American, regardless of your political viewpoints.”

DHS threatens to revoke Harvard's eligibility to host international students unless it turns over disciplinary records



            The Trump administration appears determined to bring America's most elite universities in lockstep with his political ideology by threatening to withhold research funding that has proven critical for the universities.
    


            Harvard University is locked in a standoff with the administration over $2 billion in multi-year grants and contracts for the school. The Ivy League school “will not surrender its independence or its constitutional rights” by giving in to a bevy of demands from the administration in order to maintain its funding levels, the university's president, Alan Garber, has said.
    


            But other universities have struck a less defiant tone. Fansmith said some colleges can survive without federal funding – but not for long.
    


            “When you get to hundreds of millions, billions of dollars – no institution, no matter how big their endowment, could sustain that kind of a loss over an extended period of time,” he said.
    


            Universities are like small cities with thousands of faculty members, students and researchers depending on the school to survive. But no two colleges are funded in the same way.
    


            Public universities often rely on revenue from tuition and donations as well as money from state and local governments to provide the bulk of their funding.
    


            Private universities are different. Because they don't receive financial support from the state, private schools lean heavily on donations.
    


            Take Harvard, for instance. Last year, philanthropy accounted for 45% of the school's revenue. But the majority of that money came from one source: the university's centuries-old endowment.
    


            Harvard, founded in 1636, is the oldest private university in the country and the school has received donations for nearly four centuries. Those gifts have helped the university amass an endowment worth $53 billion in 2024 – the largest of any university in the country. 



            But that doesn't mean Harvard – or any other school with an endowment – can access and spend that money freely.
    


            Endowments are meant to literally fund a university forever. So there are rules limiting how much money a school can withdraw from its endowment each year.
    


            Last year, a $2.4 billion distribution from Harvard's endowment accounted for more than a third of the university's funding. But crucially, the university said 80% of that money was restricted for specific purposes, like financial aid, professorships and specific scholarships within certain schools.
    


            “If I decide to endow a chair in the English department, the institution is legally not allowed to use that money for some other purpose,” Fansmith said, adding universities “don't have the flexibility to just shift (donations) to other purposes if they think it's a more pressing need.”
    


            That's where the federal government – and its commitment to funding academic research – comes in.
    


            Johns Hopkins University “receives more money than any other entity in the US” from the National Institutes of Health. Last year, Hopkins received $1 billion in funding from the agency.
    


            Harvard received $686 million in federal funding to conduct research in fiscal year 2024.

            But all of that could vanish overnight if the Trump administration follows through with its threats to withhold funds. Hopkins has already cut thousands of employees after dramatic cuts to USAID ﻿cost it $800 million in funding.
    


            But the federal government hasn't always played such a critical role in academic research. World War II fundamentally changed the relationship between the government and colleges and universities in the United States.
    


            Before the war, American industrialists like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller created their own universities and financed research.
    


            But President Franklin Roosevelt believed scientific advancements would be crucial to winning the war. So, in 1941, he signed an executive order to create the Office of Scientific Research and Development. He tasked Vannevar Bush, the former dean of the MIT School of Engineering, with marshalling the country's top scientists and researchers to create more advanced weapons and technology.
    


            The OSRD funded research programs at universities across the nation – including the Manhattan Project – and the work of these scientists and researchers led to the creation of not only the atomic bomb but also radar and crucial advances in medicine and other military technology.
    


            The office was disbanded after the war, but the partnership between the federal government and colleges and universities helped place the nation at the forefront of global scientific innovation. And that relationship has endured for more than 70 years, until now.
    


            Today, agencies like the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy are the largest funders of academic research at universities across the nation, said Toby Smith, senior vice president for government relations at the Association of American Universities.
    


            But the money doesn't go straight into Columbia or Harvard's bank accounts. Instead, the colleges and universities across the nation apply and compete for federal grants to conduct research, which Fansmith said enables the government to fund the best researchers at the lowest cost.
    


            Federal funding also helps cover the majority of costs for maintaining research facilities, a cost-sharing system that has been in place since Bush and the creation of the OSRD.
    


            In essence, Smith said, universities are akin to national laboratories.
    


            “When you take money away from a Columbia or a Harvard or research or other institutions, you've just taken away funds from the best researchers who were judged by other scientists to do that research on behalf of the American people – in areas like cancer, Alzheimer's, pediatrics, diabetes, and other critical research areas,” Smith said.

            Many advances in science, he added, were discovered inadvertently by researchers who received federal grants. In fact, the annual “Golden Goose” award recognizes these innovations that have had life-changing impacts.
    


            Thanks to funding from the National Science Foundation, economics researchers who were studying markets helped develop the chain model for kidney donations. In 2012, researchers Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley shared the Nobel Prize for economics.
    


            Scientists studying rats at Duke University, funded by the NIH, uncovered a breakthrough that led to the practice of “infant massage” and forever changed neonatal care for premature infants. It has saved countless lives.
    


            That is what's at stake, Smith said, if the US were to halt its federal funding to colleges and universities.
    


            “At the end of the day, (the US) won't have that knowledge,” he said. “Other countries will overtake us in science and resulting technology, if we don't recognize and protect the unique system that we have in place.”
    


            And ultimately, he said, the American people will lose.

Follow:


            When President Donald Trump named Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as his choice to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services, one group of health researchers was cautiously optimistic that their cause would finally have a champion at the highest levels of government: those focused on food and nutrition.
    


            “These are the kinds of things I've been saying and writing about for decades!” Marion Nestle, a prominent food policy researcher, wrote in November of some of Kennedy's stated Make America Healthy Again goals: removing ultraprocessed foods from schools, restricting purchases of soda with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits and ridding government agencies of conflicts of interest.

            Dr. Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the US National Institutes of Health conducting some of the world's only controlled trials on ultraprocessed foods, shared that optimism.
    


            “When I saw the MAHA movement gaining bipartisan support last year, it was music to my ears,” Hall wrote in a letter late last month to Kennedy and incoming NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. “I thought that after years of defunding human clinical research to understand metabolic disease perhaps NIH might finally prioritize the studies needed to uncover its root causes.”
    


            Instead, Hall announced his early retirement Wednesday, after 21 years at the NIH, in a post on social media, citing censorship of communication of his research findings.
    


            “Recent events have made me question whether NIH continues to be a place where I can freely conduct unbiased science,” Hall wrote, noting that it's been his “life's work” to “scientifically study how our food environment affects what we eat, and how what we eat affects our physiology” and that, given the new administration's interest in those issues, he'd hoped to expand that research program.
    


            But instead, the post continued, “I experienced censorship in the reporting of our research because of agency concerns that it did not appear to fully support preconceived narratives of my agency's leadership about ultra-processed food addiction.”
    


            Hall said he'd hoped that “was an aberration,” prompting him to write to his agency's leadership asking to discuss those issues. He said he never received a response.
    


            “It's disappointing that this individual is fabricating false claims,” an HHS spokesperson told CNN on Wednesday. “NIH scientists have, and will, continue to conduct interviews regarding their research through written responses or other means. We remain committed to promoting gold-standard research and advancing public health priorities. Any attempt to paint this as censorship is a deliberate distortion of the facts.”
    


            Hall's letter to Kennedy and Bhattacharya, which circulated both within government and in external research circles and was obtained by CNN, sheds more light on what led to the departure of a key nutrition researcher from an administration that has said it's dedicated to improving the nation's nutrition.
    


            Hall requested a discussion with the health leaders of ideas to advance studies into how the food supply contributes to rising chronic disease rates - a common focus of Kennedy and the MAHA movement - and serious concerns about significant disruptions to research and censorship of communications of his findings.
    


            “We have been hobbled on several occasions with intermittent inability to purchase food for our study participants or obtain research supplies,” he told Kennedy and Bhattacharya in the March 28 letter. “The future of our studies seems bleak given the inability to replace outgoing trainees who are the workhorses of our research.”

            Further, Hall wrote, “I've also experienced incidences of censorship in my ability to discuss our research.”
    


            “Most concerning,” he said, “was a recent intervention by a HHS communications director regarding media coverage of our study on brain responses to ultra-processed foods.”
    


            The study, published March 4 in the journal Cell Metabolism, used brain imaging to see whether consuming ultraprocessed milkshakes high in fat and sugar caused reactions in dopamine similar to addictive drugs.
    


            “Surprisingly,” Hall and his team wrote in the paper, they didn't, at least not large enough to be picked up on PET scans.
    


            “HHS denied an interview request from the New York Times and contacted the reporter directly to downplay our study results because our data might be viewed as failing to support preconceived HHS narratives about ultra-processed food addiction,” Hall said in the letter. “My written responses to the reporter's questions were edited and submitted without my approval.”
    


            An HHS spokesperson denied that Hall's responses were edited. CNN viewed copies of the written responses, which showed that an approved version sent to a reporter had added a line suggesting the study was small, with 50 participants. Hall noted Wednesday that, in fact, it was actually the largest of its kind.
    


            It's not the first time a Trump administration is said to have attempted to interfere with communication of health information from its agencies; in September 2020, a federal health official told CNN that Trump appointees had pushed to change language in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly reports so they didn't undermine the president's political message during the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            But Bhattacharya, who was sworn in as NIH director on April 1, has said it is a key priority to end what he sees as censorship at the federal research agency, claiming during his confirmation hearing that the Biden administration sought to censor him for divergent views on how to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.
    


            “We'll never use this agency to censor scientists who disagree,” Bhattacharya said in an interview on Fox News. “If scientists are censored, we actually can't have excellent science.”
    


            And food and nutrition researchers had high hopes for Kennedy, despite the broader public health world's deep concerns about his history of spreading misinformation about vaccines - worries that have only increased as a deadly measles outbreak grows in Texas and surrounding states.
    


            On food, Kennedy's priorities have appeared more aligned with most academic health researchers'.
    


            “I was hoping the administration would come in and say … ‘this is a big priority for us. We want to do this kind of study,' ” said Jerold Mande, who served in food and nutrition policy roles in the administrations of George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and is now an adjunct professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and CEO of the nonprofit Nourish Science. “They've said it's a priority: In order to take steps to make a difference here, we need the science.”
    


            What sets Hall's work apart, Mande said, is that he runs randomized, controlled clinical trials - considered the gold standard of research - to understand the effects of ultraprocessed foods on the body. Ultraprocessed foods are those that include industrially created ingredients that can't be made in a regular home kitchen and are estimated to make up about 70% of the US food supply.

            These kinds of trials are especially difficult to do in nutrition because participants' environments must be tightly controlled so their food can be monitored down to the gram; in Hall's studies, participants live at the NIH clinical center - essentially a hospital - for weeks at a time.
    


            The results of Hall's first such trial were published in 2019 and showed that people who ate a diet of mostly ultraprocessed foods consumed an additional 500 calories a day and gained about 2 pounds, on average, over the course of two weeks, compared with when they ate diets composed mainly of minimally processed foods, matched for nutrients.
    


            The study “helped provide the causal link in the established epidemiological association between obesity and diets high in ultra-processed foods,” Hall told Kennedy and Bhattacharya in his letter.
    


            Nestle, a professor emerita at New York University and author of the book “Food Politics,” called it one of the most important nutrition studies done since the discovery of vitamins.
    


            Hall, whose best-known work also includes a series of studies following the outcomes of participants in the show “The Biggest Loser,” has been in the midst of a follow-up study at NIH to understand what it is about ultraprocessed foods that causes people to overeat them. That's despite, he wrote in his letter, a 30% cut to the beds in the NIH clinical center available to conduct the trials.
    


            “His study raises this question – ‘What if it is the processing?' ” – that drives overeating of ultraprocessed foods, Mande said. “Then you have an administration coming in that's saying the same thing, and you have a great story for them to tell: that the last administration dragged its feet on this. Kevin's study was done, in 2019 it came out; it should have been replicated the next year, and hasn't been.”
    


            Hall wrote that interim results from the ongoing study “suggest that we are making substantial progress identifying exactly how ultra-processed foods cause overeating and weight gain,” but he notes that “there is still so much more to learn.”

            During his confirmation hearings, Kennedy told lawmakers that the most important action the federal government could take to improve the nation's nutrition would be “to deploy NIH and FDA to [do] the research to understand the relationship between these different food additives and chronic disease, so that Americans understand it.”
    


            “You should know what the impacts are on your family and on your health,” Kennedy said.
    


            Just over two months after Kennedy was sworn in, Hall – the NIH's top nutrition researcher working on those answers – is leaving.
    


            In his letter, Hall noted “the short time period” of deadlines to accept voluntary early retirement, part of the federal government's push to shed workers; HHS said it cut 25% of its staff through a combination of voluntary departures like Hall's and a mass Reduction in Force this month.
    


            In his social media post Wednesday, Hall said he “felt compelled to accept early retirement to preserve health insurance for my family,” noting that he'd lose that benefit if he resigned later “in protest of any future meddling or censorship.”
    


            He said he doesn't have plans for next steps in his career, given how quickly he had to make the decision. But in both his post and his letter to Kennedy and Bhattacharya, he emphasized that he hopes to go back.
    


            “Perhaps I could soon return to government service and lead an effort to expand on our research to rapidly determine what are the most important factors in our toxic food environment that are making Americans chronically sick,” Hall wrote last month.
    


            For now, he said, his experiences “have led me to believe that NIH may be a difficult place to continue the gold-standard unbiased science required to inform the needed transformation of our food supply to make Americans healthy.”

Follow:


            US Sen. Chris Van Hollen told reporters in El Salvador Wednesday that he was unable to visit Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia in the maximum-security mega-prison where he is being held.
    


            Instead, the Democrat announced he met with the Salvadoran vice president and vowed to “keep pressing” for answers and the man's release.
    


            “There will be more members of Congress coming,” Van Hollen said in an emotional media availability. “This is an unsustainable and unjust moment, so it cannot continue.”
    


            The March deportation of Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national and Maryland resident, has become a flashpoint in the fight over the Trump administration's hardline deportation push. The administration conceded in court filings that it had mistakenly deported the father of three to El Salvador last month as part of its recent deportation flights to the Central American nation, which are now at the center of a fraught legal battle.
    


            Van Hollen said he specifically asked Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa if he could meet with Abrego Garcia or at least speak with him over the phone or via video conferencing. Again, Van Hollen said the request was denied.
    


            Pressed on whether he had concerns about the man's health, Van Hollen said: “I don't know about his health status which is why I wanted to meet with him directly.”

What to know about Abrego Garcia's deportation case



            The senator's trip swiftly drew the ire of the White House.
    


            Communications director Steven Cheung called Van Hollen “a complete disgrace” and the Office of Communications accused the senator in a statement of a lack of concern regarding crimes they say were committed by undocumented immigrants against his constituents. Abrego Garcia has not been charged with any crimes in the United States, according to his lawyers.
    


            While Abrego Garcia had not been legally in the US prior to his deportation, a 2019 court order said he could not be returned to El Salvador and the Trump administration admitted in court documents he was deported there due to a clerical error.
    


            In recent days, however, Trump administration officials have denied that he was mistakenly deported. US officials have alleged he is a member of the MS-13 gang, which the administration has designated as a foreign terrorist organization – a claim his attorneys dispute and at least one federal judge has voiced skepticism toward.
    


            The Wednesday meeting, Van Hollen said, started with a “point of agreement” that the countries should work together to “crack down” on gangs like MS-13. However, he said the case of Abrego Garcia “does not have to do with MS-13.”
    


            Despite a Supreme Court ruling that the US must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return, White House officials have argued it's up to El Salvador whether to do so. The Trump administration and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele made clear during an Oval Office meeting earlier this week that the Maryland man wouldn't be returned to the US.
    


            Bukele said during the meeting that while he has the power to release Abrego Garcia, he wasn't willing to do so.
    


            Officials in the Oval Office meeting, including President Donald Trump, made no effort to ask for his cooperation in the matter.
    


            Van Hollen said Wednesday that the Salvadoran vice president had echoed comments made by Bukele at the White House that El Salvador “can't smuggle” Abrego Garcia to the US.
    


            “I said I am not asking him to smuggle Mr. Abrego Garcia into the United States, I am simply asking him to open the door of CECOT and let this innocent man walk out,” the senator said.
    


            Bukele has no plans to meet with the Democratic senator currently visiting the country, a high-level source close to Bukele told CNN.
    


            According to the source CNN spoke with, a tour of the maximum security prison Cecot may be arranged for US lawmakers, but they are not expected to be granted access to Abrego Garcia himself — as El Salvador does not permit individual visits with inmates at the facility.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Erik and Lyle Menendez could learn this week whether they will get reduced sentences — and the chance of freedom — nearly 30 years after they were convicted of murdering their parents.

A Los Angeles judge will preside over the resentencing hearing that's expected to last two days starting Thursday. The judge could rule during the hearing or issue a written decision later. If he shortens their sentences, the brothers would still need approval from the state's parole board to leave prison.

The district attorney's office filed a motion late Wednesday to delay the resentencing hearings so the court can obtain one aspect of the state parole board's comprehensive risk assessments. California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the assessments in February and the brothers' final risk assessment hearings are scheduled for June 13. Prosecutors said in their filing that one part of the risk assessment has already been completed.

The brothers were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison without the possibility of parole for murdering their entertainment executive father Jose Menendez and mother Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills home in 1989. The brothers were 18 and 21 at the time of the killings. While defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance.

The case has captured the public's attention for decades, and the Netflix drama “ Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story ” and documentary “The Menendez Brothers” have been credited with bringing new attention to the case. Supporters of the brothers have flown in from across the country to attend rallies and hearings in recent few months.




The resentencing hearing will center on whether the brothers have been rehabilitated in prison and deserve a lesser sentence of 50 years to life. That would make them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law because they committed the crime when they were younger than 26.

Former Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón asked a judge last year to reduce the brothers' sentences. He lost reelection to Nathan Hochman, who moved to withdraw the resentencing request and has argued the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes. 

A resentencing petition laid out by Gascón focuses on the brothers' accomplishments and rehabilitation. The brothers' attorneys say their clients have worked hard over the decades to better themselves and give back to the prison community. The extended Menendez family, with the exception of an uncle who died last month, has said they fully forgive the brothers for what they did and want them to be freed. 

With Hochman in charge, prosecutors argued last Friday they could not support the brothers' resentencing. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic ruled the resentencing hearings could continue despite their opposition.

Prosecutors have said the brothers have not admitted to lies told during their trial about why they killed their parents, or that they asked their friends to lie for them in court. Hochman's office has also said it does not believe that the brothers were sexually abused by their father and that by speaking about their childhood abuse, they have not taken complete responsibility for the crime.

'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts discuss a Los Angeles judge allowing the Menendez brothers' resentencing hearing to move forward.

The Los Angeles District Attorney's Office filed a request late Wednesday to delay Thursday's resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez.

District Attorney Nathan Hochman's office said in the filing that the resentencing hearings, set for Thursday and Friday, should be put on hold until the court obtains copies of comprehensive risk assessments for the brothers that were completed by state prison and parole officers.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office told Fox News in response that the comprehensive risk assessment is ongoing and will be completed on June 13, 2025. Per California legal regulations, one component of it has been released to the involved parties for their review 60 days before the clemency hearing and is subject to correction, his office said. Newsom's office said it notified Judge Michael Jesic of the status of this report, which is not a stand-alone risk assessment, and offered to share it with the court if he requests it.

It was not immediately clear if the DA's filing would affect Thursday's hearing, which is scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m. local time. The court said it would be addressed when the hearing begins.

The Menendez brothers' discussed their push for freedom, decades after their parents' brutal murders, in a recent interview with TMZ.

In the feature, ""TMZ Presents: The Menendez Brothers: The Prison Interview,"" both brothers were interviewed and discussed how prison has changed them and how they envision life outside of prison walls. 

""We're very hopeful, we've done what we can with the time we've had,"" Lyle Menendez said in the interview.

""Hope for the future is kind of a new thing for us,"" he continued.

The scenes then show a young Erik and Lyle and the grisly crime scene they left behind in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989 after killing their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez.

""It was almost the perfect murder,"" said former Beverly Hills Police Detective Tom Linehan.

Now, more than 35 years later, the fate of the brothers lies in the hands of a Los Angeles County judge, who legal experts say will have to answer two simple questions: Do Erik and Lyle pose an unreasonable risk to the public, and does he believe they have rehabilitated? 

Linehan unequivocally said he would not trust them and what they did was the ""worst, most heinous murder case"" he has ever seen.

""They are two of the most skilled liars and their notary is what sets them apart from other inmates in similar situations,"" Linehan said. ""If things weren't going their way, they could do this again."" 

Hochman has also said he does not agree with the resentencing but is prepared to move forward.

Hochman has said that it is up to the court to factor in whether the ""lack of acceptance of responsibility for their murderous actions"" is enough to decide whether the Menendez brothers pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the community.

MENENDEZ BROTHERS RESENTENCING: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

""Though this pathway to resentencing has been offered to the Menendez brothers, they have chosen to stubbornly remain hunkered down in their over 30-year-old bunker of lies, deceit and denials,"" Hochman said. 

However, family and other supporters of the Menendez brothers argued they have paid their dues and have changed.

A former inmate, rapper X-Rated, who served 18 years with Lyle and Erik, said they do not belong in prison, even claiming his neighbor's dog was more dangerous than the Menendez brothers. 

He added that they have helped him and many others get out of prison and rehabilitate in society, showing selflessness, knowing they had ""no chance"" of getting out while they were helping others.

""The fact they did all this without getting anything in return says a lot,"" the rapper said. 

Lyle said that he and Erik have developed a peace and patience that most people would not understand. 

Erik admitted they were ""spoiled brats"" and that he suffered from severe insecurity issues. He added that he wants to be an advocate for other sexually abused victims, saying that ""no one should have to be trapped"" like he was. 

Both Lyle and Erik Menendez have come forward in documentaries and on social media claiming their father sexually abused them, offering a different narrative of the killings than the story their attorneys told in the 1990s.

They maintain they killed their parents in self-defense. 

Their first trial ended in a mistrial, when jurors could not agree on their fate. After a second trial in the mid-1990s, in which some of their evidence about the alleged sexual abuse was excluded, jurors agreed with prosecutors that their motive was greed. 

If the judge decides to resentence the Menendez brothers, it will then be up to the state parole board to consider their release.

Because they were under 26 years old at the time of the murders, under current California law, new sentences of 50 years to life would immediately make them eligible for a parole hearing. 

They are already scheduled to appear before the board on June 13 as part of a comprehensive risk assessment report ordered by Newsom, who is considering the brothers' clemency request – a separate potential path out of prison.

Fox News Digital was on hand for the opening of first lady Melania Trump's White House Garden Tours on April 6. Here are some of the beautiful scenes on the tour.

Americans coast to coast are rushing to obtain REAL IDs while many motor vehicle bureaus are grappling to accommodate appointments. 

With the deadline of May 7 approaching, air travelers at domestic airports and people entering some federal buildings must have a REAL ID.

Some Americans are considering alternatives if they're struggling to get DMV appointments to obtain the new identification. 

REAL ID APPOINTMENTS ADDED AS NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS STRUGGLE TO GET NEW IDENTIFICATION

On Monday in New Jersey, the Department of Motor Vehicles (NJDMV) website showed ""0 appointments available"" for REAL ID services on its site; it has now added additional time slots. 

Virginia DMVs have launched Saturday events for people to get their REAL IDs, while some offices in California have extended their hours.

Other identification forms that will be accepted in lieu of a REAL ID are a valid U.S. passport or passport card; DHS trusted traveler cards such as Global Entry; Department of Defense IDs; permanent resident cards; and border crossing cards. 

For those who do not have those IDs on hand, some AAA branches in six states are offering services to get a REAL ID. 

NO 'REAL ID' APPOINTMENTS OPEN IN NEW JERSEY AS RESIDENTS SOUND OFF: ‘GET WITH THE TIMES, NJ'

""In Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York, DMV/RMV services at AAA branches are free for all AAA members,"" the AAA site notes.

""In Connecticut, AAA members from outside AAA Northeast territory pay $6 for DMV services and non-members pay $8,"" the site adds.

The site says there is no additional cost for the REAL ID itself. 

""If not at renewal, only the standard duplicate license fees would apply,"" states the site.

""AAA offers DMV services in 22 states, ranging from vehicle registrations, titling, tags, license renewals, issuing new licenses, and/or REAL ID,"" an AAA spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.

""Got the passport card in addition to my book and I just carry that.""

""Of those 22 states, 6 states offer REAL ID services: FL, KS, MA, MN, OH, and RI. Regulations regarding private organizations offering DMV services (and what type of services offered) vary by state,"" the spokesperson added.

AAA does not have plans to roll out DMV services in additional states, the organization said.

The processing time for an expedited passport is two to three weeks with additional fees, according to the State Department's website.

Many Americans have taken to social media to share their frustrations, with some seeking more alternatives.

""The REAL ID situation in Kentucky is such a sh--show that I'm completely bypassing it and just getting a passport next week,"" a man posted on X.

""To all the PANICANS, you do NOT need a REAL ID if you have a passport,"" posted one X user.

Another user responded, ""That's what I did... Got the passport card in addition to my book and I just carry that.""

Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang discusses President Donald Trump's tariff strategy and the threat of Chinese hackers to U.S. national security on ‘Fox News Live.'

""There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war,"" wrote Xi Jinping this week. If he's talking about China, he's absolutely right. Across the board, the Chinese will suffer.

In America, the story will be different. When the dust settles on President Donald Trump's tariffs, there will be 340.1 million people much better off.

For more than four decades, China's regime has been implementing predatory and criminal trade practices. For various reasons, the U.S. and other countries have let matters slide. 

President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping 

Trump in his first term, in 2018, fired a warning shot with his 25% tariffs. Unfortunately, the Chinese regime did not take the hint. This month he raised the general tariff rate on China's goods to 145%.

10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER

Trump's trade actions could not have come at a worse time for Xi.

As an initial matter, his economy is stumbling. It cannot be growing at the 5.4% pace reported Wednesday for the first quarter of this year. Price data for March – the Consumer Price Index was negative for the second-straight month and the Producer Price Index was negative for the 30th-straight month – indicates the country has entered a deflationary spiral. That phenomena suggests the economy is now contracting and will do so for some time.

And it's going to get worse. Xi Jinping, despite what his technocrats say, does not want consumption to form the foundation of the Chinese economy. In fact, consumption's share of gross domestic product – an abnormally low 38% last year – is now falling. In these circumstances, Xi's only way to rescue an increasingly grim situation is to export more. 

Yet Trump's elevated tariffs close off the U.S. market to most Chinese goods. The U.S. accounts for more than a third of global consumer spending. 

TRUMP'S TARIFF WAR WITH BEIJING IS PART OF A MULTI-PRONG STRATEGY TO SECURE AMERICA FROM A MUCH BROADER THREAT

Worse for Xi Jinping, Trump's tariffs are helping end the fast globalization that has marked the post-Cold War period. 

""Due to many reasons, the world has been deglobalizing for years,"" trade expert Alan Tonelson told Fox News. ""Now, the Trump Liberation Day tariffs are greatly speeding up the process, and further threatening the well-being of the People's Republic of China and other export-led economies.""

As Tonelson, who blogs on trade at RealityChek suggests, the world is de-integrating. ""The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put an end to the globalization we have experienced over the last three decades,"" wrote Larry Fink in his March 24, 2022, letter to BlackRock shareholders. The world's largest asset manager – BlackRock has $11.6 trillion under management – suggested the Ukraine war killed globalization because globalization had already been weakened by the COVID pandemic, which had lessened connectivity among nations, among companies and among people.

In this deglobalizing world, other countries will not allow China to flood their markets with goods the Chinese would have otherwise sold to America. Those markets are not large enough to absorb those goods and, in any event, they will not permit China to decimate their local industries.

China will be hurt. Even now, export factories in southern China, with nothing in their order books, are closing. Workers have begun to return to hometowns, many to subsist on farms.

WHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES

The downturn in the export sector is occurring while the country is essentially having its 2008. In 2008, Hu Jintao, Xi's predecessor, decided to avoid a downturn by embarking on what was then the biggest stimulus program in history. In the process, China took on an enormous amount of debt. Today, China's total-country-debt-to-GDP ratio could be as high as an unsustainable 375%. 

As a result, there have been for four years a series of high-profile debt defaults, especially in the property sector. Prices of flats in China have tumbled, a social stability issue: Approximately 70% of household wealth is in property.

And if all of this were not bad enough, Trump has picked this moment to begin challenging China's mighty export sector with tariffs.

The obvious course of action for Xi Jinping would be to pick up the phone to call 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He has, however, made it clear that he won't be doing that.

""China wants to make a deal,"" Trump said last Wednesday. ""They just don't know how quite to go about it.""

No Xi Jinping doesn't. And it's not hard to figure out why something so easy is in fact so hard.

Xi has configured the Chinese political system so that only the most hostile answers are considered acceptable. As a result, he cannot now back down or make concessions for fear that will lead to a challenge to his leadership. There are already signs of discontent with his rule, especially in the top ranks of the military.

Xi remains intransigent. ""China does not flinch from any unjust suppression,"" he proclaimed during his meeting with visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on April 11.

So Xi has boxed himself in. For him, there are no good outcomes. If he does not compromise, the Chinese economy will fail. If he compromises, he will fail.

For China's willful leader, the choice is easy: He will not initiate talks with Trump. China, as a consequence, will bear the consequences.

""Zero Day"" star Eden Lee, who balances her acting career with working as an ER nurse, explained why she doesnt plan to give up her day job.

""Zero Day"" star Eden Lee is balancing saving lives as a real-life emergency room nurse with her rising career in Hollywood.

The 34-year-old actress, who works in the ER at Atrium Health Union in Monroe, North Carolina, landed her first major role in the new Netflix political thriller limited series starring Robert De Niro.

During an interview with Fox News Digital, Lee explained why she decided to pursue acting while continuing to serve her community as an emergency medical professional.

""Acting is something I've always wanted to do ever since I was younger,"" she said. ""It wasn't something that was particularly encouraged. It was seen as more of a hobby.""

""And so when I started settling into my career a couple years into working in the ER, I was very happy,"" she continued.  ""I found my now-husband. I was feeling very fulfilled in my career, yet subsequently I felt like... something was missing.

""And so I started looking around and realized I now have the luxury of being a grown-up and making my own choices because I make my own money and let's see what acting classes do for me.""

Lee, who graduated from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte with a bachelor's degree in nursing, told Fox News Digital that she initially planned to attend medical school. However, she decided that she wanted to ""get to the bedside quicker,"" so she declared nursing as her major.

A post shared by Eden Lee (@msedenlee)

The New York native launched her acting career in 2017. She appeared in a string of short films before making her streaming debut in the 2021 Fox Nation holiday movie ""Christmas in the Pines.""

Over the past few years, Lee racked up acting credits with guest appearances on TV shows like ""The Resident,"" ""Dynasty,"" ""She-Hulk: Attorney at Law,"" ""Twisted Metal,"" ""First Wives Club,"" ""Found"" and ""Parish."" 

Lee also took on roles in the 2022 action film ""County Line: No Fear"" and the 2023 coming-of-age movie ""Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret,"" based on Judy Blume's 1970 novel of the same name.

While speaking with Fox News Digital, Lee shared how she juggles her acting gigs with shifts in the ER. 

""Luckily, I've been an ER nurse for 12 years now, so I have a loyalty to my department, and my department has a loyalty for me, and so I'm offered a lot of flexibility and freedom to pursue my career,"" she said.

Lee recently told the Charlotte Observer that as a PRN nurse, she works on an ""as-needed"" basis, which has enabled her to more easily divide her time between her two professions.

She explained to Fox News Digital that managing her busy schedule is a ""matter of balancing it from week to week.""

""I pick my schedule at work in a way that suits me and suits my auditioning schedule, and if there's ever times where I need to take an extended leave of absence, my department is very accommodating of that,"" Lee said.

Though Lee has now established herself as a working actress, she told Fox News Digital that she doesn't foresee hanging up her scrubs in the near future. 

""I've been working professionally for a few years and, so luckily and thankfully, I have the luxury of honestly letting my nursing job go,"" she said. ""And my husband has from time to time been like, ‘You should just quit. Why are you still going?'"" 

""And I worked really hard for this thing too,"" Lee continued. ""So emergency nursing feels very much a part of me as acting does.""

Lee said she enjoys each of her vocations equally, adding, ""Obviously, there's one I'm pursuing with a little bit more fervor, but I don't see myself letting go of nursing anytime soon.""

The actress went on to say that she sees parallels between her two occupations, noting that they both require ""empathy."" 

""I tell people all the time on both sides, whether it's acting or in nursing, that I find that they inform each other very well,"" she said. ""Obviously, when I'm working as a nurse and working at the bedside, empathy and compassion is a big part of doing what I do.""

""And subsequently, I feel like working as an actor is a constant practice of empathy as well,"" Lee continued. ""And on my bad days, you know, I got to be a real good actor at work, too.""

Lee recalled that there have been a ""couple of times"" when she has had to use her ER nursing skills while working on sets.

""There was a show that I got hired on to play a nurse and I realized very quickly when I got there that they were also in need of a little bit of medical expertise when it came down to handling some of the equipment,"" she said. 

""Emergency nursing feels very much a part of me as acting does.""

Additionally, Lee told Fox News Digital that she stepped in to help an injured actor during the filming of one of her projects. 

""There's been an instance on a smaller scale working on a short film project with a friend of mine,"" she said. ""We had an actor get hurt when he was on set, and between the time it took for our onset medic to get there and between him getting injured, I was able to lend a hand in a situation that felt very crisis-like for a lot of people there.""

Lee told Fox News Digital that the ""toughest part"" of working as an ER nurse is ""realizing over and over again that we live in a world that is less than ideal.""

""I feel very fortunate to be very well tied into my community, but at the same time, it is a privilege, but it's also really hard to see all the things that people who don't work in healthcare are not privy to,"" she said. 

""And so I feel like my biggest struggle is realizing that the state of our country is the way that it is and, hopefully, what I do and how I participate in it is making it better,"" Lee added.

The actress said she has no plans to give up her nursing job ""anytime soon."" (Eden Lee Instagram)

""Zero Day,"" which was released on Feb. 20, follows a ""former US President, George Mullen (De Niro}, who is called out of retirement to investigate a devastating cyberattack,"" which becomes known as ""Zero Day,"" according to a plot synopsis for the show. 

""As he delves into the event, he uncovers a web of lies, conspiracies, and personal betrayals that threaten to unravel the nation.""

Along with Lee and De Niro, the six-episode miniseries features an ensemble cast that includes Angela Bassett, Lizzy Caplan, Jesse Plemons, Connie Britton, Joan Allen, Bill Camp, Dan Stevens, Matthew Modine and McKinley Belcher III.

""Zero Day"" marks De Niro's first leading role in a TV series. The two-time Academy Award winner also executive produced the show along with creators Eric Newman, Noah Oppenheim, and Michael Schmidt as well as director Lesli Linka Glatter and Miramax CEO Jonathan Glickman.

In a recurring role, Lee portrays Special Agent Angela Kim, who heads the FBI National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force. Kim joins the Zero Day Commission, which is led by Mullen, as they work to uncover the culprits and motives behind the deadly cyberattack.

During her interview with Fox News Digital, Lee reflected on her experience working with De Niro.

""I couldn't in my wildest dreams ever imagine that I would be working with Robert De Niro,"" she said.

She continued, ""I think every actor has this bucket list that in our wildest dream we would get to do, like go to the Oscars and work with Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep and so on. This wasn't even on my bingo card."" 

""And working with him was such an eye-opening experience,"" Lee added. ""I think for me, my biggest takeaway in working with him is realizing that working really hard and being a kind person are really the key factors to making sure that you have a long and successful career.""

Lee also shared what surprised her most about working with the ""Taxi Driver"" star. 

""I think the thing that we as aspiring actors and looking up to people like Robert De Niro, we make some assumption that these people are infallible, and they're perfect, and they must show up camera-ready every single day,"" she said.

""On our early mornings, if there were days when he would trip up a couple of lines or things like that, it was just really eye-opening, right? It's a consistent practice of showing up and working really hard,"" Lee added. ""But he comes in ready every single day, which is very impressive.""

Lee noted that she didn't ask for any advice or ""sage wisdom"" from the veteran actor.  

""He's generally, I believe, a very introverted person. And so between takes and stuff, he keeps to himself,"" she said. ""I felt like watching him work was probably the best way to learn what I should be doing.""

Following ""Zero Day,"" Lee is continuing to line up new acting projects.

The actress told Fox News Digital that she recently wrapped filming on the independent film ""Bedford Park,"" the first directorial outing for writer and editor Stephanie Ahn. Lee said she is playing a small supporting role in the movie, which she described as ""more of a coming-of-age romantic drama"" that is ""based on two Korean-American leads.""

As a Korean-American herself, Lee shared that it was ""super important for me to make it into that project."" 

Lee also shared that she will be traveling to Atlanta to film a guest appearance in the long-running Canadian TV series ""Murdoch Mysteries.""

""And so hopefully the train just keeps chugging along,"" she said.

""Zero Day"" is streaming on Netflix now.

Keyshawn Johnson breaks down the expectations for Caleb Williams heading into his second NFL season and whether he can meet the high bar set for him.

Caleb Williams, the top pick in last year's NFL Draft, experienced some highs and lows during his rookie season. 

However, the Chicago Bears quarterback is speaking out on at least one of the ways he plans on approaching his second NFL season. Developing close friendships with fellow quarterbacks across the league is something Williams is simply not interested in.

Williams' rationale centered around his belief that having a strong bond with counterparts could cause him to lose his competitive edge. ""I think the NFL game has become very friendly, and I don't necessarily want to be friends, because I want to keep that competitive advantage,"" he said.

The Bears finished last season with a disappointing 5-12 record. The Bears relieved Matt Eberflus of his head coaching duties in November, just one day after he received considerable blame for mismanaging the clock in a 23-20 loss to the Detroit Lions.

Eberflus' nearly three-year tenure in the Windy City was marred by a flurry of last-second losses and ended with a six-game losing streak. Thomas Brown then became interim head coach. Chicago hired Ben Johnson in January.

The Bears made a flurry of additions to its roster once the NFL free agency period opened last month. The team bolstered its offensive line by acquiring center Drew Dalman and guards Joe Thuney and Jonah Jackson.

Williams made it clear that winning is the top expectation in 2025. ""The plan is to go win big,"" Williams said.

President Donald Trump participated in a Wednesday evening prayer service and dinner as part of a series of Holy Week events ahead of Easter Sunday this weekend.

Faith leaders of various Christian denominations were present and listened to the president address them about the importance of faith, both in governing and in people's personal lives. Trump also took the moment to tout his recent accomplishments in-line with Christian beliefs, and slammed efforts to move the country away from its Christian foundation. 

""This is really — I hope — going to be one of the great Easters ever, because we have something going that I don't think this country has seen in 100 years. And as we gather with family and friends, we'll not forget the true source of our joy and our strength: America has put our trust in God,"" Trump said during his address to attendees. ""It will always be ‘In God We Trust.' We will never change that.""

INSIDE DONALD TRUMP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD, IN HIS OWN WORDS: ‘I WAS SAVED'

""You know there's a movement to change it,"" Trump continued. ""It won't happen. We won't let that happen. Can you imagine a movement to change that?""

Trump also slammed former administrations for failing to stand up for persecuted Christians around the globe, reassuring the crowd of faith leaders in attendance that things would be different under his administration.  

""We had nobody fighting for our Christians in other parts of the world, that were being so incredibly destroyed, killed, injured, hurt. But they died, so many died. You wouldn't think that could happen in this time — in this modern time,"" Trump said. 

Trump also remarked about the anti-Christian bias exhibited in the U.S., pointing out to those in attendance that he established a Justice Department task force to root it out. Trump also touted his creation of the White House Faith Office, which replaced the former White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships.

""You don't hear about that very much, but there is anti-Christian bias,"" Trump said.

Trump will continue his Holy Week celebrations with another prayer service tomorrow, on Holy Thursday, which will again include various faith leaders from different Christian denominations and members of the president's staff. The event will include Christian hymns sung by musicians associated with Liberty University, a private Christian university in Virginia. 

The White House is also reportedly hosting a Passover event Thursday afternoon, to celebrate the Jewish holiday that began April 12 and ends April 20. 

""With God's help we can overcome every challenge, triumph over every evil, and restore the spirit of faith in the United States for generations to come,"" Trump concluded. ""We have a very simple slogan: ‘Make America Great Again,' and that's exactly what we're doing.""

In addition to faith leaders, Patty Morin, whose daughter's death at the hands of an illegal immigrant in 2023 was a major point of contention during the last election, was also present at the Wednesday dinner service. She attended following an emotional press briefing earlier in the day at the White House during which she told her daughter's story. 

""Her daughter's looking down on Patty today,"" Trump noted during the event, adding she's ""been through hell.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Bill Maher went to Washington. He wasn't played","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/beltway-confidential/3380420/bill-maher-washington-wasnt-played-trump-dinner/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Liberal comedian Bill Maher is under fire from the left and some in the media over his recent White House dinner with President Donald Trump. The dinner was organized by the musician Kid Rock, a mutual friend of Maher and Trump. The host of HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher, Maher has frequently — and often ferociously — criticized Trump.

At the start of his show on Friday, Maher detailed the dinner two weeks ago. The main gripes with Maher's monologue are twofold.

First, there is a contention with Maher's argument that meeting with Trump and disagreeing with him civilly is good for liberals and the nation. Second, there is a contention with Maher's claim that while Trump plays a “crazy person” on TV, he is not a crazy person in private. Maher's critics are incensed here that he may have slightly undercut the narrative that Trump is a demented psychopath ever plotting the Constitution's desecration. Their fury also belies the fact that many others have described Trump's private persona in ways similar to Maher.

No rest for fury, however.

At the Washington Post, Leon Krauze suggests that “Bill Maher went to Washington. He got played.” Rather hyperbolically, Krauze compares Maher to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and his ill-fated effort to secure peace with German dictator Adolf Hitler via the 1938 Munich Agreement. Krauze also compares Trump to General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Joseph Stalin, Cuban President Fidel Castro, and Chairman of the People's Republic of China Mao Zedong. He says that “by agreeing to meet with Trump, allowing himself to be privately charmed by a charismatic leader and then sharing his softened new take on the president, Bill Maher has made the task of holding Trump accountable that much more difficult.”

Really? Trump is Hitler? Has holding Trump accountable become more difficult because one of his critics had a respectful dinner with him?

Give me a break.

Trump will be held accountable in the way that he has always been: by the Constitution's checks and balances and by robust scrutiny of his policies and actions. But that doesn't mean Maher shouldn't have dined with him. Indeed, Krauze's flamboyant historical comparisons of Trump make Maher's key point for him: while name-calling absurdity might be a key marker of Trump's public persona, relying on similar tactics to deal with him is pointless. Nor, as the 2020 and 2024 elections attest, do those tactics actually serve an effective political strategy.

Yes, we should emphasize that Trump dishonors his office and his oath with his public tirades against his fellow citizens and close allies. Yes, we should emphasize that Trump appears determined to variably disregard the law and see how far he can stretch it. Yes, we should admit this is bad for America.

Nevertheless, the ability to meet and disagree respectfully is intrinsic to the still-young American experiment. It is good for America that Maher and Trump have just shown a shared example of how this is still possible. Neither Trump nor Maher appear to have ended their political disagreements since this dinner. On the contrary, Maher emphasized that he remains ardently opposed to many of Trump's policies. The difference between Maher and too many of his fellow liberals is that he has recognized that there's no alternative to talking. As he put it, what's the alternative? “Don't talk?”

Moreover, always approaching Trump through the prism of existential fear and absolute fury suggests a rather pathetic regard for America's enduring system of checks and balances. Perhaps I'm delusional, but I strongly suspect that Trump will soon learn that it is the Supreme Court that says what the law is and which can enforce the law against his wishes.

It would be one thing had Maher gone to the White House and come out saying Trump is right about everything. But that isn't the case. Maher lamented the “nasty crap” that Trump had posted to social media the night before the dinner. He said he had criticized several of Trump's policies to his face, including telling the president, “I'm not going to pull my punches that presidents get to propose a third term for themselves. [Trump] understood that and without animus.” Maher added, “That doesn't mean he's not going to try to do it.”

PUTIN'S CHRISTIAN NATIONALIST MIRAGE

All this said, the easiest repudiation of Krauze's suggestion that Maher “was played” is the most basic one. If America is so far gone that a Republican president and a liberal comedian should no longer be able to disagree amicably, then this dinner is the very last thing we have to worry about.

Regrettably, perhaps that's Krauze and company's point. But if so, they need to pause, take a breath, and recognize that their breathlessness is at odds with the sentiment of the vast majority of the people and the enduring power of their institutions. And that petulant fury carries no positive dividends.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified a Biden administration plan to counter domestic terrorism established in the months following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. 

Gabbard declassified former President Joe Biden's Strategic Implementation Plan for Countering Domestic Terrorism at the prompting of conservative groups, including America First Legal. 

AFL wrote in a letter to Gabbard on April 2 about its concerns regarding the Biden administration's “weaponization” of its power in the name of maintaining national security through “censoring disfavored speech on the Internet by labeling such speech ‘misinformation,' ‘disinformation,' ‘hate speech,' ‘domestic terrorism.'”

Gabbard wrote on X on April 5 in response to the AFL letter thanking the group “for your work.”

“We are already on this, and look forward to declassifying this and other instances of the government being weaponized against Americans,” she wrote, vowing to “bring transparency and accountability to end the weaponization of our intelligence community.”

The 15-page declassified plan from June 2021 established four pillars it hoped to achieve: understand and share domestic terrorism-related information, prevent domestic terrorism recruitment and mobilization to violence, disrupt and deter domestic terrorism activity, and confront long-term contributors to domestic terrorism. 

The plan called to “drive other executive and legislative action, including banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,” a frequent effort from Democrats.

The Biden administration also called for sharing with “relevant technology and other private-industry companies” information concerning domestic terrorism.

The proposal also encouraged the “teaching and learning of civics education that provides students with the skill to fully participate in civic life,” including by promoting “literacy education for both children and adult learners and existing proven interventions to foster resiliency to disinformation.”

The plan also talked about “advancing inclusion in the nation's COVID-19 response” and working to “increase voter participation and service as nonpartisan poll workers.”

Biden's summer 2021 outline even garnered the criticism of the American Civil Liberties Union, which called it a reflection of the “ever-expanding authority to surveil and monitor American communities.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A little-known Islamic sect is looking to establish its own state in Albania, equivalent to an Islamic Vatican City.

There are over two billion Muslims in the world today, making up roughly a quarter of the global population. The overwhelming majority, 87%-90%, are Sunni Muslims, while the remaining 10%-13% are Shia Muslims. These totals can be further broken down into minor heterodox sects, including Ismailis, Alawites, and Druze. One of the smallest sects is the Bektashis, an esoteric Sufi order generally considered to be under the Shia umbrella.

Bektashis make up a minuscule percentage of the Muslim population; estimates of the total number of Bektashis vary widely from 7 million to 20 million.

Despite their small number, the Bektashis are set to form the world's newest country — a first-of-its-kind Islamic microstate in Tirana, the capital of Albania.

The Bektashi Order's name comes from Haji Bektash Veli, a 13th century Sufi mystic. The belief system evolved to become a tolerant, humanistic syncretic combination of Shia Islam, Christianity, and pre-Anatolic religions. It gained prominence as the official religion of the Janissaries, the Ottoman Empire's elite infantry made up of enslaved Christian boys from the Balkans. Many Albanians converted to Bektashism, helped along by its lax approach to rituals and religious tolerance.

After Sultan Mahmud II crushed the Janissaries in 1826, he launched an empire-wide crackdown on the faith. The organization survived in Albania and rural areas of Anatolia until it was banished from the latter in 1925 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the secular founder of the modern Republic of Turkey. The faith's headquarters moved to Albania.

The order found itself persecuted once again after World War II when the communists took power under dictator Enver Hoxha. All religions were persecuted under the new state atheist country, sending Bektashism underground. The fall of communism in the 1990s brought Bektashism back into the light and back into the good graces of the public.

The head of the Bektashi Order, Baba Mondi, claims 50% of Albania is Bektashi – the true total is around 5%. What isn't in dispute is the religion's widespread popularity in Albania, enjoying good relations with Catholics (8.4% of Albanians), Orthodox Christians (7.2%), and orthodox Muslims (45.9%). Bektashism is commonly held up as a symbol of Albania's religious tolerance and good works, often praised alongside Albanian Catholic Saint Mother Teresa.

Part of their popularity stems from their key role in the development of Albanian nationalism in the 19th and 20th centuries, according to Professor Ayfer Karakaya-Stump, an expert on Bektashism who works with the Midwest Alevi Cultural Center. Mondi served as an officer in the Albanian People's Army for nearly a decade.

Bektashis are especially unique among Muslims for their lax social beliefs, such as their acceptance of alcohol consumption. They speak highly of all other religions, have a good relationship with Israel, decry all violence, and shun politics. Despite its adherents' small numbers, Bektashism is often called Albania's only true “national religion.”

It's little wonder, then, that the biggest backer to grant them their own country is Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, a lapsed Catholic. He announced the planned creation of the state in a United Nations speech on Sept. 21, 2024.

“Albania may be a small country, but it has given the world good examples. We have shown it with the Jews, with the Afghans, we have given the world the youngest saint, Mother Teresa, whose life embodied love for humanity, reminded us that not all of us can do great things, but we can do little things with great love. This is the principle that Albania stands for, this is what we want to act with, this is the source of our inspiration, to support the transformation of the Center of the Bektashi World Order, into a sovereign state within Tirana, as a new center of union and peaceful tolerance,” he said.

A more cynical reading of Rama's move is a bid to counter his poor image internationally.

If created, the Sovereign State of the Bektashi Order would swipe the title from Vatican City as the world's smallest country. It would be several times smaller than its Catholic peer.

Bektashis are also closely linked with Alevis, a syncretic heterodox Islamic ethno-religious group, largely residing in Turkey. The Alevis are mainly Çelebî, who believe Veli, the original Bektashi mystic, had biological descendants, while the Albanian Bektashis belong to the Babagan branch, who believe he was celibate. Relations between the two are complex.

Though Rama showed his support, becoming the world's next country is a complicated matter.

In 2025, several sizable territories with their own governments, military, and social services aren't recognized as states. These are nearly all secessionist states that are still claimed by their parent nation, such as South Ossetia and North Abkhazia in Georgia and Transnistria in Moldova – all of which enjoy the backing of Russia. Kosovo enjoys the recognition of much of the Western world but is still claimed by Serbia.

While the exact definition of what makes a state is complicated, universal or near-universal recognition is a good litmus test. The Sovereign State of the Bektashi World Order's first challenge will be gaining widespread recognition. This will be an easier task than the aforementioned countries, as its territory is being willingly offered up by its host country. It is also likely to enjoy the backing of the world's largest superpower.

“Extremely high. I don't see why we won't,” columnist and foreign policy expert Michael Szanto replied when asked if the U.S. would recognize the new state. “They're a really good friend to us and Israel. They're a really good friend of Europe as well… They are a very proud, happy member of NATO.”

He added that Albania even fought off Soviet influence during the Cold War, though only to become more isolationist.

Another ally on shakier grounds with the U.S., Turkey, could give much-desired recognition to the Bektashi state. Though Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is often viewed as a Sunni hard-liner, he's moved to give the group greater freedom and recognition within Turkey, Szanto said.

Karakaya-Stump, the professor, said Turkey's approach is hard to guess, with two conflicting political impulses at play. Alevis make up anywhere from 10-20% of Turkey and mainly subscribe politically to secular nationalism or secular leftism, putting them at odds with Erdogan's religious nationalism. Their beliefs make them some of Erdogan's main domestic opposition, with the president often wielding sectarian attacks against them. In some cases, the president has described protests where Alevis are present as Alevi uprisings in order to isolate them from the Sunni majority, Karakaya-Stump said.

On one hand, Erdogan's hostility to the Alevis could push Turkey to advocate against a representative for them on the international stage. But Karakaya-Stump echoed another theory, that the establishment of a Bektashi state could be a way to expand Ankara's influence in the Balkans.

Karakaya-Stump said the “Turkish government, in its foreign policy vis-à-vis the Balkans, highlights the Turkish past of the Balkans. They are trying to appropriate these Bektashi historical sites as a Turkish, Ottoman heritage.”

However, the Bektashi state could wield its influence in another way that's been floated by some analysts. The Alevis have found a sympathetic cause in the plight of the Syrian Alawites, another heterodox Islamic group subject to persecution by the Sunni majority. After the fall of the Assad government on Dec. 8, the populace has been subjected to persecution and pogroms, such as the mass killings in March. Turkey is the biggest supporter of the new government.

Only states can bring another state forward to the International Court of Justice, leading some to speculate that the Bektashi state could level a case of human rights abuses against Damascus.

The battle for recognition is likely to be decided in the Muslim world, with other large Muslim powers including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia playing a key role. Iran, which could oppose the country on religious grounds, could just be ignored altogether.

According to Szanto, the U.S. “might not even care if Iran opposed it. But if key players in the Muslim world, from even Pakistan… and key figures in the Muslim world who are reasonably mainstream positive figures, do not oppose this, I certainly don't see why we would oppose it when it's being sponsored by a country that is very friendly to the United States and to NATO.”

Szanto was dismissive of worries that the small state could become a tax haven or vehicle for money laundering. He argued that business interests would view the manipulation of a religious group as too great a risk.

“It would not be something that a major American or European or Asian company is likely to do, because … if you were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, or London Stock Exchange, you would face major backlash. It would be seen as very shady,” he said.

“If their plan to be recognized in the UN was successful, it would not be a viable conduit for money laundering or a tax haven because it would be too readily fixed by major economies around the world. And by that I mean largely legislation and then also executive action,” Szanto added.

ALBANIA LAWFARE? HOW BIDEN AIDED SOROS'S FAVORITE NARCO-STATE

Szanto outlined a way in which Bektashis could exercise outsize influence, though they make up just a tiny fraction of Muslims, comparing them to the Catholic Jesuits or Chabad movement within Orthodox Judaism. In both cases, the small group exercises far greater influence beyond their numbers, with many non-Catholics going to Jesuit schools for a good education. The Bektashi state could exert a similar kind of influence.

“I think that even Muslims who may not want to accept the religious teachings of this group could still be inspired by the positive, peaceful, multidenominational aspects, the idea of bridging the divide between different religions and embracing different cultures and religions,” he argued.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

California is like the rest of the country in at least one way.

When it comes to picking a new president and governor, they want somebody new.

In a new Emerson College Polling-Inside California Politics-Hill survey out Thursday, more Californians than not said they don't want former Vice President Kamala Harris to run for governor next year.

It was close, though, with 50.4% responding “No” and 49.6% saying “Yes.”

Name recognition has propelled Harris to the top in that race, at 31%, but she is losing to “undecided” at a whopping 39%. Harris is a former California senator, and she lost the 2024 election to President Donald Trump.

The president has grown more impulsive, more vindictive, and more anarchic.

Last Monday, Donald Trump, seeking to fortify public support for his massive, across-the-board tariffs, posted: “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!).”

By Wednesday, Trump had caved. His witless, incoherent, and incompetently executed policies—his administration had imposed tariffs on an Australian territory that is home to no people but to many penguins—created a financial panic that risked devastating the American economy and triggering a global recession. Trillions of dollars of stock-market value evaporated in a matter of days.

A man who has spent most of his life, and much of his presidency, gaslighting the public ran into the brick wall of reality. Misinformation, disinformation, bullying, and nasty social-media posts proved ineffective. Stock and bond markets weren't intimidated by the threats of the aging president.

Trump fought reality, and reality won.

WE'RE FEWER THAN 90 DAYS into Trump's second term; many more collisions between the president and the real world will come. So what can we expect, based on what we've witnessed?

Read: I should have seen this coming

We won't see qualities from Trump that we haven't seen before, but we will see them in a more extreme version. He is more impulsive, more vindictive, and more anarchic than in his first term. “He's at the peak of just not giving a f--- anymore,” a White House official familiar with Trump's thinking told The Washington Post. “Bad news stories? Doesn't give a f---. He's going to do what he's going to do.”

Trump is America's Mad King.

Compounding the problem is that the president has surrounded himself with men and women who are utterly loyal to him, unwilling to challenge him, and certainly unable to contain him. (The praise lavished on Trump by the members of his Cabinet during their meetings would make even Kim Jong Un blush.)

On top of that, this is an administration filled with third-rate intellects, conspiracy theorists, and misfits. They aren't qualified to manage Oak Hill, Alabama, or Monowi, Nebraska, let alone the federal government. Their combination of maliciousness and incompetence has produced enormous, dangerous, and in some cases lethal disruptions. Some examples:

Boasberg said he would begin contempt proceedings, unless the administration found a way to give the men a way to exercise “their right to challenge their removability through a habeas proceeding,” even if they were to remain in El Salvador while they did so.

“The Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial orders—especially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold it,” Boasberg wrote. Allowing political leaders to defy court judgments would make “a solemn mockery” of “the constitution itself.”

This kind of malicious incompetence is evident in almost everything Trump and those in his administration touch. You can be sure, too, that there are many more similar acts of ineptitude we don't yet know about. And Trump still has more than 1,350 days to go.

THE SECOND TRUMP PRESIDENCY, more even than the first, will be defined by Trump's authoritarian desires and his ineptitude. It might be that the latter impedes the former; ruthless efficiency can help in the dismantling of democratic institutions, but having an administration filled with freaks and fools can impede that effort and catalyze public disaffection and even resistance.

We're already seeing that reflected in a handful of election results, in mass protests across the country, in focus groups and public-opinion polls, and in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index, which provides a snapshot of the U.S. economy's health. Early this month, we learned that index had hit its second-lowest reading since 1952, dragged down by fears of higher prices and unemployment. Expectations for inflation hit the highest level in 44 years.

But here's the danger: Vindictive narcissists like Trump hold grudges and harbor resentments, blame everything on someone else, and weaponize information. They have a mean, even sadistic, side, belittling others to feel better about themselves and using, abusing, and discarding people.

Read: How American can avoid becoming Russia

Empathy is, to them, an alien quality. When they begin to feel like the walls are closing in; when their external validation, sense of superiority, and grandiosity are threatened; when they experience setbacks or humiliating public failures, they can approach what is known as “narcissistic collapse.” This can lead to intense feelings of rage and acts of aggression, to agitation, and to increased impulsivity and distortions of reality.

So as the second Trump administration careens from one failure to another, as unhappiness with the president rises, as events and reality refuse to bend to his will, he will become darker and crueler and more unstable. His advisers, all of whom are afraid to stand up to him, will enable him. And the MAGA movement, more cult-like than ever, more walled off from reality than ever, will stay with him until the end.

Leaders who have been worse—more ruthless and more skilled than Trump—have been stopped, and few nations have been blessed by a system of government as wise and resilient as what our Founders created. Many of our institutions are stronger than those in most other nations. So Trump is hardly invincible, and many millions of Americans will not give up without a fight. My hope and expectation is that they will prevail, that America will prevail, but it will come at quite a cost. It didn't have to be this way. There are 77,302,580 co-authors of this catastrophe. They have left a crimson stain on this Republic.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Trump's pick for U.S. attorney is a Russian-state-TV darling.

The United States of America is still a free country, and every private citizen has the right to speak to anyone, anywhere in the world, about anything. If the propaganda arm of an avowed enemy of the West calls and invites you to bash your own nation in public, you are free to do so. It might not be the most patriotic or sensible choice, but it's your privilege.

If you also would like to join the Department of Justice as a United States attorney, however, you should expect that appearing on the state television outlet of a neofascist dictatorship and engaging in conspiracy-laden anti-American rants might attract some attention—especially if it seems like you've tried to hide those appearances from the U.S. Senate committee responsible for voting on your nomination. And if you're an ordinary American citizen, you should certainly be wary of any aspiring Justice Department official who gladly contributes to Russian propaganda efforts.

Ed Martin is the Trump administration's nominee to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. A failed political candidate and former chairman of the Missouri Republican Party, he is now a right-wing podcaster and social-media figure—and a January 6 truther who believes that Justice Department lawyers are the president's personal consiglieri. He has also, however, been a regular commentator on RT America, the English-language flagship for the Kremlin's propaganda efforts until it was dropped by major content providers after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It has since gone off the air, but in its time, it featured Larry King, among some lesser American lights. (For example, have you been wondering whatever happened to Scottie Nell Hughes, who years ago shilled for Donald Trump on CNN? Me neither, but in watching Martin's segments, I learned that she ended up at RT.)

Martin, according to The Washington Post, was a guest some 150 times on RT America and its sister outlet, Sputnik, from 2016 to 2024. Now, everyone can make a mistake; public commentators sometimes find themselves on outlets that turn out to be wifty venues, or unexpectedly paired with guests they might otherwise avoid. But to appear 150 times—occasionally partnered up for friendly banter with unsavory characters such as George Galloway, a pro-Putin British politician who was kicked out of the Labour Party more than 20 years ago for, among other things, encouraging Arabs to fight British soldiers, and who has long been accused of various extremist views—suggests a genuinely comfortable relationship with the outlet. (For the record, over the course of my academic career as a professor of national-security affairs, I was occasionally invited to appear on RT America. I always declined.)

Perhaps, one might hope, Martin agreed to appear so that he could be a voice of probity and reason in the face of Russian disinformation, exactly the qualities one would appreciate in a U.S. attorney. Not a chance: He was more often the source of conspiracy theories and anti-American accusations, all delivered with the kind of cheerful confidence that always translates well on television.

I watched several of his appearances, which are still available on RT's website. One major theme emerges: Russia is usually right and America (at least when led by anyone other than Donald Trump) is usually wrong.

Martin, for example, accused the U.S. government of nefarious doings just before Russia's second invasion of Ukraine, in 2022; Washington, he said during an appearance in February of that year, was “driving what's happening in Europe,” while Putin was only trying to seek talks and a “clear peace.” This was apparently part of a long pattern. The Post also documented some of Martin's statements on RT, including his false claim that a 2017 Syrian chemical-weapons attack—one to which Trump responded with force—was a situation “engineered” in Washington “by the people that want war in Syria.” (If his nomination as U.S. attorney doesn't pan out, he could always become a spokesperson for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, whose worrisome views he seems to share.)

The day after his defense of Putin, Martin returned to RT to accuse President Joe Biden of seeking war with Russia now that the United States had left Afghanistan. (It makes no sense, of course, that Biden would try to start a war in Europe right after paying such a tremendous political price for ending America's longest war, but as the frat boys said in Animal House: “Forget it, he's rolling.”) Biden's people, Martin said, “have a vision of regime change everywhere they look,” and he castigated then–National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan for creating a crisis by publicly sharing U.S. intelligence about Russia preparing for a massive attack on Ukraine.

Of course, the Kremlin was preparing for an attack, and the Biden administration was trying to deter Putin from moving by showing that the Russians had lost any element of surprise.

Beyond his parroting of Russian talking points about Syria and Russia, Martin also had plenty to say about the United States, which he depicted as a repressive nation in the grip of dark forces. “If you say elections are bad in America in 2020, you'd probably be arrested or de-barred”—I assume he meant disbarred—“or attacked in some very specific way,” he said in December 2023, oblivious to the irony that he was speaking on the television outlet of an authoritarian state. “Big Tech and Big Media are backed up by Big Government, and they're forcing the message” about a looming war in Ukraine, he said in January 2022. Even that wasn't the first time he made such accusations. “The largest threat to democracy in the world,” he declared in November 2021, “is the American media,” not least because they bought the “Russia hoax,” which Martin claimed landed ostensibly innocent people in jail. (Here, Martin name-checked the former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, who was convicted of multiple crimes, including tax fraud and conspiracy against the United States, before being pardoned by Trump.)

Again, Ed Martin is an American who can speak to anyone he chooses. The University of  Chicago professor John Mearsheimer, who has staked his long and distinguished academic reputation on the now-laughable position that the West is to blame for the Ukraine war, came to Martin's defense when contacted by the Post: “Although the U.S. government and other governments have been waging war on RT for some time, it is not illegal for an American to appear on its shows.”

Lots of things aren't illegal, but many things are unwise or even patently stupid. And no one was “waging war” on RT America, unless correctly identifying and opposing it as a relentless source of Russian disinformation is “war.” Major American cable and satellite providers decided to stop paying for it after Russia's war of aggression began in 2022: Unlike Radio Liberty and the Voice of America, important news organizations with wide followings that are under attack by the Trump administration, RT America had the support of its government but lost its audience.

Mearsheimer has claimed that Martin's appearances are a matter of free speech, and indeed they are. But 150 hits on Russian media not only reflect poor judgment—unless Martin was unaware of what RT America was, which would be a problem in itself—they also have provided a trove of comments that should be of deep concern to senators who must decide whether to vest him with the power of a U.S. attorney. Martin seems to understand how bad it all looks: According to the Post's reporting, he somehow avoided informing the Senate about these guest shots when he was first nominated. A spokesman for Martin told the Post that he “disclosed all of the identified links in a supplemental letter to the Senate” over the past two days, but CNN reported this morning that Martin also initially neglected to list several other appearances on right-wing media in the United States.

Of course, in Trump's political orbit, defending Russia while slagging America is hardly a disqualification for office, especially because the president himself has been doing the same for years. Certainly the Russians seem happy: Margarita Simonyan, the editor in chief of RT in Russia and Putin's top propagandist, said yesterday on X that Martin's record “proves only that appearing on RT 150 times can do wonders for your career.” Getting a pat on the back from a cheerleader for Russian war crimes is not exactly the kind of endorsement that should lead to the confirmation of a U.S. attorney.

Martin's willingness to become a regular commenter on Russian television is a significant warning sign about his lack of prudence and his evident political extremism. Worse, he apparently gambled that his appalling comments might be forgotten once RT America shut down, a deceptiveness that should give pause to the Senate before it approves a fringe-dwelling conservative media personality for a sensitive position in the United States government.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Political pressure must be brought to bear—through the courts, the press, and the states, but also applied to legislators while they still have any power left.

Based on polls, election results, and the markets, Americans seem to be awakening, if only slowly, to the magnitude and nature of the threat they face. President Donald Trump and his allies in power are trying to erect an authoritarian Mafia state like the one Vladimir Putin and his cronies established in Russia. The American opposition talks of “undermining democracy” and “constitutional crisis”—but for the most part, its legislators, activists, and political strategists are pursuing politics as usual. They shouldn't be.

If this sounds alarmist, forgive me for not caring. Exactly 20 years ago, I retired from professional chess to help Russia resist Putin's budding dictatorship. People were slow to grasp what was happening there too: Putin's bad, but surely he'll stop short of—and you can fill in the blank with a dozen things he did to destroy Russia's fragile democracy and civil society, many of which Trump is doing or attempting to do in America today.

Attacking the press as fake news and the enemy of the state? Check. Delegitimizing the judiciary, the last constitutional brake when the legislature is co-opted and feckless? Check. Expanding influence over the economy by threatening businesses and using tariffs to introduce a crisis and a spoils system? Check. Creating a culture of fear by persecuting unpopular individuals and groups? Been there, done all of that.

Putin is still in the Kremlin, and I'm writing this from New York City—my family has made its home there, as well as in Croatia, since we were forced to leave Russia in 2013. America's institutions and democratic sentiment are far stronger than in the flawed, fragile state Putin took over from Boris Yeltsin 25 years ago. Russia was a mere eight years removed from Soviet totalitarianism when it elected a KGB lieutenant colonel who restored the Soviet anthem and called the fall of the U.S.S.R. the “greatest geopolitical catastrophe” of the 20th century.

Americans, by contrast, have a well-stocked toolbox with which to defend their democratic institutions, if only they would use it. The press is still free; its only limitations are self-imposed. The economy is strong, even though Trump is working hard to put a stop to that. (People who feel economically insecure, or who depend on the government for their daily bread, don't often rise up against it. Instilling a feeling of helplessness, a lack of control, is a key ingredient of authoritarianism. For example, the uncertainty created by Trump's tariff flip-flops are anathema to consumer and business confidence, but uncertain citizens are more likely to follow a strongman.) American federalism and the separation of powers are not trivial for a would-be autocrat to overcome. Political pressure must be brought to bear—through the courts, the press, and the states, but also applied to legislators while they still have any power left.

The American opposition should spend less time criticizing the content of the administration's executive actions—eliciting sympathy for a deported individual, say, or decrying the impact of Trump's tariffs on 401(k) plans—than focusing on its suspect methods. The real crisis is the lack of due process in the deportations, to take the first example, and the president's assumption of Congress's power to levy taxes, to take the second. Sure, Trump loves tariffs, in other words—but he mostly loves exercising power, and his slate of arbitrary levies, unilaterally imposed by the executive, is a power grab.

Never lose sight of the fact that the Trump administration's aim is to weaken and devalue the machinery of government, on one hand, and privatize the levers of power on the other. It is accomplishing all of this at a breakneck pace. Supporting a would-be autocrat because you like his policies (say, on DEI or transgender athletes) is a terrible trap, because soon enough, your opinions and support won't matter at all. But making opposition to the policies the centerpiece of resistance also risks missing the point. America is hurtling toward the loss of its democratic institutions and the establishment of an authoritarian state where there will be no civil discussion of these issues at all: That's what a principled opposition must fight with its full might.

Spelling out these stakes every day, like Senator Cory Booker did in his record-breaking 25-hour speech at the beginning of the month, is vital. Call hearings, press conferences, protests—everything that can be done to draw attention to the attacks on institutions. Explain due process, and contrast it with illegal or incorrect deportations, as families are torn apart. Don't let Elon Musk and his vandals pretend that what they are doing is about efficiency when their actions are a rounding error at best in the budget.

Here is another tactic that makes sense for political give-and-take within a democracy, but not as a means of fighting for democracy's life: picking your battles. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer may have thought he was doing exactly that when he caved to Republican pressure to pass the budget. He had a legal means of countering Trump's autocratic agenda—rallying his party to refuse to advance the Republican spending bill—but he declined to use it. In regular democratic politics, passing on one battle to fight again another day is normal. But when fighting for democracy, you never know if there will be another day. Fight everywhere you can, always, or you will soon be as irrelevant as the Russian Duma became under Putin's centralized executive authority.

Another recommendation: Attacking Trump's character, however abhorrent critics may find it, is futile. The president is not acting alone. In contrast to his bumbling first term, he now has a professional script, stage managers, and a plan. Project 2025 is the product of political machinery that has sprung up around Trump that seeks to tear out the roots of American democracy and then salt the ground. To accomplish this, the Trump administration, much like Putin's team in Russia, focuses on fear and enemies, not on constructing a brighter future. It will never be tempted to reconcile or coaxed by bipartisan outreach. So set aside the specifics of Trump's agenda and your distaste for him as a person. Resist on every level, at every opportunity, instead of picking this or that battle. Shout from the rooftops about the attacks on process and democracy, not just the policy content.

Since Trump's inauguration, Americans have filed numerous legal complaints challenging specific cuts or orders that Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency have made. After all, what authority does Musk, as a private individual, have to collect government data, decide which federal officials to fire, or allocate resources as he sees fit? Musk and Trump have turned their fire on judges who reject the legality of their actions.

Taking DOGE to court is necessary work—by all means, throw sand in the gears at every opportunity—but it's not sufficient. That's because Musk, like Russian oligarchs, has proximity to power, but he doesn't actually have legal authority. To eject his influence means bringing the fight not just to him, but to the elected offices where power still resides.

Americans had probably better get used to learning Russian, so I'll offer a political term from our lexicon: понятие, ponyatie (pon-YAH-tee-yeh), which doesn't quite have an English equivalent but can be translated roughly as “an understanding.” The understanding of most citizens is that proximity to power is itself a form of power, that “we all know who is really calling the shots.” What we are seeing with DOGE is an example of this phenomenon—the ponyatie that Musk, as a rich man who exercises great influence over Trump, wields tremendous governmental authority despite not having an official title or a constitutional role. The ponyatie that state power can be marshaled against his critics and rivals, while he is immune to it himself. Acquiescence to that kind of thinking must be stopped before it is allowed to permeate the American political system.

Read: Putin won

To that end, Americans should invest their time and money fighting in the arena where political power still lies: with the American people and in Washington, D.C., with the handful of Republican representatives who could put a stop to the power grab. Go after the weakest links and call them out. Promise to support them against Musk's threats to fund primary challenges if they defy him—and to raise millions against them if they don't. Don't give up on the levers of political power prematurely. Use them, or they will disappear, and marching in the street will be the only recourse—one that I can tell you from painful personal experience doesn't always work out.

The Trump administration has been cunning in choosing its first targets. Deporting supposed gang members and Hamas supporters without due process may violate any number of statutes, but forcing oppositionists to defend these people's rights allows the administration to paint them as defending their ideas. Not every battle will be as favorable as standing up for cancer research or veterans' benefits.

This is why the resistance must center the principles at stake. Does America have rule of law or not? The first line in defense of an incipient police state is: “You don't have anything to fear if you've done nothing wrong.” This fallacy is soon replaced by: “It could happen to anybody,” as the regime sees the value of using arbitrary persecution to spread fear. Again, fear is the autocrat's goal, as is simply doing many things every day. Even if you don't like him or his policies, the longer he is there, doing things, the more the autocrat starts to feel inevitable, like the sun rising each morning.

In politics, as in physics, force is mass times acceleration. The administration is mounting a barrage of attacks, with great urgency, to break through the resistance of American legal structures, sometimes by using legal and relatively popular policies (deporting convicted criminals, for example) as cover for likely illegal and relatively unpopular policies (deporting immigrants without due process). The fabricated urgency is a tell: No war, no terrible crisis, compels the president to violate the Constitution. But the administration is breaking down norms and setting precedents faster than judges can stop it. Of course, ignoring judges is also part of the plan.

To fight this onslaught means staying focused. Skip the culture wars, where the ground can easily tilt to favor the MAGA faithful. Concentrate instead on defending American rights and values against billionaires and autocrats who want to take them away. Just because you can't compete with Trump on populism doesn't mean you can't be popular, and polls already suggest that the public believes the president should obey court orders and give Ukraine more aid.

The opposition needs to proudly defend the value system and ingenious framework that made this country great. This may sound corny to cynical Americans who have taken democracy for granted for most of their lives, but it matters. The leaders of the resistance, if such can be found, must serve as spokespeople and examples of these values and institutions if they are to provide a genuine counter to Trumpism.

Read: The new authoritarianism

Rallying to the defense of American constitutional democracy has become alarmingly difficult after years of insistence, from both the far left and the far right, that the system is irreparably broken. The good news is that Trump and Musk may be reminding Americans about what they stand to lose, and to whom, as was evident in the gloating response of Democrats to the Wisconsin Supreme Court election, which Musk's preferred candidate lost.

Americans can just look to their leaders' avowed models should they wonder whether things could be worse. The GOP has moved so far to the right that it's ideologically aligned with Turkey and Russia. The Trump administration's refusal to criticize Putin may well owe to its hopes to emulate him, much as Putin's rehabilitation of Stalin's legacy tracked with policies that duplicated the Soviet dictator's. And Musk has expressed admiration for Xi Jinping's China, a repressive one-party state where he has business interests.

Four votes in the Senate. Three votes in the House. That's all it takes. Find the weakest links. Go after them, democratically. Fundraise for them if they stand up, or against them if they don't. The two-party system in America right now is Traitors versus Losers. Playing to win means asking every red-state legislator if they are fine with being in the Traitor Caucus.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

If Donald Trump can disappear people to El Salvador without due process, he can do anything.

Donald Trump's most frightening power grab was undertaken with an undertone of sinister jocularity. There was no column of tanks in the streets, no burning of the legislature. The president and his partner in despotism, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, were bantering amiably in the Oval Office in front of the press corps, mocking the American court system with evident delight.

Trump's ploy is almost insultingly simple. He has seized the power to arrest any person and whisk them to Bukele's notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, where they will be held indefinitely without trial. Once they are in Bukele's custody, Trump can deny them the protections of American law. His administration has admitted that one such prisoner, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was sent to El Salvador in error, but insists that it has no recourse. Trump, who has threatened the territorial integrity of multiple hemispheric neighbors, now claims that requesting the return of a prisoner he paid El Salvador to take would violate that country's sovereignty.

Neither Trump nor Bukele bothered to make this absurd conceit appear plausible. Even as Trump and his officials claim that only El Salvador has the power to free wrongfully imprisoned American residents, the United States is paying El Salvador to hold the prisoners. (Naturally, Congress never appropriated such funds; Trump has already seized large swaths of Congress's constitutionally mandated spending power for himself.) Bukele told reporters, “I don't have the power to return him to the United States.” Trump, not even attempting to maintain the pretense that the two countries were somehow at an impasse, told his counterpart, “You are helping us out, and we appreciate it.”

The play was signaled early on, after a judge ordered Bukele to return prisoners seized without due process. In response, Bukele posted on X, “Oopsie… too late 😂.” Trump can snatch prisoners and hand them to Bukele before the courts can act, and Bukele can ignore American court orders.

And so Trump has opened up a trapdoor beneath the American legal system. This trapdoor is wide enough to swallow the entire Constitution. So long as he can find at least one foreign strongman to cooperate, Trump can, if he wishes, imprison any dissident, judge, journalist, member of Congress, or candidate for office.

Adam Serwer: The constitutional crisis is here

If this sounds hyperbolic, bear in mind that Trump has expressed his desire to do these things. He has built an administration dedicated to turning his whims into commands, however fantastical or dangerous they may be, and he has systematically disabled every possible check on his power by training his party's voters and elected officials to treat dissent as betrayal.

The execution of this strategy has hardly been flawless. (If the administration had the chance to do it again, it would probably have taken care to ensure that the test case for its maneuver concerned an actual gang member, which very few of the deportees to El Salvador appear to be.) Still, in contrast to the shambolic, halting rollout of Trump's tariffs, the transformation of the world's oldest democracy into a competitive authoritarian system—rivaling that of Bukele's regime in El Salvador, Viktor Orbán's in Hungary, and Vladimir Putin's in Russia—has the earmarks of careful planning. Every element of Trump's assault on democracy was broadcast well in advance.

It has been widely observed that Trump entered his second presidency surrounded by slavishly loyal acolytes who would not dare defy his wishes. But even this understates the degree of the danger. Trump's closest allies are not merely acquiescing to his desires; they are fueling them. In the years before Trump returned to office, a key faction of Republican activists and intellectuals radicalized themselves against fundamental democratic norms. They came to believe that their survival required gaining control of the state and using it to destroy their opponents. Now in power, they have begun to apply this strategy across a wide array of fronts, coercing law firms, universities, media owners, and other bastions of civil society. Trump's determination to use immigration power as a limitless weapon to intimidate and imprison his enemies is not just a manifestation of his character. It is the most frightening element of his administration's plan to crush liberal democracy itself.

The Trump administration's illiberalism has two main sources. One is the personality at the center of its cult. Donald Trump gravitates instinctively toward despots, sees the constraints that democracies place upon elected leaders as a form of weakness, and refuses to accept the legitimacy of any electoral or judicial proceeding that goes against him. His authoritarianism is sub-intellectual, rather than a philosophy of governance.

Trump's personal contempt for liberal democracy has been augmented by a growing school of “post-liberal” thought on the right, with liberal referring not to the American center-left, but to the broader philosophical tradition that emphasizes that the state be governed by neutral rules that all sides agree to abide by. The post-liberal right believes that the left poses an existential threat to American society, and must be extinguished through the harsh use of state power. What makes this power illiberal is that its proponents don't believe the state has a general right to employ these weapons; they believe only their side is entitled to do it.

J. D. Vance represents the intellectual side of Republican illiberalism. He has spoken at the National Conservatism Conference, a gathering of post-liberal thinkers on the right dedicated to using state power to entrench right-wing control of society. “There's this thing called national conservatism, and it is vibrant and young people are excited about it,” he told a reporter in 2021. In addition to listening to previously marginal post-liberal thinkers on the right, Vance has soaked up ideas from Orbán, whose use of government power to crush the opposition has made Hungary a model for national conservatism.

David Brooks: The terrifying future of the American right

The ideas that have circulated on the post-liberal right are important to grasp, because they closely predict the second Trump administration's behavior thus far. Many figures may have claimed that they would influence Trump's policy agenda—you may recall Wall Street Republicans confidently predicting before the election that Trump's proposed 10 percent tariff would never happen—but the post-liberal right is the faction that turns out to have its hands on the wheel.

This group experienced Trump's first term as a discouraging failure culminating in a humiliating defeat. They blamed the fiasco not on Trump, but on a vast conspiracy to undermine him, stretching from the federal bureaucracy to higher education to the media. National conservatives believe that these sectors have all been captured by the far left, via what they call a “long march through the institutions,” which can be uprooted only through brutal application of government power.

The post-liberals are not completely imagining the rise of left-wing social theory or its spread through elite spaces; the spate of social-justice panics and cancellations over the prior decade was very real. What's striking is their interpretation of these events. They might have understood the spike in left-wing censoriousness as an abuse of power, or perhaps as a political gift handed to them by their enemies, as the fear of being canceled made Democrats hesitant to challenge electorally unpopular left-wing ideas within their own camp.

Instead, the post-liberals saw left-wing illiberalism as a powerful weapon used to take down Trump. They have accordingly set out to replicate it. “The Right's longstanding proposal—to ‘cancel cancel culture'—might make for a good slogan, but it is not sufficient as a governing philosophy,” Chris Rufo, a Manhattan Institute fellow and influential Trump-administration adviser, wrote earlier this year. “We should propose a new set of values that expands the range of acceptable discourse rightward” and “enforce just consequences on political opponents who violate the new terms.”

Vance, in an interview last year, characterized the opposition to Trump as completely unprincipled. “The thing that I kept thinking about liberalism in 2019 and 2020 is that these guys have all read Carl Schmitt—there's no law, there's just power,” he said. “And the goal here is to get back in power.” I've never heard of a progressive citing Carl Schmitt, a notorious right-wing German theorist who influenced the Nazis, as a theoretical model. Yet his imagined (or, dare I say, projected) influence over the left became transmuted into the conviction that Trump lost because he and his supporters had failed to match the left's will to power.

This helps explain why the second Trump administration has behaved so differently from the first. The characters staffing and advising this administration are far more radical. The previous Trump White House allowed all kinds of kooks and extremists into its ranks, but the new version has pushed the boundaries even further. Darren Beattie, who briefly got a job in the first Trump administration before being fired over ties to white nationalism, was welcomed back into the new administration. Marko Elez, a staffer for Elon Musk, lost his DOGE job over recent social-media posts explicitly endorsing racism; Vance intervened to restore him. Laura Loomer, a conspiracy theorist once banished from Trump's orbit, was able not only to brief the president, but to persuade him to fire half a dozen senior national-security officials.

At the same time, Trump has taken care to exclude any appointees who might hesitate on moral, legal, or practical grounds to implement his proposals. His most effective technique has been to use January 6 as a screening device, filtering out any potential staff who condemn the insurrection or refuse to repeat his claim to have won the presidential election in 2020. Trump's failed attempt to overturn that election posed a mortal threat to his career at the time, but what didn't kill him made him stronger. The insurrection became the perfect tool to purge his party's remaining pro-democracy faction.

Jack Posobiec is an embodiment of the transformed environment. Once a marginal social-media influencer known for circulating the Pizzagate conspiracy theory and promoting white-nationalist accounts, he is now treated by mainstream Republicans with the kind of respect once afforded to George F. Will. Vance blurbed Posobiec's latest book about the left, Unhumans, and two Cabinet secretaries have already invited him to join their overseas delegations this year.

The combination of these changes has completely altered the character of advice Trump receives and the range of beliefs considered acceptable within his administration. With regard to democratic norms, the ideas circulating around Trump range from indifference to overt contempt. Where the first Trump administration contained a mix of authoritarian Trump loyalists and traditional Republicans, this one consists of authoritarian Trumpists egging one another on.

Trump's showdown with the Supreme Court over the Abrego Garcia case has surfaced two ideas in particular that have been gestating for years on the right. One is the use of deportation authority not only to enforce immigration law but to intimidate Trump's political critics. Another is to defy court orders.

A year and a half ago, Posobiec posted on X, “We used to strip foreign-born anarchists and communists of citizenship and deport them. Laws still on the books. Just planting seeds.” Another user replied, “Yes. We started a new denaturalization project under Trump. In 2025, expect it to be turbocharged.” That was Stephen Miller, now Trump's deputy chief of staff and the architect of much of his policy agenda, above all on immigration.

Vance has been publicly floating the idea of ignoring court orders for years. “If I was giving him one piece of advice, fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state,” Vance said of Trump in 2021. “Replace them with our people. And when the courts—because you will get taken to court—and when the courts stop you, stand before the country like Andrew Jackson did and say, ‘The chief justice has made his ruling. Now let him enforce it.'” He has repeated versions of this idea in subsequent interviews.

Why has the administration risked the brinkmanship of defying a unanimous Supreme Court ruling in order to sustain its policy of disappearing people without due process, when it has so many other available tools to handle border enforcement? Possibly it is just extremely stubborn. But there is also considerable evidence that the administration wants to preserve this constitutional loophole in order to use it more broadly to intimidate opponents.

Stephen I. Vladeck: What the courts can still do to constrain Trump

In his meeting with Bukele, Trump stated that he wants to expand deportations to El Salvador to American citizens. (“Homegrowns are next,” he said to Bukele. “The homegrowns. You gotta build about five more places. It's not big enough.”) Asked if his deportation plan includes American citizens, he replied, “Yeah, that includes them—you think they're a special type of people or something?” He reaffirmed the position on Fox News the following day.

The president depicted this method as a response to hardened criminals. (This is scarcely a defense—even the worst offenders are entitled to the protections of the Constitution.) But it's important to understand that Trump habitually equates opposition, or any deviation from his goals, with illegality. He has labeled as criminals all three of his electoral opponents, a wide swath of media organizations, and many other people who made the mistake of publicly criticizing or disagreeing with him. Just days before his meeting with Bukele, he ordered the Justice Department to investigate the former cybersecurity official Chris Krebs for having “falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen.”

Trump's allies in the administration have adopted this habit. Elon Musk has called the United States Agency for International Development, a decades-old program with support in both parties, a “criminal organization.” Republican politicians and media routinely depict protests against Tesla as part of a conspiracy to commit domestic terrorism, conflating a tiny handful of acts of vandalism with mass-scale peaceful protests.

The enthusiasm for expanding denaturalization should be understood in this context. “What's going to be on the horizon are denaturalization cases,” Mike Davis, a conservative lawyer who has worked with the administration, told Axios last month. In 2023, Davis posted threats to denaturalize and deport the anti-Trump opinion journalists Mehdi Hasan and Tim Miller: “@mehdirhasan is now on my Lists 2 (indict), 4 (detain), 6 (denaturalize), and 3 (deport). I already have his spot picked out in the DC gulag. But I'll put him in the women's cell block, with @Timodc. So these whiny leftists don't get beat up as often.”

These threats probably contain an element of performative trolling. But one pattern of Trumpism is that its most outrageous notions appear first as jokes, allowing them to be processed and denuded of shock value, before eventually being assimilated into Trump's actual policy platform. High-profile conservative pundits such as Will Chamberlain and Charlie Kirk have proposed to denaturalize and deport Ilhan Omar; Chamberlain has proposed the same treatment for Hasan and Derek Guy, who runs a popular X account focused on menswear and routinely mocks the fashion choices made by MAGA figures. After Maryland's Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to inquire about the status of Abrego Garcia, the “Trump War Room,” the official account of the president's political operation, posted a photo mock-up depicting Van Hollen covered in gang tattoos, as if to suggest that he, too, belongs in Bukele's dungeon. In the sea of ideas in which Trump and his advisers swim, deporting the libs is an established trope.

The Occam's-razor explanation is that these people genuinely want to deport their political opponents without due process. The administration has certainly claimed the power that would enable it to do so. “They have the temerity to say that every single invader should get their own individual judicial trial before they are deported,” Miller ranted on Fox News earlier this month. “One at a time, each one gets a $1 million trial in front of a communist judge to decide whether or not we can send them home.” Without due process, of course, an “invader” is simply anybody Trump labels as such.

During Trump's first term, fears of his authoritarian tendencies largely ran ahead of his actions. This time around, the opposite has occurred. Trump has fulfilled or exceeded his critics' most hysterical-sounding predictions. He has mostly persisted with his trade war, but an incipient bond-market crisis seems to have spooked him into trimming its wildest excesses. His war on liberal democracy, by contrast, has not generated the kind of blowback that Trump has reason to care about. Why would he stop?

“Ideas have consequences,” the conservative philosopher Richard Weaver wrote in 1948. The post-liberal right's ideas about revenge and power are currently the most influential ideas in the world. Their implications need to be taken with deadly seriousness.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Tesla is scaling back Cybertruck production.

The electric car maker has dropped production targets for several Cybertruck lines over the past few months, two workers with knowledge of the targets told Business Insider. Some lines are running at a small fraction of their previous capacity, and the company has thinned out a handful of Cybertruck production teams by more than half, these workers said.

Since January, the carmaker has continued to move some workers from the line for the Cybertruck, which is made at its Texas Gigafactory, to the Model Y line, four workers said.

""It feels a lot like they're filtering people out,"" one of the workers said. ""The parking lot keeps getting emptier.""

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

During the first three months of 2025, Tesla sold 6,406 Cybertrucks, Cox Automotive estimated, half that of the previous quarter. Before the truck's release, Musk said Tesla had more than 1 million reservations for the vehicle. To date, it has delivered fewer than 50,000 Cybertrucks, a March 20 recall filing said.

In April, Tesla unveiled its cheapest version of the truck, a $70,000 rear-wheel-drive variant.

Tesla sales more broadly have been trending downward. This year's first-quarter delivery results, which are seen as a proxy for sales, showed a 13% drop from the same period in 2024.

The most recent Cybertruck production shift follows similar moves made in December, when the carmaker notified workers it would change Cybertruck production schedules and surveyed workers on their preferred roles. At the time, workers said they were told the company planned to scale back production targets for the electric pickup truck for the first quarter of 2025.

Tesla's lower delivery numbers come at a time when the company is facing pressure from all fronts. Competitors are edging in to compete with Tesla's aging lineup, demonstrators are staging protests outside showrooms, and the company's stock is down about 40% year to date.

Shares of the carmaker are still up more than 53% from this time last year.

During a press conference at the White House last month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk promised to double the company's vehicle production rates in the US over the next two years.

In February, during the company's biannual performance reviews, Tesla asked managers to identify which roles on their teams were vital to the company, three current and former workers said. The company first added the query to employee reviews in February 2024. Workers were also ranked on a scale of one to five. The company eliminated a small percentage of staff during the reviews, two people said.

Vladimir Putin has ordered his government to draw up a new legal framework for companies seeking to invest in Russia. It's the most concrete sign yet that Moscow is preparing for a day when it believes sanctions will be lifted and some investment welcomed back.

But, said one Kremlin official, “nobody is knocking on the door yet” underlining the tentative nature of the approaches taken by companies — some of whom never fully left — to restoring their operations in the country, as US President Donald Trump pushes for a deal to end Russia's war in Ukraine.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The US buyout firm could profit from pulling the UK's Thames Water out of distress. That's better than the alternative — giving the job to creditors.

Restoring the flow. 

KKR & Co. is eyeing one of the riskiest deals going right now — buying the owner of London's creaking water and sewage system, Thames Water. Giving a private equity firm the chance to profit from fixing the mess Thames got into under past private ownership looks bad but makes sense. The snag is that a transaction will require painful negotiations with, and between, the creditors who hold the cards.

Thames has two big financial problems: It has too much borrowing, and it needs to raise £4 billion ($5.3 billion) to deliver its capital expenditure program in full. Hence the company is exploring a debt restructuring. In parallel, it appointed KKR as preferred bidder last month after canvassing interest from new investors. Due diligence is now hastily underway.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Chip Wars:

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. isn't engaged in discussions to form a venture or share its technology with any company, its top executive said, dismissing persistent speculation that the Taiwanese company is negotiating a tie-up of some sort with ailing chipmaker Intel Corp.

Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei, responding to questions about a possible Intel collaboration, said TSMC remained focused on its own business. He didn't directly address a report by the Information in April that the two had struck an initial agreement to set up a joint venture to operate Intel's chip plants.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

After months of avoiding conflict with Trump, the head of the Federal Reserve shared his views on tariffs, spending cuts and threats to central bank autonomy.

Getting into it.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is pushing back against President Donald Trump after deftly avoiding confrontation for months. In a question and answer session Wednesday, Powell portrayed chaotically implemented tariffs as plainly bad for the economy; slammed the approach taken by the Department of Government Efficiency; and issued a legal defense for why he thinks he can withstand any attempt by Trump to fire him. At a time of rising concern about Fed independence, he did us all a favor by showing he's laser-focused on the central bank's core goals and will fight to be able to keep it that way.

Predictably, Trump immediately proved this point again on Thursday. In a post on Truth Social, he said the Fed should have cut interest rates already and “Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., warned Thursday that U.S. markets will ""crash"" if Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell can be fired by President Donald Trump.

The comment from Warren, a frequent Powell critic, on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" came hours after Trump griped that the Fed chair's ""termination cannot come fast enough!""

A senior White House official later told CNBC that Trump's broadside should not be seen as a threat to fire Powell, and that there are no plans being made to end his term early. 

Powell has previously said the president does not have the power to fire him.

""I have tangled with [Powell] on a regular basis about both regulations and interest rates,"" Warren acknowledged in her remarks at the New York Stock Exchange.

""But understand this: If Chairman Powell can be fired by the president of the United States, it will crash markets in the United States,"" she said.

Warren, the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, explained that the ""infrastructure"" upholding the stock market — and therefore the global economy — is ""the idea that the big pieces move independent of the politics.""

If key economic levers are ""subject to a president who just wants to wave his magic wand,"" then the U.S. will be indistinguishable ""from any other two-bit dictatorship around the world,"" she said.

Trump has repeatedly singled out Powell by name while urging the U.S. central bank to lower interest rates in hopes of spurring rapid economic growth.

The Fed hiked rates during President Joe Biden's presidency in order to tamp down the rampant inflation induced by the coronavirus pandemic, but started dialing them back in 2024.

But the Fed under Powell has said it is in no hurry to continue those cuts, pointing to the uncertainty created by Trump's shape-shifting tariff policies. Powell reiterated that stance Wednesday in a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, saying the president's import taxes are ""likely to move us further away from our goals.""

In a Truth Social post Thursday morning, Trump slammed Powell as being ""always TOO LATE AND WRONG"" while defending his wide-ranging tariff plans.

Powell should have lowered rates ""long ago, but he should certainly lower them now,"" Trump wrote. ""Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!""

In this article

Alphabet's Google illegally dominated two markets for online advertising technology, a federal judge said on Thursday, dealing another blow to the tech titan in an antitrust case brought by the U.S.

U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, ruled that Google unlawfully monopolized markets for publisher ad servers and the market for ad exchanges which sit between buyers and sellers. Antitrust enforcers failed to show the company had a monopoly in advertiser ad networks, she wrote.

The ruling could allow prosecutors to argue for a breakup of Google's advertising products. The U.S. Department of Justice has said that Google should have to sell off at least its Google Ad Manager, which includes the company's publisher ad server and its ad exchange.

Google will now face the possibility of two different U.S. courts ordering it to sell assets or change its business practices. A judge in Washington will hold a trial next week on the DOJ's request to make Google sell its Chrome browser and take other measures to end its dominance in online search.

Google has previously explored selling off its ad exchange to appease European antitrust regulators, Reuters reported in September.

Brinkema oversaw a three-week trial last year on claims brought by the DOJ and a coalition of states.

Google used classic monopoly-building tactics of eliminating competitors through acquisitions, locking customers in to using its products, and controlling how transactions occurred in the online ad market, prosecutors said at trial.

Google argued the case focused on the past, when the company was still working on making its tools able to connect to competitors' products. Prosecutors also ignored competition from technology companies including Amazon.com and Comcast as digital ad spending shifted to apps and streaming video, Google's lawyer said.

Neurotech startup Precision Neuroscience on Thursday announced that a core component of its brain implant system has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a major win for the four-year-old company.

Precision is building a brain-computer interface, or a BCI, which is a system that decodes neural signals and translates them into commands for external technologies. The company's BCI will initially be used to help patients with severe paralysis restore functions such as speech and movement, according to its website.

Only part of Precision's system was approved by the FDA on Thursday, but it marks the first full regulatory clearance granted to a company developing a wireless BCI, Precision said in a release. Other prominent startups in the space include Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Synchron, which is backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.

""This is a foundational moment for Precision,"" Dr. Benjamin Rapoport, Precision's co-founder and chief science officer, said in a statement. Rapoport also helped co-found Musk's Neuralink in 2017 before departing the following year.

The piece of Precision's system that the FDA approved is called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface. The microelectrode array is thinner than a human hair and resembles a piece of yellow scotch tape. Each array is made up of 1,024 electrodes that can record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain's surface.

When it is placed on the brain, Precision says it can conform to the surface without damaging any tissue.

The FDA authorized Layer 7 to be implanted in patients for up to 30 days, and Precision will be able to market the technology for use in clinical settings. This means surgeons will be able to use the array during procedures to map brain signals, for instance. It is not Precision's end goal for the technology, but it will help the company generate revenue in the near term.

Precision has temporarily implanted the Layer 7 in 37 patients so far, and CNBC observed one case at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York last April. Until this point, the implementations have taken place for short periods, often a matter of minutes or hours, on patients who were already undergoing brain surgery for a medical reason. 

Now, because of the FDA clearance, the company will be able to collect data for much longer periods of time.

""This regulatory clearance will exponentially increase our access to diverse, high-quality data, which will help us to build BCI systems that work more effectively,"" Rapoport said.

Everyone is trying to assess how President Donald Trump's tariff policies will or could affect their lives and industries. In the sports world, the resulting economic uncertainty will likely do more harm than the tariffs themselves.

I asked WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert (this week's ""On The Record"" guest) if market turbulence in recent weeks has affected ticket sales for the upcoming season that begins May 16.

""Not this season, for sure, because most of our arenas are already sold out,"" Engelbert told me. ""So I'm not worried this year, but certainly as we go forward, if we were to enter into a deep recession of some sort, then you start to look again at scenario plans and contingency plans around that.""

As the private equity firm Arctos Partners said last week in a note to clients, sports are fairly well protected from recessions because ""the underlying business model of sports benefits from exceptional stability due to long-term, contracted revenues across media rights, sponsorship and ticketing and enjoys sticky, largely domestic demand.""

A recession typically goes hand-in-hand with a dip in advertising spending. Logically, companies such as automakers or toymakers that might see demand fall as tariffs raise prices could pull back on advertising to save money. Still, several big media companies told me that they haven't seen any significant effect on ad spend yet heading into next month's industry-wide upfront presentations. 

Sports, in particular, will probably be the last events to lose advertising tonnage. Fans watch games live and can't skip ads. Sports and league executives expressed confidence that scripted entertainment would feel more of the pain if companies retrench. Alex Weprin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a good piece about this yesterday. 

Some sports may also benefit from decreased travel – a phenomenon United Airlines said this week is already happening. Consumers could attend local sporting events for entertainment instead of going on pricier vacations. Last month's consumer confidence reading hit a 12-year low.

But one place where the sports world may feel the effects is in media consolidation – or lack thereof. Legacy media companies including Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Global and Comcast want to change their asset mix. Comcast is moving forward with spinning out most of its cable networks, including CNBC. Paramount Global is trying to merge with Skydance Media. 

No company's CEO has been more vocal about the need for a light regulatory touch on mergers and acquisitions than Warner Bros. Discovery boss David Zaslav.

""We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to be even better,"" Zaslav told reporters at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley conference last year.

Consolidation is a big deal for the sports world. All three of Warner Bros. Discovery, Comcast and Paramount own major sports rights, including some of the biggest packages of rights for the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Hockey League and Major League Baseball. 

Zaslav hoped a Trump victory would bring the deregulation he wanted. Not only has that not happened yet (Paramount's deal with Skydance is still awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission, prompting the first of potentially two 90-day extensions), but wild market swings have made any type of consolidation virtually impossible.

While Trump claims to love the art of the deal, the administration's economic policies have ironically stymied Zaslav's dealmaking plans.

Paramount Global would love to close its agreement with Skydance, fix Paramount Pictures by adding to its movie slate, and then merge with another studio, according to people familiar with the matter. Warner would be near or at the top of that list, the people said. 

But if Zaslav doesn't want to wait, I'm told he may still pivot and split his company into two – a low-debt entity housing his streaming service Max, the studio, the gaming division and the company's content library, and a second company with WBD's cable networks and free over-the-air European assets, which would house news and sports.

No decisions have been made on this front yet, but WBD has hired bankers to work on options which include a potential split, according to people familiar with the matter. The Financial Times first reported this idea almost a year ago – quickly following up that Zaslav had decided a breakup wasn't a good idea. Still, I'm told WBD hasn't ruled it out if the board thinks it's the easiest way to facilitate asset reallocation because other deals aren't on the table. Warner Bros. Discovery has already internally split its legacy linear assets from the streaming and studio business, making a move far easier. 

The NBA was concerned WBD might not have the balance sheet heft to pay $2 billion a year (or more) for league rights for the next 11 years when it struck its most recent TV deal last year. If Zaslav were to split the company, the non-streaming entity that owns sports rights – including MLB, NHL, French Open, March Madness, NASCAR, and more – will be even smaller.

If that's the direction Zaslav goes, it'll take about ten seconds for pundits to start predicting what types of combinations could come next – likely starting with Comcast's SpinCo and RemainCo (which will still house NBCUniversal and Peacock). 

Breaking up the company doesn't require regulatory approval or glorified bribes to the Trump administration, as Michael Wolff reported earlier this week. Neither does forming new cross-company streaming bundles – another possibility once Paramount has more clarity on its future. A recession is probably worse news for the fourth or fifth-most popular streaming service (see: Max, Paramount+, Peacock) than it is for a company like Netflix – which, by the way, reports quarterly earnings this afternoon. I'll be listening to the Netflix conference call for any insights into how that company is viewing Trump's policies. 

Warner Bros. Discovery has already paused non-critical business travel, first reported by Oliver Darcy's Status newsletter. I can add a little more detail – I'm also told the company has temporarily frozen non-critical hiring and is being cautious about other expenditures, such as how many employees to send to Cannes Lions, the industry's annual advertising extravaganza in Southern France — a location where Zaslav himself threw a big party just two years ago.  

A Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson declined to comment.

In this article

Elon Musk's SpaceX and two partners have emerged as frontrunners to win a crucial part of President Donald Trump's ""Golden Dome"" missile defense shield, six people familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Musk's rocket and satellite company is partnering with software maker Palantir and drone builder Anduril on a bid to build key parts of Golden Dome, the sources said, which has drawn significant interest from the technology sector's burgeoning base of defense startups.

In his January 27 executive order, Trump cited a missile attack as ""the most catastrophic threat facing the United States.""

All three companies were founded by entrepreneurs who have been major political supporters of Trump. Musk has donated more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and now serves as a special adviser to the president working to cut government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency.

Despite the Pentagon's positive signals to the SpaceX group, some sources stressed the decision process for Trump's Golden Dome is in its early stages. Its ultimate structure and who is selected to work on it could change dramatically in the coming months.

The three companies met with top officials in the Trump administration and the Pentagon in recent weeks to pitch their plan, which would build and launch 400 to more than 1,000 satellites circling the globe to sense missiles and track their movement, sources said.

A separate fleet of 200 attack satellites armed with missiles or lasers would then bring enemy missiles down, three of the sources said. The SpaceX group is not expected to be involved in the weaponization of satellites, these sources said.

One of the sources familiar with the talks described them as ""a departure from the usual acquisition process. There's an attitude that the national security and defense community has to be sensitive and deferential to Elon Musk because of his role in the government.""

SpaceX and Musk have declined to comment on whether Musk is involved in any of the discussions or negotiations involving federal contracts with his businesses.

The Pentagon did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters, only saying it will deliver ""options to the President for his decision in line with the executive order and in alignment with White House guidance and timelines.""

The White House, SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril also did not respond to questions.

In an unusual twist, SpaceX has proposed setting up its role in Golden Dome as a ""subscription service"" in which the government would pay for access to the technology, rather than own the system outright.

The subscription model, which has not been previously reported, could skirt some Pentagon procurement protocols allowing the system to be rolled out faster, the two sources said. While the approach would not violate any rules, the government may then be locked into a subscription and lose control over its ongoing development and pricing, they added.

Some Pentagon officials have expressed concerns internally about relying on the subscription-based model for any part of the Golden Dome, two sources told Reuters. Such an arrangement would be unusual for such a large and critical defense program.

U.S. Space Force General Michael Guetlein has been in talks on whether SpaceX should be the owner and operator of its part of the system, the two sources said. Other options include having the U.S. own and operate the system, or having the U.S. own it while contractors handle operations. Guetlein did not respond to a request for comment.

Retired Air Force General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, a top SpaceX advisor to Musk, has been involved in the company's recent discussions with senior defense and intelligence leaders, the two sources said. O'Shaughnessy did not respond to requests for comment.

Should the group led by SpaceX win a Golden Dome contract, it would be the biggest win for Silicon Valley in the lucrative defense contracting industry and a blow to the traditional contractors.

However, those long-standing contractors, such as Northrop Grumman, Boeing and RTX are expected to be big players in the process as well, people familiar with the companies said. Lockheed Martin put up a webpage as a part of its marketing efforts.

The Pentagon has received interest from more than 180 companies keen to help develop and build the Golden Dome, according to a U.S. official, including defense startups like Epirus, Ursa Major and Armada. Members of the White House's National Security Council were briefed by a handful of companies about their capabilities, four sources said.

The Pentagon's number two, former private equity investor Steve Feinberg, will be a key decision-maker for Golden Dome, two U.S. defense officials said.

Feinberg co-founded Cerberus Capital Management which has invested in the cutting-edge hypersonic missiles industry but not in SpaceX. Feinberg, who did not respond to a request for comment, has said he would divest of all his interests in Cerberus when he joined the administration.

Some experts believe the overall cost for Golden Dome could reach hundreds of billions of dollars. The Pentagon established several timelines for capabilities to be delivered starting with early 2026 to those delivered after 2030.

SpaceX is pitching for the part of the Golden Dome initiative called the ""custody layer,"" a constellation of satellites that would detect missiles, track their trajectory, and determine if they are heading toward the U.S., according to two sources familiar with SpaceX's goals.

SpaceX has estimated the preliminary engineering and design work for the custody layer of satellites would cost between $6 billion and $10 billion, two of the sources said. In the last five years, SpaceX has launched hundreds of operational spy satellites and more recently several prototypes, which could be retrofitted to be used for the project, the sources said.

Reuters reviewed an internal Pentagon memo from Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth issued shortly before a February 28 deadline to senior Pentagon leadership asking them for initial Golden Dome proposals and calling for the ""acceleration of the deployment"" of constellations of satellites.

The time frame could give SpaceX an advantage because of its fleet of rockets, including the Falcon 9, and existing satellites that could be repurposed for the missile defense shield, the people familiar with the plan said.

Despite these advantages, some of those familiar with the discussions said it was uncertain whether the SpaceX group would be able to efficiently set up a system with new technology in a cost-effective way that can protect the United States from attack.

""It remains to be seen whether SpaceX and these tech companies will be able to pull any of this off,"" said one of the sources. ""They've never had to deliver on an entire system that the nation will need to rely on for its defense.""

By most metrics, employees have never been more disconnected from their work. Employee engagement in the U.S. fell to its lowest level in a decade last year, with roughly 31% of employees engaged, according to Gallup. Workers also are losing confidence in their company's future, with that sentiment falling to a record low, according to Glassdoor, leading many to either quit, or perhaps worse, stick around and do less.

Pete Stavros, co-head of global private equity at KKR, said that when he meets with CEOs and asks them how their employees are feeling, it often results in vague responses: ""There's not a tremendous amount of insight,"" he said.

When KKR runs its own set of worker surveys across the companies in its portfolio, ""The results consistently surprise CEOs to the downside. They're like 'Wow, yeah, I didn't know it was that bad.'""

Stavros has been championing a strategy that he believes can solve some of these issues, born out of his own decades of experience across hundreds of private equity deals but also his father's career journey working for a small construction company in Chicago: employee stock ownership.

""These programs can really meaningfully move the needle on culture when they're well implemented,"" he said. ""These are outcomes that build wealth for workers, make them happier on the job, more engaged, and less likely to quit, and that's what it's done for companies.""

At its most basic, the goal of employee stock ownership plans is to award all workers, not just the most senior executives, with equity in the company as part of retirement planning. Advocates like Stavros say that broadening stock ownership within corporate America can help to address several critical issues for companies but also for workers, which includes worker retention, engagement and happiness, but also wealth inequality, financial illiteracy and the broader fraying of the social fabric of society.

Stavros has led the push via KKR's deals in the industrial and manufacturing sectors, transitioning companies to shared ownership models in the process. The strategy has had some big successes, and big payouts for workers.

For example, KKR acquired CHI Overhead Doors for roughly $600 million in 2015, and in the process created a program where even hourly workers at the company received stock on top of their regular wages and benefits. When KKR sold CHI Overheard Doors to steel producer Nucor for $3 billion in 2022, CHI's employees collectively received more than $360 million as a result, with the vast majority of that going to workers below the C-suite level.

However, to date, the growth of ESOPs has been relatively stagnant, with about 250 companies each year forming as one and it largely being contained to smaller industrial companies.

Stavros said there are several reasons why, from regulatory complexity and tax issues that don't benefit larger companies, to litigation risk and a structure that appeals to companies with just a few shareholders.

However, he's placed his support behind updates to the federal law that governs employee-stock ownership plans.

""Without policy, we're not going to reach our aspirations, which are to have a transformational impact on the way companies operate,"" said Stavros, who added that his Expanding ESOPs coalition not only has the support of more than 50 organizations, foundations and service providers, but also bipartisan support in Washington, D.C.

The moment may not be right, Stavros said. ""The government has a lot going on ... when the time is right, we'll make a big bipartisan push to try and get this law modernized.""

Meanwhile, his efforts to spread the message of employee ownership continue, alongside CEOs and workers alike who praise what it's brought to their companies.

Wayne Berson, the CEO of BDO USA, said as his professional services firm was considering a variety of restructuring options in 2023 ranging from a private equity buyout to becoming an M&A buyer, the idea of how to keep workers engaged, motivated and with the firm into its future, especially amid talent shortages in accounting, kept coming up.

""We were looking at several business models, and we were looking for a business model that supported continued growth, investment and long-term stability,"" Berson said. ""But while we were doing that analysis on our business model, we were also looking at a second issue of people.""

Berson said a few numbers kept coming up, one in particular that stuck: at the nearly 6,000 ESOPs across the U.S., average staff turnover then was at 5.9%, while BDO's was at 18% (albeit less than the 39% seen across its industry).

""Any CEO is looking at the future. How do you create a sustainable business, and one that's profitable at the same time?"" Berson said. ""The more we looked at it, the more it became clear that if you really do care about people, this in my mind is the only way to go.""

Berson said in the nearly two years since, the decision has been proven correct. The firm has lowered its turnover rate, attracted new workers because of the employee ownership strategy, and anecdotally, engagement among workers is up.

""Every firm is unique and has unique considerations, but for us, this was the only choice for our future growth based on how we feel about people,"" he said. Berson said his leadership team has often used the term 'We before me.""

""We wanted to put it in practice; we wanted to be able to steward a thriving future for all,"" he said.

When Kevin Sims was in the process of being hired as a technician at Web Industries, a Massachusetts-based aviation and medical product manufacturer, he was told by human resources that the company was 100% owned by its employees through its ESOP structure.

At first, Sims said he didn't really understand what that meant but was happy to have a stable position after bouncing between jobs for a stretch of time. However, because of those job changes, he hadn't been able to set himself up well for retirement, something that was looming in his mind as he made his way through his 40s as a single father.

But as he started to learn more about what an ESOP was, and he started to receive statements explaining how his ownership in the company was growing, he quickly realized the benefits.

""It really just changed my life,"" Sims said. ""It gave me this sense of confidence.""

It also changed his relationship with work. Sims said in other jobs, ""It was like I'm just clocking in and clocking out and getting a paycheck."" But in this role, he said ""I come in every day like it's my first day because that's how proud I am of what I do and what this company has offered me.""

Sims said that sense of ownership is apparent among his fellow workers, who all feel like they share in the successes and challenges that the company faces, whether that's the pride he felt when Sims and his coworkers manufactured blankets that were used in space, to offering suggestions to the company about ways it could save money by being less wasteful with supplies, a strategy that was later implemented.

""The fact that I have a voice and faith in this company, it's like I got an opportunity to help us grow,"" he said. ""I think that's really cool, and I really brainstorm on how I can make us better and our team better; the fact that they actually listen and do it and implement it, it just makes me want to do everything 10 times better in my life.""

Mary Josephs, who previously led Bank of America's ESOP solutions group before founding her own ESOP advisory firm, Verit Advisors, said there have been a number of successes with ESOPs across middle market companies, but too often ""it's too complicated for very small businesses and too complicated for the very large and very, very valuable businesses, so the access to ESOP is very limited relative to the economy as a whole.""

At the same time, Josephs said simply implementing an ESOP doesn't guarantee anything. ""The culture that needs to complement the strategy takes intention,"" she said.

However, she said she has seen firsthand the way that the benefits from ESOPs have empowered workers both on the job and in their personal lives. ""If you come into work and you matter, and your contributions are going to help the firm and your family, you're going to go home a different person, you're going to contribute to your community differently, and that's what you see around employee ownership.""

Both Josephs and Stavros say while the ESOP structure isn't going to work for every company as things stand, there are several lessons that any company can learn from ESOP successes.

Stavros said at the core, that starts with trust building, which he said, ""is one of the real breakpoints today between management and workers."" 

The most common way to build trust is through sharing information, and that can be accomplished through highlighting financials or just a deeper roadmap into where the company is heading. Employee surveying is an important part of that also, as well as implementing requested changes with accurate timelines.

He also encourages companies to give workers ""more voice,"" pointing to the ""Kaizen"" principle practiced by Toyota, where all employees are encouraged to identify problems or potential fixes at the worksite to improve efficiency and eliminate waste.

""We've worked on more programmatic ways of giving people a feeling of control and input,"" Stavros said, highlighting the example of giving each manufacturing plant a million dollars a year, which workers can then ""invest in any way they see fit in improving their workplace.""

Stavros said there is also the opportunity for companies to embrace efforts around profit sharing and equity grants, things that can bolster retention and create more buy-in. Employee share purchase plans don't always have the same effect, he said, as they can be viewed as a trade of wages or benefits rather than being treated as a business partner.

""Conventional wisdom is only CEOs and C-suite people move the needle, they're the only ones who need ownership and we should concentrate that there,"" he said. ""This strikes at the Achilles heel of capitalism. Every economist would say capitalism is the best way to organize an economy, but the problem, as Winston Churchill said, is the unequal sharing of the blessings,"" he added. ""This strikes right at the heart of the problem, which is why I think it's such an important idea.""

In this article

Target CEO Brian Cornell will meet with the Rev. Al Sharpton this week in New York as the retailer faces calls for a boycott and a slowdown in foot traffic that began after it walked back key diversity, equity and inclusion programs, the civil rights leader told CNBC Wednesday.

The meeting, which Target asked for, comes after some civil rights groups urged consumers not to shop at Target in response to the retailer's decision to cut back on DEI. While Sharpton has not yet called for a boycott of Target, he has supported efforts from others to stop shopping at the retailer's stores.

""You can't have an election come and all of a sudden, change your old positions,"" said Sharpton. ""If an election determines your commitment to fairness then fine, you have a right to withdraw from us, but then we have a right to withdraw from you.""

The civil rights leader said he would consider calling for a Target boycott if the company doesn't confirm its commitment to the Black community and pledge to work with and invest in Black-owned businesses.

""I said, 'If [Cornell] wants to have a candid meeting, we'll meet,'"" Sharpton said of the phone call Target made to his office. ""I want to first hear what he has to say.""

A Target spokesman confirmed to CNBC that the company reached out to Sharpton for a meeting and that Cornell will talk to him in New York this week. The company declined further comment.

In January, Target said it would end its three-year DEI goals, no longer share company reports with external diversity-focused groups like the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equity Index and end specific efforts to get more products from Black- and minority-owned businesses on its shelves. 

Just days after the announcement, foot traffic at Target stores started to slow down. Since the week of Jan. 27, Target's foot traffic has declined for 10 straight weeks compared to the year-ago period, according to Placer.ai, an analytics firm that uses anonymized data from mobile devices to estimate overall visits to locations. Target traffic had been up weekly year over year before the week of Jan. 27.

The metric, which tallies visits to brick-and-mortar locations, does not capture sales in stores or online, but can indicate which retailers are drawing steadier business. While Target has been struggling to grow its sales for months as shoppers watch their spending, the stretch of declining visits came as some civil rights groups and social media users criticized the DEI decision and urged shoppers to spend their money elsewhere.

Target declined to comment on the figures, saying it doesn't discuss third-party data.

At the convention earlier this month for his civil rights organization, the National Action Network, Sharpton said the group would call for a boycott of PepsiCo if the company didn't agree to meet with the organization within 21 days. In February, the food and beverage company behind brands like Doritos and Mountain Dew announced it would end its DEI workforce representation goals and transition its chief DEI officer role into another position, among other changes.

This week, leaders from Pepsi met with Sharpton and his team. He did not confirm whether Pepsi made any commitments, but did say it was encouraging that Pepsi's CEO Ramon Laguarta attended. He added that the two will continue their discussions.

Sharpton's meetings with companies including PepsiCo and Target — and his openness to boycotts — mark one of the first meaningful efforts to push back against the war conservative activists like Robby Starbuck have waged on DEI. Starbuck, a movie director-turned-activist, has urged companies to drop DEI policies in part by sharing what he considers unflattering information about their initiatives with his social media followers. He has successfully pressured a wide range of corporate giants to rethink their programs.

With its decision to roll back DEI efforts, the cheap chic retailer Target joined Walmart, McDonald's, Tractor Supply and a slew of others that scrapped at least some DEI initiatives as they grew concerned that the programs could alienate some customers or land them in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump, who has vowed to end every DEI program across the federal government.

Target's decision contrasted with Costco, which shook off pressure from conservative activists to maintain its DEI programs. Shareholders of the membership-based wholesale club soundly rejected a proposal in late January that requested a report on the risks of DEI initiatives.

NAN has called for so-called ""buy-cotts"" at Costco, and has brought people to stores in Tennessee, New York and New Jersey. It gave them gift cards to shop with at the warehouse club.

In the month of March, Target's store traffic declined 6.5%, while the metric rose 7.5% year over year at Costco, Placer.ai data show.

Target's challenges run deeper than DEI backlash, and resistance to its policy change only added to its issues. The discounter's annual revenue has been roughly flat for four years in a row as it's struggled to drive consistent sales gains.

Margins have been under pressure, as consumers buy more of groceries and necessities and less of more profitable categories like home goods and clothing. And the company has pinned its problems on a laundry list of problems in recent years, including having the wrong inventory; losing money from theft, damaged goods and other types of inventory losses; backlash to its collection for Pride Month and pricier costs from rushing shipments.

Competition has grown fiercer too, as big-box rival Walmart has remodeled stores, launched new private brands and attracted more high-income shoppers.

In February, Target gave weak guidance for the first quarter and said it expected sales to grow 1% for the full year. 

In his meeting with Cornell, Sharpton said he will ask for Target to follow through on pledges it made after police killed George Floyd in the company's hometown of Minneapolis.

""You made commitments based on the George Floyd movement ... what changed?"" said Sharpton. ""Are you trying to say ... everything's fine now, because the election changed? That's insulting to us.""

In the wake of Floyd's murder, Cornell said the event moved him.

""That could have been one of my Target team members,"" Cornell said in 2021 at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago, recounting his thoughts as he watched the video of Floyd taking his final breaths.

At the time, he said it motivated him to step up Target's efforts to fight racial inequities.

""We have to be the role models that drive change and our voice is important,"" he said at the event. ""We've got to make sure that we represent our company principles, our values, our company purpose on the issues that are important to our teams.""

President Donald Trump on Thursday again called for the Federal Reserve to lower rates and even hinted at the ""termination"" of Chair Jerome Powell.

In a Truth Social post, Trump said:

""The ECB is expected to cut interest rates for the 7th time, and yet, 'Too Late' Jerome Powell of the Fed, who is always TOO LATE AND WRONG, yesterday issued a report which was another, and typical, complete 'mess!' Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS. Too Late should have lowered Interest Rates, like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now. Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!""

Indeed, the European Central Bank has been cutting rates as it tries to boost growth in the region. The ECB lowered rates again later Thursday.

To be sure, a senior White House official told CNBC that the post should not be seen as a threat to fire Powell, but rather as a reinstatement of Trump's frustrations with the Fed chief.

The post comes a day after Powell delivered a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago in which he noted that the administration's tariffs put the central bank in a tricky spot as it decides whether to tame inflation or boost growth.

""If that were to occur, we would consider how far the economy is from each goal, and the potentially different time horizons over which those respective gaps would be anticipated to close,"" Powell said. Those comments contributed to a steep sell-off on Wednesday.

This is not the first time Trump has criticized Powell's approach to U.S. monetary policy. Trump posted on April 4, two days after the administration's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement, that it would be ""a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates. He is always 'late,' but he could now change his image, and quickly.""

However, it is the first time Trump has explicitly called for Powell's firing. Powell has said the president does not have the power to fire him, noting that it is ""not permitted under the law.""

Powell's term as Fed chair ends in May 2026.

In this article

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company denied reports that the semiconductor giant was in active discussions with Intel regarding a chipmaking joint venture.

""TSMC is not engaged in any discussion with other companies regarding any joint venture, technology licensing or technology,"" CEO C.C. Wei said on the company's first-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, dispelling rumors about a collaboration with Intel.

Intel and TSMC were said to have been looking to form a JV as recently as this month. On April 3, The Information reported that the two firms discussed a preliminary agreement to form a tie-up to operate Intel's chip factories with TSMC owning a 21% stake.

Intel was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC on Wei's comments on Thursday. The company previously said it doesn't comment on rumors, when asked by CNBC about the reported discussions.

Once the dominant chipmaker in the U.S., Intel has faced numerous challenges in recent years, losing ground to players like Nvidia, AMD, Qualcomm and Apple. Last year, Intel suffered its worst ever performance as a public company, with shares shedding 61% of their value.

TSMC's denial of tie-up talks with Intel comes as President Donald Trump is pushing to address global trade imbalances and reshore manufacturing in the U.S. through tariffs. The Department of Commerce recently kicked off an investigation into semiconductor imports — a move that could result in new tariffs for the chip industry.

TSMC reported a profit beat for the first quarter thanks to a continued surge in demand for AI chips. However, the company contends with potential headwinds from Trump's tariffs — which target Taiwan — and stricter export controls on TSMC clients Nvidia and AMD.

This was CNBC's live blog covering the European Central Bank's April 2025 meeting.

The European Central Bank made yet another 25-basis-point interest rate cut on Thursday as global tariff turmoil has created widespread uncertainty and spurred fears about the euro zone's economic growth.

A rate cut was fully anticipated by markets, with a roughly 94% chance of a 25-basis-point trim being priced in ahead of the decision, according to LSEG data.

The cut takes the ECB's deposit facility rate, its key rate, to 2.25%. At its highs in mid-2023 it had been at 4%.

Tariff developments in recent weeks are widely seen by analysts and economists as a key reason for the ECB to cut interest rates. Even though many of the initial duties imposed by the U.S., as well as retaliation measures, have been put on ice or eased, fears about how they could affect economic growth have been rife.

In its policy statement, the ECB said that the ""outlook for growth has deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions.""

It added, ""Increased uncertainty is likely to reduce confidence among households and firms, and the adverse and volatile market response to the trade tensions is likely to have a tightening impact on financing conditions.""

The ECB on Thursday also said that ""the disinflation process is well on track.""

""Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around the Governing Council's 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis.""

The ECB appears open to further interest rate cuts after announcing a 25 basis point trim, according to Mark Wall, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank.

""The forwarding-looking view on the economy implies an expected shock from tariffs, and the characterisation of 'exceptional' uncertainty, implies an openness to further monetary easing assuming the trade shock persists and is borne out in the data,"" Wall said in a note.

""We continue to expect another rate cut in June and a terminal rate of 1.5% by year-end,"" Wall said.

This sentiment regarding further cuts was echoed by other economists and analysts, with Capital Economics Chief Europe Economist Andrew Kenningham saying the ECB was likely to cut rates at both its June and July meetings.

""We are in the presence of a negative demand shock,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said during a press conference as she noted that while some tariffs are in place, ""something that could be far more impactful"" could be on the horizon.

Lagarde said there would likely be some re-routing of goods supplied by markets that are facing higher duties, and other policies that do not necessarily link to trade, but fiscal matters and investments, were also at play.

She indicated that tariffs could have a negative impact on economic growth, while the ""net impact on inflation is less than clear at this point in time.""

Some of the factors at play could settle by the ECB's June meeting, but others would take longer to become more certain, she said.

— Sophie Kiderlin

Assessing the current level of monetary policy restrictiveness is ""meaningless,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said during a press conference.

Her comments after the ECB Governing Council removed a line characterizing the level of restrictiveness of monetary policy from its statement. Ahead of the ECB's decision, analysts and economists had been considering if, and how, the Governing Council would change its wording around this in its statement.

""While that assessment of the restrictiveness was meaningful, or made sense, to the extent that we were very far away from the destination, it is meaningless at this point in time,"" Lagarde said.

""Meaningless because assessing restrictiveness relies heavily on the comparison between the policy rates and the neutral rate,"" she said.

The concept of the neutral rate works for a world free of shocks, Lagarde said, suggesting that this did not match the current environment.

""So, that assessment of the restrictiveness is not operative anymore and what we need to do is to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance that will actually take us to our destination,"" which is the ECB's 2% inflation target, she said.

— Sophie Kiderlin

The ECB's decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points was unanimous, the central bank's President Christine Lagarde told CNBC's Annette Weisbach during a press conference.

""Options were debated but there was no one to argue in favor of a 50 basis point cut for instance,"" Lagarde said. ""25 basis points was definitely the rate cut on which all in the room agreed,"" she added.

— Sophie Kiderlin

ECB President Christine Lagarde said in a press conference that the economic outlook was ""clouded by exceptional uncertainty.""

""Euro area exporters face new barriers to trade although their scope remains unclear. Disruptions to international commerce, financial market tensions and geopolitical uncertainty are weighing on business investment,"" she said.

Consumers meanwhile could also become more cautious regarding spending, Lagarde said.

But, ""the euro area economy has been building up some resilience against the global shocks,"" she said, noting that the economy likely grew in the first quarter of 2025.

— Sophie Kiderlin

The ECB's 25 basis point interest rate reduction was ""an insurance cut Lagarde-style,"" ING's global head of macro Carsten Brzeski said in a note.

""Given the high level of uncertainty currently, 50bp might indeed have been a bridge too far today – but to some extent, today's rate cut decision is also an insurance cut,"" he said. ""Today's cut won't do any harm,"" he added.

Keeping rates unchanged meanwhile could have raised questions about whether the ECB was willing to bolster growth, and would have prompted ""a further and unwarranted strengthening of the euro,"" Brzeski said.

— Sophie Kiderlin

The ECB on Thursday said that ""especially in current conditions of exceptional uncertainty"" the central bank's Governing Council would ""follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance.""

Decisions would be based on the council's expectations for the inflation outlook given economic and financial data, as well as underlying inflation dynamics and the strength of monetary policy transmission.

""The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.""

— Sophie Kiderlin

Euro zone bond yields pared gains shortly after the interest rate cut announcement, with Germany's 10-year yield — the benchmark for the bloc — just below the flatline after earlier gains of more than one basis point.

Yield moves were largely muted following their recent spell of volatility spurred by tariffs. The German 2-year dipped to the flatline from a gain of three basis points. France's 2-year yield was nearly one basis point higher, slightly below earlier gains, while its 10-year yield also fell flat.

""All else equal, the ECB believes monetary policy will need to be more accommodative than previously expected,"" Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note.



— Jenni Reid

The ECB on Thursday warned that trade tensions have weakened the outlook for economic growth.

""The euro area economy has been building up some resilience against global shocks, but the outlook for growth has deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions,"" the central bank said in its monetary policy statement. 

""Increased uncertainty is likely to reduce confidence among households and firms, and the adverse and volatile market response to the trade tensions is likely to have a tightening impact on financing conditions. These factors may further weigh on the economic outlook for the euro area."" 

— Sophie Kiderlin

The ECB on Thursday cut interest rates by 25 basis points, as was widely expected ahead of the decision.

Markets had been pricing in an around 94% chance of such a cut, and an around 6% chance of a bigger, 50 basis point reduction.

This takes the central bank's deposit facility rate, its key rate, to 2.25% — down from highs of 4% in mid-2023.

— Sophie Kiderlin

The Euro was last lower against the U.S. dollar just after midday in London, as markets looked ahead to the ECB's interest rate decision.

At 12:33 p.m. London time, the euro was down around 0.3% against the greenback.

In the aftermath of sweeping U.S. tariffs initially coming into effect, the euro had strengthened, while the dollar declined, which caught many investors offguard.

— Sophie Kiderlin

European markets were slightly lower ahead of the ECB's interest rate decision, with the cross-regional Stoxx 600 last trading around 0.5% lower at 11:52 a.m. London time. 

Regional bourses were also widely in negative territory, with Germany's DAX down 0.6%, the French CAC 40 falling 0.8% and Italy's FTSE MIB trading 0.5% lower. 

— Sophie Kiderlin

Lower growth expectations have been a key factor in shifting market pricing toward an interest rate cut from the ECB, Jens Eisenschmidt, chief Europe economist at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC on Thursday.

""Of course the clear catalyst has been here the lower growth expectation coming out of April 2nd's announcement related to the U.S. tariffs,"" he told Julianna Tatelbaum.

An unexpected exchange rate reaction was also a factor, he added.

""More tariffs were previously associated with a lower value of the euro, hence inflationary. The opposite has happened and of course that has contributed to an expectation for the cut.""

Eisenschmidt said he does not believe the ECB would make any big changes to the wording of its closely watched policy statement as there are no new projections and a lot of uncertainty.

""Right now in that situation probably you're well advised not touching in particular references to policy being still restrictive,"" he said.

— Sophie Kiderlin

An interest rate cut from the ECB is being fully priced in by markets. But the rate decision is not the only thing they will be paying attention to on Thursday.

""More importantly for markets will be the extent to which the central bank decides to communicate what it perceives to be the ""neutral rate,"" and whether monetary policy could turn accommodative – i.e. go below the neutral rate – in the next six to 12 months,"" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, said in a note Thursday.

But, he added, it may be too soon for the ECB to share a solid stance on that, given the ongoing tariff uncertainty.

""Another area of focus will be the euro, given the recent appreciation of the single currency,"" Lafargue added. That could ""help"" in terms of inflation, he explained, but could be a downside risk for economic growth.

— Sophie Kiderlin

The European Central Bank is widely expected to trim interest rates for the third time this year as global tariff tensions and uncertainty threaten the euro zone's economic growth.

A quarter-point cut would take the ECB's deposit facility rate, its key rate, to 2.25% — down from a high of 4% toward the middle of 2023.

The series of relatively fast-paced interest rate cuts have played out as inflation in the euro area has consistently sat below 3%, recently closing in on the ECB's 2% target. Regional economic growth has, meanwhile, been lackluster.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Thursday that China was a very important market for Nvidia after the U.S. imposed a ban on sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to the country.

""We hope to continue to cooperate with China,"" Huang said in a meeting with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, according to China state broadcaster CCTV.

Huang arrived in Beijing earlier in the day at the invitation of the trade organisation.

His visit comes at a time when the United States has put new restrictions on China-bound shipments of Nvidia's H20 datacentre GPUs, the only compliant AI chip the company can sell legally to China.

The US ban has created uncertainty for Chinese internet companies, which were still anticipating H20 deliveries by the end of the year.

Nvidia didn't immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment on Huang's agenda in China.

In this article

Spanish lender Banco Santander has eclipsed Swiss giant UBS as continental Europe's largest bank by market capitalization, as U.S. tariffs ripple through the region's bruised banking sector.

UBS — whose share took a deep tumble after the April 2 announcement of U.S. President Donald Trump's baseline and reciprocal duties on Washington's trade counterparties — had a market cap of 79.5 Swiss francs ($97.23 billion) as of the Wednesday close, according to FactSet data, with Banco Santander at 91.3 billion euros ($103.78 billion).

The two banks' shares have diverged over recent months, with the Swiss lender shedding 17.2% in the year to date, while Banco Santander has gained nearly 35%, according to LSEG data.

Both banks, along with Europe's broader banking sector, have suffered since the imposition of the White House's protectionist trade policies, given the shrinking growth outlook for tariff-struck European countries and the prospect of a recession in the U.S.

Washington imposed 20% tariffs on imports from the European Union, but has lowered them to 10% under a 90-day pause announced by Trump on April 9.

Switzerland — which is not a member of the EU — faces a steeper 31% levy after the pause lifts and the Trump administration has also threatened additional duties on imported drugs. This could deliver a blow to the Swiss pharmaceutical industry that ""grew robustly"" in the fourth quarter and ""contributed significantly"" to the country's exports over the period.

More broadly, European Union banks received a boost from the announcement of the European Union's ReArm initiative in March, which is set to loosen regional fiscal rules and trigger further borrowing activity to boost defense spending.

Continental Europe's two largest lenders have very different exposures to the U.S. market.

Banco Santander is the fifth-largest auto lender in the country and is expanding through a recent partnership with telecom giant Verizon. Nevertheless, it only logged around 9% of its total profits for 2024 Stateside.

The U.S. is, meanwhile, a key market for UBS' lucrative core global wealth management division, with roughly half of the Swiss lender's invested assets concentrated in the broader Americas region last year, according to its annual report.

UBS' outlook has also been clouded by a shroud of uncertainty surrounding potential new — and steeper — capital requirements from Swiss authorities. This follows its expansion in the wake of absorbing collapsed domestic peer Credit Suisse, from which it also inherited a significant U.S. presence. The lender expects to receive further clarity on these guidelines next month.  

UBS' profitability could also be impacted by a strong Swiss franc — historically a safe haven asset during market turmoil — which has appreciated by roughly 8% against the U.S. dollar since the imposition of the latest tariffs.

Switzerland's appreciating currency — whose strength local trade groups had flagged as damaging to exports even before tariffs came into effect — could, along with depressed inflation in the country, see the Swiss National Bank make further defensive cuts to interest rates, which were already reduced to just 0.25% in March.

In comparison, the European Central Bank is also widely expected to trim its key deposit facility rate by a quarter point when it meets later on Thursday, although this will take it to 2.25%.

The potential interest rate cut would take place after the ECB said in March that its monetary policy was ""becoming meaningfully less restrictive"" — in a signal some analysts interpreted as indicating restraint when it comes to lowering rates further. 

Declines in national interest rates typically weigh on local lenders' net interest income revenues from loans.

Binance CEO Richard Teng reveals multiple governments seeking guidance on bitcoin and crypto following U.S. strategic stockpile initiative.

Financial Times reports that bitcoin and crypto exchange Binance is advising several countries on creating their own bitcoin and crypto regulations and establishing national strategic bitcoin reserves.

Binance CEO Richard Teng revealed that multiple governments seek the exchange's guidance on establishing strategic bitcoin reserves and crafting digital asset policies following recent U.S. moves toward creating a national bitcoin stockpile.

“We have actually received quite a number of approaches by a few governments and sovereign wealth funds on the establishment of their own crypto reserves,” Teng said in an interview with the Financial Times. While declining to name specific countries, he noted that the United States is “way ahead” in developing strategic bitcoin frameworks.

The development comes as nations worldwide reassess their approach to Bitcoin following former U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve using confiscated assets from criminal and civil proceedings.

Teng, who assumed leadership of Binance after founder Changpeng Zhao stepped down, said that many countries have approached Binance to “[help] them with formulating their regulatory framework to govern crypto.”

The exchange's advisory role significantly evolves its relationship with regulators. Previously known for its “no headquarters” approach, Binance is considering establishing a global base as it takes on a more formal role in shaping national bitcoin and crypto policies.

Countries like Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan have already partnered with Binance on crypto regulation, though neither has officially announced plans for bitcoin reserves. The exchange's expanding influence in policy formation reflects the growing acceptance of Bitcoin as a potential strategic asset by sovereign entities.

Market observers note this development could signal a broader shift in how governments view bitcoin and crypto.

The advisory initiative comes as Binance works to reshape its image following recent regulatory challenges. The exchange has strengthened its compliance frameworks and proactively engaged with regulators worldwide.

The trend toward national bitcoin reserves could significantly affect the bitcoin's global adoption and price stability. As more countries consider holding bitcoin as a strategic asset, the market may see reduced volatility and increased institutional participation.

Binance's role in advising governments marks a new chapter in the bitcoin and crypto industry's maturation as these assets increasingly become part of national strategic planning. The development suggests a potential shift in how countries approach monetary sovereignty in the digital age.

The recent Project Eleven bounty for quantum computers cracking cryptographic keys is a joke. It provides no serious incentive at all. 

Recently, Project Eleven (a quantum computing research group) announced a 1 bitcoin reward for the first team able to complete a challenge to demonstrate breaking a ECC (elliptic curve cryptograph) key using Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer. 

The deadline for this challenge is April 5th, 2026, meaning in order to qualify for the prize a team must demonstrate breaking a key pair it must be done before that deadline. 

This is frankly a completely absurd and meaningless prize for a number of reasons, the first of which is the deadline of just under a year from today. Even highly optimistic projections about the progress of quantum computing put the timeline of practically achieving such a goal at more like 5-10 years. Expecting a workable proof of concept demonstration that actually breaks a keypair in a single year is pretty laughable at face value, even if you do view quantum computing as a material threat in the short term. 

Next is the factor of economic incentives. A single bitcoin is currently worth approximately $80,000. That is frankly not a lot of money in the grand scheme of things. Especially when it comes to the application of a cutting edge technology like quantum computing that can perform an entire class of computation exponentially faster than a classical computer. Imagine how much more valuable things could be done with a working quantum computer. 

You could eavesdrop on internet connections regardless of TLS, breaking secure connections to banks, equity brokerages, private corporate networks not using post-quantum cryptography. You could break every private messenger application on the planet, you could decrypt any PGP encrypted message sent over email that you knew the public key for. You could break the entire DNS system's certificate authority hierarchy, allowing you to impersonate any server in the world a user tries to connect to. 

All of these things have immeasurable value beyond just a mere $84,000. Why on Earth would someone with a working quantum computer publicly reveal that fact to claim a single bitcoin when they could take advantage of all these other things they would be capable of doing?

Okay, let's sweep all of those possibilities aside and pretend the entire world magically migrates to post-quantum cryptography aside from Bitcoin. It still makes no sense to try to publicly claim this prize if you have a functional quantum computer. 

Let's assume you have a barely performant enough quantum computer, that it takes a decent amount of time to crack a single key. How many bare public keys are there securing 50 BTC outputs from the first mining epoch? THOUSANDS of them. Why on Earth would you crack one, and then go tell everyone publicly to claim a single bitcoin? You would just try to crack as many of those early coinbase rewards as possible before people detected you. 

Finally, the timetable on its own is just absurd. Quantum computers currently are not even capable of factoring prime numbers that people can do themselves in their heads mentally. In a single year the technology is going to jump from that to cracking Bitcoin keys? That's absurd. 

So what the hell is the point of this prize except some publicity stunt? It's utterly meaningless as a serious bounty to function as a canary in the coalmine for us, no matter how concerned or unconcerned you are with the timeframes of quantum computers as a threat. 

This bounty is a joke.

Stacy Hazinski received one of those annoying text messages that claimed she was about to be charged $114.02 for something she didn't buy. So she called the number, supposedly for her Apple Pay account, to make sure that she didn't get stuck with the bill.

She got stuck talking to scammers.

One simple phone call set off a scheme that ultimately enabled someone to steal her entire income tax refund and drain her savings account at a local credit union.

Filing her taxes early in the year essentially meant little, she told me at her Troy condo, because now she has nothing to show for it.

She's out $17,500 in all.

Her story highlights one huge red flag that consumers must watch out for these days — how scammers are convincing you to take cash to a crypto ATM at the local party store, gas station, or grocery.

Con artists deceive people with backstories on how they can protect their money or avoid trouble by depositing money in a cryptocurrency ATM.

The crooks — who might pretend to be from Apple, Google, an Internet service provider, or even law enforcement — do their research and know where these ATMs are in your neighborhood. They'll tell you to withdraw cash from the bank and give you directions to one of these crypto ATMs.

The crooks even go so far as to call bitcoin ATMS “safety lockers,"" according to regulators.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a consumer alert April 8 to warn residents about scammers using bitcoin ATMs to defraud consumers.

“Because money sent through bitcoin ATMs is nearly impossible to recover and these machines lack oversight and regulation, they have become an attractive option for criminals engaged in fraud and money laundering,” Nessel said in a statement.

Consumers lost $66 million to crypto ATM fraud in the first six months of 2024, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The actual number is likely much higher as such types of fraud often go unreported, according to the FTC. The FTC said the losses involving these ATMs increased dramatically from $12 million in 2020 to $114 million for all of 2023.

People 60 and over were more than three times as likely as younger adults to report a loss using a bitcoin ATM in the first half of 2024, according to FTC data.

Once the money is deposited into bitcoin, experts warn, it is transferred quickly, making it often impossible to track. Your bank is unlikely to reimburse you because you withdrew the money on your own.

Hazinski, 51, heard slew of scary stories on Feb. 28 — starting with a guy named John from Apple and switching over to a guy named Eric who claimed to be from her credit union — on how scammers were in the process of getting their hands on her federal income tax refund, as well as the rest of her savings.

As part of the scam, she was told by the guy who claimed to be an employee at the credit union that she would need to transfer her cash into a ""security"" account to protect her savings from someone who was about to send her money into an account at www.poker.com.

What? Why was her money going to cover some online poker tournament? She got terribly nervous, especially since her savings was limited after she had been out of work for a few months.

""And I said, 'I don't gamble,' "" Hazinski recalls.

She said she wasn't using her refund to play poker — and she wasn't about to let someone else use her money, either.

""It was so stressful,"" Hazinski said.

The fraudsters kept her on the phone most of the time, except for when they were disconnected a few times. She was told to go to the Community Choice Credit Union branch at 1740 Crooks Road in Royal Oak first to take out $12,500 where she remembers that the stack of bills was stuffed into zippered bag.

The crooks told her not to tell any bank employees why she was taking the money out. When a teller asked, she repeated a story the man on the phone told her. She needed money for home improvements.

She and her son and daughter live in a condo that she rents in Troy. She had no plans for home improvements.

After she made the first withdrawal, the man on the phone told her to drive to the Community Choice Credit Union at 30 E. Long Lake Road in Troy where he instructed her to take out $5,000 cash. The teller put those bills in a paper envelope.

After that, he told her that bitcoin is secure and she needed to deposit her money at a bitcoin ATM to protect it from scammers.

""So I believed him,"" she told me as we talked at her dining room high-top table.

Hazinski said the con artists told her to drive to a party store, BB's of Troy, where people usually go to buy liquor or lottery tickets. Instead of winning big, she ended up losing her money on the spot.

There, she would find an ATM operated by Bitcoin Depot where she could deposit her cash.

The Bitcoin Depot ATM stands near the front register, not far from a refrigerated case that sells BB's Buzzin Brews for $8.99 and up, ready-to-mix drinks that often include minibar size bottles of liquor.

When I visited the store April 12, I did not see any signs posted on the machine warning of potential scams. I did not attempt to buy bitcoin. The sign on the screen flashed: ""Touch the screen to get started. With Bitcoin Depot there's no hassle. Just crypto made easy.""

When I called the store April 16, I asked to speak to a manager who apparently hung up on me after I mentioned that a woman had lost $17,500 at the bitcoin machine in the store. I asked how long the ATM had been there and the phone went dead. No one picked up after I tried to immediately call again.

The party store had a decent number of customers in it that February afternoon, Hazinski remembered, but no one said a word as she pulled out the two envelopes stuffed with $17,500 from her purse.

""I was standing there at least a half hour putting money in that machine,"" Hazinski said.

She had no idea how to use a bitcoin ATM or set up an account. The con artist remained on the phone to walk her through the steps.

""He's telling me exactly what to do,"" Hazinski said.

At one point, the ATM asked her for a QR code. And con artist told her: ""I'll send you the QR code.""

She scanned it. ""What I find out after the fact, right, is the QR code that he sent me went to his account,"" Hazinski said. ""I did that twice like an idiot.""

As part of the scam, crooks text you a QR code to scan at the ATM, and once you do, the cash you deposit goes right into the bad actor's wallet. It's gone.

She was still in the store when her 16-year-old son Joshua, who attends Troy Athens High School, called her wondering why she wasn't home yet.

""I said, 'I'll be home in a minute,' "" she recalled.

When she told him what had happened, her son said ""Mom, are you kidding me?""

If her bank account somehow wasn't secure, her teen son wondered, why wouldn't the credit union tell her to transfer it right to his account? It made no sense to go to a crypto ATM.

The lights came on, and Hazinski knew her son had to be right.

The man impersonating a credit union employee had told her earlier that someone would come to her house the next day to give her a new debit card and a new account number. No one showed up. After her conversation with her son, Hazinski didn't expect that anyone would.

""All the bills, and you have no money,"" Hazinski said.

Fortunately, her father has been able to help her cover some expenses, such as her rent.

Hazinski was laid off in August from a job as a robotics engineer, work she has done for some 25 years. Initially, she used that time off to take care of her father who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He's now in remission and she's still looking for work.

Hazinski has been on interviews but thinks many companies, including auto suppliers, are holding back hiring in light of the Trump tariffs. She voted for Trump and favors his strategy of raising revenue for the federal government by getting countries to pay higher tariffs. But she's hoping that hiring picks up, too.

She's far from the first person to be caught in this bitcoin ATM scam.

Crypto ATM abuse has gotten so bad that a top Democratic senator introduced a bill in Congress in February that would protect new customers who are most likely to be fraud victims by setting transaction limits of $2,000 per day, and $10,000 total over the first 14 days.

The Crypto ATM Fraud Protection Act — introduced by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee — would require full refunds for fraudulent transactions at crypto ATMs if the new customer makes a report within 30 days.

And it would be required that the ATM offer a way for consumers to give live, verbal confirmation for any transaction greater than $500.

ATM operators would need to provide clear warnings to consumers about the risk of fraud.

In a Senate floor speech, Durbin shared the story of a man from New Lenox, Illinois, who lost $15,000 via a bitcoin ATM. That scam started when the con artists called and claimed to be a deputy in the Will County Sheriff's Office. Supposedly, the man missed jury duty and needed to pay a fine to avoid arrest.

Durbin said it was past time to put some ""commonsense guardrails in place to stop fraud in this largely unregulated industry.""

Bitcoin Depot, which operates the ATM at BB's of Troy along with more than 8,400 kiosks in North America, said the company remains focused on ""prevention and user safety as we work to make crypto more accessible and secure.""

""We display multiple scam warnings throughout the entire transaction process and offer live customer support via phone, text, chat, and email to assist users in real-time before they complete a transaction,"" according to a statement sent to the Detroit Free Press by a spokesperson for Bitcoin Depot.

Bitcoin Depot also emailed photos of several types of warnings. One was of a permanent label attached below a keypad on the kiosk that stated: ""Warning: Have you received a phone call from someone demanding payment in bitcoin? This is likely a scam. All bitcoin transactions are irreversible.""

I did not see such a label when I looked at the ATM in Troy on April 12.

Other warnings, according to the company, appear during the transaction. They include warnings to new customers to not use the Bitcoin Depot ATM for payments to any government entities, law enforcement, employers, tech support companies, or anyone saying you've been hacked.

Another photo showed a warning that appears before a wallet is scanned: ""Are you being scammed? Do not buy bitcoin for IRS payments, utility bills, or if someone says you have been hacked or are being investigated. These are scams.""

That warning also indicates that ""losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable and transactions in virtual currency are irreversible.""

Hazinski told me she did not see any alerts about scams when the con artist on the phone was telling her what to do next.

""I did not receive any of those warnings,"" she later told me by email after I sent her images of the Bitcoin Depot warnings.

I initially wrote about crooks using bitcoin ATMs to steal money roughly three years ago. A 27-year-old woman thought she snagged a great work-from-home job, but she ended up losing $500 to scammers. They sent a phony check to her Oakland Township home for her to buy Apple computer products to work remotely as an administrative assistant for a biopharmaceutical company.

But first, she somehow needed to deposit money in a bitcoin ATM at the Star Market in Lake Orion to prove where she lived before they'd send any equipment. She, too, had never bought bitcoin before.

In another case in 2022, a northern Michigan couple received a phony call from ""Apple Support."" Ultimately, the couple ended up withdrawing $350,000 from various banks and then turning that cash into cryptocurrency, according to the Grand Traverse Sheriff's Department.

The man, 76, and the woman, 87, sent that money via CoinFlip platform to scammers. Some money was sent via bitcoin ATMs; the rest was through wire transfers, according to authorities.

In 2024, consumers reported losing more money to scams where they paid with bank transfers or cryptocurrency than all other payment methods combined. People reported losing $2 billion through a bank transfer and $1.42 billion through cryptocurrency, according to Federal Trade Commission data. These cryptocurrency-related scams also involved phony investments, not just cash lost at a bitcoin ATM.

Crooks, of course, take advantage of our lack of knowledge when it comes to these ATMs. Consumers need to realize that they should only send crypto to a wallet that that they control.

Once it's in someone else's wallet, experts say, there's nothing you can do to recover your crypto.

The Community Choice Credit Union said it consistently shares information to alert consumers about fraud, including the use of bitcoin. Warnings about bitcoin ATM scams, according to the credit union, have been posted on its website and social media pages.

“We are extremely concerned and saddened to hear that our member was a victim of fraud,” said Jeff Dubey, vice president of Enterprise Risk Management for Community Choice Credit Union.

In a statement sent to the Free Press, the credit union said frontline credit union staff will encourage a credit union member to engage with the risk management team, if the staff suspects someone is a potential victim.

""Our internal teams are alerted to current scam techniques and trained to assist members if they indicate they have been told to withdraw money for a suspicious purpose,"" according to the statement.

The credit union stated that fraudsters are increasingly tech savvy and can ""spoof"" financial institution phone numbers and send text messages to take over accounts. ""They also commonly employ scare tactics via phone calls, demanding that consumers purchase gift cards, wire funds, or deposit cash into bitcoin machines,"" the credit union stated.

Lt. Ben Hancock of the Troy Police Department said right now, scams where crooks are demanding payments by bitcoin or outright cash have seen an uptick lately.

On March 16, for example, a 61-year-old Troy man told police that he was contacted by someone who falsely claimed to be from the Department of Justice. The man was told that his bank accounts had been breached and his money could be stolen if he did not safeguard his cash.

As part of the scam, the government imposters told him to wire transfer $33,000 to a Coinbase account. Coinbase is an online platform, which promises that you can buy and sell crypto in ""less than 3 minutes.""

After transferring the money, the victim was contacted again and told he needed to transfer any remaining money he had to protect it. The man did not send any more money.

It's another reminder, Hancock said, that scammers impersonate government agencies and brand names we trust. But no legitimate federal agency or business, he said, is going to contact you and demand that money be transferred or paid immediately by cryptocurrency, cash or other methods.

""We are still seeing some gift card scams,"" Hancock said, ""but currently bitcoin or other electronic payments seem to be happening more than gift card scams.""

His advice: Do not purchase bitcoin or transfer money via other means to pay a bill or handle a problem.

""Please do your research and contact whatever company these people are claiming to be from directly to confirm they are, in fact, employees,"" Hancock said. ""They are likely not.""

U.S. Secret Service forensic analysts have collaborated with Canadian authorities to tackle $4.3 million in “approval phishing” attacks targeting Ethereum wallet holders.

Approval phishing is when a malicious attacker tricks a user, for example, as part of a “pig butchering” romance scam, into signing a transaction that gives the attacker permission to spend or drain tokens from their crypto wallet.

The joint operation, dubbed Operation Avalanche (no affiliation with the layer-1 network or its AVAX token), searched for compromised wallets on the Ethereum blockchain and reached out to impacted wallet owners who had lost money or were at risk of doing so.

The effort was led by the U.S. Secret Service and the B.C. Securities Commission. It also had support from the Ontario Provincial Police, Alberta Securities Commission, L'Autorité des marchés financiers, Ontario Securities Commission, Delta Police Department, Vancouver Police Department, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. An unnamed crypto exchange and a third-party blockchain analyst were also said to be involved.

Matt McCool, a special agent in charge at the U.S. Secret Service's Washington Field Office, said his organization “will continue working with Canadian law enforcement and financial partners to identify and seize stolen assets to return to victims.”

This isn't the first time that the Secret Service has announced a major crypto enforcement action in recent months.

In March, it took down the website of Russian crypto exchange Garantex as part of another joint operation, claiming it had ties to cybercriminal groups and sanctioned Russian banks, including darknet ransomware groups.

Approval phishing has consistently been a popular and damaging type of crypto scam.

Blockchain sleuths at Chainalysis estimated that $2.7 billion was lost to approval phishing between May 2021 and July 2024, adding that many cases go under the radar and remain unreported.

Though approval phishing attacks can be targeted at organizations—such as in the case of the $120 million Badger DAO hack in December 2021—they are often directed at wealthy private individuals, who are known to be active in crypto or NFT space.

In December 2021, a well-known collector in the NFT space lost Bored Ape NFTs worth almost $2 million (at value's of the time) to a variant of 'approval phishing' known as 'ice phishing.'

Ethereum has slipped below the $1,600 mark, but on-chain and technical signals hint that the market may be entering a key accumulation phase. 

According to an Apr.17 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor abramchart, Ethereum (ETH) is trading near its realized price level, historically a zone that has preceded significant rebounds. The realized price, currently around $1,585, has served as a reliable signal of deep-value accumulation. 

Every major bull run in ETH's history has started when the price fell to or below this level. Ethereum is approaching the lower band of the realized price model, indicating market cooling and potentially priming long-term holders for re-entry.

Still, technical indicators remain mixed. ETH has slipped beneath its 20-day moving average and remains well below the 200-day, indicating a strong downtrend. The relative strength index hovers just under 40, reflecting weak momentum but not yet fully oversold. Daily Bollinger Bands remain compressed, reflecting lower volatility, but a decisive move in either direction may be imminent. 

Should the downtrend persist, ETH could find support in the $1,450–$1,550 range, a zone that has historically served as a bottoming area. Immediate resistance lies around $1,670 and a stronger overhead pressure could be experienced in the $1,930 area.

On the fundamentals front, Ethereum's value capture on layer 1 has weakened considerably since the Dencun upgrade, as noted by an Apr. 16 Binance Research article. While scalability has increased nearly 16-fold due to the introduction of blobs, the change reduced L1 fee revenues. 

With users migrating to cheaper layer 2s, ETH's role as “ultrasound money” has diminished, hurting its appeal relative to faster, lower-fee rivals like Solana (SOL) and BNB Chain (BNB).

Santiment's Apr. 16 analysis revealed that Ethereum fees have dropped to 5-year lows, averaging just $0.168 per transaction. This shows falling usage and congestion, but from a contrarian perspective, could hint at a potential rebound. 

Historically, low fees under $1 often precede price rebounds. As Santiment notes, “The more the retail community leans away from an asset (especially one with still thriving development), the higher the likelihood of an eventual surprise rebound with little resistance.”

Much of the pullback may be tied to broader macro uncertainty. Santiment observed that traders are highly sensitive to tariff and economic news, often delaying ETH activity until greater clarity returns to the global picture.

A widely followed crypto analyst says one Solana (SOL) competitor may be gearing up for a breakout.

In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 783,000 followers on the social media platform X that Sei (SEI) may increase more than 100% its current value if it breaks through a key resistance level.

“SEI starts to show momentum. The Bitcoin pair has a strong bullish divergence on the higher timeframes and the USD pair faces a crucial resistance. Breaking through $0.20 opens up a continuation towards $0.30-$0.35.”

SEI is trading for $0.17 at time of writing, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours.

Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) is in a consolidation phase that may lead to an explosive move to the upside.

“Bitcoin is stuck in the final range. Another test of $87,000 and we'll likely break upwards to the rally of a new all-time high.” 

Bitcoin is trading for $83,800 at time of writing, flat on the day.

Lastly, the analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) may be kicking off an uptrend if the price of gold peaks, based on ETH's historic inverse correlation with the precious metal.

“A good start of the week, as ETH is +4% against Bitcoin. The ultimate question whether it will sustain or not, last months it has been giving back the returns in the days after. What to monitor? Gold peaking or not. If that's the case, then we'll see more strength on ETH.”

The analyst also says that ETH's Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is flashing bullish, having entered oversold territory.

The RSI is a momentum oscillator used to determine whether an asset is oversold or overbought. The RSI's values range from zero to 100. A level between 70 and 100 indicates that an asset is overbought. The 0 to 30 level range indicates that an asset is oversold.

“It's been a bear market for 1,225 days for ETH, as, in this period, gold did a 2x. The lowest RSI on the weekly candle for ETH as well.”

ETH is trading for $1,589 at time of writing, down 2% in the last 24 hours.

The Ripple-linked XRP cryptocurrency is on track to score six consecutive months of positive returns against archrival Ethereum (ETH) for the first time in history. 

In November, the token gained a whopping 160% against ETH, and this trend ended up persisting throughout 2025. 

In March, XRP/ETH was up by nearly 20%. In this month, the token has so far added another 14%.

This is a sharp turnaround compared to the previous year. Over the period from November 2023 to May 2024, XRP recorded as many as seven consecutive months of negative performance. In February 2024, XRP plunged by as much as 20.4% against the flagship altcoin. 

XRP has managed to carry its Q4 momentum well into 2025, with positive new developments in the SEC v. Ripple case, as well as growing ETF buzz.

As reported by U.Today, multiple analysts believe that a spot-based XRP ETF is already a done deal in the U.S.

 As XRP outpaces most altcoins against Bitcoin, a new Cointelegraph video explores what is driving its price action and whether the momentum can last. 

Over the past year, most altcoins have struggled to keep up with Bitcoin, but one project is breaking away from the pack: XRP.

While other tokens have stagnated or slid, XRP (XRP) has surged more than 300% in just six months against Bitcoin (BTC) to quickly become one of the best-performing assets in the crypto space. But what's really behind this rally — and more importantly, can it last?

Some say it's the fundamentals finally shining through. Others argue it's just hype and speculation driven by a passionate community. Then there's the legal, political, and institutional side of things — factors that could have a far greater impact on XRP's trajectory than many realize.

In Cointelegraph's latest video, we dive deep into the forces driving XRP's recent performance, the growing institutional interest, and the potential game-changing developments on the horizon. From exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and stablecoins to regulation and Ripple Labs' evolving strategy, this video breaks it all down.

Whether you're an XRP holder, a skeptic, or just trying to make sense of the altcoin market in 2025, this is a video you don't want to miss.

Former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has stated that Bitcoin (BTC) could continue to exist and thrive for a long time. 

However, Gensler emphasized that this may not be the case for most altcoins, as they lack solid fundamentals.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Gensler mentioned that Bitcoin's enduring presence could be attributed to its strong global interest. 

“Something like Bitcoin may persist for a long time because there's 7 billion people around the globe, a real keen interest in it,” he stated.

Gensler, who served as SEC Chair from 2021 to 2025, made these remarks in response to questions about the crypto industry's reaction to the dismissal of lawsuits and investigations initiated during his tenure. 

While at the SEC, Gensler took a hard stance on cryptocurrency regulation. He launched multiple enforcement actions targeting several exchanges, token issuers, and other crypto entities. 

While he refrained from commenting directly on the dismissal of these cases, he shifted focus to broader trends within the cryptocurrency market.

“I'm going to step back a little bit from any individual cases and just say this again to your viewing public. This is a very small part of the financial markets, but if you were interested in this, think about every financial asset sort of trades on a bit of fundamentals and sentiment. But this field is almost 99, or maybe one might say 100% sentiment and very little on fundamentals,” said Gensler.

The former SEC chair advocated for careful asset risk assessment. He noted that the primary focus should be the project's fundamentals. Moreover, he warned that many assets are driven predominantly by sentiment. As a result, he suggested that such tokens are generally unsustainable and likely to lose value over time.

When pressed on whether Bitcoin should be grouped with other cryptocurrencies, Gensler drew an analogy to precious metals. He implied that Bitcoin holds a unique position in the cryptocurrency world.

“There's only two or three precious metals. We humans have a certain fascination with two or three precious metals like gold,” he remarked. 

Gensler believes that the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, especially those driven by trends, memes, or social sentiment, will not attract lasting interest. He stressed that only a few, like Bitcoin, will stand the test of time.

These comments align with Gensler's previous statements on the crypto market. In a January 2025 interview with CNBC, he acknowledged BTC's volatility yet showed faith in its long-term prospects.

“With 7 billion people around the globe, 7 billion people want to trade it just like we do have gold for 10,000 years. We have Bitcoin. It might be something else in the future as well,” Gensler noted.

Despite the optimistic outlook, Gensler disclosed that he did not own any Bitcoin or other crypto assets.

Gensler's remarks reflect ongoing debates about the legitimacy and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin has gained traction as a store of value, many altcoins struggle to demonstrate the same level of acceptance.

Coinbase Premium rebounds as U.S. traders reenter the market as Bitcoin steadies, with signs pointing to a potential broader crypto breakout.

Bitcoin may be finding its footing again after lifting off from a sharp decline earlier in the week. The latest market data shows that recent Coinbase Premium activity offers a positive outlook for market watchers.

Likewise, a key signal tied to U.S. buying behavior shows signs of recovery, even as broader conditions remain shaky.





According to CryptoQuant's report, the past few weeks have been rough across global digital asset markets.

The increasing tariff tensions between the US and China have shaken investor confidence. This has led investors to move their funds toward safer assets like gold. Unfortunately, Bitcoin was not spared, falling more than 30% during the pullback.

However, rather than continuing to slide, the price has stabilized. Based on recent developments, a gradual recovery is now underway.

One factor showcasing this price stability is the Coinbase Premium. This mechanism compares Bitcoin's price on Coinbase to those on other exchanges.

Based on historical trends, a rise in the premium often signals increased buying activity. It usually points to U.S. traders entering the market, especially larger or more experienced investors.

Since March 2025, the Coinbase Premium has been moving in a tighter range, with smaller ups and downs. The same signs are starting to show again, and some traders think another big Bitcoin breakout could be coming.

It is worth noting that Bitcoin is not the only digital asset showing potential. The behavior of altcoins is often tied to the movement in the price of Bitcoin. If demand keeps building from U.S.-based buyers, it could lift the entire crypto ecosystem.

It is important to note that while activity is picking up on Coinbase, the situation in South Korea tells a different story. The Korea Premium Index tracks the price difference between Korean exchanges and global prices.

During most of the market correction, the index remained low. It only started to move up after Bitcoin had already begun to recover. This slower reaction suggests that Korean retail traders, who have often been early movers in past rallies, were more cautious this time.

Their current market reservations contrast with the stronger activity seen on U.S. platforms. The gap between the U.S. and Korean markets is something to watch. The U.S. side has been showing more activity in recent moves.

With the Coinbase Premium holding steady and starting to rise, it could signal that momentum is building. This may push Bitcoin and altcoins into a stronger recovery phase. At the time of writing, BTC's price changed hands for $84,708.83, up 0.63% in 24 hours.

Still, while the Coinbase premium trend continues to shape Bitcoin's price, some big names are making quiet but steady moves. For example, Strategy recently added $285 million in Bitcoin to its total stash.

In addition, Semler Scientific filed plans to raise $500 million, with part of that money set aside to buy more Bitcoin. These actions show that even with all the market noise, some heavyweights are still betting on Bitcoin's long-term strength.

SPONSORED POST*

As the cryptocurrency market navigates through April 2025, participants are closely watching for signs of a potential turnaround following recent volatility. Significant attention has been paid to recent analysis, particularly a report from Coinbase published mid-April, which offers a cautiously optimistic forecast suggesting a market bottom might form later in Q2, potentially setting the stage for a Q3 bounce. This outlook inevitably sparks interest in identifying the best altcoins to buy now to position advantageously for a possible recovery. Understanding the market dynamics, especially concerning altcoins, provides crucial context when evaluating various opportunities, from innovative presales like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) to established players such as Sei (SEI) and XRP.

Summary

The comprehensive April 15th report from Coinbase delves into the state of the crypto market, offering valuable perspectives for those considering altcoin investments. It acknowledges the significant pressure experienced, noting that the total crypto market capitalization excluding Bitcoin had fallen sharply by 41% from its December 2024 peak of $1.6 trillion to around $950 billion by mid-April. 

This coincided with a notable decline in venture capital investment in the sector, remaining 50-60% below the previous cycle's highs, indicating reduced risk tolerance from major investors. External factors like global tariff implementations and economic uncertainty were also cited as contributing factors, particularly weighing on the recently more volatile altcoin market.

The analysts encourage using technical indicators like the 200-day moving average to understand longer-term trends. Both Bitcoin and Coinbase's own COIN50 index ,tracking top altcoins. Falling below this key level signaled a potentially more profound market shift requiring caution. The report highlighted the performance gap between Bitcoin and altcoins. This divergence,reflects the heightened volatility in newer crypto sectors like memecoins, DePIN projects, and AI-related tokens. Despite these cautionary signals, Coinbase expressed cautious optimism, forecasting a potential market bottom by mid-to-late Q2 2025 and the possibility of a recovery starting in Q3.

Given Coinbase's analysis pointing towards potential stabilization and a Q3 bounce, which specific altcoins might traders be evaluating? The focus often falls on projects with strong fundamentals, innovative technology aligning with current trends,like AI or unique market positioning that could see them benefit disproportionately from a market recovery. Here are three diverse examples attracting attention:

Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) represents an altcoin operating in the AI and meme coin sectors, highlighted by Coinbase as areas of interest (and volatility). Currently in its presale phase, it offers a unique entry point.

<iframe width=”560″ height=”315″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2LHM6ObNHY?si=4R1FRAWNUC963OkS” title=”YouTube video player” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share” referrerpolicy=”strict-origin-when-cross-origin” allowfullscreen></iframe>



Sei (SEI) is an established altcoin operating as a Layer 1 blockchain specifically engineered for trading applications.

XRP stands as one of the largest and longest-standing altcoins, primarily known for its focus on facilitating efficient global payments.

The search for the best altcoins to buy now is intensified by analysis suggesting the market may be nearing a bottom ahead of a potential Q3 bounce. While caution is warranted due to ongoing volatility and technical indicators still showing weakness, this outlook encourages strategic positioning. 

Opportunities are diverse: innovative presales like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) offer early access to trending sectors like AI with potential price stability, specialized Layer 1s like Sei (SEI) provide infrastructure bets on specific growth areas like decentralized trading and established utility-focused coins like XRP present opportunities tied to real-world adoption and regulatory clarity. As market sentiment potentially shifts, conducting research into these varied altcoin categories will be key for navigating the path towards a potential Q3 recovery.

Discovering altcoins involves using data aggregators, crypto exchanges, news sites, and researching presales; always verify project details, check for audits (like Dawgz AI's SolidProof audit), and assess utility before investing.

Potential often lies with altcoins innovating in key sectors like AI (e.g., Dawgz AI), specialized Layer 1s (e.g., Sei), or those with strong real-world utility (e.g., XRP), especially if positioned well before market rebounds.

Some altcoins with proven utility and strong ecosystems may fit long-term strategies, but many are highly speculative; Coinbase's report highlighting altcoin volatility underscores the need for careful selection and risk management.

Altcoins include diverse categories like platform tokens, DeFi protocols, utility tokens (like XRP), meme coins (including those adding utility like Dawgz AI), Layer 1s focused on specific niches (like Sei), and many more.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Blockchain Offers Security Benefits","https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/blockchain-offers-security-benefits-but.html","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

Blockchain is best known for its use in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but it also holds significant applications for online authentication. As businesses in varying sectors increasingly embrace blockchain-based security tools, could the technology one day replace passwords?

Blockchain is a secure way to maintain, encrypt, and exchange digital records of transactions. Its security benefits stem from its decentralized nature: this distributed ledger can be accessed by participants across various nodes, and is unalterable. All users retain control as a group, meaning no single person can change the ledger.

How could this provide security benefits? One advantage is the ability to create a 'self-sovereign ID' that alters the way that a user identifies themselves online. Essentially, it creates a private ID for a user that they control, rather than relying on a centralized institution: they can logon to a particular website or service using their identity on the blockchain. 

These identities utilize cryptographic keys, rather than passwords: your private key would be used to authenticate you through verification with a corresponding public key. It could be further bolstered by two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA): for example, when logging onto your bank account. 

It's easy to see how this could bring significant security advantages. We all know the dangers inherent in passwords, from phishing to simple user error: reusing the same, easy-to-guess password, for instance. With a blockchain-based authentication system, it should be possible to significantly reduce the risk of data breaches, because the decentralized nature of the technology simply removes the centralized databases that are key targets for such attacks. 

What advantages is this providing in the real world? There are numerous examples. For example, R3 Corda is a distributed ledger technology designed for financial services, enabling the secure exchange of data and value between parties. Such technology could be used in such areas as Know Your Customer (KYC) in finance, enabling banks and other operators to verify someone's identity without putting their privacy at risk. 

In healthcare, it is being used to prevent unauthorized access to medical records and to enable the secure sharing of patient data. Infosys BPM reckons that the blockchain tech market in healthcare could exceed $215 billion by the end of 2036. 

Like any rapidly developing technology, blockchain poses challenges in the security space and beyond. Let's look at a few.

Cost: Blockchain can be pricey, consuming large amounts of energy and computing power to validate transactions. The United Nations University found in 2023 that if Bitcoin was a country, it would consume more energy than Pakistan. 

Unfamiliar technology: Despite the growing prevalence of Bitcoin and the like, most people – and organizations – still have little idea of how blockchain actually functions. This could slow down the adoption of the technology. 

Legal and regulatory issues: Digital identities are a tricky area, with different jurisdictions and countries holding varying standards. That could make it difficult to build global traction. 

Storage requirements and scalability: Blockchains require storage, a challenge that could grow as the technology is utilized more widely. It is vital to focus on the scalability of the solution, ensuring that it delivers the speed required. 

Interoperability challenges: Without international standards, it's unclear how interoperability would be achieved. It's vital that identities can be verified across different devices, sectors and even international borders. 

That's not to downplay the potential of blockchain as a security tool. With its decentralized nature and use of cryptography and private and public keys, it provides huge advantages. Even challenges around power consumption, cost and regulations could be addressed as the technology expands in use.

However, while no-one can predict the future, it seems highly unlikely that passwords will vanish anytime soon. Passwords offer key advantages that provide them with an enduring appeal: they're simple and universal; they're flexible as they can easily be reset; and despite the risk of hacks and breaches, they remain effective, simply because they're either right or wrong.

Yes, they can be vulnerable. Ideally, users they will opt for multi-factor authentication, combining passwords with other security measures – this could include blockchain-based methods. Protecting both the logon with effective MFA such as Specops Secure Access works best in combination with strong password security. 

As long as passwords remain in use, organizations need to ensure their active directories are free of weak or compromised passwords. Specops Password Policy makes it easy to enforce a strong password policy, while also scanning your active directory for breached or compromised examples. It currently blocks more than 4 billion compromised passwords –and the list is always growing. 

The reality is that individuals and organizations continue to rely on passwords for security online. This fact – combined with the challenges around adopting new technologies like blockchain – mean organizations simply cannot afford to neglect password security, at least for the foreseeable future.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ethena and tokenization firm Securitize said they will use part of Arbitrum's tech and data availability network Celestia for their real-world asset focused, Ethereum-compatible blockchain, aiming to launch mainnet in the second quarter of this year.

The Converge chain is setting out to have fast blocktimes, allowing users to pay gas fees through Ethena's USDe and USDtb, while creating security and guardrails via its Converge Validator Network, the two protocols behind the project explained in a tech update shared with CoinDesk.

""The idea is that we go on a testnet very soon, in the next few weeks, because we've already been working on this for a while,"" Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk. ""Then, the mainnet: the goal is to do it before the end of Q2.""

The exact timing of the public rollout also depends on third-party integrations such as Anchorage for custody support, Fireblocks for key management and other DeFi apps the project partnered with, Domingo added.

Converge, unveiled last month, aims to connect the rapidly growing tokenized real-world assets (RWA) sector with the DeFi space, building on existing ecosystems around Ethena and Securitize and their multi billion dollar worth of assets.

Ethena has quickly become a DeFi powerhouse, spearheading the yield-bearing stablecoin trend with its $5 billion ""synthetic dollar"" token USDe. Meanwhile, Securitize issues nearly $4 billion in tokenized assets by traditional finance giants like Apollo and Hamilton Lane and BlackRock's blockchain-based money market fund token BUIDL. The latter is also the key backing asset of Ethena's $1.4 billion USDtb stablecoin.

""Converge's ambitious vision of onboarding tens of billions of institutional capital on-chain requires providing users with high performance and elevated security guarantees,"" Guy Young, founder of development firm Ethena Labs, said in a statement.

To achieve that lofty goal, the Converge chain's performance relies on a custom sequencer for an Arbitrum-powered blockchain, while using Celestia as the data availability layer underneath it, according to the tech update shared with CoinDesk. A sequencer is a key piece of blockchain infrastructure that compiles transactions from layer-2 networks and posts them back to the layer-1 network.

Data availability layers, like Celestia, aim to bring down the downloading and storage costs for data-intensive blockchain networks. The combination of Conduit's G2 sequencer, as well as the use of Arbitrum and Celestia's tech is supposed ""to push the boundaries of what level of throughput is possible on EVM-based networks,"" the team wrote.

The network will use Ethena's USDe and USDtb as gas tokens to pay for transaction costs across the network. Both tokens are designed with a price anchored to $1, allowing easier accounting for transaction costs, the team wrote.

Converge will also support both permissionless and permissioned applications operating side by side. Developers can deploy permissionless DeFi apps freely, while institutional issuers such as Securitize can create permissioned environments for compliant real-world asset products.

In addition, the Converge Validator Network (CVN) is supposed to provide the foundations of the network's security, by essentially acting as the chain's security council. The CVN will have the ability to interfere during emergencies like when funds are at risk, perform circuit breakers to pause user-activity if there are serious bugs, as well as review important governance proposals.

In order to participate in the CVN, validators must stake ENA, Ethena's governance token. According to the team, the CVN will go live shortly after mainnet launches.

""Technical breakthroughs on this initiative will drive asymmetric product outcomes for Converge, and thus growth in USDe, USDtb and other Ethena and Securitize products,"" Young said.

 Bybit is shutting down most of its Web3 services, including wallets and its NFT platform, to refocus on core offerings after a $1.4 billion hack. 

Bybit is shutting down more of its Web3 services after axing its non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace earlier in April.

According to an April 16 announcement, the exchange is shutting down its Cloud Wallet (a hosted custodial wallet​), Keyless Wallet (non‑custodial multiparty computation wallet with no seed phrase​), NFT marketplace, multi‑chain decentralized exchange (DEX)​ DEX Pro and the Swap & Bridge cross‑chain swap widget​ on May 31.

On April 28, Bybit will also discontinue Web3 Points, its internal loyalty program that rewarded onchain activity with redeemable points for fee discounts, airdrop boosts and early-bird perks.​

On the same day, the exchange will shut down its inscription marketplace, the decentralized NFT marketplace NFT Pro, the gateway to the Apex Pro derivatives DEX, its fiat-to-crypto on-ramp, and its initial DEX offering service.

Bybit announced its intention to shut down its NFT marketplace earlier this month. The decision follows a similar decision by major NFT marketplace X2Y2.

Still, the firm is not just cutting products. Recent reports indicate that Bybit has integrated the Bitcoin (BTC) yield product of lending protocol Avalon to offer Bitcoin yield to its users. Avalon said it will allow the platform's users to earn yield from Bitcoin by arbitrating on its fixed-rate institutional borrowing layer.

Bybit recently denied claims that it charges $1.4 million to list a token on its platform, following allegations made by a social media user.

Bybit said it is shutting down the services in order to focus on the quality of its core products. The announcement reads:

These apparent cost-cutting efforts by the company follow Bybit's loss of about $1.4 billion in a major hack in February.

Bybit had not responded to Cointelegraph's request for comment by publication.

The cyberpunk-themed MMORPG 77-Bit has concluded its closed Beta phase with metrics that suggest a compelling case for the viability of a fun-first crypto gaming model. The development team has now confirmed the distribution of free Limited Edition NFT skins to Beta participants, alongside introducing a new item drop, Quantum Core, slated to follow soon after.

The Beta attracted major attention, with over 1 million BitHub users attempting access. Ultimately, the team onboarded 20,000 players, prioritizing high-intent participants over mass inclusion.

Engagement data from Amplitude paints a strong picture:

Players averaged 2.5 hours of gameplay per day. Notably, ~$500,000 in in-game purchases were recorded during the Beta. Importantly, none of these purchases were speculative or play-to-earn related. Spending centered around non-tokenized upgrades like weapon leveling and battle pass access, reinforcing the developers' “fun-before-financials” approach.

The average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) was $45 across 11,000 users. These figures suggest that crypto-native gaming experiences can attract and retain users based on gameplay value, not token incentives.

In recognition of Beta participation, all players will receive one free Limited Edition Beta Skin NFT. Battle Pass holders are entitled to a second one. These NFTs represent some of the rarest cosmetics introduced so far in 77-Bit, and may become tradeable in the future, though they are currently Soulbound.

The skin lineup includes:

Each mint reveals instantly upon claim, with no delay or random reveal mechanics. Players can mint additional skins at 0.005 ETH (~$7.70), with no cap on the number of paid mints.

This mint is not open to the general public, with eligibility tied to in-game engagement or prior asset ownership.

Following the NFT skin mint, 77-Bit will roll out its next initiative—Quantum Core. Details remain limited, but the team has confirmed that holders of minted skins will gain the “Noob” role, granting early access to upcoming rewards and the Quantum Core whitelist. A supply of 5,000 Quantum Cores is expected, with distribution prioritized to Iconic players and Noob-role holders.

The roadmap beyond April includes:

77-Bit's development team emphasized that the project's direction hinges on the success of these next phases. The Beta has provided strong proof of concept, but community engagement in events like the NFT mint and Quantum Core drop will determine how the platform scales.

For now, April 18 marks a key date for players looking to secure early, limited assets tied to 77-Bit's foundational phase.","{'href': 'https://playtoearn.com', 'title': 'PlayToEarn'}","cryptocurrency"

 Trump wants to build a ""Crypto Monopoly""? (Related reading: "" Trump, an old fan of Monopoly, enters the blockchain game, making another move in the crypto market "")

 Although Trump has disturbed the world since he took office, we have to admit that, personally, Trump is undoubtedly the most money-making president of all time. In addition to his well-known real estate industry, the growth of his media and technology companies, and the shady stock operations that have made the market extremely suspicious, he has also opened up a new channel for profit-making - cryptocurrency, and has made at least $1 billion in profits from it.

 To date, Trump's crypto territory has been expanding, from the initial NFT to Defi, from MEME to stablecoins, and finally to mining. A new crypto empire named after Trump seems to be rising. And just recently, according to Fortune, the Trump family is suspected of targeting the blockchain game field again.

 Looking back at Trump's crypto journey, we have to start with digital cards. In June 2021, Trump at the time was still advocating the ""great dollar theory"", denouncing cryptocurrencies as a ""scam"" that affects the value of the dollar, and also said that cryptocurrencies should be strictly regulated. But in less than a year and a half, Trump has shown his true colors.

 On December 15, 2022, Trump announced the release of Trump digital trading card NFT through TruthSocial, a social media website he founded. The series was minted on the Polygon blockchain, and a total of 45,000 NFTs were initially created, with a starting price of $99 per piece. Buying 45 digital trading cards will get you a ticket to dinner with Trump. This series of NFTs can be purchased with credit cards and WETH, and requires KYC and email. Although it caused ridicule at the time, with the traffic blessing and call of the former president, this series was still sold out in less than a day after its launch. Judging from the trading volume of opensea, the total transaction volume of this series reached 17,115ETH, and there are currently 14,411 holders. 



 In short, Trump made a huge profit of $4.45 million on his first attempt. After tasting the sweetness, on April 18, 2023, Trump quickly released his second series of NFTs - Trump Digital Trading Cards Series 2. The same marketing method, but the total number of series increased to 47,000, which he said was to express his confidence in serving as the 47th president. The price is still $99. Although it was also sold out within 5 hours of release, it plummeted rapidly on the second day. It can be seen that the market has been tired of the consecutive sales.

 But Trump doesn't care about the market, he only cares about the actual benefits. Shortly afterwards, Trump released the third series of MugShot Edition NFTs. This time it was even more outrageous, with a total of 100,000 pieces, with no price increase, and introduced special benefits. For $10,000, you can be invited to the reception, and a unique Ordinal digital trading card limited to 200 pieces will be included. It is precisely because of this series that Trump's subsequent ""making NFT hot again"" came into being. A simple calculation shows that with just three sets of NFT combinations, the Trump team has attracted $19 million, and according to its financial disclosures, the actual profit of NFTs has reached millions of dollars.

 NFT is just the beginning. It is both for earning political donations and for canvassing votes. In September 2024, the Trump family announced the launch of the cryptocurrency project ""World Liberty Financial"". This company named Defi has not seen much improvement in Defi since its listing. Instead, it has continuously bought coins and built positions, which has attracted attention. The total holdings have reached 1 billion US dollars, with a loss of 0.87%. More directly, the sale of governance tokens. In the context of clarifying that the tokens will not be resold at the secondary level and that there are market interests, in March this year, WLFI still announced the completion of the sale of $550 million WLFI governance tokens, and the currency circle OG Sun Yuchen also contributed $75 million. 



 The documents show that after deducting operating costs, Trump and his business partners will receive 75% of the project's net income, including the WLFI token sale. Of the funds raised from the WLFI sale, $30 million has been designated to pay company expenses, compensation and obligations. Project documents also show that Trump and his partners in DT Marks DEFI LLC will receive 75% of the remaining amount, or $390 million, as marketing fees for Trump to promote the project ""from time to time"" and allow the use of his name and image.

 Just as Trump talked about the future of stablecoins at the first White House Crypto Summit, the family business took action. On March 25, WLFI announced the launch of a stablecoin called USD1, which is pegged to the US dollar and 100% backed by US government short-term treasury bonds, US dollar deposits and other cash equivalents. USD1 will be minted on the ETH and BSC blockchains, and plans to expand to other protocols in the future. USD1 reserves will be hosted by BitGo. As of now, according to Coingecko data, USD1 transaction volume has exceeded 44.91 million US dollars. 



 Next up is mining. The president has made it clear that he wants to ensure that the remaining bitcoins are made in the United States, so the Trump family naturally wants to seize the opportunity. At the end of March, Trump's second son Eric Trump and mining company Hut 8 Mining announced the joint establishment of a new bitcoin mining company, American Bitcoin. Hut 8 injected most of its ASIC mining machines into American Data Centers, which was co-invested by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., and changed its name to American Bitcoin after the transaction was completed. Hut 8 holds 80% of the shares.

 If mining and stablecoins seem to have just taken shape and there is no big profit to speak of, the one that shocked the world must be Trump MEME. In January, Trump's personal MEME Trump opened the precedent of the president issuing coins, and successfully made him a lot of money amid the abuse. But from the peak of $70 to the current $7.89, from a 125-fold surge to a 90% drop from the high point, investors are in a state of extremes, and it also laid the root cause of further tightening of liquidity in the subsequent cryptocurrency circle. 



 Due to the unlocking problem, the actual profit is not as huge as imagined. From the perspective of token distribution, the total supply of TRUMP is 1 billion, but only 200 million will be circulated initially, and the remaining 800 million are expected to be unlocked linearly within 3 years. Two subsidiaries of the Trump Group occupy an absolute share. Trump's companies CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC will own 80% of the TRUMP tokens, with a lock-up period of 3-12 months and unlocking within the next 24 months. The current book value profit is approximately US$6.344 billion.

 Overall, a huge Trump crypto empire is emerging, and its layout is already very extensive. After a small trial of NFT, the mining business is about to take shape, and it also includes profit cash cow stablecoins and Defi, and even MEME provides blood packages. Although it is scattered, the industrial chain has gradually formed, and both infrastructure and applications are involved, and it is expected to continue to expand around ""core applications"". Bloomberg reported that as of now, the Trump family has attracted more than $1 billion in the crypto field. From the current point of view, the crypto market is not in a boom cycle. After entering the bull market after the foothold, it is obvious that the Trump family will make a lot of money.

 Just a few days ago, Fortune reported that Trump's latest crypto project will be a real estate video game. People familiar with the matter said that this game is an adaptation of ""MONOPOLY GO!"". Players earn in-game cash by moving chess pieces on a digital ""Monopoly"" board and build buildings in a digital city. It was also revealed that Trump's long-time friend Bill Zanker is the driving force behind the project. However, Zanker spokesman Kevin Mercuri denied this, saying only that Zanker is indeed developing a game, but it is not Monopoly. It can be seen that the Trump family's subsequent crypto tentacles are very likely to extend to the field of blockchain games.

 It has been mentioned before that Trump's business philosophy adheres to the principle of traffic monetization. The currency circle, which has always been traffic-oriented, is obviously very consistent with its business characteristics. With the support of its own controllable policies, Trump can continue to raise the currency market by releasing favorable news, and can also directly use his influence to cut into the most profitable and policy-promising fields. This is undoubtedly an alternative political corruption and insider trading. Looking at its layout in the encryption field, it is all before and after the government releases the signal, the family team quickly follows up, and interest groups are also formed. A typical example is that one of the co-founders of WLFI is Zach Witkoff, who is also the son of Steve Witkoff, the Trump administration's special envoy for the Middle East.

 Not everyone is happy about this, and high-level doubts from the Democratic Party and nonpartisan parties have never stopped. Elizabeth Warren, a well-known crypto opponent, said that the SEC's abandonment of law enforcement activities is part of Trump's use of the crypto business to get rich, which undoubtedly hinders regulatory legislation. Kedrick Payne, general counsel and senior director of ethics at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, also said that Trump is personally advocating laws to promote the development of the crypto industry.

 This is not groundless. After Trump took office, not only did the SEC completely become crypto-friendly, the Department of Justice also promised to reduce crypto lawsuits, and even stopped prosecuting the mixers that were previously deeply involved in anti-money laundering controls, and stakeholders were able to let go. Take Justin Sun as an example. In 2023, he was also sued by the SEC for fraudulent market manipulation and other suspected misconduct, but after investing heavily in WFLI last year, the SEC stopped the lawsuit this year.

 It seems that the policies under Trump's control are ironclad, but arbitrary regulation can easily trigger political conflicts, especially in the current complex political situation in the United States, where there is a possibility of regulatory backlash. Investment bank TD Cowen said today that the Trump family's crypto business (including the planned stablecoin) may trigger a backlash and delay the US regulatory process. Although lawmakers are accelerating crypto regulations, political risks are rising.

 In fact, conflicts of interest and insider information are not limited to the cryptocurrency circle. After the recent tariff storm swept the global stock market, Trump's close friends have successfully made a fortune. According to congressional disclosure documents, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia congresswoman who has a close relationship with Trump, successfully made 21 stock purchases the day before and the day Trump suspended tariffs. What's even more ridiculous is that on the same day, Trump's personal account stock holdings soared 22.67%, with a single-day profit of more than $415 million. In addition to this congresswoman, Republican Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania also coincidentally sold shares of American steel producer Steel Dynamics in advance on the day Trump announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum products. Although the two congressmen later came forward to clarify that the investment was legal and compliant, it still aroused suspicion in the market.

 The family makes money in the cryptocurrency circle, and allies profit in the stock market. No matter how it is clarified, Trump's operation is inevitably suspected of conflict of interest. At present, the Democratic Party has jointly sent a letter to the new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, asking for an investigation into whether Trump has created trading opportunities for allies through policy changes and whether he is suspected of market manipulation. However, considering that the chairman was pushed to the top by Trump, the Democratic Party's impeachment may be difficult to succeed.

 It is obvious that the Trump family has not stopped making money. Less than half a year after taking office, the Trump family has already made billions of dollars. After four years in office, how much more money will they make? The evaluation of the Trump family's ability to govern has not yet begun, but the most profitable president in the United States seems to have been born.

According to Bold (@boldleonidas), the Zora token model, which creates a unique token for every piece of content, can be puzzling for traders and creators. This approach results in multiple tokens each representing individual artworks or digital items, instead of a single token representing an entire brand or creator. Traders should analyze each token's individual performance, as each has its own chart and market dynamics (source: Twitter).

China's advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), following the launch of its AI startup DeepSeek, which has captured global attention, is now the focus of the U.S. The U.S. is concerned that China is catching up in AI technology and making progress after importing Nvidia chips. 

Keeping these concerns in mind, US President Donald Trump has imposed restrictions on the export of its H20 AI chips to China. The U.S. aims to maintain its lead over China in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. 

The US government has imposed these rules on its major AI chipmaker firm, Nvidia, preventing it from selling these high-tech chips to China as part of a broader effort to keep the most advanced technology out of China's hands and maintain the US's lead in the AI race.

As per the reports, the U.S. House Select Committee on China said in a report that “it has sent a formal letter to Nvidia demanding answers about sales to China and Southeast Asia to examine whether and how its chips ended up powering DeepSeek's AI models—despite U.S. export restrictions.”

The US and China both want to be global leaders of AI in the AI race, and a part of that, the US government is worried that China could use Nvidia's advanced AI chips to strengthen its military. Since the year 2022, the US has banned the sale of Nvidia's most advanced AI chips to China. 

This decision by the Trump administration has cost Nvidia the loss of $5.5 billion in its sales. These actions are part of the U.S.'s efforts to keep China from getting cutting-edge technology and to stay ahead in AI and military capabilities. This trade war between the two big countries has created a challenge for Nvidia, as it loses sales in China, a major market.

Code & Country welcomes key government officials, the global tech industry, and Bitcoin leaders to discuss the future of tech and policy.

LAS VEGAS, April, 2025 – The Bitcoin Conference, the world's largest Bitcoin and fintech event, and America250 announced “Code & Country,” a first-of-its kind program exploring the intersection of public policy and technology. Taking place on Tuesday, May 27, 2025, at the Venetian Conference Center during Bitcoin 2025, Code & Country will bring together U.S. cabinet officials and policymakers, leading tech companies, and Bitcoin industry titans for a summit on accelerating innovation through public policy.

Chris LaCivita, Co-Manager to Donald Trump's 2024 Presidential Campaign and Senior Strategic Advisor for America250, Rosie Rios, Chair of America250, David Sacks, White House Crypto and AI Czar, and Bo Hines, White House Executive Director have been announced to speak. Bitcoin industry executives joining the program are Gemini Founders, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and the Chief Legal and Chief Policy Officers of Coinbase, Paul Grewal and Faryar Shirzad (respectively,) and BTC Inc Founder and CEO, David Bailey. More speakers and the official program will be announced in the coming weeks on the Bitcoin 2025 website.

“Bitcoin is experiencing unprecedented recognition at the highest levels of government, but it's not happening in a silo,” said David Bailey, Co-Founder and CEO of BTC Inc. “President Trump's establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve is one of many steps he's taken to promote American innovation. Our stage is where these conversations started, and we're taking it to the next level in Las Vegas.”

For the first time, the Bitcoin Conference opens its stage to converging technologies, recognizing that Bitcoin's adoption is a byproduct of widespread technological progress, industrial strength, and a friendly regulatory landscape.

By collaborating with America250, the Congressional Commission tasked with celebrating the 250th anniversary of the United States, the organizers recognize the role American policies play in advancing technology globally.

“President Trump has assembled the first pro-crypto administration,” said Chris LaCivita. “Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and space exploration are all a part of America's legacy for human achievement. President Trump's agenda ensures that crypto, AI, and energy abundance will write this next chapter in history.”

Code & Country will convene Cabinet officials, U.S. Members of Congress, and key figures from federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, Treasury, and Department of Energy alongside industry executives from the Bitcoin, AI, energy, fintech, internet access, space, and enterprise technology sectors. Together, they will explore the next era of human advancement and the critical role that the government plays in fostering open innovation. 

The Bitcoin Conference has historically hosted key political figures including President Donald Trump, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Howard Lutnik, Ron Paul, and Vivek Ramaswamy, many of whom have taken a position with the new administration, are vocal proponents of Bitcoin, and are notable supporters of economic freedom.

Attendance at Code & Country is exclusively available to Bitcoin 2025 Industry Pass and Whale Pass holders, ensuring a high-caliber networking environment. Attendees will hear from and engage in discussions around these topics with more information to be announced in the coming weeks.

Bitcoin was never meant to sit idle.

For over a decade, bitcoin has served as a digital store of value, a hedge against monetary debasement and more recently, a core allocation in institutional portfolios. As the asset matures and infrastructure improves, long-term holders are asking a new question: How do I put my bitcoin to work — without leaving the Bitcoin ecosystem?

The answer lies in a growing but underexplored category of strategies: BTC-on-BTC yield.

Let's be clear: this isn't about lending your BTC on unregulated platforms or chasing high annual percentage yields (APYs) à la BlockFi. That playbook collapsed under the weight of counterparty risk and opacity. What's emerged over the last two years is a more institutional alternative — diversified, risk-managed access to systematic arbitrage and quantitative strategies, all denominated in bitcoin.

Why BTC-native yield matters

For most assets, it's a given that money should work for you. We don't keep dollars under a mattress or tucked away on a thumb drive — we invest them. Yet in the bitcoin world, the dominant narrative has long been “hold and wait.”

That mindset made sense when bitcoin was fighting for legitimacy. But in today's environment — where BTC is being adopted by sovereign wealth funds and traded on major exchanges — long-term holders need better tools.

BTC-on-BTC yield solves this. It aligns with the ethos of accumulating more BTC but does so through institutional-grade strategies that aim to generate returns in BTC, not just on BTC. That distinction matters.

Cold storage isn't a strategy

There's also a myth that simply holding bitcoin in cold storage is the safest option. The phrase “not your keys, not your coins” has become dogma — but it deserves a second look.

In reality, cold storage comes with its own risks: human error, hardware failure, loss of keys and in many cases, an inability to generate any yield whatsoever. Meanwhile, professional custodians — regulated, insured and audited — are now standard infrastructure providers in digital asset management.

For allocators managing material BTC positions, yield-generating custody isn't a tradeoff. It's an upgrade.

How these strategies work

Today's BTC-native yield opportunities span a wide range — from delta-neutral basis trades and statistical arbitrage to DeFi yield farming and machine learning-driven quant execution — but all settled in BTC.

Returns are calculated and distributed in kind. The objective is simple: accumulate more BTC over time, without needing to rely solely on price appreciation.

By allocating across a diversified mix of strategies and managers, investors can pursue consistent BTC growth while mitigating single-strategy or single-manager risk.

Why BTC-on BTC yield is timely

Several forces are converging right now:

In short, bitcoin is growing up. The question is whether the strategies around it will grow with it.

Rethinking HODLing

BTC-on-BTC yield and long-term holding aren't mutually exclusive. Allocators can continue to hold core BTC positions while using active strategies to pursue steady accumulation.

That requires moving beyond cold storage maxims and exploring yield strategies that reflect the sophistication of today's markets. With proper risk controls, BTC-native yield offers a pragmatic path to accumulate more BTC without abandoning its core principles.

The bottom line is that bitcoin doesn't have to sit on the sidelines. It can move with the market — and grow with it.

For allocators thinking in decades, BTC-on-BTC yield opens the door to a more productive bitcoin strategy — one that matches conviction with action.

Q. What's the best way to align early developer incentives with long-term protocol value?

A. The key is to reward real product-market fit and real users — not short-term speculation. That starts with building tight relationships and solving problems for real communities. From there, it's about fostering an “eat what you kill” ecosystem, in which builders who ship products people actually use are rewarded with real economic upside — not just points, grants or temporary incentives. When developers are compensated based on the value they create for users, long-term alignment takes care of itself.

Q. When just starting out in crypto, how can developers filter for signal over noise?

A. Don't just chase the hot thing — look for what will still matter in 5 to 10 years. That's one of the key reasons Bitcoin remains a compelling foundation for builders. It has dedicated users, immense value and a clear product-market fit. Developers should focus on real usage and demand instead of short-term token price action. If you're building something that keeps people engaged because it's useful — not because it's yield-farming season — you're already filtering signal from noise.

Q. What lessons from Bitcoin's design philosophy are still underutilized?

A. Bitcoin is dominant not because it does the most, but because it does one thing better than anyone else. Its product-market fit as digital gold is crypto's most proven use case — and yet it's still underrated. Too many forget that simplicity with real utility wins. Building around Bitcoin and extending its utility without compromising its foundation remains one of the most underrated opportunities in the space today.

President Donald Trump's trade war has introduced significant volatility to financial markets since March, prompting investors to chase assets they believe provide a hedge in this turbulent environment.

What's clear: Bitcoin (BTC) is not one of them, much to the dismay of bullish investors who have long thought of the largest cryptocurrency as digital gold either as a store of value or a haven investment. The reality is that since the onset of the trade war, bitcoin has become more closely correlated with the Aussie dollar-yen pair (AUD/JPY), the foreign exchange market's risk barometer.

Data from TradingView show the 90-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin and the AUD/JPY pair flipped positive in late February and has since hit the highest since November 2021. The tit-for-tat tariff war between the two nations has led to a staggering 245% cumulative levy on Chinese imports to the U.S., leading to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell reiterating stagflation risks on Wednesday.

The correlation of 0.80 — the maximum value is 1 — is considered strong, implying that the two variables, BTC and AUD/JPY, are closely related in their movements in the same direction.

In contrast, bitcoin's 90-day correlation with gold flipped negative in late February and has since dropped to -0.80, just above the minimum -1. It means the two are closely related in their movements, but in opposite directions.

The Australian dollar, being China-sensitive and the home currency of a commodity-exporting nation, is seen as a risk currency. The yen is a safe haven because Japan has been a net international creditor for decades with near-zero interest rates.

When global markets are optimistic and commodity demand rises, the AUD typically appreciates, reflecting a higher risk appetite among investors and the yen drops. The opposite holds true when they become risk-averse.

Traders, therefore, monitor AUD/JPY as a risk indicator, viewing uptrends as positive signs for risk assets like stocks, and vice versa. Bitcoin, which was already emerging in a comparable role, has strengthened its position. The correlation data indicates that BTC is now as much a proxy for risk sentiment as AUD/JPY.

Richard Kim, the founder of crypto casino Zero Edge, was arrested on Tuesday following allegations that he had gambled away investors' funds.



According to an FBI complaint filed on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York, Kim ""fraudulently induced investors to invest in Zero Edge, a cryptocurrency technology company he founded, and then misappropriated millions of dollars in those investors' funds.""



The FBI said Kim lost ""nearly all"" of the $7 million he raised from investors and charged him with securities fraud and wire fraud. According to court records, Kim posted a secured bond of $250,000 and put up $100,000 in ""cash or real property"" to secure it.



CoinDesk was first to report on the Zero Edge incident in July of last year. In an interview at the time, Kim revealed to CoinDesk that he had gambled away more than $3.67 million of his investors' funds through a series of high-risk leveraged crypto trades.



""The downfall began with a careless mistake — a phishing site that cost $80k,"" Kim said in his own recollection of what went wrong, which he shared with CoinDesk in a written statement that he later published as a public apology. ""This triggered my old demons, the need to 'make it back' to preserve my reputation.""



According to Kim, he ""started down a negative spiral of leverage trading, raising more capital, and hiding the truth.""



After losing most of the $7 million he had raised for Zero Edge, Kim told CoinDesk he reported himself to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's public tip line.



""Part of my rationale in reaching out proactively to the SEC was to say, OK guys, I really f—d up. I lost this money. It was grossly negligent. But I didn't intend to go run away with this money,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview.



According to the FBI complaint, Kim's previous accounts ""misleadingly described where investors' funds had gone, and why, and omitted to inform investors that certain funds had been transferred to Shuffle.com, the gambling website.""



Kim's claim that he initially lost $80,000 to a phishing scam and never “mix[ed] personal and business funds,” according to the FBI, failed to account for the fact that he had also sent company funds to an online sportsbook and personal crypto investment accounts.



Kim did not immediately respond to a request for comment this week.



Kim's arrest marks a striking fall from grace. A former executive of Galaxy, the crypto investment firm headed by Michael Novogratz, Kim also led elite trading desks at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. Before that, he was an attorney with the prestigious law firm Cleary Gottlieb.



Galaxy was among the investors in Zero Edge who lost money as a result of Kim's activities.



""Mr. Kim left Galaxy in March 2024 to start Zero Edge, a company in which Galaxy had an immaterial balance-sheet investment,"" said Michael Wursthorn, Galaxy's head of communications. ""Upon learning of certain actions taken by Mr. Kim in his role at Zero Edge, we, along with other investors, reported his conduct to the authorities.""



Kim pitched Zero Edge as a first-of-its-kind crypto casino that would level the playing field for gamblers through improved transparency.



Zero Edge never launched, but Kim told CoinDesk last year that he was motivated to build it because of his history with gambling addiction and his frustration that the house frequently had an opaque and unfair edge over players.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Ethena and tokenization firm Securitize said they will use part of Arbitrum's tech and data availability network Celestia for their real-world asset focused, Ethereum-compatible blockchain, aiming to launch mainnet in the second quarter of this year.

The Converge chain is setting out to have fast blocktimes, allowing users to pay gas fees through Ethena's USDe and USDtb, while creating security and guardrails via its Converge Validator Network, the two protocols behind the project explained in a tech update shared with CoinDesk.

""The idea is that we go on a testnet very soon, in the next few weeks, because we've already been working on this for a while,"" Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, said in an exclusive interview with CoinDesk. ""Then, the mainnet: the goal is to do it before the end of Q2.""

The exact timing of the public rollout also depends on third-party integrations such as Anchorage for custody support, Fireblocks for key management and other DeFi apps the project partnered with, Domingo added.

Converge, unveiled last month, aims to connect the rapidly growing tokenized real-world assets (RWA) sector with the DeFi space, building on existing ecosystems around Ethena and Securitize and their multi billion dollar worth of assets.

Ethena has quickly become a DeFi powerhouse, spearheading the yield-bearing stablecoin trend with its $5 billion ""synthetic dollar"" token USDe. Meanwhile, Securitize issues nearly $4 billion in tokenized assets by traditional finance giants like Apollo and Hamilton Lane and BlackRock's blockchain-based money market fund token BUIDL. The latter is also the key backing asset of Ethena's $1.4 billion USDtb stablecoin.

""Converge's ambitious vision of onboarding tens of billions of institutional capital on-chain requires providing users with high performance and elevated security guarantees,"" Guy Young, founder of development firm Ethena Labs, said in a statement.

To achieve that lofty goal, the Converge chain's performance relies on a custom sequencer for an Arbitrum-powered blockchain, while using Celestia as the data availability layer underneath it, according to the tech update shared with CoinDesk. A sequencer is a key piece of blockchain infrastructure that compiles transactions from layer-2 networks and posts them back to the layer-1 network.

Data availability layers, like Celestia, aim to bring down the downloading and storage costs for data-intensive blockchain networks. The combination of Conduit's G2 sequencer, as well as the use of Arbitrum and Celestia's tech is supposed ""to push the boundaries of what level of throughput is possible on EVM-based networks,"" the team wrote.

The network will use Ethena's USDe and USDtb as gas tokens to pay for transaction costs across the network. Both tokens are designed with a price anchored to $1, allowing easier accounting for transaction costs, the team wrote.

Converge will also support both permissionless and permissioned applications operating side by side. Developers can deploy permissionless DeFi apps freely, while institutional issuers such as Securitize can create permissioned environments for compliant real-world asset products.

In addition, the Converge Validator Network (CVN) is supposed to provide the foundations of the network's security, by essentially acting as the chain's security council. The CVN will have the ability to interfere during emergencies like when funds are at risk, perform circuit breakers to pause user-activity if there are serious bugs, as well as review important governance proposals.

In order to participate in the CVN, validators must stake ENA, Ethena's governance token. According to the team, the CVN will go live shortly after mainnet launches.

""Technical breakthroughs on this initiative will drive asymmetric product outcomes for Converge, and thus growth in USDe, USDtb and other Ethena and Securitize products,"" Young said.

Lombard Finance, a Bitcoin infrastructure developer, has launched a software development kit (SDK) that allows wallets, exchanges, and other platforms to offer one-click bitcoin (BTC) staking.

The release aims to further bring BTC into the decentralized finance (DeFi) economy by tapping into the estimated $154 billion in bitcoin estimated to be sitting idle on centralized exchanges. 

The new toolkit allows users to stake BTC to mint a liquid staking token called LBTC, which can be automatically deposited into Lombard's DeFi Vault for a current annual yield of 3%, according to the protocol.

“Once viewed solely as a store of value, Bitcoin is now increasingly being integrated into DeFi, unlocking new earning opportunities for BTC holders,” said Lombard Finance co-founder Jacob Phillips, who added that the SDK removes “the complexity for both platforms and users.”

Leading cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Bybit have already integrated the SDK, with additional wallet integrations—including xVerse, Metamask, and Trust Wallet—also being supported. For these platforms, the integration offers new revenue streams and a way to keep users engaged through a new DeFi offering, Lombard says.

Bitcoin staking through Lombard's system began seven months ago and has grown into a $4 billion market. Lombard's DeFi Vault, powered by smart contract provider Veda, currently holds more than $200 million in total value locked.

The protocol expanded last month with the launch of its liquid-staking bitcoin token, LBTC, on the Sui blockchain.

The ""Minsky Moment"" is here, according to Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, in a recent interview on CNBC. Novogratz noted that tariffs are playing a key role in reshaping the global security apparatus, while President Trump's return to the political scene is introducing fresh uncertainty into the markets. 

Although equities are down roughly 10% year-to-date, Novogratz believes that's insufficient given the scale of the global economic shifts underway. “We're clearly in a risk-off environment,” Novogratz said.

Novogratz explained that bitcoin (BTC) typically performs well amid macroeconomic uncertainty unless risk appetite completely evaporates. He outlined two major narratives driving bitcoin: the macro story, reflected in gold's recent rally, capital flowing out of the U.S. dollar into perceived safe havens; and the adoption story, which remains in its early stages. While institutional and retail adoption is still developing, Novogratz observed that bitcoin is beginning to trade more independently of U.S. equities. 

Novogratz also warned that the U.S. is starting to behave like an emerging market, a shift not seen in decades. Interest rates are rising while the U.S. dollar weakens an unusual and concerning combination. While, bitcoin and gold are report cards on financial stewardship, Novogratz remarked. 

Novogratz referenced economist Hyman Minsky and said the U.S. could be approaching a ""Minsky Moment,"" where deficits and debt levels finally matter. While sovereign nations have long been able to run large deficits without market backlash, that grace period may be ending.

According to Novogratz, markets are signaling that the Trump-led policy push is too aggressive and unsustainable. Novogratz pointed to the enormous impact of even modest treasury yield increases on the $35 trillion national debt—saying that a 25 or 50 basis point hike has massive implications, potentially costing more on an annualized basis than major savings programs like the Department of Government Efficiency.

 After Fed Chair Powell's comments, BTC price is in a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, with major resistance overhead and several key support levels below $86K. 

Bitcoin's (BTC) price failed another attempt at breaking above resistance at $86,000 on April 16 as  Fed Chair Jerome Powell dashed hopes of early rate cuts, citing the impact of Trump's tariffs.

Since April 9, BTC price has formed daily candle highs between $75,000 and $86,400, but has been unable to produce a close above $86,000.

Many analysts and traders ask, “Where is Bitcoin price headed next?” as the asset remains stuck in a tight range on the lower time frame (LTF) of the 4-hour chart.

Polymarket bettors say there is an 88% chance that the current interest rates will remain between 4.25% and 4.50%, leaving just a 10% probability of a 0.25% rate cut.

However, a common market belief is that any bearish price action from unchanged interest rates is already priced in.

On April 16, US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the Fed is not rushing to cut interest rates. Speaking in Chicago, he emphasized a ""wait-and-see"" approach, needing more economic data before adjusting policy. 

Powell highlighted risks from President Trump's tariffs, which could drive inflation and slow growth, potentially creating a ""challenging scenario"" for the Fed's dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. 

""The level of the tariff increases announced so far is significantly larger than anticipated,"" said Powell in a speech, adding: 

He stressed maintaining a restrictive policy to ensure inflation doesn't persist, suggesting any immediate rate cuts despite market volatility and tariff uncertainties.

As a result, President Trump has threatened Powell with termination, arguing that he is “always too late and wrong” and that his April 16 report was a typical and complete “mess.”

Meanwhile, Polymarket now says there's a 46% chance that Bitcoin's price will hit $90,000 on April 30, with less than 5% possibility of hitting new all-time highs above $110,000.

Bitcoin must flip the $86,000 resistance level into support to target higher highs at $90,000.

For this to happen, BTC/USD must first regain its position above the 200-day exponential moving average (purple line) at $87,740. This trendline was lost on March 9 for the first time since August 2024.

Above that, there is a major supply zone stretching all the way to $91.240, where the 100-day SMA sits. Bulls will also have to overcome this barrier in order to increase the chances of BTC's run to $100,000.

Conversely, the bears will attempt to keep the $86,000 resistance in place, increasing the likelihood of new lows under $80,000. A key area of interest lies between $76,000 and the previous range lows at $74,000, i.e., the previous all-time high from March 2024.

Below that, the next move would be a retest of the US election day price of $67,817, erasing all the gains made from the so-called Trump pump.

Onchain analyst James Check points out that Bitcoin's true bottom lies at its ""true market mean"" — the average cost basis for active investors — around the $65,000 area. 

“The $75,000 zone is an area where you want the bulls to mount a defense,” check said in an interview on the TFTC podcast, adding:

Interestingly, this price level aligns closely with Michael Saylor's Strategy cost basis, which sits around $67,500.

 Bitcoin may be down 10% year-to-date, but that doesn't dent its status as a growing macro hedge, says Glassnode research. Is $155,000 BTC in the cards? 

Bitcoin (BTC) has a new gold-inspired $155,000 target, as analysis describes both assets as “remarkably impressive.”

In a post on X on April 16, trading and analytics account Cryptollica predicted BTC/USD would copy gold to hit new all-time highs.

Bitcoin has made headlines for its inability to follow in gold's record-breaking footsteps in 2025.

While XAU/USD continues to see repeated record highs, BTC/USD is down 9.3% year-to-date, data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows.

Despite calls for an imminent “blow-off top” for gold, Bitcoin bulls hope that after a delay of several months, its “digital” equivalent will follow suit.

For Cryptollica, this means BTC/USD breaking out of a consolidatory wedge structure to swiftly reclaim six figures and more.

“Bitcoin midterm target: 155K $,” it told X followers.

BTC price performance already has various potential tailwinds at its disposal, all of which have fueled bull runs in the past.

As Cointelegraph reported, these include a declining US Dollar Index (DXY) and all-time highs in the global M2 money supply.

Continuing, onchain analytics firm Glassnode argued that despite the price performance disparity, Bitcoin and gold have weathered the current macroeconomic storm remarkably well.

“Amid this turmoil, the performance of hard assets remains remarkably impressive,” it said in the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain,” published on April 16. 

Glassnode said that gold and BTC are “increasingly entering the center stage as global neutral reserve assets.”

In terms of the BTC price drawdown, analysts stressed the fact that by historical standards, the dip versus all-time highs remains modest at around 30%.

“In prior macroeconomic events like last week, Bitcoin has typically experienced greater than -50% sell-offs in such events, which highlights a degree of robustness of modern investor sentiment toward the asset during unfavorable conditions,” it wrote, referring to the ongoing US-China trade war.

 Bitcoin and Ether both dropped in Q1 2025 — even though it's historically been the second-best quarter for Bitcoin and the best for Ether. 

Despite recent major developments in the crypto industry, the market has just posted its weakest Q1 performance in years — but a crypto analyst is pointing to several catalysts that could make Q2 more promising.

“Frustrating. That's the best word to describe the past quarter,” Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan said in a recent market report, calling Q1 the “best worst quarter in crypto's history.”

Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, saw price declines of 11.82% and 45.41%, respectively, over Q1 2025 — a quarter that has historically seen strong results for both assets. Since 2013, Q1 has been Bitcoin's second-strongest quarter on average (51.2%) and historically the best for Ether (77.4%), according to CoinGlass data.

Hougan pointed to a few key catalysts that could help crypto deliver more upside to Q2. 

He noted the rise in global money supply, which “after years of tightening, central banks across the globe are signaling a shift toward monetary easing and M2 expansion.”

“Historically, these conditions have been favorable for risk assets, particularly for digital assets,” Hougan said. Echoing a similar sentiment, Pav Hundal, the lead analyst at Australian crypto exchange Swyftx, told Cointelegraph in February that “in normal times, global loosening measures are a pretty reliable lead indicator for crypto.”

More recently, on April 14, analyst Colin Talks Crypto said, “Global M2 has remained at an ATH for 3 days in a row.” Bitcoin moves in the direction of global M2 83% of the time, economist Lyn Alden wrote in a September research report.

Hougan also said the “clean sweep of pro-regulations” in the US may be another bullish factor for the crypto market. “This is the long tail of regulatory clarity that no one is talking about, and it's just getting started,” Hougan said.

The rise in stablecoin assets under management may also be a positive indicator that more upside will come this year in the crypto market. Hougan said during the first quarter, stablecoin assets under management surged to “an all-time high of over $218 million.”

“Growing stablecoin adoption will benefit adjacent sectors, including DeFi and other crypto applications,” he said.

The firm also said that the “geopolitical chaos” seen in the global economy during Q1 2025, mainly after US President Donald Trump's inauguration through his tariffs, “are pushing global investors to reassess their portfolios.”

It comes only days after Hougan recently reiterated his prediction that Bitcoin may surge approximately 138% from its current price of $84,080 by the end of the year.

“In December, Bitwise predicted that Bitcoin would end the year at $200,000. I still think that's in play,” Hougan said.

Meanwhile, crypto exchange Coinbase recently said, “When the sentiment finally resets, it's likely to happen rather quickly, and we remain constructive for the second half of 2025.”

 Quantum researchers are offering 1 Bitcoin to whoever cracks the biggest “toy version” of a Bitcoin key  using Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer. 

Quantum computing research firm Project Eleven has launched a competition to see just how much of a threat quantum computing currently poses to Bitcoin.

Launching the competition on April 16, Project Eleven said it is offering 1 Bitcoin (BTC) to whoever cracks the biggest chunk of a Bitcoin key using a quantum computer within the next year. 

Project Eleven said the purpose of the “Q-Day Prize” is to test “how urgent the threat” of quantum is to Bitcoin and to find quantum-proof solutions to secure Bitcoin over the long term.

“10 million+ addresses have exposed public keys. Quantum computing is steadily progressing. Nobody has rigorously benchmarked this threat yet,” Project Eleven wrote on X on April 16.

More than 6 million Bitcoin — worth around $500 billion — could be at risk if quantum computers become powerful enough to crack elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) keys, Project Eleven said.

Participants can register as individuals or as a team and have until April 5, 2026, to complete the task. The prize winner will win 1 Bitcoin, currently worth $84,100.

The aim is to run Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer to crack as many bits of a Bitcoin key as possible, acting as a proof-of-concept that the technique could scale to crack a full, 256-bit Bitcoin key once the necessary compute is available. 

“The mission: break the largest ECC key possible using Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer. No classical shortcuts. No hybrid tricks. Pure quantum power,” Project Eleven said.

“You don't need to break a Bitcoin key. A 3-bit key would be big news,” it added.

No ECC key used in real-world applications has ever been cracked, noted Project Eleven, adding that the winner could “go down in cryptography history.”

Project Eleven noted that several online platforms offer quantum computing access, such as Amazon Web Services and IBM.

Current estimates suggest that around 2,000 logical qubits (error-corrected) would be enough to break a 256-bit ECC key, Project Eleven noted.

IBM's Heron chip and Google's Willow can currently do 156 and 105 qubits — significant enough to cause concern, according to Project Eleven, which believes a 2,000-qubit quantum system could be developed within the next decade.

Bitcoin cypherpunk Jameson Lopp recently said the question of how concerned the industry should be about quantum computing is currently “unanswerable.”

“I think it's far from a crisis, but given the difficulty in changing Bitcoin it's worth starting to seriously discuss,” Lopp said in a March 16 post.

In February, Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said the concern is well-founded but is confident that quantum-proof Bitcoin addresses will be implemented well before any “serious threat” emerges.

 Binance is reportedly advising global governments on setting up strategic Bitcoin reserves and crypto regulations, as countries follow the US lead on digital asset policy, its CEO said. 

Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is involved in discussions on establishing strategic digital asset reserves with several countries, its CEO, Richard Teng, reportedly said.

Binance has been advising multiple governments on establishing strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserves and formulating crypto asset regulations, Teng said in an interview with the Financial Times on April 17.

“We have actually received quite a number of approaches by a few governments and sovereign wealth funds on the establishment of their own crypto reserves,” Teng told the FT.

Teng did not identify any countries but said that the United States is “way ahead on that front.”

According to Teng, the main reason for governments approaching Binance for help in handling potential strategic reserves is the new crypto-friendly agenda in the US.

Teng referred to key US crypto policy developments, such as discussions around creating a national Bitcoin reserve and digital asset stockpile. Earlier this year, Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve seeded with BTC forfeited in federal criminal and civil cases.

While governments of Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan have announced collaboration with Binance and former CEO Changpeng Zhao on crypto regulations in the past few weeks, none of the jurisdictions mentioned crypto reserve plans on their agenda.

As Binance deepens its involvement in efforts to help countries set up crypto reserves and regulations, it appears to have shifted away from its no-formal-headquarters approach under Zhao.

According to Teng, Binance is “working very hard” on plans for a global headquarters for the exchange.

“It requires serious deliberation and the board and the senior management are spending a lot of time doing the evaluation,” Teng reportedly said, adding: “Hopefully we are able to announce our intentions on that front.”

In 2019, Zhao said that offices and headquarters are “old concepts like SMS and MMS.”

The shift comes as more jurisdictions adopt clearer frameworks for regulating crypto businesses. Binance was subject to heavy scrutiny and investigations by multiple governments in 2020.

Cointelegraph approached Binance for comment regarding its crypto policy collaboration with governments worldwide, but had not received a response by the time of publication.

North America May Be Dripping Away Deep under the Midwest

A long-lost slab of Earth's crust may be pulling away the bottom of the oldest part of North America, scientists say

By Meghan Bartels edited by Andrea Thompson

Something very strange appears to be happening deep, deep beneath the Midwest and Ohio Valley.

North America's geological core has persisted for billions of years—it's what scientists call a craton, a massive block of continental rock that withstands the natural recycling system of plate tectonics. Typically, scientists think of cratons as unchanging, nigh on eternal. But new research published on March 28 in Nature Geoscience suggests that a long-lost geological plate may be siphoning rock from the bottom of the North American craton, eroding it from below, right under our feet.

Such a scenario would not be unprecedented—scientists have evidence that the North China craton thinned dramatically millions of years ago—but it would certainly be surprising and intriguing to study in real time. “Cratons are the oldest cores of continents, so they have been sitting near the Earth's surface for billions of years,” says Claire Currie, a geophysicist at the University of Alberta, who was not involved in the new research. “They've persisted through time, so this is quite unusual.”

The scientists behind the new research had no intention of finding an eroding craton, according to study co-author Junlin Hua, a geophysicist at the University of Science and Technology of China. The team merely wanted to apply a new, more precise analysis technique to the data gathered by North America's rich network of more than 6,000 seismometers in hope of seeing the continent in more detail than ever before.

The work relied on the seismometer network's observations of more than 200 earthquakes, each of which produced multiple types of seismic waves. These waves are affected in specific ways by changes in the material they pass through—for example, there are particular effects when that material is relatively cold or warm or strong or weak. By analyzing the waves, scientists can reverse engineer a map of Earth's innards, Hua says. And the researchers sought to conduct this work in a way that would account for every wiggle in the trove of seismic data, a laborious process.

A map produced by the authors ofa new study in Nature Geoscience shows the relative seismic velocity of material that is 200 kilometers below Earth's surface and located around the base of the North American craton. Cratons are characterized by high seismic velocity. On this map, blue represents rock through which seismic waves travel faster; red represents rock through which seismic waves travel more slowly. The black dashed line outlines the borders of the North American craton.

Nature Geoscience, Hua et al.

It was months into the analysis when Hua started to recognize that the work was turning up something surprising. The craton itself looked normal enough: a slab of dense rock, about 200 kilometers thick, through which seismic waves traveled relatively fast—what scientists refer to as high-seismic-velocity material—that abruptly transitioned to material with lower seismic velocity as the craton gave way to younger rock.

But beneath part of the craton—underneath much of the Midwest and Ohio Valley—something strange was happening. Here, a patchy pattern of material with that same high seismic velocity sagged to a depth of nearly 600 kilometers, almost to the lower mantle. Those measurements, Hua says, suggest that in this area, North America's craton is dripping downward into the mantle in a way he and his colleagues didn't expect and couldn't quite explain.

What got them unstuck was considering a relic of geological history that lies hidden below North America: remains of the Farallon plate. This was an oceanic plate that stretched between the Pacific and North American plates some 100 million years ago, when the dinosaurs were at their peak. Most of the Farallon plate was eventually shoved beneath North America. Its remnants linger in the lower mantle, some 800 kilometers below Earth's surface, and indeed showed up in the cross sections of seismic velocities that Hua and his colleagues made.

A diagram demonstrates the researchers' theory for what's happening underneath the North American craton. The material in the map shown above sits near the top of the areas illustrated in this diagram,where the layer labeled “Cratonic lithosphere” bulges downward into the upper mantle. The Farallon slab (purple), sinks down through the lower mantle. Between the two stretches a relatively narrow region where cratonic material is dripping down, fed by horizontal movement at the base of the entire craton.

Nature Geoscience, Hua et al.

When the scientists used computer modeling to test theories of what could pull cratonic material downward, the Farallon slab was key: drips formed only when the slab was incorporated into the model. Hua calls the slab “a big sinker” that pulls material off the craton and down into Earth.

Right now, Currie says, this is just a hypothesis—but one that she calls “intriguing.” Currie would like to see other signals of the cratonic drip—for example, is the surface of Earth being pulled down at all over this region? She would also like to see stronger explanations for how the craton gets pulled down into material denser than it is because it ought to float above such material.

Still, the research is a surprising glimpse of activity in an environment that scientists have long considered unchanging, Hua says. “The continent is not something static,” he says. “It has a dynamic component.”

RFK, Jr. Is Wrong about Cause of Rising Autism Rates, Scientists Say

Autism rates are rising, but RFK, Jr. is wrong about the reasons. Here's what the science says

By Stephanie Pappas edited by Jeanna Bryner

Research suggests that autism is between 60 and 90 percent heritable.

Maskot/Getty Images

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, struck an alarmist tone about new findings that one in 31 eight-year-olds in the U.S. have an autism diagnosis at a press conference today.

Kennedy called autism a “tragedy” that “destroys families.” And his statements also included assertations that autism experts say are out of date, such as the idea that autistic kids “regress” around their second birthday. In fact, while autism is often diagnosed at this age, researchers have found brain differences as early as six months of age among kids who were later diagnosed as autistic. Some studies have also found subtle differences in motor behavior and social behavior, such as looking less at people than typically developing kids do, in babies who were later diagnosed as autistic.

But Kennedy's greatest breach with the scientific consensus was likely his insistence that autism is an “epidemic” that must be caused by an environmental exposure that has been introduced within the past several decades. In fact, researchers say, autism is between 60 and 90 percent heritable. And in up to 40% percent of cases, doctors can find a specific set of genetic mutations to explain the condition. While there are environmental risk factors for autism, such as air pollution, rising rates are mostly attributable to broadened diagnostic categories and more comprehensive screening.

“The problem from a science communication standpoint is that the causes are complex,” says Annette Estes, director of the University of Washington Autism Center. “It's not like Down syndrome, where we can say, ‘There is one genetic change that leads to this syndrome, and everybody with this syndrome has these characteristics.' Even though the amount we've learned is unbelievable, it's also not a simple story.”

The new finding that one in 31 kids born in 2014 are autistic comes from a newly released report from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network (ADDM), which started tracking data in 2000. That year one in 150 eight-year-olds were diagnosed as autistic, and the number has been steadily rising since. Kennedy also cited numbers from the 1970s and 1980s that showed rates of autism that represented around one to three in 10,000 people.

This period saw a number of changes in how autism was diagnosed, however. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which has lays out criteria for psychiatric diagnoses in the U.S., called autism “schizophrenic reaction, childhood type” in its first edition and subsequently referred to it as “schizophrenia, childhood type” until 1980, when the diagnosis changed to “infantile autism.” The criteria then focused on external symptoms such as delays in language development, resistance to change and attachments to objects. In 1987 the criteria widened and encompassed three categories related to social interaction, communication and restrictions in activities. In 1994 the diagnosis of Asperger's disorder appeared, only to be subsumed into a broadened “autism spectrum disorder” in the DSM's fifth edition (DSM-5) in 2013. That year was also the first in which autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder could be diagnosed in the same child at the same time, Estes says. Prior to that time, an ADHD diagnosis would preclude a child from getting an autism diagnosis, even though researchers currently estimate that half or more of autistic people also have ADHD.

Kennedy downplayed diagnostic shift as a minor explanation for the increase in autism cases, but researchers have found that changes in diagnosis probably explain a majority of the increase. A 2015 study on children diagnosed as autistic in Denmark, for example, found that 60 percent of the rise of autism among children born between 1980 and 1991 was caused by changes in diagnostic criteria and reporting practices. Another 2015 study examined students in U.S. special education programs between 2000 and 2010. The number of autistic children who enrolled in special education tripled from 93,624 to 419,647. In the same time frame, however, the number of children labeled as having an “intellectual disability” declined from 637,270 to 457,478. The shift of children from one diagnostic category to another explained two thirds of the increase in autism in this population, researchers say.

Another piece of evidence for changes in diagnosis explaining a large difference in the prevalence of autism is that autism rates vary widely from state to state in the U.S. The state with the highest prevalence of autism is California, with a rate of 53.1 per 1,000 eight-year-olds, while the one with the lowest prevalence is Texas, with a rate of 9.7 per 1,000 eight-year-olds. That's a huge difference. But according to the CDC's own report, it's likely linked to California's intense push for early screening and assessment.

“Because of all the hard work that everyone has done to come up with good approaches for supporting and teaching autistic kids, there are benefits of getting an autism diagnosis,” Estes says. “So people seek it out. And that, coupled with less stigma around autism, means more people want to understand their kids in this way.”

Some portion of the rise in autism rates may be unrelated to better diagnosis. The likelihood of having an autistic child increases for older parents, and there is a societal trend toward delaying childbirth across developed countries. Children who are born prematurely are also at a heightened risk of autism, and improved neonatal care means many more of these children are surviving to childhood and beyond.

There are also known environmental risk factors for autism. Among pregnant people, for example, infections that are accompanied by fever in the second trimester raise the risk of autism for their eventual baby. So does exposure to fine particulate matter pollution in the third trimester of development and the first year of life, according to a 2019 study. Laura McGuinn, an epidemiologist at the University of Chicago, who led a study that made the latter finding, says that particulate matter is inflammatory, and work is ongoing to understand how it might trigger the maternal immune system and potentially affect brain development.

As Secretary of Health and Human Services, Kennedy promised “some” of the answers to the causes of autism by September. But his “start from scratch” approach largely ignores research that has already been done. For example, Kennedy told reporters the initiative would look at ultrasounds during pregnancy as a possible risk factor. But a comprehensive multisite study of more than 1,500 pregnancies that found no link between autism and ultrasound use was published as recently as 2023. And scientists definitively ruled out the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine as a cause of autism a decade ago (and again in 2019). In addition, the primary study that had suggested a link between the MMR vaccine and autism was found to have falsified data. Despite this, federal officials said in March that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct a study to investigate a link between vaccines and autism. The study will be led by a vaccine skeptic who was previously disciplined for practicing medicine without a license.

Work on untangling the complex environmental risk factors was ongoing prior to Kennedy's tenure, including at federal agencies such as the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, which is developing a Web-based tool to help scientists make sense of the existing data on environmental studies and autism.

“As scientists, I wish there was a way we could talk about this and really explain how amazing it is, how much taxpayer money has gone to creating this understanding of this complex developmental disorder and how to help kids and parents,” Estes says. “This idea that there needs to be one single cause, and it needs to be really scary—it's just really taking us backward.”

According to experts, the building may have once been a royal “water palace.”

The Konbaung Dynasty (1752 to 1885)—also known as the Third Burmese Empire—was the last dynasty to rule Burma (now Myanmar), eventually toppled by the British. A recent natural disaster may give researchers a rare look into remnants of the empire, or at least one remnant in particular. On March 28, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake revealed an ancient structure in Tada-U Township, Myanmar. According to a translated report from the Department of Archaeology and National Museum, some believe the remains could have been part of a royal “water palace” from the Konbaung era. 

Part of the archaeological site—a set of stairs—was originally uncovered in 2009 while locals were baking bricks. But the recent earthquake caused a fissure that revealed more parts of the structure that were previously hidden beneath layers of soil. Exploratory excavations began on April 9, led by the Mandalay branch of the Department of Archaeology. Researchers say that additional ruins, including a handrail, brick platforms, and an 18-inch riser step, are now visible. According to the report, some of these features resemble sketches from ancient palm-leaf manuscripts called “Pura-pike.” 

Historically, water has been a religious symbol in Myanmar culture, so water palaces served as important places for rituals, the Department of Archaeology and National Museum reports. The water palace described in the palm-leaf manuscript—supposedly penned by Minister Letwe Nawrahta (a prominent minister during the Burmese Kingdom)—has five grand staircases and 18 to 20 dormitories shaded by mango trees. 

Though the prospect of finding a royal water palace is exciting, it's much more likely the structure is something simpler. Researchers suggest the building may have been a wooden residence, spanning about 200-250 feet long and 200 feet wide. According to experts, the structure resembles the Inwa Varkara Wooden Monastery and the Shwenandaw (Golden Palace) Monastery in Mandalay. 

Some commenters are critical of researchers not unearthing the structure when it was initially discovered in 2009. Because of the possible religious significance of the site and how little is currently known, Myanmar's Department of Archaeology and National Museum reports that further research will continue and, in the future, the structure will be preserved for public education.

And it's not the first batch they've discovered in the area.

Most of us have skeletons in our closets, but they can also lurk in much less familiar places. Literally.

Hundreds of skeletons were recently unearthed at the site of an abandoned Debenhams department store in the UK. The remains of 317 individuals from medieval and post-medieval burial grounds were discovered by archaeologists from Cotswold Archaeology in Kings Square, Gloucester, as the site was being redeveloped into the University of Gloucester's City Campus. The university actually commissioned Cotswold Archaeology to excavate at the site because artifacts have continued to crop up in the area.

“Every time we work in Gloucester, we make new discoveries,” Cliff Bateman, Cotswold Archaeology Senior Project Officer, said in a press release. “It's a massively important place.”

Among the skeletons were artifacts such as a tobacco pipe and fragments of a wine bottle. Many earlier artifacts from the Roman period also surfaced, which makes sense, considering that what is now King's Square is thought to have once been the northeast quadrant of an ancient Roman town. Since the project began in 2023, archaeologists have found many vestiges of the Roman period, including pottery, 83 brick burial vaults (which were cleared in the mid-1950s), the foundations of a wall from a townhouse, and what appears to be a road dating back to the 2nd Century A.D.

Other recent finds include brick burial vaults and a crypt from St. Aldate's Church—the external wall and porch of which appeared when remodeling efforts started. It was built in 1750 to replace a church of the same name, whose origins traced back to before the Norman Conquest in 1066 (it was meant to honor a fallen bishop of Gloucester, who died in battle in 577). That church ended up so damaged from the English Civil War that it was finally torn down in the mid-1700s. The later St. Aldate's stood until 1960, but has long since been demolished. Evidence of its medieval predecessor has not yet appeared, but is thought to be in the area. 

Burials associated with the vanished medieval church were also found when the site was first being remodeled. The bones of twelve individuals were only exhumed for research before being reinterred in their original graves.  

Bateman also said that he is just about positive “there will be Roman buildings in situ” beneath the post-medieval necropolis. This isn't surprising to archaeologists, who first started finding mosaics and ruins of Roman buildings in the basement of the empty Debenham's.

Preliminary studies on the teeth of skeletons have found that the people they came from likely consumed a diet high in sugar. While there is little else known about the remains—except that about half of them were not in burial vaults like some of the other skeletons found nearby—Gloucester is apparently one of those places where pieces of the ancient past are literally inches beneath your feet. Excavations in another part of the city previously revealed even more skeletons, this time from the Late Roman period, which were buried both on their backs and facedown. Some of them were even decapitated, then laid to rest with their heads between their feet. 

While human remains will not be on display at the university, the Roman, medieval, and post-medieval artifacts found at the site will eventually have their own shrine.

“These objects have been retained on site, following archaeological recording, and will be displayed on site for students, staff and visitors to City Campus to appreciate once the site is fully operational,” Steve Sheldon, Acting Principal Manager of Cotswold Archaeology, said in a more recent press release.

The campus in progress will be opening in September. There could be no more epic way to kick off an ancient history class.

Experts aren't sure why it was buried in the first place.

The discovery of a silver treasure hoard—this one unearthed by metal detectorists—has shed a sparkling light on just how richly adorned the Dacian elite once were. 

What is now modern-day Romania was once ruled by a people group known as the Dacians, who were prominent from around 500 B.C. into the first century A.D. This spring (according to a translated statement from the Museum of Mures County posted by the Breaza Mures Municipality City Hall), metal detectorists Moldovan Dionisie-Aurel and Zahan Sebastian-Adrian scoured an area around the town of Breaza in central Romania, and uncovered a cache of six silver ornamental pieces that date to the Dacian people.

This is the first find of Dacian treasure in Breaza, and it doesn't disappoint. 

The haul included a bracelet made of a circular silver bar with slightly widened ends and plant-like motif decorations, a matching pair of two knotted brooches without decoration (but with an elongated plate and a spring), a smaller brooch with four knobs, a neck chain with a looped link holding three nail-like pendants, a waist belt made up of oval plates attached alternately with a series of links, and a rectangular plate that likely  attached to the belt, the last of which would likely have been decorated with a series of solar motifs showing the role the Sun played in ancient Dacian culture. 

In total, the treasure weighs 19 ounces and “represented an important symbol of the owner's social status,” museum archaeologist Daniel Cioata wrote. He added that the items would have been worn by a prominent member of the Dacian aristocracy on various special occasions, but it's “difficult to say whether it was a man or a woman.” Either way, they would have shined in silver. 

The buried silver didn't offer up many clues as to why it was placed where it was to begin with—as Cioata said, it could have been an offering to a deity, or simply never retrieved after the owner hid it away. 

This find opens up the possibility for further Dacian discoveries in and around the town of Breaza. “We hope that through field research in the coming period,” Cioata said, “the Dacian settlement or even the fortification in the area will be identified.” 

Plans are now in place to document and further study the silver hoard, which the Mures County Museum will exhibit. 

“These historical artifacts,” the city said in a statement, “remind us of the cultural heritage and importance of our region in the history of Dacia.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Strongest hints yet of biological activity outside the solar system","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/04/250416204034.htm","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 04:15:46 GMT","

Astronomers have detected the most promising signs yet of a possible biosignature outside the solar system, although they remain cautious.

Using data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the astronomers, led by the University of Cambridge, have detected the chemical fingerprints of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and/or dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), in the atmosphere of the exoplanet K2-18b, which orbits its star in the habitable zone.

On Earth, DMS and DMDS are only produced by life, primarily microbial life such as marine phytoplankton. While an unknown chemical process may be the source of these molecules in K2-18b's atmosphere, the results are the strongest evidence yet that life may exist on a planet outside our solar system.

The observations have reached the 'three-sigma' level of statistical significance -- meaning there is a 0.3% probability that they occurred by chance. To reach the accepted classification for scientific discovery, the observations would have to cross the five-sigma threshold, meaning there would be below a 0.00006% probability they occurred by chance.

The researchers say between 16 and 24 hours of follow-up observation time with JWST may help them reach the all-important five-sigma significance. Their results are reported in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Earlier observations of K2-18b -- which is 8.6 times as massive and 2.6 times as large as Earth, and lies 124 light years away in the constellation of Leo -- identified methane and carbon dioxide in its atmosphere. This was the first time that carbon-based molecules were discovered in the atmosphere of an exoplanet in the habitable zone. Those results were consistent with predictions for a 'Hycean' planet: a habitable ocean-covered world underneath a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.

However, another, weaker signal hinted at the possibility of something else happening on K2-18b. ""We didn't know for sure whether the signal we saw last time was due to DMS, but just the hint of it was exciting enough for us to have another look with JWST using a different instrument,"" said Professor Nikku Madhusudhan from Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy, who led the research.

To determine the chemical composition of the atmospheres of faraway planets, astronomers analyse the light from its parent star as the planet transits, or passes in front of the star as seen from the Earth. As K2-18b transits, JWST can detect a drop in stellar brightness, and a tiny fraction of starlight passes through the planet's atmosphere before reaching Earth. The absorption of some of the starlight in the planet's atmosphere leaves imprints in the stellar spectrum that astronomers can piece together to determine the constituent gases of the exoplanet's atmosphere.

The earlier, tentative, inference of DMS was made using JWST's NIRISS (Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph) and NIRSpec (Near-Infrared Spectrograph) instruments, which together cover the near-infrared (0.8-5 micron) range of wavelengths. The new, independent observation used JWST's MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) in the mid-infrared (6-12 micron) range.

""This is an independent line of evidence, using a different instrument than we did before and a different wavelength range of light, where there is no overlap with the previous observations,"" said Madhusudhan. ""The signal came through strong and clear.""

""It was an incredible realisation seeing the results emerge and remain consistent throughout the extensive independent analyses and robustness tests,"" said co-author Måns Holmberg, a researcher at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, USA.

DMS and DMDS are molecules from the same chemical family, and both are predicted to be biosignatures. Both molecules have overlapping spectral features in the observed wavelength range, although further observations will help differentiate between the two molecules.

However, the concentrations of DMS and DMDS in K2-18b's atmosphere are very different than on Earth, where they are generally below one part per billion by volume. On K2-18b, they are estimated to be thousands of times stronger -- over ten parts per million.

""Earlier theoretical work had predicted that high levels of sulfur-based gases like DMS and DMDS are possible on Hycean worlds,"" said Madhusudhan. ""And now we've observed it, in line with what was predicted. Given everything we know about this planet, a Hycean world with an ocean that is teeming with life is the scenario that best fits the data we have.""

Madhusudhan says that while the results are exciting, it's vital to obtain more data before claiming that life has been found on another world. He says that while he is cautiously optimistic, there could be previously unknown chemical processes at work on K2-18b that may account for the observations. Working with colleagues, he is hoping to conduct further theoretical and experimental work to determine whether DMS and DMDS can be produced non-biologically at the level currently inferred.

""The inference of these biosignature molecules poses profound questions concerning the processes that might be producing them"" said co-author Subhajit Sarkar of Cardiff University.

""Our work is the starting point for all the investigations that are now needed to confirm and understand the implications of these exciting findings,"" said co-author Savvas Constantinou, also from Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy.

""It's important that we're deeply sceptical of our own results, because it's only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we're confident in them,"" Madhusudhan said. ""That's how science has to work.""

While he is not yet claiming a definitive discovery, Madhusudhan says that with powerful tools like JWST and future planned telescopes, humanity is taking new steps toward answering that most essential of questions: are we alone?

""Decades from now, we may look back at this point in time and recognise it was when the living universe came within reach,"" said Madhusudhan. ""This could be the tipping point, where suddenly the fundamental question of whether we're alone in the universe is one we're capable of answering.""

Metrics details

The stability of fluorescent proteins (FPs) is crucial for imaging techniques such as live-cell imaging, super-resolution microscopy and correlative light and electron microscopy. Although stable green and yellow FPs are available, stable monomeric red FPs (RFPs) remain limited. Here we develop an extremely stable monomeric RFP named mScarlet3-H and determine its structure at a 1.5 Å resolution. mScarlet3-H exhibits remarkable resistance to high temperature, chaotropic conditions and oxidative environments, enabling efficient correlative light and electron microscopy imaging and rapid (less than 1 day) whole-organ tissue clearing. In addition, its high photostability allows long-term three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy imaging of mitochondrial dynamics with minimal photobleaching. It also facilitates dual-color live-cell stimulated emission depletion imaging with a high signal-to-noise ratio and strong specificity. Systematic benchmarking against high-performing RFPs established mScarlet3-H as a highly stable RFP for multimodality microscopy in cell cultures and model organisms, complementing green FPs for multiplexed imaging in zebrafish, mice and Nicotiana benthamiana.

Scientists are trying to measure the impact on global health of funding cuts by the US administration. Credit: Luis Tato/AFP via Getty

The United States spent roughly US$12 billion on global health in 2024. Without that yearly spending, roughly 25 million people could die in the next 15 years, according to models that have estimated the impact of such cuts on programmes for tuberculosis, HIV, family planning and maternal and child health.

The United States has long been the largest donor for health initiatives in poor countries, accounting for almost one-quarter of all global health assistance from donors. These investments have contributed to consistent public-health gains for more than a decade. HIV deaths, for example, dropped by 51% globally between 2010 and 2023, and deaths owing to tuberculosis dropped by 23% between 2015 and 2023.

But the administration of US President Donald Trump has cut billions of dollars of spending for global health, including dismantling the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and freezing foreign-aid contributions — some of which has been temporarily restored.

Researchers have been trying to study the potential impact of the funding cuts. John Stover, an infectious-diseases modeller at Avenir Health, a global-health organization in Glastonbury, Connecticut, and his colleagues used mathematical models to estimate health outcomes, should all US funding for global health be cut and not replaced, compared with outcomes if funding provided in 2024 were to continue through to 2040. The results were posted on the preprint server SSRN earlier this month and have not been peer reviewed1.

Source: Stover/Preprints with The Lancet

The researchers “use a combination of robust, well-established and proven mathematical models and analytical approaches to estimate the impact”, says Andrew Vallely, a clinical epidemiologist at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. “Their findings are devastating to read” and “a wake-up call for all of us working in global health.”

James Trauer, an infectious-disease modeller at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, adds: “These models are probably as good as we have available at the moment for predicting the direct effects of the funding cuts on these various programmes.”

On 28 March, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said that the government was reorienting its foreign-assistance programmes to align with the country's priorities. “We are continuing essential life-saving programmes and making strategic investments that strengthen our partners and our own country.”

The researchers modelled the impact of cutting the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in the 55 countries it supports, including stopping the delivery of treatments, tests and interventions that prevent transmission. The programme has been affected by funding freezes.

Without PEPFAR, there would be 15 million more deaths from AIDS by 2040 than if the programme continued (see ‘A world without US aid'). More than 60% of those deaths would take place in six African countries, including Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda. Roughly 14 million extra children would become orphans as a result of those AIDS deaths — a trend that had been expected to decrease over the next 15 years. And 26 million more people could become infected with HIV without PEPFAR.

Source: Stover/Preprints with The Lancet

The impact varies considerably depending on how reliant a country is on US government support, says Stover. In Uganda, for example, 65% of funding for HIV research comes from the United States, he says. Some models estimated the effects of a partial-funding scenario; in this case, continuing funding for treatment alone could avert 97% of the extra deaths and 90% of the extra new HIV infections.

The global number of infections of Mycobacterium tuberculosis — the bacterium that causes the world's deadliest infectious disease — is also expected to ramp up without US aid funding. Researchers looked at the impact of cuts to USAID and US contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria across 79 low- and middle-income countries — although it is not yet clear by how much US contributions to the fund will shrink in the coming years. These would contribute to 69 million more M. tuberculosis infections and 2 million more deaths by 2040.

These estimates are broadly consistent with other efforts to assess the impact, says Trauer.

“There's been tremendous progress made in global health over the last couple of decades and we're at risk of losing a lot of that,” says Katherine Horton, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who contributed to the modelling on tuberculosis.

Discord is facing a new lawsuit from the state of New Jersey, which claims that the chat app is engaged in “deceptive and unconscionable business practices” that put its younger users in danger.

The lawsuit, filed on Thursday, comes after a multiyear investigation by the New Jersey Office of Attorney General. The AG's office claims it has uncovered evidence that, despite Discord's policies to protect children and teens, the popular messaging app is putting youth “at risk.”

“We're the first state in the country to sue Discord,” Attorney General Matthew Platkin tells WIRED.

Platkin says there were two catalysts for the investigation. One is personal: A few years ago, a family friend came to Platkin, astonished that his 10-year-old son was able to sign up for Discord, despite the platform forbidding children under 13 from registering.

The second was the mass-shooting in Buffalo, in neighboring New York. The perpetrator used Discord as his personal diary in the lead-up to the attack and livestreamed the carnage directly to the chat and video app. (The footage was quickly removed.)

“These companies have consistently, knowingly, put profit ahead of the interest and well-being of our children,” Platkin says.

The AG's office claims in the lawsuit that Discord violated the state's Consumer Fraud Act. The allegations, which were filed on Thursday morning, turn on a set of policies adopted by Discord to keep children younger than 13 off the platform and to keep teenagers safe from sexual exploitation and violent content. The lawsuit is just the latest in a growing list of litigation from states against major social media firms—litigation that has, thus far, proven fairly ineffective.

Discord's child and teen safety policies are clear: Children under 13 are forbidden from the messaging app, while it more broadly forbids any sexual interaction with minors, including youth “self-endangerment.” It further has algorithmic filters operating to stop unwanted sexual direct messages. The California-based company's safety policy, published in 2023, states, “We built Discord to be different and work relentlessly to make it a fun and safe space for teens.”

But New Jersey says “Discord's promises fell, and continue to fall, flat.”

The attorney general points out that Discord has three levels of safety to prevent youth from unwanted and exploitative messages from adults: “Keep me safe,” where the platform scans all messages into a user's inbox; “my friends are nice,” where it does not scan messages from friends; and “do not scan,” where it scans no messages.

Even for teenage users, the lawsuit alleges, the platform defaults to “my friends are nice.” The attorney general claims this is an intentional design that represents a threat to younger users. The lawsuit also alleges that Discord is failing by not conducting age verification to prevent children under 13 from signing up for the service.

In 2023, Discord added new filters to detect and block unwanted sexual content, but the AG's office says the company should have enabled the “keep my safe” option by default.

“Consider me unimpressed by their PR campaign,” Platkin says. He contends that the new features are insufficient and easy to get around, and they are less than what the company has made available to users in other countries. “If you put lipstick on a pig,” he says, “it's still a pig.”

WIRED reached out to Discord for comment about its child safety measures but has not heard back.

“Together, these open design features and default settings make it so that anyone can gain direct, private access to a child user with just a few clicks,” the filings allege. Later, the AG goes further, writing that “Discord promised parents safety but made deliberate choices to design its Application and establish default settings that rendered those promises utterly meaningless.”

The lawsuit lists a half-dozen criminal cases where adults allegedly used Discord to lure and exploited children, including the case of 764, a digital far-right pedophile ring.

The lawsuit proposes several different remedies, including a court injunction requiring that Discord improve its safety features and possible financial penalties if it's found to be failing to keep its users safe.

While this appears to be the first state-level lawsuit against Discord, a number of private law firms have taken aim at the company on similar grounds. In 2022, the family of a then-11-year-old girl filed a class action lawsuit against Discord, alleging that the platform failed to implement enough safeguards to prevent her exploitation by other users. A similar case was filed in California earlier this year. Both cases are ongoing.

But these lawsuits are growing more and more common: Meta, in particular, is facing two massive lawsuits, led by dozens of states, claiming it harmed its teenage users. A similar lawsuit was filed by a coalition of school boards in the Canadian province of Ontario. The European Union, meanwhile, has crafted a suite of regulations meant to tackle these externalities—but, thus far, it is having trouble getting the American tech giants to comply.

Platkin has filed a number of other lawsuits—most recently against TikTok—in an attempt to force social media giants to improve their child protection measures.

“They can't knowingly put out a product that's unsafe for kids,” Platkin says. “I don't care if you're a social media company, or an opioid manufacturer or any other company that's telling the public your product is safe when it's not. We're going to hold the company accountable.”

Platkin says he's hopeful that the Trump administration, which has indicated some willingness to go after major social media companies, is interested in keeping children safe — not just targeting supposed conservative censorship. “Hope springs eternal for me,” Platkin says.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Anti-Vaxxers Are Grifting Off the Measles Outbreak—and Claim a Bioweapon Caused It","https://www.wired.com/story/antivax-grift-measles-crisis-bioweapon/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 15:35:00 GMT","

Anti-vaccine activists with close ties to US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are falsely claiming that the measles public health crisis in Texas is caused by a “bioweapon” targeting the Mennonite community. These activists are now trying to sell their followers a range of pseudoscientific cures—some purportedly powered by artificial intelligence—that supposedly prevent customers from contracting measles.

The claims were made in a webinar posted online last week and hosted by Mikki Willis, an infamous conspiracy filmmaker best known for his Plandemic series of pseudo-documentaries. These helped supercharge Covid-19 disinformation online and were, Kennedy has said, funded in part by Children's Health Defense (CHD), an anti-vaccine group Kennedy founded. Willis also created a video for Kennedy marking the announcement of his independent run for the presidency.

“I'm not going to be careful by calling it a virus,” Willis said in the measles webinar. “I'm going to call it what it is, and that is a bioweapon, and my belief after interviewing these families is that this has been manipulated and targeted towards a community that is a threat because of their natural way of living.” (Measles is not a bioweapon. It is a viral infection that can be easily prevented by getting a vaccine.)

The webinar was hosted by Rebel Lion, the supplement company that Willis cofounded. On the website, and prominently featured under the webinar, Willis sells and recommends a “measles treatment and prevention protocol” full of supplements and tools on the site. On the webinar, Willis claimed the protocol will help parents “get prepped for, if God forbid this does get out, and their children get sick.” Together, purchasing the full protocol costs hundreds of dollars.

“This is the standard radical anti-vaccine extremist playbook,” Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, tells WIRED. “You can see RFK Jr. has translated his anti-vaccine lies into political power. You can see others have converted it into economic power. And there's some that just do it because it makes them feel good to be listened to, to be important, to be the center of a community. There's always an ulterior motive.”

The community Willis refers to in the webinar is the Mennonite community in Seminole, a small city in west Texas, which has been the epicenter of the measles outbreak. Over 560 measles cases have been reported in Texas alone. To date, the deaths of two children have been linked to the measles outbreak, and another death is under investigation.

Willis' bogus claim about a bioweapon is part of a larger effort by the anti-vaccine community to undermine the threat posed by the infection. Many, instead, have claimed that the measles deaths were caused by other diseases or, in some cases, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine itself. These claims are not true and “there have been no deaths shown to be related to the MMR vaccine in healthy people,” according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

The claims have been facilitated, in part, by Kennedy, whose response to the outbreak has been widely criticized by public health officials. Kennedy has seemingly attempted a balancing act in his response to this crisis, accurately saying the MMR vaccine is “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” before undermining this statement days later by claiming, without evidence, that the effectiveness of the vaccine wanes by 5 percent every year.

Kennedy last month, in an interview on Fox News, also praised doctors who have been using alternative and unproven treatments within the Mennonite community. Among those doctors is Richard Bartlett, who also appeared on Willis' webinar last week and is credited on the Rebel Lion site with sharing the measles “protocol” package for purchase.

“Not only are we going to talk to Dr. Bartlett about what's happening and what he's seen there on the front lines, but he's also going to share what he's been using and the protocols that he's been using to treat his patients,” Willis said in the webinar.

On the webinar, Bartlett pushed unproven measles treatments like the steroid budesonide and the antibiotic clarithromycin. He also urged viewers to buy a range of pseudoscientific treatments. Along with mouthwash, supplemental oxygen, and a few other items, the measles protocol includes Rebel Lion's own Fierce Immunity capsules, which cost $50 for a single bottle and contain a blend of five supplements available off the shelf that the company claims have been formulated with a supposed AI technology known as Swarm Intelligence. Swarm Intelligence was created by Anton Fliri, who says he has worked as a cancer researcher at Pfizer in the past. Fliri told Willis in a webinar last August that unlike regular AI, his technology “is the natural form of intelligence, that's the way our brain works, that's the way our body works and it doesn't hallucinate because everything we are doing is based on reality, based on the real evidence.”

Willis, Bartlett, Rebel Lion, and Fliri, who also appeared on last week's webinar, did not respond to requests for comment.

Willis' attempt to cash in on an ongoing public health crisis is reminiscent of a strategy that has been playing out for decades in the anti-vaccine community and was seen most recently during the Covid-19 pandemic. Anti-vaccine influencers and groups like America's Frontline Doctors pushed the baseless claim that ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine were viable treatments for Covid-19, encouraging followers to spend millions of dollars on these products.

From the very beginning of the measles outbreak in Texas, the anti-vaccine community has sought to undermine the threat posed by the disease, presenting false narratives about what caused the deaths and the dangers of the MMR vaccine.

Central to this push has been Children's Health Defense. Within hours of the first child's death reported in Lubbock, Texas, on February 25, the Defender, CHD's news publication, published an article citing several unsubstantiated text messages from medical professionals suggesting that the child had not died of measles.

CHD has also pushed the debunked claim that vitamin C offers protections against contracting measles. The group's website is currently promoting an ebook titled The Measles Book: Thirty-Five Secrets the Government and the Media Aren't Telling You about Measles and the Measles Vaccine. The foreword of the book is written by Kennedy, who is now the secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS).

CHD, Kennedy, and the HHS did not respond to requests for comment.

On X, anti-vaccine influencers claimed without evidence that hospital employees had mistreated the first patient, leading to their death. One of those pushing this narrative was Syed Haider, a doctor who was part of the notorious Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), which formed during the pandemic and pushes dubious and ineffective treatments. Haider has almost 170,000 followers. Henry Ealy, a naturopathic doctor based in Oregon with 50,000 X followers, also pushed this claim. Ealy's 2022 report falsely claiming that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had altered records to boost deaths linked to Covid-19 has been cited in the past by CHD.

Marissa Brooke Alesi, an influencer known as Red Pill Patriot, posted a video on TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook claiming the child was hospitalized for pneumonia and RSV. “They then proceeded to give that child the MMR vaccination,” Alesi says, suggesting that the use of the MMR vaccine contributed to the child's death. The video has been viewed over 3 million times on Instagram alone.

Haider, Ealy, and Alesi did not respond to requests for comment.

Pierre Kory, a doctor best known for his role as the founder of FLCC and a central figure promoting ivermectin as a treatment for Covid-19, has also been pushing the narrative that measles was not the cause of the deaths of two children in Texas. In recent weeks, he has claimed without evidence that the measles crisis was, in fact, a targeted attack on the Mennonite community.

In August of last year, the American Board of Internal Medicine revoked Kory's certifications; just a month earlier, Kennedy described Kory as a “brave dissident doctor.”

“Do you want to know the real story on this case?” Kory told a physician and activist last month. “Several of us believe that they weaponized this measles virus—on purpose. She got sicker from this measles probably because they monkeyed with the virus.”

Kory did not respond to a request for comment.

Kory has called Willis a “friend,” and the pair have collaborated multiple times in the past on webinars and podcasts. In 2023, Willis turned Kory's War on Ivermectin book into a documentary.

Willis also claimed in the webinar that he has been given exclusive access to the Mennonite community in Texas after Bartlett convinced community members to speak only to him and people from CHD, and to avoid speaking to members of the mainstream media, who Willis described as “vultures.” Willis said he has interviewed at least 20 people for a short documentary that will be released in the coming days.

“This is a very contemporary example of very old tropes, which is that an extremist who's seeking to radicalize someone else, separates them from people that might persuade them otherwise, whether that's doctors, family, community, journalists who might be asking them questions to expose what's happening,” Ahmed says. “You need to separate them out so you can indoctrinate them without impediment.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","This ‘College Protester' Isn't Real. It's an AI-Powered Undercover Bot for Cops","https://www.wired.com/story/massive-blue-overwatch-ai-personas-police-suspects/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

American police departments near the United States-Mexico border are paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for an unproven and secretive technology that uses AI-generated online personas designed to interact with and collect intelligence on “college protesters,” “radicalized” political activists, and suspected drug and human traffickers, according to internal documents, contracts, and communications that 404 Media obtained via public records requests.

This article was created in partnership with 404 Media, a journalist-owned publication covering how technology impacts humans. For more stories like this, sign up here.

Massive Blue, the New York–based company that is selling police departments this technology, calls its product Overwatch, which it markets as an “AI-powered force multiplier for public safety” that “deploys lifelike virtual agents, which infiltrate and engage criminal networks across various channels.” According to a presentation obtained by 404 Media, Massive Blue is offering cops these virtual personas that can be deployed across the internet with the express purpose of interacting with suspects over text messages and social media.

Massive Blue lists “border security,” “school safety,” and stopping “human trafficking” among Overwatch's use cases. The technology—which as of last summer had not led to any known arrests—demonstrates the types of social media monitoring and undercover tools private companies are pitching to police and border agents. Concerns about tools like Massive Blue have taken on new urgency considering that the Trump administration has revoked the visas of hundreds of students, many of whom have protested against Israel's war in Gaza.

404 Media obtained a presentation showing some of these AI characters. These include a “radicalized AI” “protest persona,” which poses as a 36-year-old divorced woman who is lonely, has no children, is interested in baking, activism, and “body positivity.” Another AI persona in the presentation is described as a “‘Honeypot' AI Persona.” Her backstory says she's a 25-year-old from Dearborn, Michigan, whose parents emigrated from Yemen and who speaks the Sanaani dialect of Arabic. The presentation also says she uses various social media apps, that she's on Telegram and Signal, and that she has US and international SMS capabilities. Other personas are a 14-year-old boy “child trafficking AI persona,” an “AI pimp persona,” “college protestor,” “external recruiter for protests,” “escorts,” and “juveniles.”

One example of an AI persona created by Massive Blue's Overwatch tool. The company adds backstories for many of its AI personas, in an apparent attempt to make them appear more realistic.

Our reporting shows that cops are paying a company to help them deploy AI-powered bots across social media and the internet to talk to people they suspect are anything from violent sex criminals all the way to vaguely defined “protestors” with the hopes of generating evidence that can be used against them.

“This idea of having an AI pretending to be somebody, a youth looking for pedophiles to talk online, or somebody who is a fake terrorist, is an idea that goes back a long time,” Dave Maass, who studies border surveillance technologies for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told 404 Media. “The problem with all these things is that these are ill-defined problems. What problem are they actually trying to solve? One version of the AI persona is an escort. I'm not concerned about escorts. I'm not concerned about college protesters. So like, what is it effective at, violating protesters' First Amendment rights?”

Massive Blue has signed a $360,000 contract with Pinal County, Arizona, which is between Tucson and Phoenix. The county is paying for the contract with an anti-human trafficking grant from the Arizona Department of Public Safety. A Pinal County purchasing division report states that it has bought “24/7 monitoring of numerous web and social media platforms” and “development, deployment, monitoring, and reporting on a virtual task force of up to 50 AI personas across 3 investigative categories.” Yuma County, in southwestern Arizona, meanwhile, signed a $10,000 contract to try Massive Blue in 2023 but did not renew the contract. A spokesperson for the Yuma County Sheriff's Office told 404 Media “it did not meet our needs.”

This image from a Massive Blue presentation for police departments shows how the company's RADAR program uses AI personas to provide law enforcement with “intelligence reports.”

Massive Blue cofounder Mike McGraw did not answer a series of specific questions from 404 Media about how Massive Blue works, what police departments it works with, and whether it had been used to generate any arrests. “We are proud of the work we do to support the investigation and prosecution of human traffickers,” McGraw said. “Our primary goal is to help bring these criminals to justice while helping victims who otherwise would remain trafficked. We cannot risk jeopardizing these investigations and putting victims' lives in further danger by disclosing proprietary information.”

The Pinal County Sheriff's Office told 404 Media that Massive Blue has not thus far been used for any arrests.

“Our investigations are still underway. Massive Blue is one component of support in these investigations, which are still active and ongoing. No arrests have been made yet,” Sam Salzwedel, Pinal County Sheriff's Office public information officer, told 404 Media. “It takes a multifaceted approach to disrupting human traffickers, narcotics traffickers, and other criminals. Massive Blue has been a valuable partner in these initiatives and has produced leads that detectives are actively pursuing. Given these are ongoing investigations, we cannot risk compromising our investigative efforts by providing specifics about any personas.”

Salzwedel added, “Massive Blue is not working on any immigration cases. Our agency does not enforce immigration law. Massive Blue's support is focused on the areas of human trafficking, narcotics trafficking, and other investigations.”

Law enforcement agencies have taken steps to prevent specifics about what Massive Blue is and how it works from becoming public. At public appropriations hearings in Pinal County about the Massive Blue contract, the sheriff's office refused to tell county council members about what the product even is. Matthew Thomas, Pinal County Deputy Sheriff, told the county council he “can't get into great detail” about what Massive Blue is and that doing so would “tip our hand to the bad guys.”

Pinal County Sheriff's Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The Arizona Department of Public Safety said, “From what we can ascertain, Pinal County planned to implement technology to help identify and solve human trafficking cases, and that is what we funded,” but was unaware of any of the specifics of Overwatch.

While the documents don't describe every technical aspect of how Overwatch works, they do give a high-level overview of what it is. The company describes a tool that uses AI-generated images and text to create social media profiles that can interact with suspected drug traffickers, human traffickers, and gun traffickers. After Overwatch scans open social media channels for potential suspects, these AI personas can also communicate with suspects over text, Discord, and other messaging services. The documents we obtained don't explain how Massive Blue determines who is a potential suspect based on their social media activity. Salzwedel, of Pinal County, said “Massive Blue's solutions crawl multiple areas of the Internet, and social media outlets are just one component. We cannot disclose any further information to preserve the integrity of our investigations.”

One slide in the Massive Blue presentation obtained by 404 Media gives the example of a “Child Trafficking AI Persona” called Jason. The presentation gives a short “backstory” for the persona, which says Jason is a 14-year-old boy from Los Angeles whose parents emigrated from Ecuador. He's bilingual and an only child, and his hobbies include anime and gaming. The presentation describes his personality as shy and that he has difficulty interacting with girls. It also says that his parents don't allow him to use social media and that he hides his use of Discord from them. This AI persona is also accompanied by an AI-generated image of a boy.

Another example of an AI-generated persona, along with a sample of chats showing how the AI personas interact with targeted suspects.

The presentation includes a conversation between this AI persona and what appears to be a predatory adult over text messages and Discord.

“Your parents around? Or you getting some awesome alone time,” a text from the adult says.

“Js chillin by myself, man. My momz @ work n my dadz outta town. So itz jus me n my vid games. 🎮,” Jason, the AI-generated child, responds.

In another example of how the “highly adaptable personas” can communicate with real people, the presentation shows a conversation between Clip, an “AI pimp persona,” and what appears to be a sex worker.

“Dem tricks trippin 2nite tryin not pay,” the sex worker says.

“Facts, baby. Ain't lettin' these tricks slide,” the Clip persona replies. “You stand your ground and make 'em pay what they owe. Daddy got your back, ain't let nobody disrespect our grind. Keep hustlin', ma, we gonna secure that bag💰💪✨”

A list from Massive Blue's presentation showing the types of “highly customizable” personas Overwatch can generate.

“The continuous evolution of operational, communication & recruitment tactics by bad actors drives exponential increases of threats and significant challenges in reducing demand,” says a one-page brochure provided to police departments that explains Overwatch's functionality. “The Overwatch platform harnesses the power of AI & blockchain to scale your impact without operational or technical overhead.”

Jorge Brignoni took notes for the Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff's Office at a meeting with Massive Blue in August 2023, which 404 Media obtained. In the notes, he wrote that Overwatch does “passive engagement, then active engagement, towards commitment” with a “Bad Actor, Predator, DTO,” or drug trafficking organization. These targets are then “HAND[ed] OFF to L.E. [law enforcement] to arrest, indict, convict.”

“Why is he talking about converting folks into ‘buying something,'” Brignoni wrote. “So dumb. Talk about the widget, not how you're selling the widget to L.E.”

According to Brignoni's notes, in addition to collecting intelligence via these AI personas, Overwatch also leverages “Telco & Geo Data” and “Blockchain Data” in the form of “full transaction history, top associated wallet IDs, sending & receiving cryptocurrency, potential off-ramps (Exchange names).” The Cochise County Sheriff's Office ultimately did not buy Massive Blue and did not provide answers to 404 Media's questions about its meeting with the company.

Besides scanning social media and engaging suspects with AI personas, the presentation says that Overwatch can use generative AI to create “proof of life” images of a person holding a sign with a username and date written on it in pen.

A variety of AI-generated images of Massive Blue's personas, which are made to look realistic in an attempt to fool targets.

The Massive Blue presentation gives an example of an “Overwatch Recon Report” based on “24 hours of activity across Dallas, Houston, and Austin.” It claims that Overwatch identified 3,266 unique human traffickers, 25 percent of which were affiliated with “larger sophisticated trafficking organizations” and 15 percent of which were flagged as “potential juvenile traffickers.” 404 Media was not able to verify what these accounts were and whether they actually engaged in any criminal activity, and Massive Blue didn't respond to questions about what these accounts were and how exactly it identified them.

On top of the ongoing contract with the Pinal County Sheriff's Office and the pilot with the Yuma County Sheriff's Department last year, Massive Blue has pitched its services to Cochise County in Arizona and the Texas Department of Public Safety, according to documents obtained as part of this investigation.

In September 2023, Yuma County set up a meeting that was going to include federal law enforcement, but Massive Blue had to cancel the meeting: “That's unfortunate, we had federal agents here that focus on human trafficking ready to go,” a Yuma County sergeant wrote in an email to Massive Blue CEO Brian Haley after Haley canceled the meeting.

Much of Massive Blue's public-facing activity has been through its executive director of public safety, Chris Clem, who is a former US Customs and Border Protection agent who testified before Congress about border security last year and regularly appears on Fox News and other media outlets to discuss immigration and the border. In recent months, Clem has posted images of himself on LinkedIn at the border and with prominent Trump administration members Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Massive Blue has also relied on former Kansas City Chiefs kicker Nick Lowery to introduce and endorse Overwatch to police departments.

Clem and Lowery have spoken most extensively publicly about Overwatch, where they have described it as an amorphous “cyberwall” that can do everything from stopping human traffickers to preventing hackers from breaking into 401(k) accounts to taking money back from hackers who have stolen from you, though they provide no specifics about how that would work.

In a two-and-a-half-hour interview with podcaster Theo Von, Clem said, “My company Massive Blue, we basically use deep tech to identify the habits and process of you know, look, I worked on a physical wall, now we've created a cyberwall,” adding that he believed it would “save lives.”

Von asked, “OK, but how does your company do that?”

“Well, I'm not going to get into that too much,” Clem responded, adding that he is trying to sell the technology to US Border Patrol.

More examples of Massive Blue's AI personas, which include a “child trafficking AI persona,” an “AI pimp persona,” “college protestor,” “external recruiter for protests,” “escorts,” and “juveniles.”

On June 5, a Pinal County Board of Supervisors meeting was asked to approve a $500,000 contract between the county and Massive Blue in order to license Overwatch.

“I was looking at the website for Massive Blue, and it's a one-pager with no additional information and no links,” Kevin Cavanaugh, the then-supervisor for District 1, said to Pinal County's Chief Deputy at the Sheriff's Office, Matthew Thomas. “They produce software that we buy, and it does what? Can you explain that to us?”

“I can't get into great detail because it's essentially trade secrets, and I don't want to tip our hand to the bad guys,” Thomas said. “But what I can tell you is that the software is designed to help our investigators look for and find and build a case on human trafficking, drug trafficking, and gun trafficking.”

Cavanaugh said at the board meeting that the basic information he got is that Massive Blue uses “50 AI bots.” He then asked whether the software has been successful and if it helped law enforcement make any arrests. Thomas explained they have not made any arrests yet because they've only seen the proof of concept, but that the proof of concept was “good enough for us and our investigators to move forward with this. Once this gets approved and we get them [Massive Blue] under contract, then we are going to move forward with prosecution of cases.”

Cavanaugh asked if Overwatch is used in other counties, which prompted Thomas to invite Clem to the podium to speak. Clem introduced himself as a recently retired border agent and said that Massive Blue is currently in negotiations with three counties in Arizona, including Pinal County.

“As a resident of 14 years of Pinal County I know what's happening here,” Clem said to the Board of Supervisors. “To be able [to] use this program [...] to provide all the necessary information to go after the online exploitation of children, trafficking victims, and all the other verticals that the sheriff may want to go after.”

Cavanaugh again asked if Massive Blue gathered any data that led to arrests.

“We have not made arrests yet, but there is a current investigation right now regarding arson, and we got the leads to the investigators,” Clem said, explaining that the program has been active for only about six months. “Investigations take time, but we've been able to generate the necessary leads for the particular counties that we're involved with and also in the private sector.”

The Pinal County Board of Supervisors concluded the exchange by approving payment for a handful of other, unrelated projects, but with board members asking to delay the vote on payment for Massive Blue “for further study.”

The decision not to fund Massive Blue that day was covered in a local newspaper. Cavanaugh told the paper that he asked the company to meet with supervisors to explain the merits of the software.

“The State of Arizona has provided a grant, but grant money is taxpayer money. No matter the source of the funding, fighting human and sex trafficking is too important to risk half a million dollars on unproven technology,” he said. “If the company demonstrates that it can deliver evidence to arrest human traffickers, it may be worthwhile. However, it has yet to achieve this goal.”

404 Media's public record requests yielded several emails from Cavanaugh's office to IT professionals and other companies that provide AI products to law enforcement, asking them if they're familiar with Massive Blue. We don't know what was said in those meetings, or if they occurred, but when the Pinal County Board of Supervisors convened again on June 19 it voted to pay for Massive Blue's Overwatch without further discussion.

“Supervisor [Cavanaugh] ultimately voted for the agreement because Massive Blue is alleged to be in pursuit of human trafficking, a noble goal,” a representative from Cavanaugh's office told 404 Media in an email. “A major concern regarding the use of the application, is that the government should not be monitoring each and every citizen. To his knowledge, no arrests have been made to date as a result of the use of the application. If Overwatch is used to bring about arrests of human traffickers, then the program should continue. However, if it is just being used to collect surveillance on law-abiding citizens and is not leading to any arrests, then the program needs to be discontinued.”

In an August 7, 2024, Board of Supervisors meeting, Cavanaugh asked then-Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb for an update on Massive Blue. “So they have not produced any results? They've produced no leads? No evidence that is actionable?” Cavanaugh asked. “That would be public knowledge, that would be public information.”

“I think there's a lot of ongoing investigations that they're not going to give you information on, and we're not going to give you information on,” Lamb said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Trump's Tariffs Haven't Resulted in Higher Prices on Amazon—Yet","https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-prices-tariffs-why-higher-lower/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

It's been a week since President Donald Trump imposed massive tariffs on Chinese imports to the United States, but the policies haven't forced Amazon shoppers in the US to dig deeper into their wallets just yet. Recent data from price tracking websites reviewed by WIRED show little in the way of dramatic price hikes across most product categories on the ecommerce platform.

On Wednesday, the average price of goods on Amazon was higher than the previous 90 days in just nine out of 27 high-level categories monitored by the price-tracking firm Keepa, which says it collects data about billions of different items. The categories showing higher average prices included automotive, arts and crafts, and musical instruments, though the increase in nearly every group was under 1 percent.

Prices were lower in 16 of the categories, including appliances and toys. Most of the drops amounted to less than 0.5 percent on average. Prices on Amazon fluctuate regularly for several reasons, including when sellers offer deals, and information collected by the tracking websites can help illuminate these many shifts.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on CNBC last week that he guessed Trump's policies would raise costs for sellers on Amazon's marketplace, which would eventually be passed on to customers in the form of higher prices. That may very well still happen in the near future if the tariffs rates on Chinese imports remain the same or increase for other countries.

But at least for now, ecommerce pricing experts say there are three leading reasons why Amazon sellers are keeping their prices steady: Many still have existing inventory in the US, are fearful about violating Amazon's pricing rules, and remain inclined to wait out the mercurial president.

“Apart from a few isolated niche segments, we have not observed any significant price increases to date,” says Keepa CEO Julian Johann. “However, this situation may well evolve in the coming weeks and months.”

CamelCamelCamel, another service that provides pricing history for Amazon product listings, says it has also seen prices remain largely unchanged over the last week both for premier items, such as iPads, as well as household staples, including toothpaste and peanut butter.

The data fit with what Dani Nadel, president and chief operating officer of Feedvisor, says she is hearing from some of the thousands of businesses that use the company's pricing software to manage their listings on Amazon and Walmart. “Many are taking a wait-and-see approach and don't want to act rashly,” she says, noting that some stocked up on inventory earlier this year in anticipation of the trade war.

About 40 percent of the items consumers buy on Amazon are sold by the ecommerce giant itself. Independent merchants sell and price everything else—often with the help of software that can automatically adjust the prices consumers see. When multiple sellers offer the same item, those with the lowest price are more likely to be featured by Amazon and ultimately win the sale. Estimates suggest that over half of Amazon merchants are based in China, so a vast selection of goods on the platform may be vulnerable to Trump's tariffs.

Amazon merchants that don't have a stockpile of goods sitting in US warehouses are in a more difficult position to absorb the impacts of Trump's tariffs. Importing a new batch of inventory from China is going to cost significantly more, but immediately passing on the expense to shoppers could trigger alarms at Amazon.

Nadel says Amazon's “fair pricing” rules penalize merchants, including by potentially removing their listings, if they abruptly and dramatically hike up the price of their products. The exact thresholds that can lead to a listing being removed aren't publicly disclosed, she says, so sellers often engage in “a tenuous dance” of gradual bumps. Experts say the policy has continued to be enforced in recent days. Will Amazon eventually relax enforcement in this volatile market? “I don't think they know yet,” Nadel says.

Amazon declined to comment about the policy and how tariffs have generally affected prices.

So far, the small group of Feedvisor users that have begun accounting for the tariffs have been moving cautiously, according to Nadel. Feedvisor's technology helps businesses dynamically adjust prices based on competing offers. But merchants can set a minimum to avoid matching outrageously low prices that would eat too far into their profit margins.

Some sellers in categories such as toys have raised their minimum prices by 5 to 10 percent this month to ensure they can recoup tariff-related costs, Nadel says. But higher minimums generally don't affect shoppers unless prices were already about as low as sellers could bear.

Nadel says merchants also are continuing to insert “inflation-friendly” language in their product descriptions and advertising—think phrases like “affordable luxury” and “highest quality for the fairest price”—in an effort to resonate with ever price-conscious consumers.

Across the internet, some companies have reportedly enacted aggressive measures in response to Trump's trade policies, such as adding a clearly labeled tariff surcharge at checkout. Chinese ecommerce giants Temu and Shein warned customers this week that they plan to start adjusting prices on April 25 and encouraged consumers to buy items now while better deals are still available.

In one Facebook group for Amazon sellers viewed by WIRED, merchants have been discussing strategies they can use to avoid tariffs or recoup the cost of them. Some also wrote that they have been surprised by unusual dips and spikes in sales during this period of volatility.

Fahim Sheikh, CEO and cofounder of pricing and advertising software company Trellis, says the tariffs are posing an existential risk to some of his Amazon seller clients, who are considering going out of business. “By the time they pay their suppliers, the money they are making is thin—10 percent to 15 percent for some of these guys,” he says. “Now, tack on these additional tariffs, there's nothing really left for them.” Sheikh is bracing for not only higher prices on Amazon if the tariffs aren't rolled back, but also less product selection.

Marty McCay, vice president and manager at pricing tool developer Repricer, estimates that a quarter of its clients have made adjustments to their sales strategies this month. That includes raising minimum prices or halting the sale of products that no longer make financial sense. But the overall activity on Repricer's platform has remained stable at 5 billion price adjustments per week, further suggesting that the tariffs to date haven't triggered absolute chaos for consumers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","If I Don't Use AI, Will My Grandkids Still Think I'm Cool?","https://www.wired.com/story/the-prompt-using-chatgpt-with-grandkids/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

As a retiree, I want to stay close to my grandkids. I worry that not learning how to use AI will leave me behind. What's the easiest tool for me to learn, and should I be worried?  —Lifelong Learner

Be not afraid! I promise that you do not need to learn how to use a generative AI tool like ChatGPT or Claude to ensure your grandkids see you as a relevant, informed person. If anything, I would say that our culture has tipped over the past year to generally oppose the use of generative AI tools due to their outsize environmental impact, ethical concerns over their data scraping, and general sludginess of the outputs. So, depending on your relatives' worldview, confessing that you don't use any chatbot tools might even boost your cool factor with them.

Also, AI chatbots are possibly eroding our social skills. OpenAI recently conducted a research study to determine whether repetitive ChatGPT usage made users feel lonelier and less social overall. It did; the most frequent ChatGPT users in the study became emotionally dependent on the chatbot's company. So, if you want to spend time fostering better connections with your family, generative AI should be near the bottom of your list of essential tools to learn.

Instead, stay up to speed on your basic software-enabled communication skills like texting, emailing, video calling, and the proper uses of social media. Keeping these skills sharp may help you feel more connected online, both through direct communication with your family members and your more complete awareness of what the grandkids are doing day to day.

If you want to experiment with AI tools, I'd recommend using them with your family members for education and entertainment. When ChatGPT first came out in 2022 and I was visiting my parents for the holidays, we had a wonderful time trying it out together, making funny poems, and refining prompts just to see what the AI could do. If your grandkids are really into using this type of software, then asking if they could spend 30 minutes the next time you're together in person playing around with the tool could be an enjoyable bonding experience.

If you're not the fastest typer, you may find the voice options for inputting prompts into the chatbot more comfortable to use. ChatGPT's voice mode is entertaining to chat with, though it will likely feel quite odd at first. I mean, how do you strike up a conversation with a piece of software? But once you get used to voice mode, it can be fun to ask it to teach you phrases in different languages. Before traveling to Japan last year, I spent hours and hours practicing speaking Japanese with ChatGPT. It's not a perfect tutor, but I found the process to be quite enjoyable.

One thing to keep in mind is that chatbots often fabricate information or spit out search results that contain inaccuracies. This can happen when you're doing web searches to gather specific information, or when you ask the chatbot a general question. The wrong answers given by these generative AI tools can sound quite confident, so you're better off doing some additional digging to verify what it told you. When you're doing this double-checking, you may realize there's not much you can get from ChatGPT today that you couldn't find through a simple Google search.

Another detail worth remembering: It's not alive. Even if you feel impressed with the quality of the answers or get an uncanny feeling that it's more than just a software program talking to you, remind yourself that chatbots are massive tools that memorize the patterns of human writing and interactions with the intention of mimicking them. The mimicry may be stunning, but the expressions are ultimately hollow.

Let's get back to your worries about staying connected to family. Take a moment and genuinely think about your relationship with your grandkids. They hopefully love you for who you are, and what kind of software you use or avoid shouldn't have any impact on that. I feel like life is far too short to be caught up in our anxieties about how others view us. As soon as you finish this article, give them a call (or send them an Instagram DM) and tell them how you feel as well as how important family is to you. Do it now. I promise it's worth it. Besides, you already know what to say to them—no chatbot needed here.

Astronomers have found one of the most promising indications that there could be extraterrestrial life on another planet. With the help of the James Webb Space Telescope, researchers have detected what they believe could be biosignatures of marine microorganisms on K2-18b, an exoplanet located in the habitable zone of its parent star 124 light-years away.

According to research led by the University of Cambridge, the team detected traces of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) in the planet's atmosphere. On Earth, these compounds are produced only by microbial life such as phytoplankton.

The scientists admit that there is a possibility that these substances have been produced on the planet by an unknown chemical process unrelated to microorganisms. However, they also emphasize that the data represent the strongest evidence to date for possible life on a planet other than our own. The results were published in the scientific journal The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

K2-18b is 8.6 times the mass of Earth and nearly three times its size. It lies in the direction of the constellation Leo and orbits a small, low-temperature type of star called a red dwarf. The planet is very close to its star—it takes only 33 days to complete one orbit—but due to the red dwarf's low temperature, the planet is in a region of space that, in theory, allows liquid water to exist on its surface.

This exoplanet is one of the leading potential examples of a Hycean planet, a theoretical class of worlds characterized by having vast liquid oceans and a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. According to astrobiologists, discovering a Hycean planet would represent one of the best opportunities to find extraterrestrial life.

This is not the first time that K2-18b has caught the attention of astronomers. In 2023, the same team of scientists found methane and carbon dioxide in its atmosphere. It was the first time carbon-based molecules were discovered on a planet within a habitable region of space. The researchers also identified diffuse signals at that time that looked like they could be dimethyl sulfide. And so two years later, the team took another look at the promising planet.

“We didn't know for sure whether the signal we saw last time was due to DMS, but just the hint of it was exciting enough for us to have another look with JWST using a different instrument,” said Nikku Madhusudhan, the scientist who led the research, in a press release.

“Earlier theoretical work had predicted that high levels of sulfur-based gases like DMS and DMDS are possible on Hycean worlds. And now we've observed it, in line with what was predicted. Given everything we know about this planet, a Hycean world with an ocean that is teeming with life is the scenario that best fits the data we have,” Madhusudhan said.

A federal judge has found that Google violated antitrust laws by “willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power” in the advertising technology market, rounding out a two-year saga after the U.S. and eight states filed its initial complaints against the Alphabet-owned company.

The court will set a briefing schedule and hearing date to determine appropriate remedies for the antitrust violations, per a Thursday filing. 

The remedies could include forcing Google to break up its advertising business, like selling its Google Ad Manager, which includes the AdX ad exchange and DFP (DoubleClick for Publishers), the ad server used for publishers. 

Or the courts could force behavioral remedies that would allow Google to keep its business intact, but would impose restrictions to ensure fair competition, like prohibiting Google from prioritizing its own exchange or demand in auctions. 

In a separate antitrust case, another federal judge last year found that Google illegally monopolized the general internet search market. The judge has not yet issued remedies on that case, but is expected to do so in mid-2025. 

In the adtech case, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema wrote in her memorandum opinion that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the “open-web display advertiser ad networks” are a relevant market where Google has monopoly power. These networks help advertisers buy display ads across the open web, so they're outside of closed ecosystems like Facebook, Instagram, and Google Search. 

The judge did agree that Google violated the Sherman Act by monopolizing and unlawfully tying two parts of the adtech stack together, specifically DFP and AdX, and that Google is guilty of abuse of monopoly power in the publisher-side adtech. 

“We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, said in an emailed statement. “The Court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don't harm competition. We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.” 

The Department of Justice – alongside California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia – filed suit against Google's alleged use of monopoly power over the digital ad market in January 2023. 

The DOJ argued that Google achieved its monopoly through anti-competitive conduct when it purchased DoubleClick in 2008, which then became the backbone of its ad business. Google then bought AdMeld in 2011 to gain more control over the ad market's supply side. The government says this allowed Google to hike up ad prices and harm publishers by taking larger cuts of each sale.  

The trial for this case began in September 2024 and lasted for three weeks, with closing arguments presented in late November. 

This article has been updated to include more background about the case.

Posted:

Temu and Shein plan to raise prices for U.S. customers starting April 25, due to President Donald Trump's tariffs on goods shipped from China, the Associated Press reports.

The 145% tariff on products made in China, along with Trump's decision to end a customs exemption that had allowed goods under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has disrupted the business models of both platforms. The report says nearly 4 million parcels, most of them from China, enter the U.S. every day under this soon-to-be-ended exemption.

Shein and Temu have gained significant popularity in the U.S. over the past few years due to the platforms' discount pricing and influencer advertising.

The Wall Street Journal reported last year that Amazon now sees Shein and Temu as bigger threats to its business than retailers like Walmart and Target. In November, Amazon launched Amazon Haul, a storefront that offers mass-produced and discounted items to take on Shein and Temu.

Shein and Temu are encouraging customers to continue shopping. The companies say they will ensure orders arrive on time and are doing what they can to minimize the impact on shoppers.

Instagram on Thursday announced that it's rolling out Blend, a new feature that lets you create a custom, personalized reels feed for you and your friends. Blends are invite-only and can be created with a singular friend or with a group chat. The custom feeds are refreshed with new content each day.

The launch doesn't come as a surprise, as TechCrunch reported in March 2024 that the social network was developing the feature.

Once you join or accept a Blend invite, you will be able to browse through reels picked for each person in the chat. When someone in the group reacts to a reel, Instagram will notify you so you can keep a convo going in the DM (direct messaging) chat. 

The idea behind the feature is to explore what sorts of reels your friends are into, while also connecting with them and discovering new content together. Blend aims to introduce a new social element to Instagram, bringing it closer to its roots of sharing moments with friends, something that's been overshadowed in recent years by an influx of influencers and ads.

With the launch of Blend, Instagram is giving users access to a feature that isn't available on TikTok, which is one of Instagram's biggest rivals. 

For Instagram, Blend could be a way to boost reels' discovery and watch time on the social network, as it's encouraging users to watch short-form content together.

To create a Blend, you need to open a one-on-one or group DM chat and tap the new Blend icon at the top of the chat. Then, you need to select “Invite” to invite people from your DM chat to join the Blend. The Blend will be created when at least one member of the chat accepts your invite. You can revisit a Blend by going to the DM chat and tapping the Blend icon.

It's worth noting that Blend is somewhat similar to Spotify's functionality of the same name, which allows people to combine their tastes into one shared playlist that refreshes daily.

New York City is one of those places in the world where you can get a dollar slice at 2 a.m. or have a burger delivered in less than 30 minutes, but you'll still spend two hours crawling down the highway to catch a flight.

Archer Aviation wants to change that with air taxis that it envisions flying passengers from Manhattan to nearby airports within 15 minutes.

The startup on Thursday unveiled its proposed air taxi network for New York City in partnership with United Airlines, which would allow passengers to tack on an Archer ride to their traditional airline tickets. 

“We're starting with nine core nodes,” Adam Goldstein, co-founder and CEO of Archer, told me during an interview at Casa Cipriani, a members-only club at the bottom tip of Manhattan, watching helicopters land at the Downtown Skyport.

“So you have the three big international airports — JFK, LaGuardia, Newark,” Goldstein continued. “You have the three big heliports, [including] the Downtown Skyport, and then the east and west side heliports. And then the three big regionals — Teterboro, Westchester, and Long Island Republic.”

Archer has shared a similar vision for air taxi networks in cities like Los Angeles. The company is still waiting on the Federal Aviation Administration to approve its aircraft — a five-seat eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle) dubbed Midnight — before it can even begin testing the routes it has planned.

Archer also still needs to get a pilot into one of its aircraft to test-fly it. So far, the company has only flown the plane autonomously with no humans inside. Its competitors, Joby Aviation and Beta Technologies, have both piloted flights.

Goldstein seemed hopeful that Archer would achieve the necessary certifications in 2026, telling TechCrunch that it would have an update about piloted flights at its next earnings call. The company went public in 2021 via a special-purpose acquisition merger, and has raised $3.36 billion to date, per PitchBook, via public and private fundraises.

In the meantime, Archer is laying the groundwork, setting up infrastructure and operations. For that, partnerships are essential. 

In NYC, United will help with aircraft storage, maintenance, charging setup, and setting up vertiports (landing pads for eVTOLs) at airports. Archer has also teamed up with the fixed-base operators that run the Manhattan helipads — Atlantic Aviation, Signature, and Modern Aviation — which, Goldstein says, will give Archer passenger access and help set up the charging infrastructure. 

“What makes New York very compelling is it's the No. 1 helicopter commuting city in the world, outside of São Paulo,” Nikhil Goel, Archer's chief commercial officer, said. “You don't have to squint very hard to imagine any of these helicopters that are flying by on the Hudson simply replacing them with one of our aircraft. The routes are already there. The air traffic already knows how to work with them. The FBOs and the landing facilities are already there. So there's no systemic changes that are necessary.”

Archer's plan is to start small, bringing up to five aircraft to NYC — and other cities — to practice running the routes before launching. Ten to 20 years down the line, the goal is to fly hundreds of aircraft across several cities. Archer last month began constructing Midnights at its production facility in Georgia that it built in partnership with strategic investor Stellantis. It plans to build 650 aircraft annually by 2030. 

Aside from NYC and LA, Archer also plans to launch in San Francisco and Miami, but the timeline is still dependent on FAA certification, and the company hasn't picked its first U.S. launch city.

The company also has plans to launch an air taxi service in Abu Dhabi, where regulations are less strict, later this year. Goldstein said the proposed network for NYC gives people a vision they can understand. 

“We're hoping people look at [Abu Dhabi] and say, ‘Oh, it's real. How is New York gonna work?'”

Stargate, a $500 billion project headed up by OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build AI data centers and other AI infrastructure in the U.S., is considering investments in the U.K. and elsewhere overseas, according to a Financial Times report. 

While Stargate was initially launched as a way to boost U.S. AI infrastructure, the project is allegedly weighing international expansion. In addition to the U.K., Germany and France are on the table, per the Financial Times' reporting. 

Stargate remains focused on the U.S. at the moment, to be clear, as originally pitched — and it's still in the process of raising its first $100 billion. SoftBank is expected to put forward tens of billions of dollars as a mixture of debt and equity.

When Stargate was announced in January, President Donald Trump praised the initiative as a “declaration of confidence in America.”

Elon Musk's AI company, xAI, is slowly bringing its Grok chatbot to parity with top rivals like ChatGPT and Google's Gemini.

On Wednesday night, xAI announced a “memory” feature for Grok that enables the bot to remember details from past conversations with a user. Now if you ask Grok for recommendations, it'll give more personalized responses, assuming you've used it enough to allow it to “learn” your preferences.

ChatGPT has long had a similar memory feature, which was recently upgraded to reference a user's entire chat history. Gemini, too, has persistent memory to tailor its replies to individual people.

“Memories are transparent,” reads a post from the official Grok account on X. “[Y]ou can see exactly what Grok knows and choose what to forget.”

Grok now remembers your conversations. When you ask for recommendations or advice, you'll get personalized responses. pic.twitter.com/UXhX7BjS57

— Grok (@grok) April 17, 2025

 

Grok's new memory feature is available in beta on Grok.com and the Grok iOS and Android apps, but not for users in the EU or U.K. It can be turned off from the Data Controls page in the settings menu, and individual “memories” can be deleted by tapping the icon beneath the memory from the Grok chat interface on the web (and soon, Android).

xAI says that it's working on bringing the memory feature to the Grok experience on X.

> Three industry studies showed less than 50 cents of every dollar goes to showing ads.Every penny of what is spent goes to showing ads, by definition. However, that doesn't mean that every penny goes to the publisher. The advertiser may look at the 60 cents being spent on everybody between them and the publisher and say ""hey, I'm getting ripped off! I could be paying 4 cents/CPM instead of 10 cents/CPM!"" but each middleman (usually) adds some kind of value to increase acquisition rate. For example:* Identity providers who have lists of user IDs that belong to ""high CTR"" audiences (users more likely to click ads)* Geo providers who tell the bidders where the User's location is so that they can target locally-focused advertisements to them* User intent plugins, ""abandoned cart"" retargeting, product recommendation providers, etc. who look at user interaction events and build profiles of people who can be retargeted* Exchanges which conduct auctions across multiple DSPs to get a better price for publishers while also making more inventory available to advertisersAt one company I worked for, we allocated impressions ahead of time. Based on prior years' data and viewer ratings of TV shows, we could predict the future, determining how many viewers a video or TV show would get, and then selling the advertising inventory based on that prediction. That shit ain't free!All of these things are designed to increase your acquisition rate from x% to y%, where x > y. Sure, you could just pay $5,000 a month to a website to show a banner ad directly, but a larger % of your money would be wasted on users who are utterly uninterested in your banner.

This is the argument that gets made, but very rarely is it true.From Neumann et al in 2019 [1]""When investigating gender (being male) and age (three different tiers: 18-24, 25-34 and 35-44 years) individually, we find that digital audiences for gender are on average less often correct than random guessing (accuracy of 42.3%).""If the accuracy of targeting is worse than random guessing on average then it's value is less $0.00. Advertisers would reach more of their target audience by simply buying more media instead of spending money on 'targeting' even after you discount wastage to $0.00 in 'value'.I agree with everything you're saying about programmatic *in theory*, but I would argue that in practice the whole system is just broken.[1] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3203131

All of a sudden, Adsense revenue has gone to basically zero. $90 of earnings from Sunday has even disappeared.There is no way to contact a real person at Google. You can just post in their dumb little forum and someone with no authority who doesn't even work there will reply to you with the same pointless info from their FAQ.If things go the way they have been, it seems like roughly $2k in revenue that's been pretty consistent for the last decade is going to be basically zero this year and there's nothing I can do about it.Thankfully, this is just a side project and I'll be fine, but its not hard to see how they could screw someone over who relied on it.

Imagine for a second that, instead of 1 Google, there are tens of thousands of alternatives. Offering good customer support becomes once again a competitive advantage. No sane customer thinks ""yep, I want no recourse at all in case of problem so google's profit margins are bigger for the sake of their stakeholders"".Moreover, the cost of doing customer support grows less than linearly thanks to economies of scale, from which Google benefits disproportionally, and here again Google chose profits over quality at the expense of the consumer.

Who gets what part of the company is the wrong question to ask. The org chart would get split along those business units. In all likelihood, the company called ""Google"" would be the software side, since that's where search lives.

> Currently, the predominant business model for commercial search engines is advertising. The goals of
the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users. For
example, in our prototype search engine one of the top results for cellular phone is ""The Effect of
Cellular Phone Use Upon Driver Attention"", a study which explains in great detail the distractions and
risk associated with conversing on a cell phone while driving. This search result came up first because
of its high importance as judged by the PageRank algorithm, an approximation of citation importance on
the web [Page, 98]. It is clear that a search engine which was taking money for showing cellular phone
ads would have difficulty justifying the page that our system returned to its paying advertisers. For this
type of reason and historical experience with other media [Bagdikian 83], we expect that advertising
funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the
consumers.> Since it is very difficult even for experts to evaluate search engines, search engine bias is particularly
insidious. A good example was OpenText, which was reported to be selling companies the right to be
listed at the top of the search results for particular queries [Marchiori 97]. This type of bias is much
more insidious than advertising, because it is not clear who ""deserves"" to be there, and who is willing to
pay money to be listed. This business model resulted in an uproar, and OpenText has ceased to be a
viable search engine. But less blatant bias are likely to be tolerated by the market. For example, a search
engine could add a small factor to search results from ""friendly"" companies, and subtract a factor from
results from competitors. This type of bias is very difficult to detect but could still have a significant
effect on the market. Furthermore, advertising income often provides an incentive to provide poor
quality search results. For example, we noticed a major search engine would not return a large airline's
homepage when the airline's name was given as a query. It so happened that the airline had placed an
expensive ad, linked to the query that was its name. A better search engine would not have required this
ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it
could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer
advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the
advertising supported business model of the existing search engines. However, there will always be
money from advertisers who want a customer to switch products, or have something that is genuinely
new. But we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a
competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.Kind of funny how they basically predicted Google's degradation years in advance.

The fact that we actually were enforcing antitrust at the time absolutely prevented MS from getting a strangehold on the consumer internet as it was taking off. It's the reason you're posting on this forum in the first place, as it was essential to the success of tech startups in the first dot-com era.Then we stopped enforcing antitrust laws, and after about 10 years or so the new market leaders had developed the stifling set of monopolies we're all dealing with today.Breaking up Google (which seems inevitable, this is the third distinct recent case where they've been proven to be a monopoly) is likely to be good for literally everyone, including even Google shareholders.

A historical parallel is when tobacco advertising was banned, and cigarette companies because more profitable.

If the rules were targeted at Google only then Google's lawyers would argue this is unequal application of the law. Even if the courts rejected Google's argument there'd be a real risk end up with exactly the same situation but with Bing in a couple of years time as they become the default search on every device / browser.If ""pay for default"" deals were banned altogether then Firefox might be seriously hurt, which isn't exactly good for the competitive tech ecosystem.

There is no intended reading that makes ""Chinese metallurgy is an oxymoron"" a sensible thing to post any place where you want to have a halfway reasonable conversation with strangers.

I'm not sure anyone was saying they're immune to it, but their reputation does lend them credibility when compared to a random HN commenter that says stuff like ""Chinese metallurgy is an oxymoron""

So this article still gives me both hope that it is real, and sadness that it probably isn't.

I was looking into using WASM in Python yesterday for some image processing. It requires pulling in a full WASM runtime like wasmtime. Still better than calling out to native binaries like ImageMagick, but definitely more complicated than doing it in Deno. If I was writing it myself I'd do Deno, but LLMs are so good at writing Python.

Let's cut through the noise with cold, hard numbers.

While it's rare to look at the news without finding some headline related to AI and energy, a lot of us are stuck waving our hands when it comes to what it all means.

A new report suggests that AI could reduce carbon emissions in the future, but the world needs the industry to keep its climate pollution in check now.

Sure, you've probably read that AI will drive an increase in electricity demand. But how that fits into the context of the current and future grid can feel less clear from the headlines. That's true even for people working in the field. 

A new report from the International Energy Agency digs into the details of energy and AI, and I think it's worth looking at some of the data to help clear things up. Here are four charts from the report that sum up the crucial points about AI and energy demand. 

This point is the most obvious, but it bears repeating: AI is exploding, and it's going to lead to higher energy demand from data centers. “AI has gone from an academic pursuit to an industry with trillions of dollars at stake,” as the IEA report's executive summary puts it.

Data centers used less than 300 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2020. That could increase to nearly 1,000 terawatt-hours in the next five years, which is more than Japan's total electricity consumption today.

Today, the US has about 45% of the world's data center capacity, followed by China. Those two countries will continue to represent the overwhelming majority of capacity through 2035.  

The IEA report is relatively optimistic on the potential for renewables to power data centers, projecting that nearly half of global growth by 2035 will be met with renewables like wind and solar. (In Europe, the IEA projects, renewables will meet 85% of new demand.)

In the near term, though, natural gas and coal will also expand. An additional 175 terawatt-hours from gas will help meet demand in the next decade, largely in the US, according to the IEA's projections. Another report, published this week by the energy consultancy BloombergNEF, suggests that fossil fuels will play an even larger role than the IEA projects, accounting for two-thirds of additional electricity generation between now and 2035.

Nuclear energy, a favorite of big tech companies looking to power operations without generating massive emissions, could start to make a dent after 2030, according to the IEA data.

We should be talking more about appliances, industry, and EVs when we talk about energy! Electricity demand is on the rise from a whole host of sources: Electric vehicles, air-conditioning, and appliances will each drive more electricity demand than data centers between now and the end of the decade. In total, data centers make up a little over 8% of electricity demand expected between now and 2030.

There are interesting regional effects here, though. Growing economies will see more demand from the likes of air-conditioning than from data centers. On the other hand, the US has seen relatively flat electricity demand from consumers and industry for years, so newly rising demand from high-performance computing will make up a larger chunk. 

The grid is no stranger to facilities that use huge amounts of energy: Cement plants, aluminum smelters, and coal mines all pull a lot of power in one place. However, data centers are a unique sort of beast.

First, they tend to be closely clustered together. Globally, data centers make up about 1.5% of total electricity demand. However, in Ireland, that number is 20%, and in Virginia, it's 25%. That trend looks likely to continue, too: Half of data centers under development in the US are in preexisting clusters.

Data centers also tend to be closer to urban areas than other energy-intensive facilities like factories and mines. 

Since data centers are close both to each other and to communities, they could have significant impacts on the regions where they're situated, whether by bringing on more fossil fuels close to urban centers or by adding strain to the local grid. Or both.

Overall, AI and data centers more broadly are going to be a major driving force for electricity demand. It's not the whole story, but it's a unique part of our energy picture to continue watching moving forward.

After wowing CinemaCon with an early look, this morning Marvel released the second trailer for Fantastic Four: First Steps. And if the first trailer found them conspicuously absent, then this one is is all about one thing in particular: if this be doomsday, and Galactus' arrival on earth, then he must be heralded.

Yes, today's trailer finally gives us a good look at Julia Garner in action as Shalla-Bal, First Steps‘ take on the Silver Surfer. Introduced in the comics in 1968's The Silver Surfer #1, there Shalla was the Empress of the utopian planet Zenn-La, and the romantic partner of Norrin Radd. In the comics, it's Norrin who becomes the Silver Surfer, making a pact with Galactus (played here in First Steps by absolute legend Ralph Ineson) to become his herald in exchange for the world-eater sparing Zenn-La. Although in some plotlines Shalla interacted with the power cosmic that granted to Norrin—notably using a fragment of it to restore Zenn-La after Galactus drained it as punishment for Radd's defiance of him—First Steps marks the first time she herself is being depicted as Galactus' herald.

Shalla-Bal is not the only comics character this trailer “introduces” us to: we also learn that during the movie Sue is pregnant with her first child, and preparing to become a mother while navigating her and Reed's realities as superheroes. This will, presumably, be Franklin Richards—a one-time mutant, Franklin grows up to be an incredibly powerful reality-manipulation and psionic abilities, eventually fighting alongside his family and his sister Valeria as members of the First Family in his own rights. For now, it's up to the Fantastic generation before him to save their Earth from Galactus' threat… and, somehow, make their way across the multiverse over to the MCU's prime reality in time for Avengers: Doomsday.

Production at Fab 21 module 2 is set to start at least two quarters earlier.

TSMC plans to produce 30% of its N2 (2nm-class) output in the U.S. and make its Fab 21 site near Phoenix, Arizona, an independent semiconductor manufacturing cluster, the company's management revealed during the company's earnings call on Thursday. The world's largest contract maker of chips also indicated intentions to speed up building new Fab 21 modules to produce chips on N3 (3nm-class), N2, and A16 (1.6nm-class) nodes.

""After completion, around 30% of our 2nm and more advanced capacity will be located in Arizona, creating an independent leading edge semiconductor manufacturing cluster in the U.S.,"" said C.C. Wei, chief executive and chairman of TSMC, in his prepared remarks. ""It will also create greater economies of scale and help foster a more complete semiconductor supply chain ecosystem in the U.S.""

To produce 30% of its N2 and A16 output in Arizona, TSMC will build two additional Fab 21 modules. So far, the company has confirmed plans to build at least three N2 and A16-capable fab modules in Taiwan's Hsinchu and Kaohsiung Science Parks with more modules incoming, so the island will still produce the lion's share of TSMC's advanced chips. Yet, 30% of TSMC's N2 and A16 chips produced in the U.S. is certainly a big deal.

TSMC's Fab 21 module 1 in Arizona is currently ramping up volume production of chips for its American customers using the company's N4 and N5 process technologies. Construction of the company's N3-capable Fab 21 module 2 (its second fabrication facility in Arizona) is complete, and the company is working to start installing equipment there ahead of time in a bid to pull in volume production of chips at the facility by at least a couple of quarters from its original vague schedule of 2028.

Construction of Fab 21 module 3 and module 4 — the company's facilities that will use N2 and A16 nodes — is expected to start later this year, assuming all required permits are obtained. TSMC did not reveal schedules for these Fab 21 modules, but it is reasonable to expect at least one of them to come online by early 2029 provided that TSMC acquires all the necessary equipment on time.

TSMC's Fab 21 module 5 and module 6 will use process technologies beyond A16 (think A14 and possibly more advanced), but their construction timelines and production ramp will depend on future customer demand.

TSMS's grand plan for Fab 21 is to evolve it into a GigaFab cluster with production capacity of at least 100,000 wafer starts per month, though when exactly this happens is something that remains to be seen.

Significant improvements for the RX 9070 series and Ryzen AI Max+ APUs. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Stability AI, the company behind Stable Diffusion, has released ONNX-optimized models that run up to 3.3x faster on compatible AMD hardware, including select Radeon GPUs and Ryzen AI APUs on mobile.

Amuse is a platform developed by AMD and TensorStack AI that allows users to generate images and short videos locally, on AMD hardware. The latest Amuse 3.0 release not only supports these updated models but also introduces a range of new features, including video diffusion, AI photo filters, and local text-to-image generation. Amuse 3.0 and AMD optimized models require the Adrenalin 24.30.31.05 preview drivers or the upcoming Adrenalin 25.4.1 mainline release.

Over the past year, AMD has partnered with several OSVs, OEMs, and ISVs to optimize AI applications from the ground up, incorporating hardware optimizations, efficient drivers, compilers, and optimized ML models, among other enhancements. Building on this partnership, Stability AI has launched Radeon-optimized versions of its Stable Diffusion family, which include Stable Diffusion 3.5 (SD3.5) and Stable Diffusion XL Turbo (SDXL Turbo). First-party metrics report a 3.3x speedup with SD3.5 Large, dropping to 2.1x for SD3.5 Large Turbo and 1.5x for SDXL Turbo compared to the base PyTorch implementations.



Artificial Intelligence is an integral part of our daily lives, but most of it lives in the cloud and requires an active internet connection. ""AI PCs"" are driving the development of modern processors, which feature dedicated hardware units to accelerate machine learning operations. Take NPUs and specialized AI matrix cores, for example, which allow smaller and efficient AI models to be run locally.

RDNA 4 features AMD's second-generation AI accelerators, which offer 4x more FP16 performance (with sparsity), doubling to 8x with INT8 (again, with sparsity) versus RDNA 3. These optimized models are not architecture-bound, although AMD mandates high-end GPUs for certain models, such as SDXL, SD 3.5 Large, and Turbo. Ryzen AI APUs can leverage the built-in XDNA NPU in tandem with the Radeon iGPU. In this case, Strix Halo is the recommended choice due to its large memory buffer and raw horsepower.

Stable Diffusion models optimized for AMD hardware are tagged with the ""_amdgpu"" suffix and are now available for download at Hugging Face. With the necessary hardware, you can launch these models immediately in your preferred environment or AMD's Amuse 3.0, whichever suits your needs.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the stunning results of my testing of Arctic's Liquid Freezer III. This cooler earns its five-star rating by combining chart-topping performance with a surprisingly reasonable price. 

The strongest AIO I've tested, bar none

Chart-topping noise-normalized performance

Easily handles even the 9950X3D with PBO enabled

Six-year warranty

Very reasonable MSRP of $125

Up to 6.9 mm H2O static pressure!

Intel users still have to install a custom contact frame

This is not a quiet cooler, so you may want to limit the pump and fan speeds


Why you can trust Tom's Hardware




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


Arctic is a name well-known and beloved by many PC enthusiasts for providing high-value, quality cooling solutions. I caused a bit of a controversy with my last review, where I didn't mince words, stating “the Liquid Freezer III is unimpressive.”

Well, it appears that Arctic took my feedback to heart. We're looking at the Liquid Freezer III Pro today, and let me tell you guys, they take the pro moniker very seriously. If I didn't know better, I'd swear they designed this cooler just for me. Its performance blew away my expectations – I honestly couldn't believe my own results until I tested it with both Intel's Core i7-14700K and AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPUs.

Will Arctic's Liquid Freezer III Pro make our list of best coolers on the market? There's no doubt about it. Let's take a look at the specifications and features of the cooler, then we'll go over thermal performance with both Intel and AMD CPUs, as well as noise levels. Since this is our first review including AMD's Ryzen 9 9950X3D, I'll try to spend a little more time explaining how I test coolers and why I chose the methods shown in today's review.

The packaging for the cooler is typical for Arctic, advertising the cooler on the outside. Opening the box reveals the contents, carefully protected and packaged with foam, plastic, and cardboard.



Included in the box are the following:



▶️ 38mm thick radiator

This AIO's radiator is thick. At 38mm radiator and 25mm fans, that's a combined thickness of 53mm – this will present compatibility issues with some cases. So make sure to do some measuring before buying if you're installing in an existing build.



▶️ Offset mounting for Intel and AMD CPUs



Different CPUs on the market can have different hotspots, which can impact the effectiveness of a cooler. This is why some coolers seem to do better – or worse – with AMD or Intel. Arctic refined its mounting for AMD AM4/AM5 and LGA 1851 systems, resulting in claimed performance increases of up to 9 degrees C with a 250W power limit.

▶️ Pump noise

This AIO's pump can run a little louder than some users may prefer at full speed. It doesn't interfere with my noise-normalized testing at 38.9 dBA, but as part of testing this cooler I've been investigating different ways to do noise-normalized testing at lower noise levels. To test this cooler normalized at 37.3 dBA required limiting the speed of the liquid pump. That said, if you set up this cooler using the all-in-one cable, the pump will not run at full speed except in the most intensive scenarios, resulting in a quietly running pump that never overpowers the noise of fans.

▶️ New P12 Pro Fans – and a VRM fan too!

There's more to a cooler than just the heatsink or radiator. The bundled fans have a significant impact on cooling and noise levels, as well as how the cooler looks in your case.

The new P12 Pro fans include 7 blades instead of the 5-bladed fans included with previous Liquid Freezer CPUs, and are pre-installed for convenience. Arctic claims they perform at the same level as their MAX fans, but at a lower noise level. That's not to say these fans run quietly though. As you'll see in our benchmarks below, they can get pretty loud!

My results may differ from others because I place an emphasis on having results that are comparable to real world use.

This means that I test CPU coolers inside of a closed desktop case, which increases cooling difficulty compared to other testing methods - many will test CPU coolers outside of a case, on an open test bench. Open benches have lowered ambient temperatures, which in turn makes weak coolers appear stronger than they really are. Some publications have used generic thermal plates to test cooling solutions.

I reject both of these methods because they don't accurately reflect the real world conditions a CPU cooler is used in.

My previous reviews have also tested Intel's latest platform, using the Core Ultra 9 285K Arrow Lake CPU. We're going to be retiring this from our testing suite. Between BIOS updates and Windows updates, Arrow Lake's thermal characteristics have changed in some scenarios – rendering much of our previous testing data useless.

With today's review, we're adding AMD's recently released Ryzen 9 9950X3D! This is one beast of a CPU, providing the best gaming and multithreaded performance on the market – and can prove quite challenging thermally when PBO is enabled for overclocking.

The installation of this cooler is simple, but a bit of a pain for Intel users due to the required use of a custom contact frame for the CPU.

1. You'll first need to remove the standard CPU socket if you're using an Intel CPU. AMD users will remove the default mounting mechanism.



2. Next you'll set the rubber standoffs on AMD systems, or carefully install the custom mounting frame for Intel systems.



You may notice the additional standoffs present in the Intel system's photo below. This is because I used another cooler's mounting to secure the CPU socket while I installed the custom frame.



3. Next, AMD users should take the mounting bars and place them on top of the rubber standoffs, securing them with the included screws. Intel users can skip to the next step.



4. Apply the included thermal paste to your CPU. If you have any questions on how to do this properly, please refer to our handy guide on how to apply thermal paste.

5. Mount the CPU block and secure it with a screwdriver.



6. Once complete, connect the cabling to the CPU block's head. For the purposes of testing, I chose the option with individual PWM control for the fans, pump, and VRM fan. However, some users may prefer the simplicity of the all-in-one cable. Connect the cables and place the VRM fan on top of the CPU block, and installation is complete!

Overall, 8.7% of GP-invited participants had confirmed increased albuminuria, with 40.6% of them being newly diagnosed.

""Screening in a GP setting shows benefits on top of opportunistic screening. In those patients identified with increased albuminuria, a large part had previously undiagnosed or sub-optimally controlled risk factors, suggesting that health benefits can be obtained by initiating or optimising treatment of CKD risk factors,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Dominique van Mil, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands. It was published online on April 08, 2025, in eClinicalMedicine.

This study was unable to collect data from non-participants in the home-based screening phase due to privacy legislation, limiting the understanding of their characteristics and factors influencing their participation decisions. The ACR status of non-participants and patients in the pharmacy group was unknown. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported medical history by participants may have introduced potential bias.

This study was funded by AstraZeneca Netherlands. Some authors reported having stocks and ownership and receiving grants, personal fees, consultancy fees, and non-financial support from various pharmaceutical companies.

For patients who experience excessive bleeding during cardiac surgery, four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (4F-PCC), a blood product that contains clotting factors, is significantly more effective at stopping bleeding than frozen plasma and causes fewer adverse effects, the FARES-II trial showed.

“Patients who received 4F-PCC needed significantly fewer interventions to stop their bleeding, lost less blood, received fewer blood transfusions, and had fewer surgical complications and adverse events than those who were given frozen plasma,” said lead investigator Keyvan Karkouti, MD, from Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

“The results suggest that using 4F-PCC to manage excessive bleeding during cardiac surgery will have substantial benefits for patients and the healthcare system by relieving pressure on the blood supply and other hospital resources,” he explained during his presentation of the FARES-II results, which were simultaneously published online in JAMA, at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Scientific Session 2025 in Chicago.

“We believe that these findings support the use of 4F-PCC over plasma for bleeding management in cardiac surgery,” he said.

Around 15% of patients who undergo cardiac surgery experience excessive bleeding, Karkouti reported. The standard treatment is transfusion of frozen plasma, but that must be thawed and matched to the patient's blood type before use. Adverse effects of frozen plasma transfusions are uncommon but can include allergic reactions, infections, and an overload of plasma in the circulatory system.

4F-PCC is a blood product derived from pooled plasma that contains the vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, the anticoagulant proteins C and S, and small amounts of heparin. The recognized advantages of 4F-PCC over frozen plasma are that it has undergone purification, concentration, and pathogen reduction; it contains a standard amount of coagulation factors; and it does not require thawing or blood type matching.

However, until now, the ability of 4F-PCC to stop excessive bleeding in surgical patients has not been tested, and previous studies that have looked at this have been underpowered and inconclusive.

The FARES-II trial, conducted at 12 hospitals in the United States and Canada, assessed 420 patients who experienced excessive bleeding during cardiac surgery that involved the use of a heart-lung bypass machine.

In the operating room, patients who developed excessive bleeding were randomly assigned to treatment with a standard dose of either 4F-PCC or frozen plasma. A second dose could be given if ordered in the 24 hours after initiation of the first dose. If treatment was needed beyond 24 hours, all patients received frozen plasma.

The study's primary endpoint was hemostatic response — the absence of additional interventions to stop bleeding from 1 hour to 24 hours after initiation of the first treatment dose.

Hemostatic effectiveness was better in the 4F-PCC group than in the frozen plasma group (77.9% vs 60.4%) and was significant for both noninferiority and superiority.

And in the subsequent 30 days, the 4F-PCC group needed fewer transfusions, including red blood cells, platelets, and frozen plasma (mean, 6.6 vs 9.3 units) than the frozen plasma group.

The rate of severe or massive bleeding with 4F-PCC was almost half that with frozen plasma (14.1% vs 27.5%).

Serious adverse events were significantly lower in the 4F-PCC group than in the frozen plasma group (36.2% vs 47.3%), particularly acute kidney injury (10.3% vs 18.8%).

“Our hypothesis is that by stopping bleeding early, reducing transfusions, this reduces the adverse events that are associated with transfusions, which can be serious,” Karkouti said.

The difference in thromboembolic events between the 4F-PCC group and the frozen plasma group was not statistically significant (8.5% vs 7.2%). Seven patients in the 4F-PCC group and eight in the frozen plasma group died.

These 4F-PCC products are already used a fair amount in cardiac surgery to stem bleeding during the procedure, Toby Trujillo, PharmD, clinical pharmacy specialist in cardiovascular pharmacotherapy and anticoagulation at the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, Colorado, said during an ACC press conference.

Still, “this is an important study because it actually provides some literature and some support that we didn't have previously in terms of its efficacy, compared to plasma transfusion,” and its reduction in adverse events, he added. “PCCs are expensive, and these results are going to really help support the use of PCCs as a standard of care in cardiac surgery, when needed, to help stop bleeding.”

FARES-II was “a very important, well-designed, and well-per formed trial,” said Mario Gaudino, MD, PhD, cardiothoracic surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medicine Center in New York City.

However, the investigators were not blinded to the treatment administered, which could have led to some bias and may have contributed to the very large treatment effect seen in the trial, he said.

The surgeons “didn't know which product they were going to use until they started treatment. They were then unblinded,” Karkouti pointed out, although he acknowledged this as a “limitation of this study.”

However, he noted, the results were consistent over several timepoints, and there was no evidence of bias sufficient to explain a 30% reduction in blood transfusions.

“I think it will be very important to follow these patients” who have undergone bypass surgery for a longer period, said Gaudino, “because generally graft thrombosis is silent in the first months after surgery and becomes apparent in the months after that.”

The FARES-II trial excluded high-risk patients with a recent history of thromboembolism, and the use of laboratory-driven transfusion thresholds in the study may have reduced the thromboembolic risk of administering PCC to patients without factor deficiency, according to an editorial accompanying the JAMA publication by Elliott Bennett-Guerrero, MD, from the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, and Ryan Wang, MD, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City.

In a previous study, 4F-PCC was given to bleeding trauma patients without first confirming factor deficiency, so the product was associated with significantly higher rates of thromboembolic events, they explained.

In the title of their editorial, Bennett-Guerrero and Wang asked: “Is it time to replace plasma with prothrombin complex concentrate in cardiac surgery?”

They then tried to answer that. “The FARES-II trial provides substantial evidence that PCC, when used with a structured algorithm and point-of-care INR [international normalized ratio] testing, is more effective than thawed frozen plasma at treating bleeding after cardiac surgery due to factor deficiency. Administration of PCC may be beneficial in coagulopathic patients who cannot receive a large volume of thawed frozen plasma or for whom rapid reversal is important.”

However, they added, “the differences in blood products administered were modest in the FARES-II trial, and no differences were observed in mortality or in ICU or hospital length-of-stay, which may argue against a major clinical benefit for most patients.”

The FARES-II study was funded by Octapharma AG of Switzerland, which manufactures the 4F-PCC used in the study, and by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. Karkouti reported receiving personal fees from Octapharma-Werfen outside the submitted work.

This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hi. I am Stefan Holubar, an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) surgeon at Cleveland Clinic, and we're going to talk about surgery for ulcerative colitis. We'll start out by going over the goals of surgery for IBD, dive into the details of pouch surgery and ileostomy surgery, and finish up with some perioperative optimization tips and tricks and things to talk to patients about when they're facing an ileostomy or surgery. 

Importantly, the goals of surgery in IBD are a little bit different than those in colorectal cancer, for example. For the most part, it's about improving patients' quality of life, and ideally, in ulcerative colitis, curing their underlying colitis while also focusing on maintaining transanal continence. We'll talk more about that. 

We talk about medicine and surgery being complementary, and we request that our gastroenterology colleagues refer patients for surgery for medically refractory disease because surgery should not be thought of as a failure. We should not consider surgery as a last resort of therapy because that's associated with an increased complication and even mortality rate.

The role of surgery in ulcerative colitis is curative for the colorectal manifestations of disease at least, but not for the underlying IBD. We know that most patients with ulcerative colitis are referred for medically refractory disease, about 80%, whereas roughly 20% are referred for dysplasia or cancer.

In terms of operative technique, these days we have many tools in our toolbox for doing these minimally invasively, the most common being straight laparoscopic, with robotics really taking on an increasing role. I would say that robotics is just a variation on laparoscopic surgery.

Importantly, we do have to have an extraction incision to get the colon and rectum out of the body, and often to help with making the anastomosis as well. When we do it minimally invasively, this is often a periumbilical or Pfannenstiel incision. 

Diving into the details of surgery for ulcerative colitis, we're really talking about the J-pouch procedure, which an ileoanal reservoir, called the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. About 90% of patients with ulcerative colitis will have pouches, whereas 10% either won't be candidates for it or will choose an ileostomy. We'll talk more about that. 

Patients prefer the J-pouch because it restores their ability to have a bowel movement without an ostomy after total proctocolectomy. This is because the J-pouch is a reservoir for the stool. Most commonly, this is done laparoscopically in three stages. The reason we favor the three-stage approach is because we don't want to make the pouch when the patient is ill. 

Therefore, stage 1 is typically a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy. This quickly restores the patient to health and then allows them to optimize their risk factors for leaks from the pouch, which involves weaning of steroids, improving their nutrition, and treating anemia. Also, it allows them to electively schedule the pouch around life events, such as during vacations from school or work. 

In stage 2, we do a completion proctectomy. We construct a pouch and anastomosis to the anus and then make a protective loop ileostomy while the pouch is healing. Three months later, we go back in and close the loop ileostomy (stage 3).

The first and second stages each typically take about 3 or 4 hours, and patients should be in the hospital for about a week each time. The third stage takes about an hour, and they're typically in the hospital for just a couple of days. Recovery [takes] about 6 weeks after each stage. 

Medically refractory patients are typically more ill at the time that they're requiring surgery, and we know that the three-stage approach is associated with the lowest leak rate. There's an excellent study by Plietz and colleagues from Mount Sinai, originally published in 2001, titled, “Slow and Steady Wins the Race: A Solid Case for a 3-Stage Approach in Ulcerative Colitis.” 

Hospital volume is [an important] consideration. There's a great university health system consortium study from Hoang and colleagues, published in 2020, that reported that 101 hospitals performed less than five pouches per year, with the median number of pouches annually being only 1.8. Half of the pouches in this study were performed at only 10 hospitals. 

We have an excellent systematic review that was published in 2024 by Giddings and colleagues that showed that low-volume centers have a higher rate of pouch failure [and] a lower rate of reconstruction, and that higher center volume was associated with a reduced readmission rate. Some of the studies also showed an association between complication rates and surgeon experience. This adds to the mounting international evidence supporting pouch centralization. 

This is because the pouch is a complicated structure. We like to have a nice, healthy-sized reservoir — a 15- to 20-cm pouch with a small, short, less than 2-cm tip of the J and a less than 2-cm rectal cuff. Otherwise, we're open to complications such as long rectal cuff syndrome, which is basically ulcerative proctitis, and other complications. I talk about the lethal pouch triad being a cuff longer than 2 cm, a small pouch less than 15 cm, twisted pouch syndrome, which is a favorite research topic of mine, as well as anastomotic leaks. 

Not all patients with ulcerative colitis are going to be candidates for a pouch, and so we have to look at the long list of relative and absolute contraindications for pouch. Megan Obi, one of our general surgery residents, published a nice table in Diseases of the Colon & Rectum, looking at the contraindications to pouch construction, and Bo Shen and colleagues have a nice article titled, “When Not to Pouch: Important Considerations for Patient Selection for Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis.” 

We have looked at several studies at the patients who choose or do not undergo the pouch procedure, and it seems that patient preference is really the most common indication, with advanced age and other factors being less common. Importantly, when patients are facing a staged total proctocolectomy with or without a pouch, it's important for them to meet with an ostomy nurse for education and site marking.

In terms of informed consent for pouch patients, we provide them with a pouch booklet and explain that the typical pouch function in a normal situation should be seven to eight bowel movements per 24 hours, without urgency and without incontinence, pain, or bleeding. Then we talk about the leak rate being roughly around 5% and what to do if that happens. These days, we do the EndoVac or Endo-sponge treatment, which has an effectiveness rate over 80%. 

The pouch survival long-term is excellent, over 90%, and we do recommend a surveillance pouchoscopy every 3 years or so. We also talk about pouchitis being pretty common. Most patients should expect to have uncomplicated, acute pouchitis at some point during their pouch life. Phenotypic switching to Crohn's disease is less common, at about 10%-15%.

Patients with an end ileostomy should expect to empty their appliance about six to seven times per day. Skin irritation is extremely common but is usually readily addressed with fastidious ostomy care and support by the nurses. When we do the intersphincteric dissection during the proctectomy and close up the anus, what patients refer to as “Barbie butt,” we talk about the presacral sinus being pretty common, with perineal wound healing complications around 20%. Typically, with fastidious wound care, we can get that to heal. 

Parastomal hernias are really common and ileostomy prolapse is relatively uncommon. Importantly, for patients, related to the proctectomy — and often these are younger patients— we talk about fertility, sexuality, and pelvic nerve dysfunction.

I'll finish up with some perioperative optimization things to think about. This is very much about teamwork and referring patients to our IBD psychologists, nutritionists, and pharmacists, if we have those resources available. A hot topic is prehabilitation with preoperative physical therapy. We talk about referring patients to ostomy therapy nurses for education and site marking.

Often, we try to improve their nutritional status preoperatively in ulcerative colitis, typically with nutritional support, with enteral protein and calorie supplements to try to switch them from a catabolic to an anabolic state if possible. We often use intravenous iron in the perioperative period just because it's better tolerated and faster.

We try to wean the steroids perioperatively if we can, and postoperatively if we have to. Importantly, we don't believe any more that we have to hold biologics or immunomodulators preoperatively, except for the small molecules, which we do hold for about 3 days preoperatively. 

The most important part of patients' preoperative optimization process is getting the team together to review the case in a multidisciplinary team discussion where we go over everything, including previous operative and pathology reports, as well as the lab, endoscopy, radiology, and pathology reports. 

Postoperative optimization is very important, also. We counsel the patient regarding the expected length of stay and recovery, as we already talked about, as well as the complications that we talked about. Readmissions are relatively common, at about 10%. Reoperations are less common, in under 10% of patients. Overall recovery would be about 6 weeks. 

In the postoperative period, in a hospital, we try to wean and minimize the opiates with multimodal nonopioid therapy. We wean steroids typically over the course of a month at home. Very importantly, and a huge hot topic of research interest of mine, is venous thromboembolism chemoprophylaxis for about a month after the first two stages. 

Most of these patients will have a temporary ileostomy. We suggest hydration with isosmotic, low-sugar, modern products that are commercially available these days, and nutritional supplements while they're healing that, importantly, have not just high protein but also are high calorie. 

I'll finish up with some pearls for patients facing surgery with ulcerative colitis. I advise them that you can't stay the same and you can't get worse. You really need to get better, and if you can't get better with medical therapy, then you have to get better with surgical therapy. Either way, you're going to have a very normal quality of life. 

Patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis who undergo a total abdominal colectomy or with end ileostomy typically have an immediate dramatic improvement in their quality of life. 

Surgery is an inevitable reality for millions of patients with IBD worldwide, and just as IBD surgeons must be experts in the medicines for IBD, we recommend that gastroenterologists specializing in IBD care, and patients and their families, need to be well-informed and experts in understanding surgery for IBD.

The most important thing with surgery for ulcerative colitis is that we, as IBD surgeons, are not operating in isolation. We want to focus on the team approach, which is really the key to success. 

Thank you so much.","{'href': 'https://www.medscape.com', 'title': 'Medscape'}","health"

In contrast to World Health Organization (WHO) guideline, a newly published report from the UK's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) states that non-sugar sweeteners (NSS) may help adults lose a small amount of weight in the short term.

SACN released its updated guideline in early April in response to the WHO guideline, published in 2023, which offers a conditional recommendation against the use of NSS to control body weight or reduce the risk for noncommunicable diseases, such as type 2 diabetes.

The WHO guideline defines NSS as “all synthetic and naturally occurring or modified non-nutritive sweeteners that are not classified as sugars.” Common examples include aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and stevia.

The WHO recommendation is based on evidence — all described in the guideline as being of low or very low certainty — from a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and from prospective observational studies.

While some RCTs found NSS use could result in weight loss and lower body mass index (BMI), the studies were very short (mostly ≤ 3 months), varied widely in design, and typically didn't assess the effect of substituting sugar with NSS, the WHO guidelines noted.

By contrast, the observational studies, which had follow-up of up to 10 years, indicated that higher NSS intake was associated with higher BMI and obesity risk, along with increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular risks, the guidelines state.

Overall, the WHO concluded that the small amount of weight loss from NSS in short-term experimental settings may not be relevant to their long-term use in the real world.

The conditional nature of the recommendation indicates that the organization is less certain that policies dissuading use of NSS for weight loss would benefit all populations, so policymakers in various countries should discuss the recommendation before deciding whether to adopt it.

The SACN report knocks the WHO's conditional recommendation for giving greater weight to the observational cohort studies than it gave to RCTs. In its recommendation, the committee does the opposite and gives greater weight to “good quality RCTs, where available because these minimize the potential for bias and confounding.”

Prospective cohort studies are observational in nature, so “it is not possible to say that consumption of sweeteners caused weight gain,” a UK Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson told Medscape Medical News. “WHO acknowledged that this finding was based on low to very low certainty of evidence. Data from randomized controlled trials suggest that when sweeteners replace sugar in the diet, energy intake is reduced, therefore preventing weight gain.”

Nevertheless, because the evidence on NSS and health outcomes is inconsistent, SACN recommends minimizing NSS intake “on a precautionary basis,” she added. The report noted there may be some value in using NSS for older children and adults “to help reduce weight gain in the short to medium term, but it is not essential and is not the only option.”

For younger children, the committee recommends not giving drinks sweetened with sugar or NSS and giving them unsweetened food.

For older children and adults, SACN states that swapping sugars for NSS may help reduce sugar intake from foods and drinks, at least in the short term, but that the long-term goal is to limit both sugar and NSS intake.

WHO did not respond to requests for a comment.

The SACN recommendation “is not very different from previous advice,” noted Oliver Jones, professor of chemistry, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia, in an expert commentary included with the report. “The advice from nutrition bodies is to have a balanced diet and avoid taking in too much sugar — for example, fruit drinks such as orange juice often have the same level of acidity and sugar as soft drinks, so it is best not to drink too much of them.”

SACN recommends against using too many NSS because they can lead to confusion about calorie intake and because weight management is a multifaceted issue that needs to be looked at holistically, he added.

The paucity of evidence to base recommendations on is notable, Jules Griffin, director of the Rowett Institute, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland, said in his commentary.

“Despite the large consumption of NSS drinks by parts of the population, we don't have conclusive evidence of benefits or drawbacks on some pretty fundamental outcomes, including tooth decay, weight gain, and type 2 diabetes, with studies showing opposite outcomes.”

SACN simultaneously released an update on processed foods and health. The report concludes that the association between higher consumption of processed and ultra-processed foods and adverse health outcomes is “concerning.”

However, “limitations in the available evidence meant that it was unclear whether these foods are inherently unhealthy due to processing or because a large majority of them are high in energy (calories), saturated fat, salt and/or free sugars,” the advisory committee wrote.

Overall, commented Hilda Mulrooney, a senior academic in Nutrition and Health, London Metropolitan University, London, England, “SACN advice remains consistent; to meet healthy eating recommendations for nutrients such as fiber, the diet should contain more whole grains, fruit and vegetables.”

An estimated 51%-68% energy intake in the UK diet comes from ultra-processed foods, she noted. “Given that many of these are also high in fat, salt, and sugar, the advice remains that intakes of these foods should be reduced,” she added.

 April 17, 2025  

Two early-stage clinical trials demonstrate the safety and potential effectiveness of stem cell therapies to treat Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurological disease worldwide.

PD is characterized by the progressive loss of neurons that produce dopamine. Although current treatments, such as levodopa, can alleviate symptoms in the early stages of PD, their efficacy declines, and they are often accompanied by side effects such as dyskinesia.

Cell-based therapies that replenish dopamine neurons in the brain are showing early promise as a potentially more effective treatment with fewer adverse effects. The two new studies were published online on April 16 in Nature.

In a phase 2/3 trial conducted in Japan, seven patients with PD underwent bilateral striatal transplantation of dopaminergic precursor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, with immunosuppression, and were monitored for 24 months.

“This trial showed that iPS cell–derived dopaminergic neurons are safe, produce dopamine in the brain, and ameliorate neurological symptoms. I think it is a significant first step,” study investigator Jun Takahashi, MD, PhD, director and professor, Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, told Medscape Medical News.

No serious adverse events were reported during the study period, and the transplanted cells produced dopamine without forming tumors, a serious risk associated with stem cell therapy.

Among the six patients evaluated for efficacy, five showed improvement in the Movement Disorders Society–Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), Part III, while on medication and when they stopped taking it, four continued to show improvement.

The average changes of all six patients were 9.5 points (20.4%) and 4.3 points (35.7%) for the OFF and ON scores, respectively. Hoehn-Yahr stages improved in four patients.

Takahashi noted that cell transplantation can be applied when medication for PD becomes less effective or causes side effects.

“In this sense, cell transplantation therapy is adjunctive. In the future, the best scenario is that cell transplantation alone can replace lost dopaminergic neurons and cure the patient,” Takahashi said.

In a separate phase 1 clinical trial, also published in Nature, an “off-the-shelf” dopaminergic progenitor cell product (bemdaneprocel) derived from human embryonic stem cells was grafted bilaterally into the putamen of 12 patients with PD from the United States and Canada.

Five patients received a low-dose (0.9 million cells per putamen) and seven received a high-dose (2.7 million cells per putamen), coupled with 1 year of immunosuppression.

The trial achieved its primary objectives of safety and tolerability up to 18 months after transplantation, with no adverse events related to the cell product, reported the investigators led by Viviane Tabar, MD, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

The transplanted cells survived, became engrafted and produced dopamine, with no evidence of graft-induced dyskinesias.

Secondary and exploratory clinical outcomes showed improvement or stability, including improvement in the MDS-UPDRS, Part III, OFF scores by an average of 23 points in the high-dose cohort, reflecting improved motor function without PD medication.

The author of a Nature News and Views said these results are “encouraging” because they show that the use of allogeneic transplants for treatment of PD is likely to be safe.

“To confirm their effectiveness, however, more research is needed. These two trials were small, open-label studies in which both the investigators and the participants were aware of who received what treatment,” wrote Hideyuki Okano, MD, PhD, with the Keio University Regenerative Medicine Research Center, Kawasaki, Japan.

“Because of this, there is a possibility that the results on efficacy were influenced by the placebo effect or investigator bias. Nevertheless, the fact that both independent trials proved to be safe, and hinted at possible efficacy, is an important step towards the establishment of this cell therapy for Parkinson's disease in wider society. The next stages of clinical trials, phases 2 and 3, are awaited to fully assess the efficacy of these interventions,” Okano concluded.

Commenting on this research for Medscape Medical News, Michael S. Okun, MD, medical advisor, Parkinson's Foundation, and director of the Normal Fixel Institute for Neurological Diseases, University of Florida Health, Gainesville, noted that, over the past two plus decades, stem cells have generated “tremendous interest, excitement and hope for Parkinson's disease. These two most recent studies are small but promising.”

Okun cautioned that it's tough to judge short- and long-term outcomes because each of the two studies included so few subjects. “The safety of each approach was reassuring, and one very important finding was the absence of runaway dyskinesia, which was a ‘showstopper' for previous Parkinson's stem cell trials,” Okun said.

Okun also said its important for patients and families to be wary of what has been referred to as “stem cell tourism.”

These two newly published studies are both “legitimate,” he told Medscape Medical News.

“We are however aware of thousands of clinics around the world offering a stem cell ‘cure for cash' deal. We are also aware of serious complications resulting from stem cell therapies.”

“We recommend never paying for an unproven experimental treatment. We also recommend that before saying yes to anyone approaching you with cash for a stem cell treatment you request copies of two critical documents: The Institutional Review Board approval to conduct research on you as a human subject, and also the informed consent form. Bring the documents to your doctor and healthcare team for discussion and shared decision-making,” said Okun.

The study by Takahashi and colleagues was supported by a grant from the Research Project for Practical Application of Regenerative Medicine of the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development. The study by Tabar and colleagues was sponsored by BlueRock Therapeutics. Disclosures for study authors and News and Views author are available with the original articles. Okun had no relevant disclosures.

Disclosure: Alessandra Spedicato, MD, has disclosed no relevant financial relationships.

In an interview with El Médico Interactivo, a Medscape Network platform, Alessandra Spedicato, MD, president of the European Federation of Salaried Doctors (FEMS), emphasized the urgent need for reforms aimed at improving the working conditions of doctors across Europe. 

“Our main goal is to elevate the value of medical work by recognizing the unique nature of the profession — particularly for those serving in public health systems,” Spedicato explained. “At FEMS, we advocate for a comprehensive strategy that includes better working conditions, greater professional recognition, and sufficient investment in public healthcare to ensure high-quality care for all.”

We aim to improve doctors' working conditions because a well-organized system allows them to fully realize their potential, even though financial recognition is lower than in the private sector. Additionally, we are working to ensure quality and accessibility of care. We seek a balance between the commitment of doctors and the need to provide healthcare for the benefit of the entire population.

This declaration acknowledges the negative effects of medical work on health, particularly due to shifts and prolonged hours. The idea is to develop preventive measures throughout their professional careers. We must introduce organizational benefits and the possibility of early retirement, similar to those in other professional categories.

The planned steps include raising awareness among institutions, patients, and doctors about this issue, which has been overlooked so far. We need to gather updated and robust data to support the current scientific literature. Furthermore, by late March 2025, we will launch a project aimed at assessing the physical health of doctors and the impact of work organization on them. This project will also involve medical organizations across Europe, including Spain.

Through a system of alliances with other European associations representing salaried doctors, a project must be presented to both parliamentarians and the European Commission (medical and nonmedical) to address this issue.

In Europe, the main challenges revolve around caring for an aging population that is increasingly demanding and dealing with complex diseases. Doctors must continuously update their knowledge to keep pace with advances in medicine.

Other challenges include staff shortages, pressure stemming from a lack of social and managerial recognition, and the difficulty of balancing work and family life. Additionally, gender and generational changes require a review of the labor policies.

In Spain, the focus is on gaining government recognition of the specificities of the medical community compared with other groups. We also focus on the need to secure labor rights equivalent to European Union standards in terms of working hours and rest periods.

The main differences stem from the levels of funding for the national health systems. In countries that allocate a higher percentage of GDP to healthcare services, doctors tend to be more satisfied, both organizationally and financially. Even in countries with high-performing systems such as the Netherlands, generational and gender changes influence professionals' satisfaction levels.

We should emulate the models of countries that invest more in public healthcare and in general welfare. This translates into better working conditions and greater professional recognition for the workers.

The shortage of doctors is rooted in specific planning errors. On the one hand, there is inadequate staff counting in the hospital. In this regard, it is necessary to consider the full-time equivalent rather than just the number of employees, taking into account doctors' age, gender (eg, reductions due to pregnancy and parental leave), and health status.

Regarding superspecialization, the number of doctors per specialty should be evaluated, especially in the most demanding specialties with staff shortages.

As for the distribution between the public and private sectors, it is essential to count only doctors active in national health systems, because the private sector serves only a portion of the population. Additionally, policies should be promoted to enable doctors to remain in their country of training and avoid migration driven solely by economic reasons.

Health policy must recognize that patient care is not a mechanical assembly line. Therefore, hospitals should not be conceived as profit-oriented enterprises but as structures whose true benefit lies in maintaining a healthy population.

Organizational models that allow greater flexibility should be adopted, enabling doctors to dedicate the necessary time and attention to each patient, thereby benefiting the entire community.

Measures include developing a welfare system that supports childcare for preschool and school-aged children. A culture should also be promoted where childcare responsibilities are shared equally between fathers and mothers.

Moreover, the possibility of reducing working hours (part-time work) during specific career phases should be allowed to ensure greater flexibility in the workplace.

It is about creating a work environment that promotes physical and mental well-being and recognizes that a satisfied worker is more productive.

The Netherlands is an exemplary model for this. Its healthcare system receives significant investments, resulting in good remuneration, professional growth opportunities, and adequate recognition of doctors' roles in society.

Despite the repeal of the European directive on working hours, efficient internal organization and well-structured task shifting allow doctors to remain satisfied even if their hours exceed the prescribed limits.

The situation in Spain concerning the Framework Statute is worrying. Imposing exclusivity on work in the public healthcare system risks pushing doctors, especially younger and newly trained ones, toward the private sector or even other countries.

This measure, which requires exclusivity for leadership positions, could lead to a qualitative loss. Only doctors who do not engage in extrasystemic activities are eligible for decision-making roles, penalizing the public system.

FEMS is working on several fronts, such as recognizing medical work as “arduous.” Preventive and organizational measures must be developed to mitigate the negative health effects. The impact on home life should also be reviewed so that inactive time is fairly considered as rest time.

We recommend adopting the full-time equivalent parameter for a realistic and accurate assessment of the medical workforce. Additionally, the rights of salaried doctors must be strengthened, because they are increasingly sacrificed in personnel crises to ensure healthcare for the population.

 April 17, 2025  

Two international genitourinary pathology societies have published a white paper calling for improvements in the detection and diagnosis of indolent prostate cancers (PCs).

According to the new document, limitations in the ability to differentiate noncancerous prostate lesions from more aggressive and potentially life-threatening tumors are resulting in too many patients experiencing adverse outcomes, mainly from complications of unnecessary treatment from radiation therapy and radical prostatectomy, mainly incontinence and erectile dysfunction.

To address the issue, the Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) and the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) are calling for a multidisciplinary team approach with urologists, radiologists, radiation oncologists, and pathologists determining how best to manage cases of indolent PC. The document appeared last month in European Urology.

“Reliable identification of indolent prostate cancer at needle biopsies is not possible,” the societies stated. “This is because sampling errors, disease progression, or the different molecular makeup may contribute to such discrepancies.”

The societies define indolent PC as “low-volume, well-differentiated acinar neoplasm with invasive histologic features that do not spread outside the prostate, become symptomatic, or shorten a patient's life if left untreated.”

Despite the overlap between clinically insignificant PC and indolent tumors, they “do not necessarily mean the same entity,” the paper said.

Gladell Paner, MD, director of Genitourinary Pathology at the University of Chicago, Chicago, and a co-author of the new document, said the new thinking represents a “major shift, with expert genitourinary pathologists now accepting that there is indeed a ‘noncancerous-behaving entity' within our current diagnosis of prostate cancer.”

However, Paner added, “We are not yet capable of isolating these purely nonlethal tumors based on current criteria and technology.”

Glen Kristiansen, MD, past president of ISUP and chairman of the Institute of Pathology at University Hospital Bonn in Bonn, Germany, said renaming Grade Group 1 tumors as noncancerous lesions is just one approach.

“We can do something about this problem from the patient care perspective, but we cannot do it alone as pathologists,” Kristiansen said. “We need a multidisciplinary approach at this point to define indolent cancer.”

Most pathologists say Grade Group 1 looks like cancer, but many urologists say the lesions do not act like a malignancy because they tend not to spread or kill. The authors of the white paper argued that uropathologists have agreed to collaborate with urologists, radiologists, and radiation oncologists to reach an interdisciplinary consensus to write new guidelines and patient-centered pathology reports.

A similar multidisciplinary process occurred in redefining certain thyroid growths as noncancers, as reported in JAMA in 2016.

Redefining Grade Group 1 prostate tumors as noncancers has been debated for years, but pathologists, in particular, have resisted the idea.

Mathew Cooperberg, MD, MPH, the Helen Diller Family Chair in Urology at the University of California, San Francisco, said the white paper could lead urologists and other prostate experts to collaborate with uropathologists to develop new guidelines to redefine Grade Group 1 tumors and spare these patients from the emotional distress and financial toxicities that often accompany a diagnosis of cancer.

The document “shows that this question, after a lot of years of smoldering, is getting the appropriate attention that it deserves at the highest levels. Really clear engagement from the pathology community is essential,” Cooperberg said.

Rajal B. Shah, MD, immediate past president of GUPS and a senior uropathologist at the UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, and the lead author on the white paper, said a multidisciplinary approach to the problem includes integrating clinical, pathological, genomic, and radiological information unique to each patient to better understand the disease.

Shah said the goal of the effort is to educate stakeholders involved in PC care, including urologists, radiologists, radiation oncologists, and pathologists, that not all Grade Group 1 lesions can effectively be identified as indolent with 100% accuracy.

Shah said the field needs more collaboration, research support, and resources to better identify which Grade Group 1 or Gleason score 6 cancers diagnosed in prostate needle biopsies are truly indolent and can be safely watched by patients enrolling in active surveillance vs men who should be treated.

The document cites a controversial 2024 Danish study in European Urology Oncology that reported 14% of men found to have indolent lesions died from PC within 15 years of diagnosis. The authors said defects in the study, such as a lack of central pathology review, likely resulted in the mortality rate attributable to true Grade Group 1 PCs being much higher than would be anticipated.

Approximately 20%-30% of Grade Group 1 tumors on initial biopsy are upgraded to a higher grade following a radical prostatectomy.

Ming Zhou, MD, PhD, past president of GUPS and vice chair of Oncological Pathology at Mount Sinai Health System in New York City, said that while he signed the white paper, he felt it did not go far enough. “I do not think you will ever succeed in persuading pathologists to think GG1 [Grade Group 1] is not cancer-based on pathology and genetics. But for patient management, we should consider labeling it as noncancer,” he said.

No relevant financial conflicts were reported.

Howard Wolinsky is a Chicago-based medical writer. He has been working on a study funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with Cooperberg and Paner which, in part, will gather minority patients' views on the renaming of Grade Group 1 as a noncancer.

Treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, either alone or in combination with growth hormone (GH), slowed bone advancement and enhanced adult height in mid-pubertal boys with a short predicted adult height due to advanced bone age or idiopathic short stature (ISS).

“While the effectiveness of AIs [aromatase inhibitors] in GH-treated adolescents is well-established, our findings emphasize their potential benefit specifically for mid-pubertal adolescents with advanced BA [bone age] and reduced predicted AHt [adult height],” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Michal Yackobovitch-Gavan, PhD, Schneider Children's Medical Center, Petach Tikva, Israel. It was published online on April 07, 2025, in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism.

The retrospective design of this study was a major limitation. Estradiol levels were not measured in all participants before or during the aromatase inhibitor treatment period, as routine testing was not mandated by institutional policy. Additionally, the relatively small sample size may have limited the generalizability of the findings.

This study did not receive any funding. The authors declared no conflicts of interest.

Higher ozone exposure in the first 2 years of life was associated with increased odds of developing asthma and wheeze at age 4-6 years, even in areas with relatively low ozone concentrations. The mean ozone concentration of 26.1 parts per billion (ppb) was linked to 12.3% current asthma and 15.8% current wheeze rates.

“Understanding the influence of postnatal O3 on the development of pediatric asthma is important as it represents the criteria air pollutant most commonly exceeded among US children,” the study authors wrote.

The study was led by Logan Dearborn, MPH, from the University of Washington in Seattle. It was published online on April 2 in JAMA Network Open.

No personal or indoor measurements of ozone levels were available. The study relied on caregiver reports. Some indoor factors were not measured, and differences between neighborhoods may not have been accounted for, which may have affected the results.

One of the study authors reported receiving grants from the Health Effects Institute outside the submitted work. No other disclosures were reported.

 April 17, 2025  

Like a creature from a science fiction movie, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) can be a shape-shifter. In a small number of cases, patients with CLL will develop lymphoma, a complication known as Richter transformation (RT).

“It's like having two cancers at once,” said Adam Kittai, MD, a CLL and RT specialist with Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York City.

The prospects are grim for patients with the condition, named after a New York City pathologist who first described it in 1928. Many will only live for a matter of months. That's in sharp contrast to the steadily increasing lifespans — thanks to the rise of chemoimmunotherapy — for patients who only have CLL.

Still, there's good news. Patients with CLL seem to be facing less risk for RT than in the past, and some with the condition may live for a median of 4-5 years. And more progress may be close at hand.

“With the recent advances and ongoing efforts in our understanding of the biology of the disease, both novel targets and better application of current agents will be a reality sooner rather than later,” predicted CLL and lymphoma specialist Paul Hampel, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

Here are questions and answers about RT, also known as Richter transformation and Richter syndrome.

“RT is an aggressive lymphoma that develops in a patient with RT, most commonly a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [DLBCL],” said CLL and lymphoma specialist Erin M. Parry, MD, PhD, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, in an interview. “In the majority of cases, around 80% or greater, the RT arises directly from a CLL cell, which we call clonally related RT. More rarely, it can actually be an unrelated, or separate, lymphoma.”

The transformation of one type of cancer into another isn't unusual, Parry said. “It can happen due to natural cancer evolution or in the presence of therapeutic selective pressures. In the hematologic malignancies, transformation to aggressive lymphoma is observed across the other indolent B-cell lymphoma entities.”

It depends on the patient population. “If you are a hematologist with only a handful of patients with CLL, odds are you may go years without seeing a case,” said Hampel in an interview. “On the other hand, if you are a hematologist with a large panel of patients with CLL, you are likely already well aware that Richter transformation remains an area of great unmet need.”

RT incidence appears to be falling. “We used to quote that the risk of RT was 10% per patient with CLL. However, new data shows that the incidence of RT appears to be decreasing. The risk of RT is likely 1%-5% for each CLL patient,” Kittai said in an interview. (Hampel led a study released at the 2023 American Society of Hematology annual conference that tracks rates of RT at the Mayo Clinic over time and found that rates were shrinking.)

However, Kittai believes the picture is complicated. “We might be delaying the appearance of Richter transformation with continuous therapies. I also think that chemotherapy might have driven Richter transformation by inducing mutations in CLL.”

“Various high-risk CLL disease features — IGHV stereotypy with subset #8, complex karyotype, TP53 disruption, NOTCH1 mutation — have been associated with increased risk of developing Richter transformation,” Hampel said. “CLL-directed treatment, specifically with chemotherapy, is also associated with increased risk.”

A 2022 report on CLL by the European Research Initiative noted that researchers have variously linked IGHV stereotypy with subset #8 to a 40% risk for RT in CLL and a 10-fold increase in risk. Hampel also noted that RT mostly occurs in patients previously treated for CLL, but it can be detected in newly diagnosed patients too.

“Patients often present with B symptoms (fevers, drenching night sweats, significant and unintentional weight loss), rapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly, and fatigue/clinical deterioration,” Hampel said. These symptoms “typically occur at a much quicker tempo than typical for an even aggressive CLL presentation.”

He added that “worsening cytopenias can also be a presentation if the disease is presenting with significant marrow involvement.”

As Parry noted, “Most commonly, RT displays diffuse large B-cell lymphoma histology, but it can also more rarely be a Hodgkin lymphoma or other types of lymphoma. There are also other entities that can mimic RT, including proliferative CLL, CLL disease flare following the temporary cessation of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, or even infection and other secondary malignancies.”

As a result, “biopsy is absolutely essential to diagnosis,” she said. “Imaging, clinical suspicion, or both are not sufficient. It is very important to obtain an adequate sample of tissue from biopsy sampling to be reviewed by an expert hematopathologist to make the correct diagnosis. A PET scan is useful as a guide the best location to biopsy.”

Hampel cautioned colleagues to be wary of diagnosing RT during an interruption in Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. “This may represent a disease flare phenomenon rather than true Richter transformation. In this event, the histopathology may appear the same, but the clinical course will differ in that simply restarting the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor leads to resolution of lymphadenopathy and clinical symptoms.”

In cases of DLBCL that are clonally related to the patient's CLL, Hampel said first-line treatment options include R-CHOP (with or without a targeted agent), combination therapy with targeted agents (Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor and BCL-2 inhibitors) and anti–programmed cell death protein 1 or anti–programmed death-ligand 1 antibodies, and monotherapy with pirtobrutinib (Jaypirca).

Unfortunately, Hampel said, “We lack any Richter transformation–specific approvals or a true standard of care, given the poor efficacy seen with R-CHOP or intensive chemotherapy regimens.”

He added that “in fit patients, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation consolidation remains the best chance for long-term durable remission,” he said. “Otherwise, most patients will experience disease relapse even with initial response. Besides alternative first-line choices, CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy and CD20 × CD3 bispecific antibodies are options for relapsed disease.”

As for patients whose DLBCL is not clonally unrelated, he said, “Then treatment should be as in de novo DLBCL.”

Hampel added that “radiation therapy is a helpful adjunct, particularly when a specific site of bulky disease is present, and bridging is required prior to CAR T-cell therapy.”

“The prognosis remains dismal with most patients,” Hampel said. “A lack of durable remissions with multi-agent, anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens typically used to treat patients with de novo DLBCL underlies this poor prognosis. Similarly, the targeted agents that have dramatically shifted the treatment paradigm in CLL have had a more incremental impact thus far in the management of Richter transformation.”

But prognoses seem to be improving somewhat. Kittai highlighted his own research into RT in the era of novel therapy therapies, published in a 2025 study, that suggests overall survival (OS) is rising. “Previous studies showed the median OS of RT is less than 12 months, and we have now seen that it is more than 12 months,” he said. “This is exciting news for patients with RT and provides hope that what we are doing might be making a difference.” (The study examined patients who hadn't previously been treated with chemoimmunotherapy.)

Kittai added that patients with RT that isn't clonally related to their CLL and those who haven't had previous treatment for CLL have a median OS of 4-5 years.

“We are all very excited about the emergence of immune-based therapies in RT, as these work differently than chemotherapy and look promising in limited early data,” Parry said. “There are now studies investigating bispecific antibody therapies in RT, often in combination with CLL-directed targeted therapies, chemotherapy, or other lymphoma treatments. In addition, trials are investigating how we can make CAR T cells work even better in relapsed or refractory RT.”

For his part, Kittai highlighted two recent studies combining immunotherapy with targeted agents that “look very promising, with long-term responses.” One study examined zanubrutinib plus tislelizumab, which Kittai noted is currently listed as a treatment option in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The other study looked at atezolizumab plus venetoclax plus obinutuzumab.

“I am also excited to see bispecific antibodies being studied in RT and CAR T-cell therapies in combination with targeted agents,” Kittai added. “We recently performed a retrospective study showing long-term remissions for patients with RT treated with CAR T that was compelling and supports its use.”

Parry disclosed relationships with the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, American Society of Hematology, CLL Global Research Foundation, and Lymphoma Research Foundation.

Hampel reported ties between his institution and AbbVie, AstraZeneca, and BeiGene.

Kittai disclosed relationships with AbbVie and BeiGene and an American Society of Clinical Oncology Career Development award.

When it comes to cardiovascular health and shift work, when you eat may be as important as what you eat.

People who work night shift are known to be at risk for coronary heart disease and other potentially serious medical conditions. A new study, by researchers from Mass General Brigham in Boston, found restricting meals to the daytime could help avoid such problems.

“One way to understand our finding is that our body's internal clock is exquisitely organized to optimally coordinate virtually all aspects of our physiology with predictable cycling demands of the day and night,” said Frank A.J.L. Scheer, PhD, a professor of medicine and director of the Medical Chronobiology Program at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston.

Most people maintain the standard, synchronized cycle of sleeping and waking up, engaging in activity and resting, as well as eating and fasting, all in time with the rising and setting of the sun. “If we eat when our circadian system is supporting sleep, rest, and fasting, our organ systems are ill-equipped to cope with that,” Scheer said. “This is most obvious for metabolic processes such as blood sugar regulation but holds true for cardiovascular function as well.”

For the new study, published in Nature Communications, Scheer and his colleagues tracked 19 healthy men and women (age, 22-30 years) in a 2-week in-patient experiment.

To ensure simulated night work was the only outside influence on the participants' sleep cycle, Scheer and his colleagues imposed stringent restrictions on their behavior.

Participants had no access to windows, watches, or electronic devices that could clue their body clocks to the real time. They stayed awake for 32 hours in a dimly lit environment, eating identical snacks every hour. Afterward they engaged in simulated night work and were assigned to eat during the nighttime or only during the daytime.

The participants were then introduced to another routine to test the aftereffects of the simulated night work.

The primary outcomes were the percentage of consecutive heartbeat intervals > 50 ms (pNN50), the root mean square of successive heartbeat differences (RMSSD), and low/high cardiac frequency (LF/HF) ratio (< 60 beats/min and > 100 beats/min). The secondary outcome was blood concentrations of prothrombotic factor plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1).

Meal timing significantly modified the effect of simulated night work on cardiac vagal modulation and PAI-1 (P = .001). For those whose timing of meals was manipulated, pNN50 fell by 25.7% (P = .008) and RMSSD by 14.3% (P = .02). Meanwhile, this group experienced an increase in LF/HF ratio by 5.5% (P = .04) and PAI-1 by 23.9% (P = .04).

Nighttime meals also modified the effect of simulated shift work on blood pressure (P < .05), which dropped between 6% and 8% (P < .01).

“We hypothesized that maintaining the time of eating synchronized with the circadian system may alleviate the adverse effects of simulated night work on cardiovascular risk factors,” Scheer said. “We were amazed that meal timing could mitigate adverse effects even though sleep was still mistimed.”

Scheer and his team hope next to investigate the effects of meal timing in a more realistic simulation of a night shift. “These follow-up studies will help in the development of evidence-based countermeasures using food timing to improve cardiovascular health in shift workers and other populations with irregular behavioral rhythms,” he said.

 April 17, 2025  

A new systematic review has identified 17 modifiable risk factors shared by at least two of three major age-related brain disorders — stroke, dementia, and late-life depression (LLD) — in new findings that may help reduce the significant burden of these three common conditions.

These conditions are leading contributors to disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and share common vascular and small vessel pathologies. Epidemiological studies have documented overlapping risk factors, but the extent to which each factor influences the incidence and burden of these disorders remains unclear.

“Dementia, stroke, and late-life depression are connected and intertwined, so if you develop one of them, there's a substantial chance you may develop another one in the future,” first author Jasper Senff, MD, postdoctoral fellow at the Singh Lab at the Brain Care Labs, Somerville, Massachusetts, said in a release.

“Our study identified 17 modifiable risk factors shared between stroke, dementia, and/or late-life depression, emphasizing that there are many different individual steps individual can take to lower their risks for these age-related brain diseases,” added principal investigator Sanjula Singh, MD, PhD, MSc, Brain Care Labs at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.

The study was published online on April 3 in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.

Previous research suggests effective control of modifiable risk factors could prevent or delay up to 60% of strokes, 40% of dementia cases, and 35% of LLD cases, potentially extending disease onset to the natural limits of the human lifespan.

In addition, although prior studies have identified considerable overlap in modifiable risk factors for stroke, dementia, and LLD, their relative contribution to a combined outcome across these age-related brain disorders remains unclear.

The goal of the study was to systematically identify shared risk factors across stroke, dementia, and LLD and quantify the relative impact of each modifiable risk factor on a composite outcome.

The researchers conducted a systematic review of studies published between January 2000 and September 2023, drawing from PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo. They focused on meta-analyses reporting effect sizes of modifiable risk factors on the incidence of stroke, dementia, and LLD.

The target population was all adults aged 18 years or older regardless of demographic, genetic, or environmental differences, without a previous diagnosis of primary stroke, dementia, or LLD.

The search identified 182 meta-analyses that met inclusion criteria; of these, 59 were selected to calculate DALY-weighted risk estimates for a composite outcome.

Seventeen modifiable risk factors shared by at least two of the diseases were identified, namely, alcohol use (−34), blood pressure level (130), body mass index (70), fasting plasma glucose level (94), total cholesterol level (22), leisure time cognitive activity (−91), depressive symptoms (57), diet (51), hearing loss (60), kidney function (101), pain (42), physical activity (−56), purpose in life (−50), sleep (76), smoking (91), social engagement (53), and stress (55).

Hypertension ≥ 140/90 mm Hg in midlife (relative risk [RR], 2.03; 95% CI, 1.67-2.38), severe kidney disease characterized by an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.48-2.00), and high fasting blood glucose level > 126 mg/dL (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.57-1.76) had the strongest relative impact on incidence and burden of stroke, dementia, and LLD.

In contrast, leisure time cognitive activity (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.90) and high physical activity (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.69-0.79) showed the highest protective effects.

However, the researchers cautioned that these associations may reflect reverse causality, as individuals with brain disease may be less able to engage in physical and cognitive leisure activities.

Long sleep duration (> 8 hours) was another significant risk factor in the study, although the investigators suggested this particular finding may be associated with underlying comorbidities (obesity, hypertension, and diabetes), reverse causality, or confounding by aging.

Cholesterol levels had minimal impact on the three brain conditions; even low-density lipoprotein levels showed no significant effect. One possible explanation, the authors noted, is that the study did not distinguish between stroke subtypes, which is important since cholesterol's impact differs between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.

The research goal is for these findings to serve as an “empirical foundation” for developing tools that help prevent and reduce risk for age-related brain disease.

The researchers used their findings to update the McCance Brain Care Score, a tool developed by Mass General Brigham, Boston, researchers to help prevent the onset of brain disease. Currently, the tool evaluates 12 modifiable physical, lifestyle, and social factors, supporting patients in prioritizing behaviors that reduce risk for brain diseases.

The investigators noted that existing methods for assessing modifiable risk factors “lack a holistic approach that addresses the shared underlying pathophysiology.” They hope these findings will support the development of more integrated strategies for risk assessment and prevention.

“Future research can use our findings as an empirical foundation for building such tools. Tools incorporating the effect sizes obtained in this study could use the comprehensive overview of the impact of individual risk factors based on the included recent meta-analyses, offering both practitioners and patients an evidence-based summary on which guidelines for targeted risk factor modification and potential preventive measures could be based,” they wrote.

 April 17, 2025  

SAN DIEGO — Intravenous (IV) administration of the anticonvulsant fosphenytoin is effective as a fast-acting treatment for acute trigeminal neuralgia (TN) exacerbation, new research suggested.

TN is a severe, disabling facial pain disorder that has often been described as feeling like “an electric shock.”

In a small phase 3 trial of patients with acute TN, the group randomly assigned to receive IV fosphenytoin had a significantly greater reduction in pain scores 2 hours after administration than the placebo group, meeting the primary endpoint.

Those receiving the active drug also had significantly fewer TN attacks between treatment and a maintenance dose the following day.

Fosphenytoin “allows patients to remain comfortable while awaiting definitive treatments,” lead investigator Shusaku Noro, MD, chief of the Department of Neurosurgery and director of the Microvascular Decompression (MVD) Center at Nakamura Memorial Hospital, Sapporo, Japan, told Medscape Medical News.

In addition, if a patient experiences a sudden severe attack because of medication discontinuation or interruption, this agent “offers rapid relief, allowing them to resume regular oral medications and return to their daily lives swiftly,” Noro said.

“As a neurosurgeon, seeing a patient's smile after successful surgery is incredibly rewarding, but witnessing immediate relief provided by fosphenytoin brings equal joy,” he added.

The findings were presented on April 7 at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2025 Annual Meeting.

TN consists of sudden unilateral pain along trigeminal nerve branches. For typical TN, antiepileptic medications, especially carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, are usually recommended as first-line treatment.

However, some patients experience persistent pain attacks up to days later even after mono or combined therapy with oral medications — and there are currently no established treatments for these acute exacerbations of TN outside of surgical procedures, Noro noted.

Although MVD or other surgical treatments are effective, they often cannot be provided immediately, especially during weekends or holidays. So a need remains for a fast-acting option for acute exacerbations, Noro noted.

“This topic is very close to my heart. Many patients around the world are still suffering without access to rapid relief for trigeminal neuralgia attacks,” he said.

Fosphenytoin is marketed in Japan (as Fostoin, Nobelpharma) and in several other countries including the United States to treat epilepsy. Noro reported that his center has used the agent off-label for patients with exacerbation of TN who could not receive procedures such as MVD.

In January, results from an observational study from him and his colleagues were published in Frontiers in Neurology. Results showed that in 41 patients with acute TN, the mean numerical rating scale (NRS) score dropped significantly from 9.85 at baseline to 0.69 (P < .001) 2 hours after administration of IV fosphenytoin 2014 and remained significant at 12 and 24 hours afterwards.

Using that study as a foundation, the current phase 3 IFT study was created and conducted across five medical centers in Japan. It included 21 adult patients with acute TN who had a score of at least 5 on the NRS at baseline (mean score, 7). The scale ranges from 0, signifying no pain, to 10, signifying “most severe pain experienced.”

Those randomly assigned to receive active treatment (n = 11; mean age, 63.2 years; 55% women) were administered 18 mg/kg of fosphenytoin on day 1, which was lowered to 7.5 mg/kg once daily on days 2-5. The other group received matching placebo (n = 10; mean age, 67.4 years; 70% women).

The primary outcome was change in baseline NRS score 2 hours after initial dose. Results showed that score improvement was significantly greater in the active drug group than in the placebo group (0.8 vs 4.6; least square mean difference, −6.1 vs −2.4; P = .008).

In addition, the reduction in the number of TN attacks from initial dose to right before the first maintenance dose on the following day were significantly lower for those receiving the active drug (2.5 vs 16.1; P = .04).

The most common adverse events were somnolence (affecting five members of the fosphenytoin group and one member of the placebo group), decreased blood pressure (affecting two members of each group), and nausea (affecting two and one member, respectively).

These events resolved quickly and the active treatment was “generally well tolerated,” Noro reported. There were no deaths reported in either group.

The investigators noted that most countries currently lack approved medications specifically designed for the rapid relief of TN pain.

“Having a quick pain-relieving effect, with good tolerability on acute TN exacerbations, [IV fosphenytoin] may provide a new treatment for such patients suffering difficult pain control with oral drugs in emergencies and patients awaiting microvascular decompression, gamma knife radiosurgery, or nerve block treatment,” they wrote.

Noro said the most important message he wants to convey to clinicians worldwide is that rapid, effective treatment for acute TN attacks does exist.

“Knowledge truly can save lives and ease suffering. Too many patients globally endure unbearable pain, losing hope due to the lack of immediately available, effective treatment options,” he said.

“Through this research, I want to emphasize that clinicians no longer need to watch helplessly — there is something they can do, right now, to alleviate their patients' severe pain,” Noro added.

Commenting for Medscape Medical News, Amaal Starling, MD, associate professor of neurology at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, Phoenix, and program director of the Headache Medicine Fellowship Program at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, Minnesota, agreed with the investigators that currently available treatment options for acute TN may not be effective or may be poorly tolerated for a cohort of patients.

She noted that although IV fosphenytoin has been described as effective in the literature, there had been no previously conducted randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to determine its efficacy.

The current study is a “novel” RCT showing “significant reduction in pain and attacks” in the active treatment group vs in the placebo group — at least over the short term, said Starling, who was not involved with the research.

She added that although it showed a robust effect, the study only evaluated short-term efficacy and had a small sample size, so the main findings do not provide evidence for a treatment effect beyond the first 24 hours after the first infusion.

Still, based on the study results and her own experience, “I do think this is generalizable to patients in the US with trigeminal neuralgia,” she said.

“Larger, more robust studies are need for label expansion, but in the absence of FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] approval, this study suggests that fosphenytoin is an effective off-label therapy for acute exacerbations of trigeminal neuralgia — likely as a bridging therapy to oral treatment efficacy or surgical intervention,” Starling said.

Noro reported receiving personal compensation for serving as a consultant for Nobelpharma. Starling reported receiving consulting fees from numerous pharmaceutical companies, but none is relevant to this study.

In patients with metastatic breast cancer (BC), the prevalence of brain metastases increased with each treatment line, rising the most among patients with hormone receptor (HR)–negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive disease and the least among those with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease.

“Our findings further demonstrate that brain metastases are frequent in patients with [HR-negative, HER2-positive metastatic BC] and often occur early in the development of the disease,” the authors reported. “Moreover, these findings emphasize the importance of ongoing screening clinical trials (particularly at critical timepoints such as transitions between treatment lines) and have significant clinical implications for the design of screening and prevention trials. Tailored surveillance strategies are warranted” as well.

The study, led by Sarah L. Sammons, MD, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, was published online in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

This study used de-identified data from an electronic health record, which may have inherent limitations in data completeness and standardization.

The study was supported by F. Hoffmann-La Roche that provided funding for access to the de-identified database. Several authors reported receiving research funding from and having other ties with various pharmaceutical and other organizations.

Researchers at UCL have tested a new scoring system to measure the risk of stroke in patients with narrowed arteries due to atherosclerosis, which could prevent unnecessary surgeries and stents.

Atherosclerosis is a condition where the blood vessels become narrowed and hardened due to the buildup of plaque, including in the carotid arteries, which carry blood from the heart to the brain. Atherosclerosis can lead to serious health problems like strokes and heart attacks.

Atherosclerosis is a very common condition that can affect anyone, particularly those over the age of 65, smokers and people with a high cholesterol, hypertension or family history of heart or circulatory diseases. It is estimated that atherosclerosis affecting the carotid artery causes up to 20% of strokes.

Currently, many patients undergo surgery or stenting to prevent strokes resulting from atherosclerosis. However, these procedures also carry risks of causing strokes and other serious complications at the time of the intervention.

In the new study, published in The Lancet Neurology and in collaboration with colleagues at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre and the University of Basel, researchers found that using the Carotid Artery Risk (CAR) scoring system can offer a safer alternative, by identifying patients who can be effectively treated with a combination of medications and lifestyle changes tailored to their individual risk factors (otherwise known as optimised medical therapy).

The CAR system was developed by researchers at UCL and the University of Oxford.

Senior author, Emeritus Professor Martin Brown (UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology), said: ""While further follow-up and additional trials are needed to confirm these findings, we recommend using the CAR score to identify patients with carotid narrowing who can be managed with optimised medical therapy alone.

""This approach emphasises personal assessment and intensive treatment of vascular risk factors, potentially sparing many patients from the discomfort and risks of carotid surgery or stenting.

""Additionally, this method could lead to substantial cost savings for health services.""

The new research paper, which was partly funded by the Stroke Association, evaluated the effectiveness of the CAR score by testing it in a randomised clinical trial involving 428 patients across 30 centres in the UK, Europe and Canada.

All patients involved in the trial were over the age of 18 and had a significant narrowing of their carotid arteries, which was picked up before it had caused symptoms or after it had caused a minor stroke.

Those with symptoms were selected using their CAR score – which takes into account factors such as the percentage of narrowing in the carotid artery and medical history – to determine who had a low to intermediate risk of stroke over the next five years and could be included in the trial. Patients with a high score were not suitable for the trial and were recommended immediate surgery or stenting.

The patients in the trial were then divided into two groups, with one group receiving optimised medical therapy alone, and the other group receiving both optimised medical therapy and additional carotid surgery or stenting.

Optimized medical therapy included a low cholesterol diet, target-adjusted cholesterol-lowering medication, treatment to lower blood pressure, antithrombotic therapy (a treatment that helps prevent blood clots from forming or growing), and regular checks to adjust the medication as necessary.

The patients were monitored through regular visits, telephone calls, and brain scans to detect strokes.

The researchers found that, over the first two years, patients in the trial who were treated with optimised medical therapy alone had very low rates of recurrent strokes and heart attacks. Those who underwent additional surgery or stenting did not experience significant benefits, considering the associated risks of these procedures.

Atherosclerosis is a common condition, and a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Whilst medical therapy is the first line of treatment, many of those who have medical therapy then need surgery or stenting which can lead to complications including an increased risk of stroke, and other unpleasant side effects. 

The CAR risk score offers the opportunity to take away the downsides of surgery and stenting by using medical therapy alone as well as combining medical therapy with surgery. The Stroke Association is pleased to have funded this trial which indicates that some people with atherosclerosis could see the same benefits from medication and lifestyle changes that previously required surgery. 

The medical therapies used to reduce the risk of stroke from atherosclerosis work by treating risk factors for stroke, including high cholesterol and raised blood pressure, which we are putting at the heart of our recommendations for the Government's 10 Year Health Plan.

Whilst we welcome the results of this study, we note the need for more research to confirm or refute these findings, so we look forward to further developments.""

A new research paper was published in Aging (Aging-US) Volume 17, Issue 3, on March 12, 2025, titled ""DNA methylation entropy is a biomarker for aging.""

Researchers Jonathan Chan, Liudmilla Rubbi, and Matteo Pellegrini from the University of California, Los Angeles, led a study that discovered a new way to measure changes in DNA that can help predict a person's age. This method focuses on how random certain chemical tags on DNA become over time. The team compared this new measurement, called methylation entropy, to existing methods and found it performed just as well-or even better. These findings support the idea that changes in our epigenetic information are closely linked to aging and could offer new tools for studying age-related diseases.

The study focused on DNA methylation, a process where chemical marks are added to DNA and help control which genes are turned on or off. Scientists have traditionally measured average methylation levels to estimate biological age using ""epigenetic clocks."" This study, however, takes a different approach. The researchers used buccal swabs (cells from inside the cheek) from 100 individuals between ages 7 and 84 and applied targeted bisulfite sequencing techniques to measure methylation entropy across 3,000 regions of the genome.

Entropy in this context reflects how disordered or varied the methylation patterns are at certain sites on the DNA. The researchers discovered that as people age, the entropy of methylation at many locations changes in a reproducible way. Sometimes it increases, reflecting more random patterns, and sometimes it decreases, showing more uniformity. These shifts are not always tied to how much methylation is happening, which suggests entropy provides new information beyond what traditional methods can offer.

To test how well this new metric could predict age, the team used both statistical and machine learning models. They found that methylation entropy predicted age as accurately as traditional methods, and the best results came from combining entropy with other measurements like average methylation and a method called CHALM. These combined models were able to estimate age with an average error of just five years.

""[…] methylation entropy is measuring different properties of a locus compared to mean methylation and CHALM, and that loci can become both more or less disordered with age, independently of whether the methylation is increasing or decreasing with age.""

This research supports the growing theory that aging is partly caused by a gradual loss of epigenetic information-the biological ""instructions"" that help keep our cells working properly. This insight also connects with recent studies suggesting that restoring this lost information might reverse some signs of aging. While more research is needed to study methylation entropy in other tissues, this work points to a more precise and powerful way to measure biological aging, which could influence the future of aging-related treatments and therapies.

One reason why our livers excel at clearing waste from our blood system is that the organ functions according to three key ""zones"" that perform specific major tasks. So, if scientists hope to create self-growing patches of liver organoid tissue that could help repair damaged organs, it's important that the lab-grown tissue faithfully reproduce such zones.

In a groundbreaking paper published April 16, 2025, in the prestigious journal Nature, a team of organoid medicine experts at Cincinnati Children's reports achieving just such a milestone – made from human stem cells. When these humanized organoids were transplanted into rodents whose own liver-bile duct system had been disconnected, the improved organoids nearly doubled the rodents' survival rate.

The research community has long needed a better model for studying human liver biology and disease, because there are outstanding hepatocyte diversity and associated functional orchestrations in the human liver that do not exist in rodents. This new system paves the way for studying, and eventually treating, a wide range of otherwise fatal liver disorders.""

Takanori Takebe, MD, PhD, study's corresponding author

Takebe is Director for Commercial Innovation at Cincinnati Children's Center for Stem Cell and Organoid Medicine (CuSTOM). He has been studying methods for growing liver organoids for over 13 years. Breakthroughs from his lab include producing the first connected set of three organoids grown together, a novel way to mass produce liver organoids for research purposes, and gene-engineered liver organoids that may someday help treat severe jaundice.

In the short term, these multi-zonal liver organoids will help scientists shed new light on diseases including diabetes, drug-induced liver injury, alcohol-related liver disease, and viral hepatitis. In turn, such work could accelerate drug development and other approaches to restore liver health.

Longer-term, for people on waiting lists for liver transplantation, this study moves the medical community one step closer to ""growing"" a patient's own liver replacement tissue instead of relying on organ donation.

Currently, more than 9,000 Americans are registered on waiting lists to receive a liver transplant, according to the federal Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. Every year, an estimated 2,000 people die waiting lists, while far more people never become eligible. 

""This discovery is exciting for multiple reasons,"" says Aaron Zorn, PhD, Co-Director of CuSTOM. ""At one level, it shows that we have taken a significant step forward at growing liver tissue in the lab that accurately mimic human liver function. While human liver organoid transplantation remains at least several years away, in the lab, these special tissues may help us find ways to prevent people from ever needing a liver transplant.""

The new study lays out numerous details of how the new organoids were developed, and how they function – including genetic information down to the single-cell level. But even more research is needed to fully understand how the organoids match up with natural human organ development.

Scientists also are working to develop chemical methods rather than genetic editing to trigger zonal development in the new organoids. This would make it more practical to study disease development and drug responses at a personal level.

In the near-term, however, using these new liver organoids in lab settings to more accurately predict drug metabolism and toxicity may be the biggest medical impact that this innovation will have, Zorn says.

Cincinnati Children's co-authors include Hasan Al Reza, MS, Connie Santangelo, MS, Abid Al Reza, PhD, Kentaro Iwasawa, MD, PhD, Kathryn Glaser, MS, Alexander Bondoc, MD, and Jonathan Merola, MD, PhD.

This study was supported by members of several shared facilities at Cincinnati Children's: the Confocal Imaging Core, Pathology Research Core, Pluripotent Stem Cell Facility, Transgenic Animal and Genome Editing Core, Veterinary Services Facility, and Single Cell Genomics Core.

Funding sources for this work include a Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation CURE grant, a Falk Transformational Award, an NIH Director's New Innovator Award (DP2 DK128799-01), NIH grant (R01DK135478), grants from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, and support from the Takeda Science Foundation and the Mitsubishi Foundation.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Internal appetite signals vary with socioeconomic background","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250416/Internal-appetite-signals-vary-with-socioeconomic-background.aspx","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 03:07:00 GMT","

Published in the journal Food Quality and Preference, the research highlights how physiological signals, particularly those transmitted via the vagus nerve, interact with socio-economic factors to shape dietary behavior. 

The study involved 96 students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds who participated in a chocolate tasting session. 

In a controlled laboratory setting, each participant was presented with a plate containing 70 milk chocolate pieces and invited to sample and rate them at their leisure. 

Researchers measured each student's heart rate variability (HRV) as a proxy for the activity of the vagus nerve – a part of the nervous system that regulates appetite and digestion. 

The study's lead author, Professor Mario Weick of Durham University's Department of Psychology, explained: ""The findings suggest that while the vagus nerve plays a key role in transmitting signals between the gut and the brain, the extent to which these signals guide eating behavior can vary with one's socio-economic status. 

""Our research indicates that internal signals may be more closely aligned with eating behavior in individuals from higher socio-economic backgrounds. 

""In contrast, those from lower socio-economic groups appear to show a weaker link between these physiological signals and their food consumption."" 

The research builds on longstanding theories regarding the impact of socio-economic factors on health and dietary habits. 

Traditionally, disparities in diet have been attributed to differences in food access and external factors. 

However, this study shifts the focus towards internal regulatory processes. 

The data revealed that participants from more advantaged backgrounds consumed more or less chocolate depending on their vagal tone, which can signal both hunger and satiety. 

Conversely, in individuals from less advantaged backgrounds, this physiological regulation was not as evident. 

Our study does not support the idea that individuals from lower socio-economic groups eat more or are inherently more impulsive. 

Rather, it highlights that the internal regulation of eating - how our bodies naturally signal when to eat and when to stop - may function differently depending on our socio-economic backgrounds. 

This could have important implications for understanding broader health inequalities."" 

Professor Milica Vasiljevic, study's co-author, Durham University  

While the research focused specifically on chocolate consumption as a model for eating behavior, the implications may extend to other types of food and dietary patterns. 

Future research is needed to explore whether similar patterns are observed across different populations and with other food categories. 

This work marks a significant step forward in disentangling the complex relationship between socio-economic status, physiological regulation, and dietary habits. 

By bringing attention to the role of internal bodily signals in shaping eating behavior, the research offers new perspectives for developing public health strategies that address dietary inequalities and associated long-term health outcomes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Research reveals urgent need for updated vision screening for older drivers","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250417/Research-reveals-urgent-need-for-updated-vision-screening-for-older-drivers.aspx","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 05:06:00 GMT","

Research indicates an urgent need for updated vision screening policies and safer infrastructure to protect aging drivers.

Older drivers with vision impairment are dramatically more likely to stop driving or avoid challenging road conditions—with severe cases four times more likely to give up driving altogether, a national University of Michigan study finds.

Driving is essential for the mobility, independence and overall well-being of older adults. Unlike previous generations, today's older adults are driving longer, taking more trips and spending more time on the road. However, vision-related issues can complicate driving.

Based on objective vision testing and nationally representative data, the research highlights a critical gap in road safety policies, as America's aging population drives more miles than ever before.

Among Americans aged 65 and older, 14% live with either distance vision impairment or contrast sensitivity issues. But the real shock comes in how these conditions reshape driving habits: More than 25% of older drivers with vision impairment stop driving within just one year—compared to only 12% of their peers with normal vision.

Those with moderate-to-severe distance vision impairment face the steepest consequences, becoming four times more likely to cease driving entirely and up to 4.5 times more likely to avoid situations like night driving or busy highways.

What we're seeing is a cascade effect. As vision worsens, drivers self-regulate—first avoiding complex routes, then quitting altogether. But with driving so tied to independence, these decisions often come too late, after near-misses or accidents.”

Shu Xu, postdoctoral fellow, U-M Institute for Social Research

The study challenges long-standing assumptions about vision and driving safety. While contrast sensitivity (the ability to distinguish objects against similar backgrounds) was previously considered the best predictor of driving risk, the data reveals that distance acuity—particularly when combined with contrast issues—is significantly more consequential.

“This isn't about which test is better,” said Joshua Ehrlich, ISR research associate professor and associate professor of ophthalmology and visual sciences. “It's about recognizing that many older adults have multiple overlapping vision deficits. Relying solely on standard eye charts at the DMV is like only checking one symptom of a disease.”

For families, the message is clear: Healthy vision is a key part of driving and subtle changes, like struggling with glare or missing exit signs, may indicate potential issues.

On the policy front, researchers suggest key reforms: “vision-aware” road designs (e.g., high-contrast signage) and driver rehabilitation programs to help individuals adjust to declining sight.

“We're failing older drivers by using 20th-century tests for 21st-century longevity,” Xu said. “A person who can't see a street sign at dusk shouldn't have their license revoked—we should improve the visibility of street signs.”

Researchers said this work makes a key contribution to the fields of transportation, vision and aging by addressing significant gaps in the existing literature with strong, nationally representative data.

“Additionally, we incorporate multiple objective vision tests, including both distance visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, making this the first nationally representative study to examine how concurrent vision impairments influence driving cessation and avoidance, offering a more comprehensive perspective,” Xu said.

The group is currently examining transportation alternatives for older adults with vision impairments, with initial data indicating that most lack access to usable transit options.

“When driving stops, isolation often begins,” Xu said. “We need systems that don't make people choose between safety and survival.”

Asthma symptoms tend to ebb and flow throughout the day, often worsening overnight. This pattern suggests that aligning asthma medication with the body's natural rhythm—an approach known as chronotherapy—could improve disease control by enhancing medication effectiveness.

A recent study published in BMJ Journals compared three different dosing schedules across 24 hours to identify the most effective regimen for managing asthma.

​​​​​​​Study: The impact of dosage timing for inhaled corticosteroids in asthma: a randomised three-way crossover trial. Image Credit: Pixel-Shot/Shutterstock.com

Asthma affected over 260 million people globally in 2019 and was responsible for 455,000 deaths. Notably, symptoms worsen overnight in approximately 75% of individuals with asthma, and 80% of fatal episodes occur during the night.

This trend is attributed to increased airway obstruction and inflammation, along with heightened airway hyper-responsiveness during nighttime hours.

Patients who experience pronounced day-to-night symptom fluctuations and significant drops in nighttime lung function are more likely to have severe, hard-to-control asthma—and face a higher risk of mortality.

Adding to this, previous research has shown that glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity to steroids decreases at night, with peak responsiveness occurring around 4 pm and the lowest sensitivity around 4 am, as reported by the authors of this new study.

While earlier chronotherapy studies have largely focused on daytime lung function, results have been mixed. This new research aimed to more comprehensively assess how the timing of inhaled corticosteroids affects asthma control over a full 24-hour period—using both lung function measurements and biological markers.

The study involved 21 participants with mild to moderate asthma who shared similar sleep-wake schedules. Baseline and post-treatment assessments included lung function tests and levels of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), a marker of airway inflammation. Researchers also measured serum cortisol to evaluate adrenal suppression.

This was a three-arm crossover trial using beclometasone dipropionate, delivered in varying dosing regimens:

Each treatment phase lasted 28 days, with a two-week washout period between regimens. Lung function tests and biomarker measurements were conducted before and after each arm.

The researchers also employed modeling techniques to simulate 24-hour variations in asthma pathophysiology, allowing them to estimate the amplitude of these fluctuations more precisely.

All three regimens improved asthma control and reduced airway inflammation. However, the OD-PM (afternoon) regimen stood out.

These results support earlier studies suggesting that mid-afternoon is the optimal time for administering inhaled or oral glucocorticoids. This study adds a new layer by showing both physiological and immunological improvements over a full day with an afternoon dosing schedule.

Another takeaway: lung function and biomarker levels can vary significantly over 24 hours, so timing should be considered when interpreting test results.

While inhaled corticosteroids provide benefits regardless of timing, this study suggests that a single 4 pm dose of beclometasone dipropionate may offer superior control of nighttime asthma symptoms and inflammation—without increasing side effects or suppressing adrenal function.

These findings make a strong case for adjusting asthma treatment to fit the body's natural rhythm. Future research should confirm these results in larger populations and determine which patients stand to benefit most from this chronotherapy approach.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Many stroke patients with carotid artery narrowing may avoid surgery, research shows","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250416/Many-stroke-patients-with-carotid-artery-narrowing-may-avoid-surgery-research-shows.aspx","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 03:02:00 GMT","

European research led by University College London (UCL), together with Amsterdam UMC and the University of Basel shows that a significant proportion of patients who suffer a stroke due to carotid artery narrowing can be treated with medication only. A risky carotid artery operation, currently still the standard treatment for many patients, may then no longer be necessary for this group of patients. This research, published today in the Lancet Neurology, may lead to the global guidelines for the treatment of these patients being adjusted.

In the Netherlands, about 2,000 people with carotid artery stenosis are operated on every year after they have had a stroke. 30 years ago, large studies showed that an operation, in which a narrowing in the carotid artery is removed, reduced the risk of a new stroke. As a result, this became the international standardised treatment. Since then, the medications these patients receive alongside their surgery – such as blood thinners, medication for cholesterol and high blood pressure – have improved significantly. Researchers, including Amsterdam UMC neurologist Paul Nederkoorn, investigated whether routine carotid artery operations are still necessary in all patients. An international research group of neurologists, vascular surgeons, and radiologists together designed the ECST study to answer this question.

For the vast majority of these patients, in the Netherlands perhaps up to about 75 percent, medication alone is probably sufficient to reduce the risk of another stroke. It is a lot nicer for the patient not to have to have surgery and it saves a lot of healthcare costs. We are now going to work closely with the vascular surgeons to see how we can best fit these results into the current protocols.""

Paul Nederkoorn, Amsterdam UMC neurologist

Between 2012 and 2019, the researchers examined a group of 429 patients, spread over 30 centers in Europe and Canada. All patients had a low or average chance of having another stroke within 2 years of their initial treatment. Patients with a high risk of another stroke were not included in this study, because it was uncertain beforehand whether medication alone could be equally effective for them.

Patients were divided into two groups. Half received only medication, and the other half also received standard surgery. Two years after the start of their treatment, the patients were monitored for a number of outcomes. The groups were compared on the basis of how often new strokes had occurred, how many patients had had a heart attack and in how many cases patients had had a stroke unnoticed or where there was a high risk of a new stroke due to accumulations in the carotid artery. This could be seen on the MRI scans that the participating patients received after 2 years. The two groups scored equally across all metrics, leading the researchers to conclude that the operation is not necessary for this specific patient group in addition to medication.

Senior author, Emeritus Professor at UCL Martin Brown, said: ""While further follow-up and additional trials are needed to confirm these findings, we recommend using the CAR score to identify patients with carotid narrowing who can be managed with optimised medical therapy alone.

""This approach emphasises personal assessment and intensive treatment of vascular risk factors, potentially sparing many patients from the discomfort and risks of carotid surgery or stenting.

""Additionally, this method could lead to substantial cost savings for health services.""

Follow-up research should show which patients have such a high risk of another stroke that they still do need surgery in addition to the medication. New techniques for detailed imaging of the atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery allow for the selection of particularly high-risk patients much more accurately than before. The researchers think that in the future this will be the group that may still have to undergo surgery. In this way, every patient with a stroke due to carotid artery narrowing can receive a tailor-made risk-based treatment. That saves many patients a major operation and lowers healthcare costs. The researchers expect that the national and international guidelines will soon be adjusted.

""At Amsterdam UMC, we are working together with the vascular surgeons and those low- and medium-risk patients are no longer operated on as standard,"" concludes Nederkoorn

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Metabolic syndrome found to increase risk of breast cancer recurrence and death","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250416/Metabolic-syndrome-found-to-increase-risk-of-breast-cancer-recurrence-and-death.aspx","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 02:58:00 GMT","

New research to be presented at this year's European Congress on Obesity (ECO 2025, Malaga, Spain, 11-14 May) and published in The Journal of Internal Medicine shows that, in survivors of breast cancer, having an unhealthy metabolic profile or so called 'metabolic syndrome' increases the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 69%, and subsequent breast cancer mortality by 83%. The study is by Dr Sixten Harborg, Department of Oncology, Aarhus University/Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. and Department of Nutrition, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, MA, USA, and colleagues.

Metabolic syndrome was characterized according to the American Heart Association, which includes the presence of three out of five abnormal findings among the risk factors: high blood pressure, high triglycerides (blood fats), low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or 'good' cholesterol, high fasting glucose (blood sugar), and central or abdominal obesity (a waist circumference of more than 35 inches for women).

Data were obtained from observational studies and randomized controlled trials that used survival statistics and reported survival ratios to investigate how the presence of metabolic syndrome at the time of breast cancer diagnosis is associated with survival. Study data from 42,135 breast cancer survivors were pooled using statistical modelling to assess the relationship between an unhealthy metabolic profile and survival of breast cancer. The pooled estimates revealed that breast cancer survivors who had metabolic syndrome at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis experienced a 69% increased risk of recurrence and an 83% increased risk of breast cancer mortality compared to breast cancer survivors without metabolic syndrome.

Breast cancer survivors with metabolic syndrome were found to be 57% more likely to experience a breast cancer-related event (recurrence, new cancer, or death) during follow-up than breast cancer survivors without metabolic syndrome.

Interestingly, the authors looked into potential differences in the association according to geographical location of the included studies origin continent and found that the association between poorer outcomes among breast cancer survivors with metabolic syndrome was consistent across Europe, North America and Asia.

The authors conclude: ""Among breast cancer survivors, metabolic syndrome was associated with poorer breast cancer outcomes. The findings of this study emphasise the importance of metabolic screening for breast cancer survivors. Future research should focus on assessing how control of blood fats, reversing diabetes, and making healthy lifestyle choices could decrease the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this population and ultimately enhance breast cancer survival.""

They add that the precise mechanisms through which metabolic syndrome heightens the risk of breast cancer and its recurrence remain unclear, but are believed to involve chronic inflammation and hormonal imbalances.

They say: ""One possible explanation posits that the excessive body fat associated with metabolic syndrome results in increased levels of circulating oestrogen, which may stimulate the growth of breast cancer cells. Additionally, adiposity may induce alterations in the tumour microenvironment that facilitate metastasis, or the spread of cancer. Chronic systemic inflammation, a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, may further contribute to tumour progression by promoting cancer cell survival and impairing immune surveillance. Although our study did not investigate the biological underpinnings of the observed associations, it is likely that multiple interacting mechanisms-primarily driven by obesity-induced molecular changes and chronic inflammation-underlie the link between metabolic syndrome and poor breast cancer outcomes.""

While ChatGPT-4 excels at multiple-choice medical exams, new research reveals its weaknesses in complex clinical decision-making, raising big questions about the future of AI-powered healthcare.

Study: Assessing ChatGPT 4.0's Capabilities in the United Kingdom Medical Licensing Examination (UKMLA): A Robust Categorical Analysis. Image Credit: Collagery / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers evaluated ChatGPT-4's capabilities on the United Kingdom Medical Licensing Assessment (UKMLA), highlighting both strengths and limitations across question formats and clinical domains.

Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to reshape healthcare and education. With the UKMLA soon becoming a standardized requirement for new doctors in the UK, determining whether AI models like ChatGPT-4 can meet clinical benchmarks is increasingly important. While AI shows promise, questions remain about its ability to replicate human reasoning, empathy, and contextual understanding in real-world care.

Distractors tripped up AI logic: In 8 cases, ChatGPT answered correctly without multiple-choice options but failed when presented with plausible wrong answers, exposing vulnerabilities to exam-style trick questions.

The researchers tested ChatGPT-4 on 191 multiple-choice questions from the Medical Schools Council's mock UKMLA exam. The questions spanned 24 clinical areas and were split across two 100-question papers. Nine image-based questions were excluded due to ChatGPT's inability to interpret images, which the authors note as a limitation.

Each question was tested with and without multiple-choice options. Questions were further categorized by reasoning complexity (single-step vs. multi-step) and clinical focus (diagnosis, management, pharmacology, etc.). Responses were labeled as accurate, indeterminate, or incorrect. Statistical analysis included chi-squared and t-tests.

Pharmacology answers lacked certainty: Nearly 35% of drug-related responses were marked “indeterminate” without answer prompts, reflecting struggles to confidently apply dosing or treatment protocols.

ChatGPT-4 demonstrated a broad knowledge base, especially in diagnostic tasks, and performed at or above the level expected of medical graduates in structured assessments. However, it struggled with contextual clinical reasoning, especially in open-ended or multi-step management scenarios. This suggests the model may support early-stage clinical assessments but lacks the nuance required for autonomous decision-making.

Limitations include a lack of training on UK-specific clinical guidelines, which may have influenced performance on specific UKMLA questions. Furthermore, ""hallucinations"", fluent but incorrect outputs, pose a risk in clinical use. Ethical concerns include potential depersonalization of care and clinician deskilling due to overreliance on AI.

ChatGPT-4 performs well on structured medical licensing questions, particularly those centered on diagnosis. However, accuracy drops significantly in open-ended and multi-step clinical reasoning, especially in management and pharmacology. While LLMs show promise for supporting education and early-stage clinical support, their current limitations underscore the need for cautious integration, further training on clinical datasets, and ethical safeguards.

This article looks at the advantages and differences of non-contact dispensing.

Contact dispensing works by touching off the tip or nozzle on the substrate or dispensing surface or submerging the tip or nozzle into the fluid being dispensed.

Non-contact dispensing, however, works by expelling fluid from the tip or nozzle without touching the tip or nozzle on the substrate or submerging this into the fluid.

Non-contact dispensing offers a number of advantages.

Contact dispensing carries a considerable risk of contamination transfer, despite this being the traditional and historically used dispensing approach. Avoiding direct contact allows non-contact dispensing to minimize cross-contamination risks to ensure that results are cleaner and more dependable.

Contact dispensing is often dependent on the use of disposable tips, resulting in increased costs and material waste. The other option is to use stainless steel nozzles, but these still require a comprehensive washing step between each reagent or test cycle.

Because non-contact dispensing uses the same tip, there is less of a need for regular nozzle washing–a key step toward an organization's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) goals.

Because non-contact dispensing better aligns with green-friendly initiatives, it is often the preferred choice in regions with stringent environmental regulations, such as the European Union. It could also become a popular choice in areas like the United States, where new environment-related legislation is passed every year.

Because liquid expulsion through the air often leads to splashing or the formation of satellite droplets, previous non-contact systems struggled to achieve the desired precision. However, recent advancements have overcome these challenges.

Technologies such as Fluid Metering's FENYX Variable Dispense and FDD Pulseless Nanoliter pumps utilize complete shearing to create clean breaks, effectively preventing satellite droplets and improving system reliability.

Non-contact dispense pumps work more rapidly, reducing nozzle washing time and removing the need for tip changes. These factors are key to significantly increasing throughput.

Non-contact dispensing is especially valuable in diagnostics, in-vitro diagnostics (IVD), and biotechnology, where high precision at the microscale and contamination prevention are critical.

These systems are ideal for maintaining sample integrity, as they eliminate physical contact, reducing the risk of disturbance or damage to delicate biological samples.

The advanced FENYX pump utilizes a combination of positive displacement and the inertia of matched piston liners to offer unmatched precision.

Traditional time pressure dosing is a type of pneumatic dispensing that can be easily impacted by variables such as humidity, air pressure, and temperature, but the new FENYX pump offers a reliable, robust solution for precise microliter volume dispensing.

Organizations making a choice between contact and non-contact dispensing are advised to consider throughput requirements and how central the reduction of contamination risks is to their application.

Non-contact dispensing represents a more rapid, sustainable, and cleaner fluid handling solution offering numerous advantages and ongoing technological advancements.

Non-contact dispensing is set to become the standard for precision fluid handling across a diverse array of industries and applications.

Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center is at the forefront of a new approach to cancer treatment, called CAR T-cell therapy. The little known, but highly promising technology breakthrough makes it possible for your body to fight cancer, often without invasive surgery, offering patients new hope for the possibility of long-term remission. 

However, a new survey by Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center of 1,021 adults in the United States shows 65% are unfamiliar with the personalized cancer treatment option. 

Fourteen years after he was first diagnosed with an aggressive form of lymphoma, 70-year-old Chris Vogelsang knew his cancer could return. Even though he underwent several rounds and types of treatments, including a stem cell transplant, his cancer returned twice. ""My energy level was terrible. I was losing weight and had night sweats,"" said Vogelsang. ""It turned out that I was 90 percent involved with lymphoma cells in my bone marrow, which is pretty significant. I asked, 'What do I have to do to get through it so I can get on with my life?'"" 

In 2022, his care team at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center presented CAR T-cell therapy as an option. 

""As is oftentimes the case with these sometimes very stubborn and refractory types of cancer, the options became increasingly limited,"" said Renier Brentjens, MD, PhD, Deputy Director and Chair of Medicine for the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""CAR T-cell therapy is a massive paradigm change of how we view and think of cancers and how we treat those cancers."" 

Dr. Brentjens is one of the developers of CAR T-cell therapy, and has built a team of leading scientists, engineers, oncologists and nurses dedicated to advancing these treatments, improving their safety and efficacy, and making them more widely available.

When I see patients in the clinic, I ask myself, 'What do I have available that can cure them of their disease? These patients have typically gone through a lot, and the upside of CAR T-cell therapy is that they can potentially get cured and go back to their lives as a father, a mother, a student-and that, to me, is just amazing.""

Marco Davila, MD, PhD, Senior Vice President and Associate Director for Translational Research at Roswell Park

CAR T-cell therapy involves extracting T cells, a type of immune cells, from a patient's blood and then taking them into a specialized lab. From there, scientists engineer the cells to recognize and kill cancer cells. The cells are then duplicated by the millions and replaced in the patient's body through an intravenous (IV) infusion. 

The cells are processed in Roswell Park's newly expanded Good Manufacturing Practice Engineering & Cell Manufacturing Facility (GEM), one of the largest facilities of its kind in the United States. It contains 20 sterile rooms across two buildings, marking a transformative step for cancer research and treatment.

""This facility helps to speed up the process, with fewer obstacles in terms of getting these cells produced and getting them into patients,"" said Dr. Davila. ""Our goal is to reach a day soon where a patient with any type of cancer can have an investigational cell and gene therapy available directly.""

The results of CAR T-cell therapy so far have been highly promising, with more than half of lymphoma patients achieving remission, and in certain types of leukemia, the remission rate reaching an impressive 90 percent. Vogelsang's scans have not shown signs of cancer in his system since March 2023. CAR T-cell therapy has granted him valuable years to enjoy with his wife, Karen, and their growing family, which will soon include 10 grandchildren. Chris has also been able to return to the tennis courts, where he plays weekly with friends.

""I feel great, and I'm back to the life that I knew before,"" said Chris. ""To have doctors and scientists who can develop therapies is beyond words. There are people who will walk into Roswell Park today and get a diagnosis. If they know CAR T-cell therapy is available for their cancer and they know that the results have been great, it offers them hope, along with their families and friends.""

As of now, CAR T-cell therapy is FDA-approved only for certain types of blood cancer, but scientists hope that it will one day treat solid tumor cancers as well.

This survey was conducted online within the United States by Ipsos on the KnowledgePanel® from March 14 to 16, 2025, and surveyed 1,021 U.S. adults ages 18 and older. This poll is based on a nationally representative probability sample and has margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level, for results based on the entire sample of adults.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Sex and age play key roles in dementia biomarker levels","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250416/Sex-and-age-play-key-roles-in-dementia-biomarker-levels.aspx","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 02:56:00 GMT","

A new study has found important clues about the roles age, sex, hormonal changes and genetics play in how certain biomarkers for dementia are expressed in the blood, according to a study published on April 16, 2025, online in Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

Blood tests that detect biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are emerging and as these tests are further developed, they are becoming important tools for understanding and diagnosing these conditions. Our findings provide valuable insights into how age, sex, genetics and hormonal changes during menopause are linked to three biomarkers believed to influence a person's risk of dementia.""

Hannah Stocker, PhD, MPH, study author of Heidelberg University, Germany

Researchers analyzed data from a larger 17-year study, comparing 513 people who developed dementia during the study to 513 people who remained free of dementia during that time. The participants had an average age of 64 at the start of the study.

Researchers took blood samples from participants three times during the study to measure levels of three biomarkers: neurofilament light chain proteins, glial acidic proteins and phosphorylated tau 181. Neurofilament light chain proteins are found in the blood when nerve cells are injured or die. Glial acidic proteins are released when cells work to repair injury. Phosphorylated tau 181 is linked to the buildup of amyloid proteins in the body, which occurs in Alzheimer's disease.

Researchers then compared levels of the biomarkers in people with and without dementia in the following ways: over time as people aged; in male and female participants; in people with and without a gene linked to Alzheimer's; and in female participants before and after menopause.

After adjusting for age, sex, and APOEe4, a genetic biomarker that indicates a strong risk of Alzheimer's disease, researchers found that an older age was tied to higher levels of all three markers.

For neurofilament light chain proteins, people age 75 had an average of 25 picograms per milliliter (pg/ml) compared to people age 50 with an average of 10 pg/ml. For glial acidic proteins, people age 75 had an average of 140 pg/ml compared to people age 50 with an average of 45 pg/ml. For phosphorylated tau 181, people age 75 had an average of two to three pg/ml compared to people age 50 with an average of 0.5 to 1.5 pg/ml.

Researchers also found that female participants had higher levels of glial acidic proteins, while male participants had higher levels of neurofilament light chain proteins.

In addition, they found people who had the APOEe4 gene had higher levels of tau and glial acidic proteins.

Lastly, the study found that female participants who had not yet gone through menopause had higher levels of glial acidic proteins, which Stocker noted may be due to having higher levels of sex hormones. Stocker said previous studies have found a link between sex hormones and neuroinflammation.

""Gaining a better understanding of these biomarkers will help improve our ability to test for dementia in the future with simple blood tests,"" said Stocker. ""Our research underscores the need to further explore these biomarkers, including during menopause, in the development of dementia.""

A limitation of the study was that participants were of European descent, so the results may not be the same for other populations.

The study was supported by the German Alzheimer Forschung Initiative.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Evidence alcohol even prior to conception may harm your baby","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250417/Evidence-alcohol-even-prior-to-conception-may-harm-your-baby.aspx","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 10:49:00 GMT","

A study of more than 400 Australian women has found that alcohol consumption at or around the time of conception can damage the growth of the placenta, potentially harming a baby's development.

The study by a Mater Research team based at Brisbane's Translational Research Institute (TRI) confirms earlier research in preclinical models and reinforces national guidelines that alcohol consumption, even just prior to conception, can impact placenta development.

Mater Research's Dr Sarah Steane says the recently published study is one of the first to analyse doppler ultrasound measurements of placental function in relation to alcohol consumption.

In the group of women that reported consuming alcohol, our key finding is that there were some alterations in doppler ultrasound measurements. These measurements indicated that the placenta may not be performing as it should in delivering oxygen to the baby.”

Dr Sarah Steane, Postdoctoral research scientist, University of Queensland Mater Research Institute

Of the women in the study who had consumed alcohol around the time of conception, 1 in 6 had ultrasound placenta measurements suggestive of deficient placenta function. This is compared to 1 in 45 women who had not consumed alcohol. This suggests that women who drink alcohol around the time of conception are 9 times more likely to have affected placenta development compared to those who don't consume alcohol.

But Dr Steane's team also found a silver lining in their research which suggests diet may hold the key to preventing the negative effects of alcohol at the time of conception.

“We found that women who took the recommended amount of folic acid prior to conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy were less likely to have these abnormal ultrasound measurements.”

Another micronutrient, choline (found in natural sources of protein) is also important for a healthy placenta and yet the study found less than a third were obtaining an adequate amount in their diet.

“Choline and folate may be acting together to reduce the vulnerability to alcohol exposure, but this really needs more study,” Dr Steane said.

Group Leader of the Mater Research Pregnancy and Development Group based at TRI, Professor Vicki Clifton said the ongoing Queensland Family Cohort Study will be invaluable for a better understanding of the impact of alcohol on pregnancy and the benefits of micronutrients such as folate and choline.

“The take home message from everything that we've done so far in the study really is to support the guidelines that if you're thinking about having a baby, don't drink alcohol,” Professor Clifton said.

“That said, many people unintentionally conceive after a big night out and for them it's about what they can do afterwards. The recommended intake of folate and a diet high in choline-rich protein such as eggs and red meat, is a good place to start.”

Professor Clifton is urging women who are pregnant and less than 24 weeks gestation to consider joining the study which will further examine the role of alcohol, micronutrients and many other aspects of having a family.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New tool simplifies genomic research and boosts medical breakthroughs","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250416/New-tool-simplifies-genomic-research-and-boosts-medical-breakthroughs.aspx","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 02:51:00 GMT","

A University of Virginia School of Medicine scientist and collaborators have developed a much-needed new tool to increase the efficiency of genomic research and accelerate the development of new ways to improve human health.

UVA researcher Nathan Sheffield, PhD, has spent four years developing a new data standard to ensure that scientists are comparing apples to apples when doing genomic analysis. This type of analysis helps researchers understand the operating instructions for our cells and see how those instructions are carried out. The resulting insights help us understand the workings of both healthy cells and unhealthy ones, pointing us to new ways to treat and prevent disease.

Genomics is a complex field that involves analyzing vast amounts of data. This work is complicated by the number of researchers involved and the varying ways they have named ""reference sequences"" over the years. Reference sequences are essential tools in genomic research, often representing genetic information compiled from multiple individuals. Researchers rely on these sequences to identify gene variations driving genetic diseases and to understand how diseased cells behave differently than normal cells.

Sheffield's new standard, called refget Sequence Collections, will streamline genomics research by letting scientists more quickly and efficiently identify reference sequences. This will help ensure that the results of a genomic analysis are right and repeatable. This, in turn, can accelerate medical breakthroughs and improve our understanding of the clinical relevance of genetic variation.

Imagine a class where each student had a different version of the book. Maybe the words are slightly different, the page numbers don't match, the chapters titles and numbers aren't the same and the study questions are in a different order. Those differences in the reference text would make it hard for the students to communicate with each other about what they're learning, even if the general ideas behind the reference are basically the same. If the students could identify each version of the text exactly, and also get detailed comparisons showing how they differ, that would make it much easier to communicate ideas and compare results. In the same way, refget Sequence Collections can tame the chaos of slightly different references, improving collaboration, sharing and reproducibility of research results based on genomic data.""

Nathan Sheffield, PhD, UVA researcher

For scientists, trying to identify the exact reference sequence used for published results can be a major burden. It's time-consuming and involves guesswork – the type of toil you might assume could be done automatically but often is not. Sheffield's new tool addresses that problem, helping scientists eliminate drudge work while ensuring they are comparing their data to the same references.

The tool serves as an important addition to the more than 40 genomic-research resources developed by members of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). GA4GH is a not-for-profit that sets standards and develops policies to expand genomic data use within a human-rights framework.

GA4GH previously developed refget sequences to simplify reference-sequence identification by assigning unique identifiers to single genomic sequences. Sheffield's new tool takes the next step, assigning names to groups of reference sequences, such as all the DNA sequences that correspond to a whole reference genome.

This will bring much-needed organization to genomic research while also addressing long-standing challenges that have slowed scientific breakthroughs, Sheffield says. Now automation will free scientists from the important but tedious grind of hunting up reference sequences, allowing them to focus their attention on advancing discoveries that will benefit human health.

""I hope this standard helps solve some of the difficulty the scientific community has faced integrating genomic and epigenomic data,"" Sheffield said. ""With a standardized, approved way to refer to references, we can accelerate the understanding we gain from integrating results across many experiments.""

Work on the new tool was an international collaboration led by Sheffield; Timothé Cezard at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute; Andy Yates at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute; Sveinung Gundersen at ELIXIR Norway; Shakuntala Baichoo at Peter Munk Cardiac Centre-Artificial Intelligence; and Rob Davies at Wellcome Sanger Institute, with support from LSG Work Stream Manager Reggan Thomas at EMBL's European Bioinformatics Institute and Work Stream Co-Leads Oliver Hofmann at the University of Melbourne and Geraldine Van der Auwera at Seqera.

Sheffield holds appointments in the School of Medicine's Departments of Genome Sciences and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, as well as in UVA's School of Data Science and in UVA's Department of Biomedical Engineering, a joint program of the School of Medicine and the School of Engineering and Applied Science.

There's a sensation that you experience -- near a plane taking off or a speaker bank at a concert -- from a sound so total that you feel it in your very being. When this happens, not only do your brain and ears perceive it, but your cells may also.

Technically speaking, sound is a simple phenomenon, consisting of compressional mechanical waves transmitted through substances, which exists universally in the non-equilibrated material world. Sound is also a vital source of environmental information for living beings, while its capacity to induce physiological responses at the cell level is only just beginning to be understood.

Following on previous work from 2018, a team of researchers at Kyoto University have been inspired by research in mechanobiology and body-conducted sound -- the sound environment in body tissues -- indicating that acoustic pressure transmitted by sound may be sufficient to induce cellular responses.

To investigate the effect of sound on cellular activities, we designed a system to bathe cultured cells in acoustic waves.""

Masahiro Kumeta, corresponding author

The team first attached a vibration transducer upside-down on a shelf. Then using a digital audio player connected to an amplifier, they sent sound signals through the transducer to a diaphragm attached to a cell culture dish. This allowed the researchers to emit acoustic pressure within the range of physiological sound to cultured cells.

Following this experiment, the researchers analyzed the effect of sound on cells using RNA-sequencing, microscopy, and other methods. Their results revealed cell-level responses to the audible range of acoustic stimulation.

In particular, the team noticed the significant effect of sound in suppressing adipocyte differentiation, the process by which preadipocytes transform into fat cells, unveiling the possibility of utilizing acoustics to control cell and tissue states.

""Since sound is non-material, acoustic stimulation is a tool that is non-invasive, safe, and immediate, and will likely benefit medicine and healthcare,"" says Kumeta.

The research team also identified about 190 sound-sensitive genes, noted the effect of sound in controlling cell adhesion activity, and observed the subcellular mechanism through which sound signals are transmitted.

In addition to providing compelling evidence of the perception of sound at the cell level, this study also challenges the traditional concept of sound perception by living beings, which is that it is mediated by receptive organs like the brain. It turns out that your cells respond to sounds, too.

Enzo Maresca will get to assess Andrey Santos in person this summer as the Strasbourg starlet will play for Chelsea at the Club World Cup.

The 20-year-old Brazilian has enjoyed an excellent loan with the French sister club, though it ​is not yet fully confirmed where he will be spending next season.

However, Mail Sport can confirm the midfielder will have his chance to impress Maresca and Co in two months' time as he will be selected to join the first-team squad in the United States for the FIFA tournament.

It is entirely possible and perhaps even likely that Santos, who speaks perfect English, will then stay with Chelsea for the forthcoming 2025-26 campaign after performing so superbly for Strasbourg throughout 2024-25.

But sources have described the situation as fluid and confirmation is only expected once Chelsea and Strasbourg get the opportunity to decide together at the end of the season. Both BlueCo sides are concentrating on their respective run-ins currently as they strive for the highest form of European football available to them.

Chelsea signed Santos at the age of 18 from Brazilian side Vasco da Gama.

After being recalled from a loan with Premier League Nottingham Forest in January 2024, he was sent to Strasbourg, where he has become a star in Ligue 1. 

He is the top-tackling midfielder in French top-flight football this season, and also the second-top scorer from midfield.

The Club World Cup will begin on June 16 for Chelsea, although they do not yet know who they will facing after Club Leon were kicked out of the Club World Cup due to a multi-club conflict with another participating side.

They will then face Flamengo on June 20, and ES Tunis on June 24.","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","FIFA's president, on a Club World Cup tour, calls U.S. ‘a welcoming country'","https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2025/04/16/gianni-infantino-world-cup-dc/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 02:36:44 GMT","

“America welcomes the world,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said Wednesday in Washington. “That's how it has been, is and will be.”

The head of international soccer's governing body said Wednesday that he has received assurances from the White House that, despite increased scrutiny of visitors to the country since President Donald Trump's return to office, fans from abroad will be welcomed for the 2026 World Cup.

“America is a welcoming country,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said during a promotional visit to Washington for this summer's Club World Cup. “America welcomes the world. Fans from all over the world will come. … They will be welcome here. America welcomes the world. That's how it has been, is and will be.”

After meeting with Trump last month in Washington, Infantino met with Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel last week in Miami to discuss security and potential issues involving the hundreds of thousands of fans from abroad expected to attend the men's tournament in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

On Tuesday, Infantino discussed matters with Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy.

FIFA also will stage the largest World Cup in history — 48 teams, up from 32 — in 11 U.S. cities, plus three in Mexico and two in Canada. With three countries involved, many fans are expected to cross international borders to see their team play.

Since Trump's inauguration, some international travelers have reported problems entering the country amid the White House's immigration crackdown.

In a brief interaction with reporters Wednesday, Infantino said, “It is very important we have the engagement of the different government agencies to make sure that security is guaranteed, that fans can travel to the U.S. and around the U.S., that transportation is working perfectly, that the world will be welcomed.”

In early March, Trump signed an executive order establishing a White House task force to coordinate federal agencies in “planning, organizing and executing” the Club World Cup and the World Cup. Trump will chair the task force, while Vice President JD Vance will serve as vice chair. An executive director managing daily operations will be appointed.

“We got all these guarantees from the government, who is very, very engaged to make sure this Club World Cup is a huge success because this will pave the path as well for next year,” said Infantino, who has visited the United States frequently in recent months. FIFA, a Zurich-based organization, opened a Miami office last year.

Featuring 32 pro teams from around the world, the Club World Cup will take place from June 14 to July 13 at 12 U.S. venues, including Audi Field, which will stage three first-round matches: Juventus (Italy) vs. Al Ain (United Arab Emirates) on June 18, Red Bull Salzburg (Austria) vs. Al Hilal (Saudi Arabia) on June 22 and Al Ain vs. Wydad (Morocco) on June 26.

FIFA has not disclosed ticket sales, but Infantino's multi-city tour suggests they are slow. The visit to Washington was arranged on short notice following visits to Philadelphia and Atlanta. FIFA recently began using World Cup access as a way to boost Club World Cup tickets, offering the opportunity to buy 2026 seats by purchasing Club World Cup packages.

“Come to the games!” Infantino said to reporters. The 55-year-old native of Switzerland led the charge to expand the Club World Cup — it has featured seven teams for most of its 25-year history — and conduct it over a month in the summer instead of 11 days in December. This year's event features defending champion Manchester City, Real Madrid and Lionel Messi's Inter Miami.

“I don't have any concerns about ticket sales,” Infantino told reporters in Philadelphia last week. “We'll have full stadiums in America.”

FIFA pledged $1 million to each of the tournament's host cities to invest in soccer-related projects. How that money will be distributed, however, has not been detailed.

Washington was selected for the club tournament after being rejected for the World Cup. Initially considered a sure bet because it is the nation's capital, Washington merged its bid with Baltimore after FIFA expressed concerns about Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland. Despite M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore headlining the joint bid, the effort failed. The closest World Cup venue to the D.C. area is in Philadelphia.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonpost.com', 'title': 'The Washington Post'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Chelsea's Club World Cup rival plot ambitious move for outcast Joao Felix","https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/chelsea-loan-move-joao-felix-35065842","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:00:00 GMT","

Joao Felix could be set for a stunning return to Benfica in time for the Club World Cup. The Portugal international is currently on loan at AC Milan having failed to secure a starting spot in Enzo Maresca's side after completing his Chelsea transfer in the summer.

Felix has failed to make his mark at the San Siro thus far and offered just one assist in Serie A since arriving in Italy earlier this year. The 25-year-old has produced eight goals in 33 appearances in all during 2024/25 with half of those coming in the Europa Conference League.

The forward's indifferent form has not peturbed Benfica's interest in facilitating a return for the player who started his professional career with the club. Felix departed Benfica in 2019 still a teenager when La Liga side Atletico Madrid agreed a mammoth £113million deal, amid interest from Manchester City and Real Madrid.

Signing a seven-year deal, Felix became the fifth most expensive transfer of all-time. But the starlet has yet to live up to that billing despite showing flashes of his quality for Atletico, Chelsea and AC Milan.

Reports in Portugal claim that Benfica want to take Felix on loan despite his struggles, and would like to see their Club World Cup campaign boosted by his presence. It would make the third time Benfica have attempted to secure Felix's return having failed to sign him in the two previous summers.

The Club World Cup gets underway in June, and FIFA have opened the transfer window earlier to allow teams the opportunity to sign players in time for the tournament. Players will be permitted to register for the competition between June 1 and June 10 before a second period is open from June 27 and July 3, in time for the tournament's knockout stage.

Benfica face Bayern Munich, Auckland City and Boca Juniors, but could face Chelsea later in the competition that kicks off on June 14. The Blues have been matched up with Esperance de Tunis and Flamengo, and await their third opponent after Club Leon were expelled.

Felix has already admitted that he plans to return to Benfica in his career. On an episode of Benfica Play in 2020, as reported by Mundo Deportivo, he said: ""Now I see how happy I was at Benfica. I plan to return one day and leave my mark on the club.""

Former AC Milan and Chelsea defender Marcel Desailly believes that despite his talent, Felix has struggled to find the correct environment to flourish. The Frenchman reckons a move to Paris Saint-Germain may be the most suitable destination for him to realise his ability.

Speaking to Milan Presse , Desailly said, ""Joao Felix is a player with great talent, but he has still not found his place. He's been at Chelsea, Atletico Madrid, and now Milan without making any real impact.

At this moment of his career, he needs a club with a clear philosophy that can build its project around him, put him at ease to express his potential that we still haven't really seen. I would suggest Paris Saint-Germain.

""‘What Joao Felix lacks is not technique, but character. He is not a leader. At this moment, he is not what Milan need, because he lacks the mental strength to revive the Rossoneri. And vice versa.""

DALLAS- American Airlines (AA) has been named the Official North American Airline Supplier for the FIFA World Cup 26™, which will take place across Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

By North Texas FIFA World Cup Communications

Following the successful launch of the Official FIFA World Cup 26TM Dallas Sonic ID last month, today marked the reveal of the Official FIFA World Cup 26TM Dallas Host City Poster. FIFA World Cup 26TM sought out local artists in each of the 16 Host Cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico to create unique Host City Posters that reflected the distinctive spirit, vibrant culture and history of their respective city. Today, the North Texas FWC Organizing Committee revealed the final design of the Dallas Host City Poster, created by local Fort Worth illustrator and type artist, Matt Cliff at an event at Klyde Warren Park in Dallas. 

Cliff submitted his winning bid for the Host City Poster during a contest that was voted on by judges with the local organizing committee. His winning design will be displayed across the DFW Metroplex throughout the entirety of FIFA World Cup 26TM.

“When I was asked to come up with a concept for the Official FIFA World Cup 26TM Dallas Host City Poster, I wanted to approach the design in a personal way - in a way that was bold and impactful - while still thinking about what it is to be an actual Texan,” said Matt Cliff. “As a Dallas-Fort Worth local, it was my responsibility to merge the history of the state with its current metropolitan feel, and turn them both into one cohesive, impactful design that truly represents our state and the area that we live in.”

Cliff's use of bold colors, detailed artwork and knowledge of Texas enabled him to capture the diverse cultures and essence of the city of Dallas in his poster. His design incorporates both the bustling city landscape and the western, cowboy culture North Texas is known for. These contrasting cultures are connected by a soccer ball, symbolizing the passion North Texas has for the “beautiful game”. In his poster, Cliff successfully accomplished the goal of bridging soccer's global impact with the local atmosphere of Dallas and the North Texas region.  

“We chose Matt Cliff for our Host City Poster because we felt his design best

captured the energy and attitude of our incredible region,” said North Texas FWC Organizing Committee Chief Marketing Officer Noelle LeVeaux. “We want this poster to be a lasting image for soccer fans across the world capturing Dallas and our North Texas region as a thriving soccer community in 2026 and beyond, and we believe Matt accomplished that with his art.”

About Matt Cliff

Matt Cliff was raised in Fort Worth, Texas and has a deep connection to the North Texas region. Cliff considers himself an illustrator who has worked with numerous artis and companies to develop their brands, merchandise and album artwork. He is best known for his work with musicians such as Post Malone, The Killers, Leon Bridges, Maren Morris and Midland, while also working with such brands as The Dallas Cowboys, The Dallas Mavericks, The Texas Rangers, Raising Cane's and Psycho Bunny. In all, Cliff's versatility and Texas roots made him the ideal artist for this project.

            American Airlines' partnership with FIFA comes as trade groups are urging the U.S. to prepare more for the 2026 World Cup. 
        

Select a question above or ask something else

American Airlines announced Thursday that it is partnering with FIFA for the 2026 World Cup, offering flights and promos to fans and teams during the tournament. 

The partnership is with Qatar Airways, American's Oneworld alliance partner. American said it is also offering members of its loyalty program the chance to win tickets to the World Cup. 

Sports partnerships are common for airlines because it allows them to build customer loyalty among fans of a team, player, or league. Emirates inked a high-profile partnership with the National Basketball Association last year to rename the league's in-season tournament as the “Emirates NBA Cup.” Seven-time Super Bowl winner Tom Brady has a partnership with Delta Air Lines, where he serves as a “strategic advisor.”

These partnerships are also lucrative for airlines. The global sports industry generates revenues as high as $2.65 trillion, according to a report from the Global Institute of Sport. FIFA reported revenues of $483 million in 2024.

However, American's partnership with FIFA comes as trade groups are sounding the alarm on the U.S. preparedness for the 2026 World Cup. 

A report from the U.S. Travel Association found that the U.S. could miss out on billions in tourism revenue unless it modernizes travel infrastructure. The report called on the U.S. to reduce visa wait times and implement biometric systems at customs in airports across the country within two years. 

There have also been increased concerns about hosting the event as the Trump administration applies more scrutiny to visas. Multiple outlets have reported that tourists on visas in the U.S. have been detained at customs. 

The State Department said in a post last month on X that demand to visit the U.S. for the World Cup was at “all-time high.” The post added: ""We screen every visa applicant thoroughly to uphold the highest standards of national security and public safety. Anyone who will need a visa to travel to #FIFAWorldCup should apply early.""

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March that establishes a task force to support preparations for the World Cup. 

The World Cup is scheduled to take place in 2026 in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Despite rising tensions among the three countries, experts expect that they won't have an impact on World Cup attendance, according to a report from the Associated Press. 

What am I looking at? The performance of airline sector stocks within the ST200. The index includes companies publicly traded across global markets including network carriers, low-cost carriers, and other related companies.

American Airlines has announced a partnership with FIFA, alongside Qatar Airways, to provide exclusive flights and promotions during the 2026 World Cup, including ticket opportunities for loyalty program members. While such sports partnerships are common and lucrative for airlines, concerns have arisen about the U.S. readiness to host the influx of visitors, particularly regarding travel infrastructure and visa processes. Despite these challenges, demand for travel to the World Cup is high, and preparations continue amid ongoing industry and governmental efforts.

Follow:


Programming note: Watch the full interview with FIFA president Gianni Infantino on CNN's “World Sport” airing on CNN International at 8:30 a.m. ET and again at 5:30 p.m. ET.



FIFA president Gianni Infantino told CNN Sports the governing body is keeping player health at the forefront as the soccer calendar expands with more intense summer competition during what is usually the sport's off-season.
    


            With the worldwide players union filing legal claims over the expanded Club World Cup this summer and next year's World Cup, Infantino told CNN that FIFA is “always concerned” about the soccer calendar and highlighted the Arsène Wenger-led player welfare task force the governing body announced in October.
    


            “(He) is one of the top, top coaches, managers of soccer in the world and he's analyzing all of that when it comes to the FIFA Club World Cup,” Infantino said.
    


            “It is a competition which takes place once every four years. The winner plays seven games – which is like one game and a half, almost, more a year – so it doesn't have a big impact.

Why soccer players are demanding change to a calendar that has left them ‘at the limit'



            “What happens in world soccer is that there are many games for very few teams, very few players. Those who reach maybe the final stages of all competitions – which again is very rare because usually a team wins maybe one competition but doesn't win them all – so, all in all, it balances itself out quite a bit.
    


            “But we're very careful about the calendar and about the health of the players. I mean, we want to do everything for the players to be in the best conditions to perform in the best way … and that's what many players tell me as well, what you want is to play rather than to train, right?”
    


            The first edition of the newly expanded and reorganized Club World Cup takes place this summer in the United States from June 15 to July 13 as something of a warm-up event for next year's World Cup, hosted in the US, Canada and Mexico.
    


            This year's tournament will feature 32 teams compared to seven from previous editions, plus group and knockout stages.
    


            In October, FIFPRO filed a complaint to the European Commission over what it describes as an “oversaturated international football calendar” that “risks player safety and wellbeing,” among other concerns.
    


            That complaint came after June's legal claim against FIFA's decision to “unilaterally” set the sport's calendar, which includes the expanded World Cup and Club World Cup. The October complaint also said FIFA faces a “conflict of interest as a competition organizer and governing body.”
    


            The previous format – which hasn't been removed from the calendar but renamed as the FIFA Intercontinental Cup – was a single-elimination, knockout tournament that took place over just 10 days compared to a month.
    


            Of course, there has to be a shiny new trophy up for grabs for this new glitzy tournament – if the $1 billion dollar prize pot wasn't enough motivation for the players.
    


            Infantino describes the new trophy, which uses a key to open up from a flat plate into something that resembles a gold-plated gyroscope, as the “coolest trophy in all of sports.”
    


            Infantino adds that the expanded version of the tournament will allow fans to see more of the world's best players in one place, with Vinícius Jr., Kylian Mbappé, Lionel Messi, Erling Haaland, Rodri, Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane, among others, set to take part.
    


            Plus, he says, it will help settle the debate between fans about which team can call itself the best.
    


            “We created a new World Cup because soccer, the way it's organized, on one side you have the countries and on the other side you have the teams, the clubs,” Infantino explains. “We have a World Cup for the countries, and we didn't have a World Cup for the clubs.
    


            “And we thought it's actually quite good to know which team is the best in the world. When you win the Super Bowl, right, you are the world champion because you are the best in the world, but in soccer, this doesn't exist.
    


            “So we created a new Club World Cup, the World Cup for the 32 best teams in the world, from Europe, from South America, North America, Africa, Asia, everywhere in the world. And we will determine in 63 games, it's 63 Super Bowls in one month … which of those teams is the best in the world.”

All eyes will be on the Red Devils' No.1 against Lyon, but he has been in the spotlight many times before due to the high amount of gaffes he has made

The last few days have been a very difficult period for Andre Onana. It began with him giving what he must have thought was a harmless post-match interview after the Manchester derby in which he was asked for his opinion on Lyon by a journalist ahead of their Europa League quarter-final tie.

His answer, which included the crucial line that he thought the Red Devils were ""way better"" than the Ligue 1 side, was repeated to Nemanja Matic before the first leg, and the former United midfielder gave one of the most brutal responses imaginable. Matic described Onana as ""one of the worst goalkeepers in the history of Manchester United"" and his words, which Onana chose to ill-advisedly respond to on social media, made the Cameroonian the focal point of the tie.

Onana's blundering performance in the 2-2 draw in France meant that he was cast as the villain at full-time, and he has remained in the spotlight since, even though Ruben Amorim decided to leave him out of the squad for Sunday's Premier League loss against Newcastle. The United coach has confirmed that Onana will start the second leg against Lyon at Old Trafford, which could make or break United's season.

Onana was the main topic in Wednesday's pre-match press conference, and all eyes will be on him throughout the 90 minutes. But it is not just because of his display last week and his spat with Matic that Onana is under-pressure. The most expensive goalkeeper in United's history has been questioned from the very start of his time with the Red Devils because he has made so many glaring mistakes.

And ahead of a game that could define his United career and even determine whether he is sold in the summer, GOAL has ranked Onana's worst errors in his two seasons in the team and picked the very worst of an already bad bunch...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Mikel Arteta's side cruised into the semi-finals at Santiago Bernabeu while raising some real questions about the Italian coach's future in Spain

This was going to be it for Real Madrid, another remontada was loading. They were 3-0 down after one leg following a miserable performance in north London against a well-disciplined Arsenal side with a point to prove, but none of that mattered, because this is Madrid, and Madrid just win in the Champions League regardless. The laws of footballing nature, supposedly, do not apply on European nights at Santiago Bernabeu... Yeah, right.

All of the hype over what might happen quickly soured into a harsh reality for the 15-time champions. Not only did they fail to mount a miraculous comeback, but they never really showed up against the Gunners. Instead, they were outrun and outplayed on Wednesday, with Arsenal terrific value for a 2-1 victory on the night and 5-1 aggregate thrashing.

There was a brief moment where all of the chatter looked like it might become reality when Bukayo Saka, with a checkered past when it comes to big penalty kicks, saw one denied by Thibaut Courtois early in the first half. Game on - or so we all thought. Instead, Madrid never really got going. They had a penalty shout of their own chalked off, and fell into a fairly woeful pattern of simply hoofing the ball into the box without a striker to aim for. As Courtois pointed out after the match, they tried to play like Joselu was there - only the 6'4 lumbering forward now practices his craft in the Qatari top flight.

In the second half, the pieces fell into place. Saka redeemed himself with a wonderful dink to give Arsenal the lead on the night. Madrid briefly sprang back into life when William Saliba - who had been excellent to that point - dwelled on the ball slightly too long and Vinicius Jr - who had been woeful to that point - capitalised. But that second wave never followed, and Gabriel Martinelli buried a second in stoppage time to put the tie to bed.

Now, Madrid are in trouble. They have been poor all season, and Carlo Ancelotti's signature vibes-guy genius is starting to wane. He had no real tactical setup to actually score goals, and no response for Arsenal's domination of central areas. Throw in another magical midfield showing from Declan Rice - who was superb across the two legs - and Madrid were outclassed.

These things don't happen at the Bernabeu, and when thrust into unfamiliar territory, Los Blancos tend to look at the man at the helm for blame. Ancelotti, then, has some serious questions to answer.

Florentino Perez is paying a heavy price for failing to buy a replacement for the incredibly influential German, who retired last summer

Real Madrid fans turned up at Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday anticipating another miracle. What they got was a mess, the inevitable result of Florentino Perez's negligence.

Madrid spent the majority of the evening bombarding the Arsenal area with crosses and long balls but, as a bitterly frustrated Thibaut Courtois pointed out, it was an exercise in futility, given Joselu wasn't there to get on the end of them.

But then, it wasn't as if Madrid had the guile in midfield to pick holes in the Gunners' backline. Indeed, Joselu wasn't the only member of last year's double-winners who was sorely missed across both legs of the humiliating 5-1 aggregate loss to Arsenal. Toni Kroos was also conspicuous by his absence - because Perez failed to replace him, too, and that's proven an even bigger oversight on the part of the president.

With the great Luka Modric now well past his best, Madrid no longer have a single player capable of dictating the play or opening up defences in the same way that the Croat and Kroos did for a decade. Truth be told, the whole make-up of the midfield looks wrong, with Aurelien Tchouameni clearly not good enough to serve as the kind of No.6 that a team like Madrid requires, and Eduardo Camavinga still a work in progress. Even Jude Bellingham's free role looks like a luxury Real can ill-afford as those stationed in front of him do so little from a defensive perspective.

It's clear, then, that Madrid need to belatedly find another Kroos - or the next best thing - if they are to reclaim their place at the summit of European football.

Barcelona and PSG marched into the semifinal stage of the UEFA Champions League despite losing their second-leg matches. In the next round, both teams will be facing tougher challenges as Inter Milan, along with Arsenal, awaits.

Blaugrana made their way into the semi-final thanks to their 4-0 first-leg win over Borussia Dortmund at Camp Nou. That big win was enough to secure Hansi Flick's side's place in the next stage despite losing their second game 3-1 in Germany.

That second-leg defeat will be a positive learning curve for Barca ahead of their semifinal battle against Inter. The Nerazzurri will pose a different threat, especially on the defensive end, as they are known for their strong backline.

Barcelona will once again be the favourite on paper, but Inter have proved that they are not an easy team to take down, especially in two legs. Barca must put on a much more consistent effort both at home and away if they want to grab that UCL final ticket.

A similar situation also occurs for Les Parisiens as they will face another tough task from a Premier League side, Arsenal. After eliminating Aston Villa in a tricky fashion, Luis Enrique's men are going to face another EPL team.

Already eliminating Liverpool in the last 16, PSG will be eyeing to make the Gunners their third victim in this season's UCL campaign. It won't be an easy task as the Ligue 1 giant was forced to battle hard in their second-leg clash against Villa.

However, their 3-2 loss against Unai Emery's side can also serve as a good lesson for PSG to maintain their focus in both legs. Arsenal will be a tough battle, especially with their confidence sky high after beating Real Madrid.

17-year-old made history at the BMW Open in Munich with his first-round victory.ByEmma StoreyPublished Apr 17, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 17, 2025

MUNICH—The new Center Court at the BMW Open by Bitpanda witnessed a moment of history this week—and by one of their home players. Aged 17, Diego Dedura-Palomera became the first player born in 2008 to win an ATP Tour match. The Berlin native was already leading 7-6, 3-0 when his opponent, world No. 29 Denis Shapovalov, retired from the match and handed him the win.Dedura-Palomera's celebration on court was anything but understated, as he drew a cross in the sand before lying down flat out on the ground. It was a reaction that provoked much debate on social media, given Shapovalov's departure. So what was behind it?“I would say I am quite religious. I believe in God and I think He helped me win today,” explained the 17-year-old in Munich.I prayed for five minutes, and then I went out on court, took all my strength from Him, and then after the match, the gesture was simply gratitude.

The German only made it into the main draw less than 24 hours before his first match on Tuesday. After losing to Alexander Bublik in qualifying, Dedura-Palomero stayed on in Munich as the last of four Lucky Losers. The three players ahead of him benefited from Sunday withdrawals, but it looked like the 17-year-old wouldn't be joining them—until late on Monday afternoon.“I was in the players lounge, directly in the gym and then Gael Monfils came by. He went to the supervisor and I immediately realised, okay, something is wrong. My pulse went straight up, and then of course I was in the middle of the action, back to life,” he said.Then Monfils told me that he was pulling out, he gave me a hug and said: ‘Yeah, good luck.' He was super sweet and super nice to me. In the end, I came in and yes, I believe that everything happens for a reason in life.“I knew that I had a feeling that I might win because I came in as a Lucky Loser and that's what happened!” he laughed.

Dedura-Palomero was born in 2008 to a Chilean father and a Lithuanian mother in Berlin. His unusual background has shaped him on and off the court. He speaks four languages—German, English, Spanish and Lithuanian—and he describes himself as “a complicated person”.“I have many different aspects to me, which are a bit strange. I am very irregular. Otherwise, I'm very ambitious. I try to win every match and fight as hard as I can to the end. And of course, I'm always exhausted afterwards, even when I win.I'm very emotional. I like to freak out, to take people with me, to just be there emotionally and to say: ‘Okay, now after the match, I really gave it my all.' Otherwise, off the court, I'm actually quite the quiet type. I would also describe myself as nice.

As any other normal teenager, his parents are his biggest influences. Just like Germany's current number one Alexander Zverev, Dedura-Palomero is coached by his father Cesar, with his mother Ruta also on hand to offer advice. Both are tennis players, as is brother Mariano, who also competes on the ATP Challenger Tour. He's also spent time at the Nadal Academy honing his skills on his favorite surface of clay—following in the footsteps of his idol.“Rafa has always been my role model since I was little. I watched all his matches. I know everything about him by heart,” he grinned.“I think I would describe myself as a fighter. I think anyone can play forehand and backhand. In the end, it's also about work and I'm really good at it. And I've always had a thing about serve and volley.”

Fans have been quick to draw the comparison between Dedura-Palermo and another rising German star, Justin Engel. Engel wrote his own name into the ATP history books last year when he became the first player born in 2007 to win on the Tour. There's less than six months between the two players in age. So could be witnessing the start of a new rivalry? A friendly one, perhaps.“With Justin, there is always competition involved, but it is more friends than competitors. I know the boy inside out. We met last year. We are together all the time. He is at all the tournaments. I get along incredibly well with him. He's a super nice guy,” said Dedura-Palomero.

“I was also really happy when he had his ATP breakthrough in Almaty last year. We wrote to each other all the time and stuff. That's why it's hard to say in terms of competition. Of course I always look where he is playing. He always looks where I am playing, but in the end it's a good friendship and that's more important to me than the competition,” he added.And what about his own ambitions for the future?“It's hard to say in this sport because it goes up and down all the time. You can never say what will happen. I always try to stay as down-to-earth as possible. I'm not going to say an absolute number now for where I want to go, but that will be decided in the end.“I'll try to be the best tennis player I can be. Just be myself.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Patrick McEnroe says there is a young ATP player that is coming 'like a ton of bricks' and predicts him to impress at Roland Garros","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/patrick-mcenroe-says-there-is-a-young-atp-player-that-is-coming-like-a-ton-of-bricks-and-predicts-him-to-impress-at-roland-garros/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

The next generation of ATP players have started to make some significant breakthroughs in 2025.

Although he is still only 21-years-old, Carlos Alcaraz has solidified his position on the ATP Tour as one of the best players in the world.

This was evident from the start of the clay court season, where Alcaraz won the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time.

Despite winning the prestigious title, Alcaraz admitted he did not play his best after suffering a scare against another young star.

The match where Alcaraz looked particularly at risk came in the quarter-finals against Frenchman Arthur Fils.

Fils led by a set and had three break point opportunities in the latter stages of the second, but was unable to capitalise on them. 

After their match, Alcaraz emphasized Fils' power as a huge strength and was full of praise for the 20-year-old.

Fils has quickly put that disappointment behind him and is now into the quarter-finals of the Barcelona Open.

The world number 14's improvements have been noticed by many including Patrick McEnroe, who took to social media to wax lyrical about Fils.

Patrick McEnroe, who is the brother of John and is a former doubles Grand Slam champion in his own right, has predicted Fils to make a big run at Roland Garros this year in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).

“Add Arthur Fils to the list of under 21 players that are coming like a ton of bricks,” said McEnroe. “I can see him making a big BIG run @rolandgarros. Now wouldn't that be fun!!!”

Add Arthur Fils to the list of under 21 players that are coming like a ton of bricks I can see him making a big BIG run @rolandgarros Now wouldn't that be fun!!!

McEnroe is not the only person who thinks that Fils will make some noise at Roland Garros, but his previous history at the tournament will need to change if that is the case.

Despite being a French player, Fils has never won a main draw match at Roland Garros after suffering two consecutive opening round losses.

The first of those was a tricky encounter against 29th seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, but a year later it was Fils in that seeded position.

However, Fils was unable to take advantage of that seeded ranking and was beaten in four sets by Italian Matteo Arnaldi.

Fils will be looking to make history at Roland Garros this year, as a Frenchman has not reached the quarter-finals of the Paris major since Richard Gasquet in 2016.

While the 20-year-old is just getting his career started, Gasquet will be retiring at Roland Garros next month.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Rafael Nadal's playing career came to an end last November, but the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings will still make an appearance at Roland Garros next month.

The 38-year-old, who lifted the Coupe des Mousquetaires a record 14 times, will be honoured by the French Tennis Federation (FFT) in celebration of his dominance at Roland Garros.

The ceremony will occur on the opening day of the tournament — Sunday, 25 May — on Court Philippe-Chatrier, following the conclusion of the day session's three matches.



In addition, an exhibition paying tribute to Nadal's victories will also be on display for the duration of the clay-court major.

The event also paid tribute to the Spaniard in 2021, when his statue was unveiled at Stade Roland Garros in honour of his remarkable record on the Parisian clay.

The 22-time Grand Slam champion won his first Roland Garros title on tournament debut in 2005. He earned a staggering 112-4 record at the tournament and defeated Casper Ruud to win his final title in 2022. Nadal's last appearance in Paris came last year, when he lost to Alexander Zverev in the opening round.

Carlos Alcaraz moved one step closer to capturing his third Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell title on Thursday when he raced into the quarter-finals at the ATP 500.


The Spaniard fought off heavy-hitting Laslo Djere 6-2, 6-4 in blustery conditions, extending his winning streak to seven following his Monte-Carlo title run last week.

Carlos on lock 🔒 😤That's a dozen straight on the Barcelona clay for @carlosalcaraz , brushing past Djere 6-2 6-4!@bcnopenbs | #BCNOpenBS pic.twitter.com/2CNfCozmLu

Alcaraz trailed 2-4 in the second set, but quickly bounced back, breaking Djere to love that game behind increased aggression from the baseline. Djere double faulted at 0/40, gifting Alcaraz the break back. The home favourite rode that momentum to tally four straight games and close out the 71-minute victory.



“I think as much as I can win in straight sets, it's much better to save energy for the matches that I have coming forward,” Alcaraz said. “I think I played great tennis, even better than the first round, even though I had to come back from 4-2 in the second set. I think he played much better in that second set, but really happy to find a great level again and hopefully keep going.”


The No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Alcaraz made a flying start and treated the fans to a blistering forehand pass to earn a double break in the opening set. He moved around the court with ease, mixing deep return positions with explosive sprints to track down the Serbian's drop shots. Alcaraz converted all six of his points at net.






Alcaraz, the top seed, held the edge on second-serve performance, winning 57 per cent of those points to Djere's 37 per cent, according to Infosys ATP Stats. 
The 18-time tour-level titlist improved to 27-1 on Spanish clay courts since the start of 2022 season, including 12-0 in Barcelona, where he was crowned champion in 2022 and 2023. He next faces fifth seed Alex de Minaur, who Alcaraz leads 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, including a victory in the Rotterdam final this year.

De Minaur raced past lucky loser Jacob Fearnley 6-1, 6-2 in just 62 minutes after dropping just three points behind his first serve (20/23).

Into his 50th tour-level quarter-final, De Minaur is third man born in 1999 or later to achieve that feat, alongside Felix Auger-Aliassime (2000; 54) and Jannik Sinner (2001; 52). Since the start of the 2023 season, the 26-year-old De Minaur boasts the most match wins at ATP 500 level (37).
In other Barcelona action, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina advanced to the last eight by earning his first win over World No. 8 Andrey Rublev. After five straight defeats in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, the Spaniard ousted the fourth seed 7-5, 6-4 to claim his third Top 10 victory of the season.

Davidovich Fokina is the third player to earn 20 tour-level match wins this year, alongside Alcaraz and De Minaur. The 25-year-old recorded just 18 tour-level wins for the entire 2024 season. Eighth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, Davidovich Fokina will next face Karen Khachanov.

The 28-year-old Khachanov advanced to his 60th tour-level quarter-final — and first of this season — with a 7-5, 6-4 victory against Jaume Munar. Khachanov, who advanced to his first Barcelona quarter-final in 2017, now holds the record for longest gap between quarter-final appearances at the Spanish tournament.

A year after he bid adieu to Roland Garros for the last time as a player, 14-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal will receive a special tribute at the venue where he was virtually unbeatable for the most part of his career.

The Spanish legend called time on his illustrious career after the Davis Cup Finals late last year, having amassed 22 Grand Slam titles, and will be honoured on Court Philippe Chatrier at the end of the day session on the tournament's opening day – May 25.

“Rafa made history at Roland Garros and his 14 titles will perhaps remain unequalled,” tournament director Amelie Mauresmo said. “The idea is to have a vision for the future and also to celebrate those who thrilled us in the past.”

The French Open will also honour the retiring Richard Gasquet and 2000 champion Mary Pierce.

“To mark Rafa's first season post-retirement, a ceremony will take place following the conclusion of the day session's three fixtures,” the organisers said in a news release. “An immersive and entertaining exhibition dedicated to the legendary Spaniard will also run for the duration of the tournament at the Roland-Garros Tenniseum.”

Nadal won the French Open nine times in 10 years from 2005 to 2014, and triumphed five more titles in six years from 2017 through 2022. His Grand Slam tally is second only to Novak Djokovic's 24.

The organisers had not organised a proper farewell for Nadal after he lost to Alexander Zverev in the first round as the Spaniard had not said unequivocally that it was his final participation in the tournament.

“We wanted to do the tribute last year, to be transparent, but he refused at the time,” Mauresmo said. “He wasn't sure that it was his last Roland Garros. Now that he is retired, he is happy to receive it,” Mauresmo, a two-time Grand Slam champion, said.



The 38-year-old Nadal already has a statue at the venue of the clay-court Grand Slam. He will also feature in an exhibition in the tournament museum and lend his voice to the official French Open trailer.

The next generation of ATP players have started to make some significant breakthroughs in 2025.

Although he is still only 21-years-old, Carlos Alcaraz has solidified his position on the ATP Tour as one of the best players in the world.

This was evident from the start of the clay court season, where Alcaraz won the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time.

Despite winning the prestigious title, Alcaraz admitted he did not play his best after suffering a scare against another young star.

The match where Alcaraz looked particularly at risk came in the quarter-finals against Frenchman Arthur Fils.

Fils led by a set and had three break point opportunities in the latter stages of the second, but was unable to capitalise on them. 

After their match, Alcaraz emphasized Fils' power as a huge strength and was full of praise for the 20-year-old.

Fils has quickly put that disappointment behind him and is now into the quarter-finals of the Barcelona Open.

The world number 14's improvements have been noticed by many including Patrick McEnroe, who took to social media to wax lyrical about Fils.

Patrick McEnroe, who is the brother of John and is a former doubles Grand Slam champion in his own right, has predicted Fils to make a big run at Roland Garros this year in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter).

“Add Arthur Fils to the list of under 21 players that are coming like a ton of bricks,” said McEnroe. “I can see him making a big BIG run @rolandgarros. Now wouldn't that be fun!!!”

Add Arthur Fils to the list of under 21 players that are coming like a ton of bricks I can see him making a big BIG run @rolandgarros Now wouldn't that be fun!!!

McEnroe is not the only person who thinks that Fils will make some noise at Roland Garros, but his previous history at the tournament will need to change if that is the case.

Despite being a French player, Fils has never won a main draw match at Roland Garros after suffering two consecutive opening round losses.

The first of those was a tricky encounter against 29th seed Alejandro Davidovich Fokina, but a year later it was Fils in that seeded position.

However, Fils was unable to take advantage of that seeded ranking and was beaten in four sets by Italian Matteo Arnaldi.

Fils will be looking to make history at Roland Garros this year, as a Frenchman has not reached the quarter-finals of the Paris major since Richard Gasquet in 2016.

While the 20-year-old is just getting his career started, Gasquet will be retiring at Roland Garros next month.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Rafael Nadal's playing career came to an end last November, but the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings will still make an appearance at Roland Garros next month.

The 38-year-old, who lifted the Coupe des Mousquetaires a record 14 times, will be honoured by the French Tennis Federation (FFT) in celebration of his dominance at Roland Garros.

The ceremony will occur on the opening day of the tournament — Sunday, 25 May — on Court Philippe-Chatrier, following the conclusion of the day session's three matches.



In addition, an exhibition paying tribute to Nadal's victories will also be on display for the duration of the clay-court major.

The event also paid tribute to the Spaniard in 2021, when his statue was unveiled at Stade Roland Garros in honour of his remarkable record on the Parisian clay.

The 22-time Grand Slam champion won his first Roland Garros title on tournament debut in 2005. He earned a staggering 112-4 record at the tournament and defeated Casper Ruud to win his final title in 2022. Nadal's last appearance in Paris came last year, when he lost to Alexander Zverev in the opening round.

The United States Tennis Association (USTA) has renewed its partnership with IMG in a deal that will take the long-running partnership beyond 15 years.

IMG and the USTA have been working together to expand the US Open's international reach, fan engagement and overseas media rights revenues since 2011.

The agency adds the US Open's domestic rights to its purview, with IMG advising and representing the USTA during its renewal negotiations with ESPN for the tournament's domestic rights. ESPN now owns the grand slam's rights through to 2037 as part of a deal reportedly worth US$170 million per year and US$2.04 billion in total.

IMG was acquired by Endeavor-owned TKO Group Holdings earlier this year as part of a US$3.25 billion all-stock deal. The agency also has partnerships with other leading tennis properties such as the Wimbledon and French Open grand slams, as well as with the ATP and WTA tours.

“IMG has been an integral part of the US Open's growth, ensuring that it reaches core fans and new audiences across the world through innovative local and regional media distribution partnerships,” said Kirsten Corio, chief commercial officer of the USTA. “We are thrilled to extend the relationship with IMG to together bring the most spectacular sports and entertainment event to the world for many more years to come.”

Ed Mallaburn, senior vice president of sports management at IMG, added: “The USTA continues to push the boundaries of what is possible onsite and onscreen, and we couldn't be prouder to continue to support such a bold and innovative rightsholder.“

The 2025 US Open will begin on 24th August. The singles competitions will begin on a Sunday for the first time and a revamped Mixed Doubles tournament to be held the week before.

The United States Tennis Association (USTA) announced on April 16 a multi-year extension and expansion of its partnership with IMG, a leading global sports marketing agency. The new agreement will see IMG represent and advise the USTA on both the international and domestic media rights of the iconic US Open Tennis Championships.

IMG advised and represented the USTA throughout the recent renewal negotiation with ESPN to continue broadcasting the US Open in the US, Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean through 2037, resulting in a significant increase in exposure and revenue. The USTA has been working with IMG since 2011 to power the growth of its international reach, fan engagement, and media rights revenues. The 2024 US Open was watched by a record-breaking global audience of more than 175 million and broadcast in more than 200 countries and regions across 60 channels.

The USTA continues to push the boundaries of what is possible onsite and onscreen, and we couldn't be prouder to continue to support such a bold and innovative rights holder. The sport of tennis needs to leverage its unique assets in an ever-changing ecosystem and this year's revamped mixed doubles event is a perfect example of how the USTA is doing this.""

The US Open is set to continue its multi-year trajectory of extraordinary growth and demand in 2025, with its first Sunday start to the singles main draw in the Open Era and a revolutionized Mixed Doubles Championship that will see the game's blockbuster stars competing for a $1 million champions' prize during Fan Week. The full, three-week US Open runs from Aug 18-Sept 7.

IMG, which was recently acquired by TKO Group Holdings Inc, is partner to a number of the world's leading tennis events and tours, including the AELTC (Wimbledon), FFT (Roland Garros), ATP Media (ATP Tour), and WTA Ventures (WTA Tour).

In tennis, momentum can be fleeting. One moment a player is dominating the tour, the next they're sidelined by injuries, trying to rebuild. Bianca Andreescu has lived both realities. Just a few years ago, she was considered one of the sport's brightest stars, even having a positive record against Serena Williams. Now, after several long breaks from competition, she's working toward a full comeback.

Andreescu was born in Canada and spent part of her childhood in Romania, where she started playing tennis. Her early promise was clear, and she climbed the junior rankings quickly before turning professional.

By her late teens, she was already making waves on the WTA Tour. With a bold playing style and a strong mindset, she stood out as someone capable of competing with the game's best. But injuries and personal struggles slowed her rise.

Over the past few seasons, Andreescu has missed major tournaments and spent long periods away from the court. Despite those setbacks, she hasn't lost sight of what she's capable of.

Andreescu's 2019 US Open victory over Serena Williams was a historic moment for Canadian tennis. She became the first player from Canada to win a Grand Slam singles title and the first to win the Canadian Open in 50 years. Her wins over Williams, first in Toronto, then in New York, made headlines around the world. At Flushing Meadows, she held her nerve in a packed Arthur Ashe Stadium to defeat one of the game's greatest champions 6-3, 7-5.

She also won the Indian Wells Open earlier that season, becoming the first wildcard to take the title. That same year, she finished the season ranked World No. 5, despite missing some time due to injury. Her aggressive, varied style and willingness to mix pace and spin earned her fans and praise from tennis commentators worldwide.

But just as quickly as she rose, Andreescu began to face serious setbacks. A knee injury sidelined her for all of 2020. She returned to the tour in 2021 but struggled to regain consistency. In 2023 and 2024, a stress fracture in her back kept her out for nearly a year.

Then, in early 2025, she underwent emergency surgery for appendicitis, ruling her out of the Australian Open. “The surgery went smoothly, and I'm on the road to recovery,” she wrote on Instagram, later adding that she hoped to return during the clay season.

Injuries have tested not just her body but her mindset. In interviews, Andreescu has spoken openly about how much she has learned about herself during time away from the sport. In 2024, she told The New York Times, “Honestly, I've learned more through injuries than through actually playing tennis.”

Andreescu also spent time away from the game exploring other interests. She went on a spiritual retreat in Costa Rica, practiced yoga, and volunteered with animal rescue and women's shelters. She has said that tennis is no longer her entire identity and that her new approach to life has helped her manage the mental side of the sport.

17-year-old made history at the BMW Open in Munich with his first-round victory.ByEmma StoreyPublished Apr 17, 2025 copy_link

Published Apr 17, 2025

MUNICH—The new Center Court at the BMW Open by Bitpanda witnessed a moment of history this week—and by one of their home players. Aged 17, Diego Dedura-Palomera became the first player born in 2008 to win an ATP Tour match. The Berlin native was already leading 7-6, 3-0 when his opponent, world No. 29 Denis Shapovalov, retired from the match and handed him the win.Dedura-Palomera's celebration on court was anything but understated, as he drew a cross in the sand before lying down flat out on the ground. It was a reaction that provoked much debate on social media, given Shapovalov's departure. So what was behind it?“I would say I am quite religious. I believe in God and I think He helped me win today,” explained the 17-year-old in Munich.I prayed for five minutes, and then I went out on court, took all my strength from Him, and then after the match, the gesture was simply gratitude.

The German only made it into the main draw less than 24 hours before his first match on Tuesday. After losing to Alexander Bublik in qualifying, Dedura-Palomero stayed on in Munich as the last of four Lucky Losers. The three players ahead of him benefited from Sunday withdrawals, but it looked like the 17-year-old wouldn't be joining them—until late on Monday afternoon.“I was in the players lounge, directly in the gym and then Gael Monfils came by. He went to the supervisor and I immediately realised, okay, something is wrong. My pulse went straight up, and then of course I was in the middle of the action, back to life,” he said.Then Monfils told me that he was pulling out, he gave me a hug and said: ‘Yeah, good luck.' He was super sweet and super nice to me. In the end, I came in and yes, I believe that everything happens for a reason in life.“I knew that I had a feeling that I might win because I came in as a Lucky Loser and that's what happened!” he laughed.

Dedura-Palomero was born in 2008 to a Chilean father and a Lithuanian mother in Berlin. His unusual background has shaped him on and off the court. He speaks four languages—German, English, Spanish and Lithuanian—and he describes himself as “a complicated person”.“I have many different aspects to me, which are a bit strange. I am very irregular. Otherwise, I'm very ambitious. I try to win every match and fight as hard as I can to the end. And of course, I'm always exhausted afterwards, even when I win.I'm very emotional. I like to freak out, to take people with me, to just be there emotionally and to say: ‘Okay, now after the match, I really gave it my all.' Otherwise, off the court, I'm actually quite the quiet type. I would also describe myself as nice.

As any other normal teenager, his parents are his biggest influences. Just like Germany's current number one Alexander Zverev, Dedura-Palomero is coached by his father Cesar, with his mother Ruta also on hand to offer advice. Both are tennis players, as is brother Mariano, who also competes on the ATP Challenger Tour. He's also spent time at the Nadal Academy honing his skills on his favorite surface of clay—following in the footsteps of his idol.“Rafa has always been my role model since I was little. I watched all his matches. I know everything about him by heart,” he grinned.“I think I would describe myself as a fighter. I think anyone can play forehand and backhand. In the end, it's also about work and I'm really good at it. And I've always had a thing about serve and volley.”

Fans have been quick to draw the comparison between Dedura-Palermo and another rising German star, Justin Engel. Engel wrote his own name into the ATP history books last year when he became the first player born in 2007 to win on the Tour. There's less than six months between the two players in age. So could be witnessing the start of a new rivalry? A friendly one, perhaps.“With Justin, there is always competition involved, but it is more friends than competitors. I know the boy inside out. We met last year. We are together all the time. He is at all the tournaments. I get along incredibly well with him. He's a super nice guy,” said Dedura-Palomero.

“I was also really happy when he had his ATP breakthrough in Almaty last year. We wrote to each other all the time and stuff. That's why it's hard to say in terms of competition. Of course I always look where he is playing. He always looks where I am playing, but in the end it's a good friendship and that's more important to me than the competition,” he added.And what about his own ambitions for the future?“It's hard to say in this sport because it goes up and down all the time. You can never say what will happen. I always try to stay as down-to-earth as possible. I'm not going to say an absolute number now for where I want to go, but that will be decided in the end.“I'll try to be the best tennis player I can be. Just be myself.”

The 2025 F1 ACADEMY field has traded Shanghai's expansive layout for the fast-paced, tight and twisty Jeddah Corniche Circuit as the grid prepares for Round 2 of the season.

Whilst in-season testing earlier this month allowed the 18 drivers to get acquainted with the Saudi Arabian venue, even bigger tests lie in store on for the Grand Prix weekend…

The frustration was evident from Maya Weug in China after the Ferrari driver failed to convert her pole position into victory in Race 2. Speaking post-race, she rued her cautious approach of trying to avoid making a mistake on the rolling start which left her vulnerable to be overtaken by Doriane Pin.

Maya Weug will hope to bounce back as she lost out to Doriane Pin in Shanghai's Race 2

Although she believes she should have been leading the Drivers' Standings, the reality is she has a five-point deficit to Pin heading to a track that favoured the Mercedes junior last year. Whilst Pin seized both pole positions and would have been on course for back-to-back wins if not for a post-race penalty in Race 2, Weug finished five seconds behind her on track.

During the in-season test at Jeddah, Weug acknowledged that there were things she was doing wrong last year that she's addressing. If she can master her one-lap pace and seal a second consecutive pole, the limited overtaking opportunities around Jeddah should play in her favour.

Pin might be sitting pretty at the top of the Drivers' Standings, but the French racer hasn't got much breathing room from the pack behind. Two points behind second-place Weug, Chloe Chambers delivered back-to-back podiums in Shanghai but knows she needs to nail her Qualifying on a regular basis, a feat that proved to be a struggle last season.

Alisha Palmowski is the leading rookie in fourth and is brimming with confidence after winning the reverse grid Race 1 last time out. Despite this, the Red Bull Racing driver felt that the trip to the Chinese circuit would be one of her weakest weekends of the year.

Based off her efforts in testing, the Briton seems happier with the set-up direction as she set the fastest time across the three days of running.

Alisha Palmowski is the leading F1 ACADEMY rookie so far this year

She leads the quintet of rookies inside the top-eight, with herself, Alba Larsen, Emma Felbermayr, Ella Lloyd and Rafaela Ferreira all separated by 10 points. Larsen put together an impressive performance in Shanghai, qualifying in third and only losing that spot on the podium in the latter stages of Race 2 to Chambers.

One driver who was down but far from out after Shanghai was Lia Block. Contact from Ferreira in Practice left the Williams driver out of Qualifying with damage, but she did manage to salvage a P9 finish in Race 2.

Picking herself back up and setting her sights on pole, Block returns to the track she made her debut at last year and will be desperate to demonstrate the potential that went untapped in China.

Lia Block will be hoping for a smoother weekend in Jeddah

The smoother track surface might make tyre degradation less of a concern for the drivers, but the Jeddah Corniche Circuit will be a monumental test of their mental agility.

Darting in between the high-speed corners with the walls close at hand, the room for error is minimal. To add to the task, temperatures will reach beyond 30C across Practice and both races, with focus then switching to Qualifying under the floodlights.

Balancing all these variables will be a demanding job for the drivers and their teams, which could provide those who missed out points in Shanghai a much-needed chance to shake up the order.

The long-awaited sequel from Columbia Pictures stars Jodie Comer and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. 


							By 

	James Hibberd


Writer-at-Large


	A second trailer for Danny Boyle‘s long-awaited zombie-horror thriller 28 Years Later has been released. 


	Below is Columbia Pictures' official second trailer for the film, which returns fans to a post-apocalyptic U.K. plagued by the infected undead. Writer Alex Garland (Civil War) has teamed with the Oscar-winning Boyle for the first of two sequels.




	The official description: “It's been almost three decades since the rage virus escaped a biological weapons laboratory, and now, still in a ruthlessly enforced quarantine, some have found ways to exist amidst the infected. One such group of survivors lives on a small island connected to the mainland by a single, heavily-defended causeway. When one of the group leaves the island on a mission into the dark heart of the mainland, he discovers secrets, wonders and horrors that have mutated not only the infected, but other survivors as well.”

	“I still love an apocalypse, British-style,” Boyle said last month at CinemaCon. “I still love the infected. And I still love blowing shit up.” He also teased fans will have to be patient to see 28 Days Later original star Cillian Murphy in the new planned trilogy: “Like all good things in life, you may have to wait a little while for him to make his appearance.” Murphy, who won an Oscar for his role in Oppenheimer, also executive produces the new films.


Nia DaCosta, who directed the forthcoming second film, 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple, was also at the event. “While it's very much informed by 28 Days Later, the script for The Bone Temple is very different,” DaCosta said. “I was able to let my freak flag fly.”


28 Years Later will be released in theaters on June 20.

Director Matt Shakman's new take on the legendary Marvel team hits theaters this summer.


							By 

	Ryan Gajewski


Senior Entertainment Reporter


Fantastic Four: First Steps teases a possible new addition to Marvel's First Family in the movie's latest trailer. 


	Ahead of its theatrical release July 25, the Marvel Studios title released the trailer online Thursday after it debuted earlier this month during Disney's CinemaCon presentation. Director Matt Shakman's feature offers a new take on the superhero quartet who made their first comic book appearance in 1961.




Fantastic Four: First Steps stars Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm/The Invisible Woman, Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm/The Human Torch and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm/The Thing.

	In the new footage for the 1960s-set project, Reed Richards and Sue Storm learn that they are expecting a baby, spurring a complicated response. “We can do this,” Kirby says.


	Our heroes face threats from Galactus but are determined to stay united, even as the public begins to lose faith in them. “We will face this together,” Kirby adds. “We will fight it together — as a family.” Toward the end of the trailer, Julia Garner's Silver Surfer briefly glides across the screen to offer a warning. 


	The latest version of the screenplay is from Eric Pearson, who also worked on Marvel's forthcoming Thunderbolts*. The First Steps cast includes Ralph Ineson as Galactus, along with Paul Walter Hauser, John Malkovich and Natasha Lyonne.


	Following an unreleased Roger Corman-produced feature in the 1990s, the Fantastic Four hit the big screen with director Tim Story's 2005 movie that starred Chris Evans, Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffudd and Michael Chiklis as the titular group. Although critics were unimpressed, the movie did well at the box office and spawned a 2007 sequel. 


	The team was rebooted for Josh Trank's 2015 feature starring Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Bell. This one underperformed at the box office and holds a mere 9 percent Rotten Tomatoes critical score.

The legendary John Williams once set the soundtrack for the billion-dollar franchise. Now a new generation of Hollywood composers that he inspired are giving the Force a whole new feel.


							By 

	Tim Greiving



	What is the definition of “Star Wars music”? Maybe, to paraphrase Jimmy Carter, you just know it when you hear it.


	Most people would answer by pointing to the man who invented and canonized this unique subgenre: John Williams, composer of nine Star Wars films from 1977 to 2019, the original themes for two spinoffs and a district of Disneyland. Williams established an orchestral, operatic musical language, rich with tuneful character themes and draped in classical tradition, a style now so deeply familiar and revered that it is, for many fans, holy scripture.

	But as this sprawling galaxy continues to expand, the artists behind every new adventure are questioning what the musical topography should — and can — be.




			Popular on THR		







	In the most recent Darwinian leap, a trailer for the second season of Andor was soundtracked with the countrified clang of electric guitar in Steve Earle's Iraq War protest anthem, “The Revolution Starts Now.” An apt text for the show's grown-up political ambitions, but a surprising, maybe even discordant, sound for the galaxy far, far away.


	“Every living thing has to evolve as it goes forward, right?” says Steven Gizicki, who ran the music department at Lucasfilm in its last years under George Lucas, a time when they were developing such animated series as Star Wars Detours — an irreverent, and ultimately ill-fated, co-production with Robot Chicken, full of pop songs. For the animated Star Wars: Rebels, Gizicki says, “We had conversations about: What can this sound like? How far can we push it?” 


	“The obstacle was just reverence,” he continues. But “I think we who are reverent also sort of have blinders on because … ‘Jedi Rocks.' Enough said.”


	Gizicki is referring to the funky pop song that Lucas inserted into the 1997 “Special Edition” of Return of the Jedi, written by Jerry Hey and performed by a CGI band. “Jedi Rocks” is both an anomaly and a healthy reminder: Star Wars music, even under Lucas, was always more eclectic than just heroic brass fanfares and noble leitmotifs.


	Even in the original Star Wars, Williams wrote galactic bebop for the alien “Cantina Band,” and for Jedi, he wrote bizarro baroque music for Jabba's palace and the jungly celebration song “Yub Nub” for the Ewok choir. (At one point, Lucas considered hiring the band Toto to write a finale song.) For the prequel films, Williams stretched his score palette to include pagan choral cantatas, throat singing — and, yes, even electric guitar.

	











	But as new composers were tasked with stepping into his Chewbacca-sized shoes, the prevailing “house” style Williams had so firmly established loomed like an enormous shadow. Most of the scorers for these satellite Star Wars projects grew up worshiping Williams, who inspired some of them to become composers themselves. They were also working for Kathleen Kennedy, an old friend of Williams, and for Disney — a modern corporation reluctant to take experimental risks.


	John Powell, who scored 2018's Solo: A Star Wars Story, joked to composer Michael Giacchino (Rogue One) that the assignment was “like walking through a minefield in clown shoes.”


	The first serious break from the prevailing Williams soundtrack came courtesy of Jon Favreau and The Mandalorian. For the inaugural Disney+ Star Wars series, Favreau wanted to take this familiar-but-new character into familiar-but-new musical territory. He found the perfect co-pilot in composer Ludwig Göransson, who had proved he could stir the beloved, nostalgic flavors of Bill Conti's Rocky music into a fresh, hip-hoppy dish with his score for Creed.


	“There's only one John Williams, and no one's going to make that music better than what he did,” says Göransson. “I think what I proved with Creed was how you can take a franchise and breathe new life into it while still honoring it.”


	Göransson realized that “if you start with orchestra and strings or brass, you're just doomed from the beginning” — so he began by messing around with bass recorders, electric guitar, sampled boot spurs and synths. He eventually found his way into a Williams-esque main theme for Mando, still with lots of elegant Star Wars-ian orchestration, but he infused his score with Old West, samurai and retro-futuristic elements for a satisfying mutation that was entirely his own.

	











Andor stretched the definition even further. Composer Nicholas Britell and showrunner Tony Gilroy took a conceptual approach, coding each of the story's cultures with its own musical language; the planet Ferrix, for instance, was scored with metallurgical sounds. Britell wrote in-world funeral music for live musicians playing retrofitted instruments, and he also used analog synths to evoke the sense of a “retro past.” (Season two is co-scored by Brandon Roberts.)


	In both cases, Göransson and Britell were working for creators with eccentric visions and creative autonomy. When Natalie Holt was asked to score the Obi-Wan Kenobi series, she had to satisfy both director Deborah Chow's desire for a more modern sound and Kennedy's decision to commission Williams for a main theme and insisting on more orchestral nostalgia.


	“It was a lot of pressure,” admits Holt, who received helpful encouragement from Giacchino and Powell as she began her daunting task of scoring a beloved character — and writing a new Darth Vader theme. “I think Ludwig and Nicholas had an easier time,” she says, “because they were in a different area where there's less expectation. Michael and John and I had more of that weight of responsibility, of dealing with beloved heritage characters who already had themes.”


	When the show Loki came out, Holt's socials filled with “unadulterated fan love” — but when Obi-Wan premiered, “it was a bit more mixed,” she laughs. “Obviously Marvel fans are hugely passionate, but they don't come with quite the same level of, what's the word … interrogation?”

	











	There is reverence, but also more leeway, on the interactive side. Composer Gordy Haab has done impressive Grammy-winning work in a Williams accent on games like Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. But these games also feature a diverse variety of in-world music, including tunes by Mongolian metal band The Hu. The music team for Survivor cooked up a wild setlist — “Mos Eisley Cantina by way of Coachella,” as Electronic Arts president of music Steve Schnur put it — and enlisted actual Coachella acts, indie bands like Joywave and Altın Gün, to provide original jukebox tunes that characters (and players) can jam out to inside Pyloon's Saloon.


	“My audience is obviously much younger than the fans of the movies from the '70s and the '90s, in many cases,” says Douglas Reilly, vp at Lucasfilm Games. “They also expect the music to match what they are doing in a way that is very different than what we do on the linear side. I think our incremental approach has allowed us to explore that space, and to push those boundaries, but not do it in a way that breaks fan expectation around what this stuff sounds like overall — and it still feels like Star Wars music at the end of the day. … That balance of new and old is the alchemy that makes the fans feel like they're having something authentic.”


	So what, exactly, is Star Wars music?


	“Jedi Rocks.” Enough said.

Following the deaths of his wife and son, a Texas rancher fights to keep the land that is his family's legacy, and to win over the heart of the woman he's loved for years.


							By 

	Angie Han


Television Critic


	It was around perhaps the third episode of Ransom Canyon that I finally realized what Netflix's new Western-themed romantic drama reminded me of: Varsity Valley. Which, to be clear, is not some cheesy primetime soap but a parody of one — specifically, the one that plays in the foreground of Saturday Night Live's “Waffle House” sketch, while absolute mayhem reigns in the background. In other words, it's a “show” made specifically to be ignored, generic enough to slide right off your brain but familiar enough that you get the basic idea anyway. 

	











Ransom Canyon, though it is a real series, feels much the same. It is featureless and formulaic, happy to borrow just a fraction of your attention while you mostly focus on other things. This is not entirely a net negative, or at least not for everyone; background shows can have their place in an omnivorous TV diet. But it can, the longer and more closely you try to watch it, make for a stultifying experience.

The Bottom Line

	
	Best enjoyed while drifting off on the couch.
	



Airdate: Thursday, April 17 (Netflix)Cast: Josh Duhamel, Minka Kelly, James Brolin, Eoin Macken, Lizzy Greene, Andrew Liner, Marianly Tejada, Garrett Wareing, Jack SchumacherCreator: April Blair			
			







	Created by April Blair, the drama opens in the long wake of one tragedy and on the immediate precipice of another. On the night of his birthday, teenager Randall Kirkland (Hubert Smielecki) is killed in a car crash, devastating his father, Staten (Josh Duhamel), who'd also lost the boy's mother two years prior. One year out from Randall's accident, Staten's barely starting to get out from under his grief, with the patient and persistent support of Quinn (Minka Kelly), his late wife's best friend and the owner of what appears to be the only bar in the sleepy Texan town of Ransom Canyon.


	That Staten and Quinn are deeply in love, and maybe always have been, is obvious from the first time we see them spot each other in a crowded room. But they're unable to be together for … well, for no very good reason, beyond Ransom Canyon's need to stretch out the will-they-won't-they over a ten-hour season. Ditto the parallel romantic situation unfolding among the community's junior set, involving good-girl cheerleader Lauren (Lizzy Green), her rich asshole boyfriend Reid (Andrew Liner) and her wrong-side-of-the-tracks paramour Lucas (Garrett Wareing).


	The series throws a lot of other subplots into the mix too, including the halfhearted mystery of what truly happened to Randall (Staten is convinced another driver was present at the scene, to the great irritation of a sheriff played by Philip Winchester); the devious plans by Austin Water & Power to get ranchers like Staten to sell over their land for the construction of a new pipeline; and the arrival in town of a mysterious drifter (Jack Schumacher's Yancy) who dutifully fills the show's quota for scenes of a buff shirtless man doing farm chores.

	











	But it's the love stories that Ransom Canyon is concerned with first and foremost. Everything else, from the tornado that rips through town to the bitter rivalry between Staten and his former brother-in-law Davis (Eoin Macken), is just so much fodder for make-outs or break-ups. 


	Given that the series is adapted from Jodi Thomas' Texas-set romance novels, the emphasis on affairs of the heart is to be expected. But the smooth, flat execution makes it feel like the output of a market research meeting about Yellowstone and Virgin River‘s strong viewership numbers, more than a passion project for anyone involved.


	It's wholly unobjectionable, which is not the same thing as saying it's actively enjoyable. The plot is complicated in that the characters make a habit of abrupt changes of heart and earnest speeches explaining said changes, but simple in that we're never left in any doubt as to what's eventually supposed to happen. The rural Texas landscapes aren't quite beautiful in a way that evokes grandeur or a distinctive point of view, but they're benignly pretty in the way that a stock photo or a catalog image might be pretty.


	The characters fall neatly into shopworn archetypes — strong silent cowboy, too-slick businessman, bad boy with a heart of gold, etc. — and are easy to root for in the sense that none of them are interesting enough to be worth rooting against. The casting is serviceable in this regard. Duhamel is perfectly agreeable in a role that makes capable use of his smoky voice and “less idiosyncratic Timothy Olyphant” looks. Kelly brings a pleasant warmth to Quinn, though the fact that she's mostly called upon here to cast indulgent looks toward Staten seems an underuse of the depth she showed as Texan golden girl Lyla Garrity on Friday Night Lights.

	











	Neither of them, nor really anyone else in the cast for that matter, manages to elevate these characters to the point of an actual personality. But that seems less a fault of their performances than it does of writing that allows these characters no nuance to play with, and no space to grow. For all the down-home grumbling about legacy and loyalty, the people of Ransom Canyon are a hopelessly fickle bunch, prone to tearfully confessing their feelings in one episode, only to coldly reject each other the next, only to go back to tearfully confessing their feelings again the one after that.


	While such endless back-and-forth makes for unsatisfying character development, it does make for plotlines that go down almost too easy — that do not ask you to dial into the subtleties of a person's emotions or track their evolution or even remember what happened an episode or two earlier. 


	Depending on how you plan to watch it, this might be a bug or a feature. If you're hoping to get fully swept up in a story, Ransom Canyon won't be it; it's too bland to command your notice for more than a few minutes at a time. But if you're looking for some background noise to throw on while you drift off on the couch? Well, then, Staten Kirkland just might be your guy.

The second and final season of the fantasy series has a teaser trailer and an unusual release strategy. 


							By

Writer-at-Large


	Major news in the long-awaited return of Netflix‘s The Sandman. 


	The streamer has released a teaser trailer (below) for the second and final season of the fantasy series, which stars Tom Sturridge as Dream. There's also a premiere date — well, actually, two launch dates, as Netflix has decided to split the roll out of the second season into two parts. 




	Volume 1 will comprise six episodes to debut July 3, while Volume 2 will have five episodes premiering July 24. It's a strategy Netflix usually reserves for its highest-profile titles (such as Stranger Things).

	Here's the official description: “After a fateful reunion with his family, Dream of the Endless (Tom Sturridge) must face one impossible decision after another as he attempts to save himself, his kingdom, and the waking world from the epic fallout of his past misdeeds. To make amends, Dream must confront longtime friends and foes, gods, monsters, and mortals. But the path to forgiveness is full of unexpected twists and turns, and true absolution may cost Dream everything. Based on the beloved award-winning DC comic series, the second season of The Sandman will tell Dream's story arc in full to its thrilling conclusion.” 


	The second and final season is from showrunner Allan Heinberg and director Jamie Childs. The show has been caught up in controversy for being based on the DC comic by Neil Gaiman (along with Sam Keith, and Mike Dringenberg). Gaiman — who is also an executive producer on the series — has been accused of sexual misconduct and has been sued for sexual assault.


	Following those allegations in January, Netflix announced the second season of The Sandman would be its last. “The Sandman series has always been focused exclusively on Dream's story, and back in 2022, when we looked at the remaining Dream material from the comics, we knew we only had enough story for one more season,” Heinberg said in a statement. “We are extremely grateful to Netflix for bringing the team all back together and giving us the time and resources to make a faithful adaptation in a way that we hope will surprise and delight the comics' loyal readers as well as fans of our show.”


	The allegations came amid Gaiman having several other projects at various stages, including the Amazon miniseries Anansi Boys and a concluding 90-minute episode of Amazon's Good Omens.

	











	Season one of The Sandman premiered in August 2022 to largely positive reviews from critics and fairly strong audience numbers. It spent seven weeks in Netflix's worldwide top 10 (based on the company's internal data) and six weeks on the Nielsen streaming charts in the United States.


	But the allegations against Gaiman has overshadowed the series. He was accused of sexual misconduct by several women last year in a podcast titled Master, produced by Tortoise Media. On Jan. 13, a New York magazine story detailed several more allegations against the writer. 


	Gaiman denied the allegations in a blog post, writing, “I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever. I went back to read the messages I exchanged with the women around and following the occasions that have subsequently been reported as being abusive. These messages read now as they did when I received them — of two people enjoying entirely consensual sexual relationships and wanting to see one another again. At the time I was in those relationships, they seemed positive and happy on both sides.”

BTS‘ Jin announced the dates for his first-ever solo tour on Thursday (April 17), the #RUNSEOKJIN_EP.TOUR. The outing that incorporates the singer's full given name (Kim Seok-jin) will hit nine cities around the globe for two nights each, kicking off with a double-down at the Goyang Auxiliary Stadium in Goyang, South Korea on June 28 and 29, before moving on to the Makuhari Messe International Exhibition Hall in Chiba, Japan on July 5-6.


	After a stop in Osaka, Japan for another pair of dates, the tour will jump to the U.S. for shows in California, Texas, Florida and New Jersey before winding down with two-fers in London and Amsterdam in August.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	The tour reveal comes just two days after Jin announced the release date for his second solo album, Echo, which is due out on May 16. The collection is the follow-up the K-pop superstar's 2024 debut solo effort, Happy. “Aiming to connect on a deeper level with fans through music, Echo offers Jin's perspective on universal life experiences, capturing everyday emotions with warmth and sincerity,” read a statement. “Built on dynamic band sounds, the album showcases his versatile vocals across a spectrum of moods and styles. It reflects a deeper layer of vocal maturity and personal storytelling that underscores Jin's evolving artistry.”


	Jin was the seventh, and final, member of BTS to release a full solo LP and his second album will drop while ARMY awaits word on when the full band will reunite following a nearly three-year hiatus to allow its members to complete mandatory South Korean military service. At press time no official time table for the band's return has been announced.

Amid her astronomical rise, the singer-songwriter is trying to stay true to what has gotten her this far: her honest way with words, and the fans who deeply relate to them.


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



At the beginning of the year, Gracie Abrams found herself in a rare bind. For one of the first times in her life, she says, “I felt like I had nothing to say.”


	The 25-year-old musician had scheduled a week to spend at Long Pond Studio working on new music with her longtime collaborator, Aaron Dessner, when she realized that she was at a loss for inspiration — a frustrating position for Abrams, who isn't just one of Gen Z's most prolific songwriters, but has also been writing songs since she was a kid. “I was actually quite aggravated with myself that I had booked that time,” she says now, months later. “I went into it being like, ‘Oh, I'm going to waste Aaron's time.' I felt a little bit disconnected from myself.”

	











	It's understandable why Abrams might have felt at loose ends. After releasing her second album, the Dessner-produced The Secret of Us, last June, she went from the cusp of main-pop-girl status to bona fide stardom and has careened ever since on a career-affirming thrill ride that refuses to slow down. The witty, self-effacing album full of catchy acoustic anthems and searing appraisals of romantic disappointments debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200, and Abrams' momentum only snowballed that fall when its deluxe version produced her first top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hit, “That's So True,” a snarky post-breakup kiss-off that became inescapable on TikTok. She has also been traveling basically nonstop for years, piggybacking a catalytic stint opening for Taylor Swift — her childhood hero — on The Eras Tour with her own sold-out fall run of U.S. theaters; she'll play North American arenas this summer, including two nights at New York's Madison Square Garden.


	Add to that list a second Grammy nomination (best pop duo performance for “us.,” her duet with Swift), her first turn as Saturday Night Live musical guest and the monthlong run of arena dates she wrapped in Europe just days before our conversation, and we're almost caught up with everything Abrams has accomplished over the past 10 months. On this March evening, she's poised and seemingly at ease with the nonstop nature of her life lately as we talk beside a vintage-looking piano tucked inside Ella's Lounge at the Brooklyn Paramount, where in a few hours, she and Dessner will play an acoustic charity show supporting World Central Kitchen at what is now, for her, an exceedingly rare small-venue stop. But she admits the pressure does occasionally get to her, as it did during that bout of writer's block over the new year.

	











	“ ‘That's So True' was the first song I've had that did what it did,” she explains, a cup of tea steeping nearby to help combat a sinus infection lingering from the tour. “Every time I sat down to try to write something, I felt a little sick. I was thinking, like, ‘How do I do something that will beat it?'


	“There are more people [than ever] telling you what's going on charts-wise, radio-wise, streaming numbers, whatever,” she says. “That can start to be internalized, and I actually really hate how that feels.”


	Since she signed to Interscope Records in 2019, Abrams and her team have strategically built up to this moment. Constantly releasing music and touring, her crowd sizes have ballooned as each project has performed better than the last; after a couple of EPs, she earned her first Billboard 200 entry in 2023 with debut album Good Riddance, also produced by Dessner, peaking at No. 52. Her rapid ascent since is comparable to those of fellow 2024 breakouts Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan — though Abrams is hesitant to see herself as their peer. “When I think about both of their rises, it's like, boom,” she says, her eyes widening. “I feel like I've almost slipped under the radar a little bit [in comparison].”


	But to the extent that may be true, it's only because of how steadily she has grown over the past several years. “This is obviously her big breakout moment, but there was no skipping of steps or taking shortcuts,” Interscope Capitol chairman/CEO John Janick tells Billboard. “She never wanted to rush anything — she really cared and wanted to make sure people heard her music in the right way and really connected with it. We're all just trying to figure out how to continue to make the train move.”

	











	Right now, that means simply trying to keep up with how fast things are happening. Backstage at the Paramount, where much of Abrams' team is gathered to support her tonight, Interscope Geffen A&M (IGA) vp of pop/rock marketing Hannah Gold explains that they meet “every Tuesday without fail” to discuss how they can best pounce on opportunities, like when the star's live Vevo performance of Secret of Us single “I Love You, I'm Sorry” started going viral in October. They immediately clocked the trend and released the recording on streaming services, which boosted the studio version of the track to a new Hot 100 peak of No. 19 shortly after. “It's kind of like the war room where we're like, ‘OK, what are the things that we can do to help this spark that's happening organically?' ” she says.


	But while her label is tuned into all that's buzzing around her, Abrams' strategy for staying above water is entirely the opposite. She has learned to spend as little time as possible scrolling social media, where everything from her signature bob and chiseled abs to her rumored romance with actor Paul Mescal have become lightning rods for discourse, and incessant stan wars are fueled by people picking apart her music and pitting her against her peers. As Abrams sees it, as long as she doesn't look at the hate, “It doesn't exist.


	“I can know that 10 people a day are having that conversation on Twitter — that's cool for them,” she continues, shrugging. “I'm just going to mind my own business, really. I feel like any time I've slipped into paying too much attention to that, I'm less present in my life, I'm less available for people I know and love. It's not good for me as a person, it's not good for the art that I want to make. It's boring as hell.”

	











	Ignoring her own inner voices is harder. She eventually pushed through with Dessner at Long Pond and emerged with a handful of songs that are the foundation for her next project — likely a new album, she thinks, though she has considered dividing the material into EPs. But making sure she's not psyching herself out as her career takes flight is a continual challenge.


	“I've just been trying to take the pressure off myself to have to reinvent,” she says. “I hope that I don't get in my own way so much.”


It's two hours until showtime, and there are so. Many. Bows. These accessories, part of the unofficial Gracie fan uniform, adorn the heads of both girls so young they have to hold a parent's hand as they cross Flatbush Avenue in Downtown Brooklyn and young women old enough to grab drinks at the bar before taking their seats at the venue.


	Though smaller than usual, the gathering here offers a sample-size glance at the types of crowds Abrams has been drawing. Many of the fans are newbies who caught on to her after her recent career spike, like 7-year-old Ara, who discovered her on Spotify just months ago but is now Abrams-obsessed. To prove it, she and best friend Mazzy passionately perform the bridge of lead Secret of Us single “Risk” for me and reveal that, inspired by their new idol, they've started writing songs together.


	But there are also O.G. fans like 18-year-old Ariana, who tells me she has adored Abrams since she first heard enduring fan-favorite deep cut “21” and saw her back in 2022 at the Bowery Ballroom. She says that watching her favorite musician's explosion over the past few months — after previously thinking of Abrams as “my little underground artist” — has felt “insane,” her bow rippling as she shakes her head incredulously.


	It's crazy to Abrams, too. Growing up in Los Angeles, she didn't have grandiose pop star ambitions. As a studious, introverted kid, she simply found songwriting therapeutic — “It was what made me feel like I could, like, bear everything,” she says — and took inspiration from Swift and Joni Mitchell, whom she recalls listening to on car rides to school with her mother. The daughter of director J.J. Abrams and production executive Katie McGrath, she spent the first couple years of her career fielding questions about being a so-called “nepo baby”; now, she has arguably surpassed her dad's level of fame (well, at least in the eyes of Gen Z).

	











	When Interscope first expressed interest in her as a teenager, it had nothing to do with Abrams' Hollywood pedigree. “She's done this on her own without taking any of the shortcuts,” Janick says, remarking that he still hasn't even met the singer's parents. “It was purely signing her based on how she was as a person and a songwriter. That's what we were interested in.”


	The label was drawn in by Abrams' honest, evocative pen, which she started showcasing in high school by using Instagram as an “impulsive diary” to upload song snippets and bond with the ever-growing base of followers who related to her lyrics. She says she was wary at first about involving a third party in her relationship with those fans — because “it did feel so personal from the jump” — but Interscope was willing from the beginning to make sure doing right by her listeners informed every decision. After spending a year studying international relations at Barnard College, she eventually felt comfortable signing with the label.


	“I mean this in the greatest way possible: I don't think it feels like there's a major label running things,” she tells me backstage before she is whisked away to get ready. “Everything — and I hope that the fans feel this way, too — feels as connected as it did six years ago.”

	











	That bond is on full display tonight as Abrams takes the stage in Brooklyn, where she stops to chat with audience members and reciprocate screamed “I love you's” between almost every song. Four separate times, she and Dessner are interrupted by a different fan shouting to say that it's their birthday today; each time, she gasps ­sincerely and offers felicitations.


	“The way she respects her fans, herself and her craft are an inspiration to me,” Noah Kahan, who tapped Abrams for his “Everywhere, Everything” remix in 2023, tells Billboard. “And a reminder that you can live a crazy and unfamiliar life and still remain true to who you are.”


	Abrams has strived to create these types of community spaces with her fans since the beginning of her career, even when they couldn't gather in person. When the pandemic forced her to cancel her first-ever tour in 2020, she concocted an idea for a series of virtual 100-­capacity gigs — dubbed Minor Bedroom Shows — that were available by city to mimic the course she originally had scheduled, something her team thinks planted the seeds for her booming international demand today. “She was like, ‘I want to route it like a tour,' ” IGA's Gold recalls. “ ‘I want the fans in each market to start meeting each other so when they come to see me in real life, they know each other.' ”


	The Zoom shows also helped cultivate an audience that was desperate to see her in real life once she hit the road, something she finally did in September 2021, when she performed for the very first time before 300 people at the Constellation Room in Orange County. Then in 2022, Olivia Rodrigo, an early and vocal champion of Abrams, offered her the first of two crucial supporting gigs in Abrams' touring career. “She gave me such a shot, opening for her on the SOUR tour,” she says of Rodrigo. “I adore her with my whole heart for forever and ever.”

	











	Rodrigo gushes right back. “Gracie has such a singular voice when it comes to songwriting,” she tells Billboard. “I think it's rare to be so young and already have developed your very own lane. You can hear a song and instantly know if it's a Gracie Abrams song even if she wasn't singing it. That is so special and a real testament to her talent and influence.”


	Carole Kinzel and Shirin Nury, Abrams' agents at CAA, were already planning her 2023 Good Riddance tour when the friendship-beaded opportunity of a lifetime came knocking: an invitation to support Swift on the biggest stadium trek in history. They quickly rerouted some of Abrams' headlining dates to make it work — “Quite honestly, for an opportunity like that, we would have rearranged just about anything,” Kinzel says — and she spent six months across 2023 and 2024 flourishing under her idol's wing. Studying Swift every night on the road, Abrams learned to command stadiums that would swallow most artists up while managing to also make them feel intimate. The lessons have come in handy on her Secret of Us tour, where she has made packed arenas feel cozy by performing on a B-stage decorated to look like her bedroom, a callback to her backdrop in those first virtual shows.


	Tracking her progression, it's natural to wonder if Swift-size stadiums are in Abrams' future as a headliner. Her CAA team thinks they're in reach — but is that something she wants for herself? “Hell yeah,” Abrams answers without hesitation.

	











	But then she pauses. “I could have never imagined myself admitting to that,” she continues, more slowly. “I think having had the privilege of opening for Taylor in the stadiums that we played, to now have a visual reference and a real sense of what it feels like to be on a stage in that environment… It's something that I miss and desperately hope to earn over time.”


A week after the Paramount show, Abrams is still glowing. “It was a sweet little hang,” she says brightly over the phone.


	She's on the opposite coast now, back in her native Los Angeles and in a car on her way to rehearsal for Billboard's Women in Music, where she'll perform “I Love You, I'm Sorry” and accept the Songwriter of the Year honor — and, hopefully, catch up with Doechii, whose music Abrams says she's “quite addicted to” at the moment. (A video from the ceremony will later show the two chopping it up.) She also says she has been streaming Lady Gaga's MAYHEM nonstop: “When I think about songwriter greats, she has been top of mind recently.”


	Moments for her own songwriting seem to come fewer and farther between these days, but Abrams finds them whenever she can. Despite having only three weeks between the end of the Secret of Us tour's European leg and the Asia run's April 3 kickoff show in Singapore, she spent a precious free Saturday with Dessner at New York's Electric Lady Studios before heading to L.A. Abrams says they went in hoping to nail just one particular song, but emerged 12 hours later having worked on “a bunch” of tracks for the next project, which comes together in her head more and more with each scattered studio session.


	“Aaron and I are catching each other in these little pockets between hectic times,” she explains. “Every day that I live with the music, things start to become a little clearer. There's something we're starting to crack that is making both of us feel energized.”


	She also found time recently to reteam with one of her first collaborators. Abrams initially met Benny Blanco when she was dating his then-intern, Blake Slatkin (who produced much of her early work), and first worked with him over five years ago on minor's title track, which was followed by her appearance on his 2021 song “Unlearn.” For “Call Me When You Break Up,” off Blanco's new collaborative album with fiancée Selena Gomez, he tapped Abrams to guest — and with a No. 46 Hot 100 peak, the track became her seventh career entry on the chart.

	











	“What's so cool about her music is that she really tells it how it is, whether it makes her look great or not so great,” Blanco raves on a call. He remembers how she was once “much more shy” in the studio and says he was “blown away” by how quickly and confidently Abrams stacked her own harmonies on “Call Me.”


	“She makes these songs that are huge in stadiums now, yet they also still feel like she's whispering them into your ear in your bedroom at three in the morning,” he adds, excitedly pointing out that his car just passed a billboard in Manhattan with her face on it. “She's just a force to be reckoned with.”


	The billboard, it happens, was for Hourglass Cosmetics, which just announced Abrams as the face of its new campaign. She's also a Chanel ambassador; her CAA team carefully curated both deals to bring her more opportunities beyond music — though Kinzel and Nury note that they're “saying no to a lot” because of how full Abrams' plate already is. (Abrams also tells me that she has “loads of ambitions” outside of songwriting and touring, but those, for now, are “sacred.” When I ask if she would like to act, she replies politely, “I don't know what I want to attempt to speak into existence at this point in time,” though she does say she may someday like to compile her poetry and journal musings from years on the road into a book or something similar.)


	One thing Abrams definitely saves room for, though, is celebrating the people who've helped get her to where she is. The day before our call, she attended She Is the Music's Women Sharing the Spotlight event highlighting the work of her mostly female team — much of which has been with her since the beginning — and accepted an award on the group's behalf. “It's definitely been intentional,” Abrams says of professionally surrounding herself with “badass women.” “I lean on these women. I admire the way that they work. I think all of us are equally invested, and I think that the fact that we get to learn from each other is a really beautiful thing.”


	“Gracie is an artist who lives and breathes what she stands for — and she wants women at the table, period,” adds Abrams' longtime manager, Alex DePersia. “For me, being in this group of women who genuinely support each other is so, so powerful.”

	











	Abrams also feels lucky to have some of the women she has looked up to since she was a tween become mentors she can turn to if she ever needs advice. There's Lorde, who's a calming presence just to be around — “She's like 800 years old inside … whenever we're together, I feel my nervous system regulate differently” — and of course, Swift. When things start to get overwhelming by way of public scrutiny, Abrams says simply being in the Eras superstar's orbit helps put things in perspective.


	“It's like, I really don't have it that bad in terms of invasion of privacy, you know what I mean?” she says. “I feel like I learned a lot from her, obviously, but one of the things that I've felt lucky to observe is how extreme it can be [for her]. It helps right-size my own s–t.”


	On that front, Abrams says she hasn't let prying eyes or snapping phone cameras change how she approaches her everyday life or dating. (“That would be so unfortunate,” she says with a laugh.) And, much like Swift, she also continues to write about her relationships in vivid detail, regardless of how many listeners may or may not be dissecting the lyrics for clues about, say, a certain Gladiator II star.


	Overall, she seems strikingly well-adjusted to the public pressures of her mounting fame. Maybe it's because of her upbringing, or the fact that she has been preparing for this moment so gradually for the past six years, but “That's So True” co-writer Audrey Hobert suggests that her childhood best friend is simply preternaturally suited for greatness.

	











	“She's completely built for it,” Hobert tells me over Zoom in the middle of unpacking her new L.A. apartment. (The pair previously lived together for two years in the city, writing much of The Secret of Us in their shared digs, but Abrams recently relocated to New York to be closer to work, telling me that “the walking of it all is really good for my brain.”)


	“I've never watched someone work harder for longer,” Hobert says. “I don't think anyone should have to go through certain aspects of what this job brings if you're really good at it and you're successful, but I would say — you don't really hear that girl complain. You don't.


	“Even to me, her safe person,” she emphasizes. “She is genuinely grateful at her core. It's not just something she says.”


	For Abrams, it's a clear creative vision and sense of purpose that sustains her — even in flashes of self-doubt when, for a moment, she can't quite find the right words. That's why she says one of her main priorities now is finding ways to stay centered during all the chaos, whether by journaling constantly, daydreaming about “disappearing to the woods” to spend “days and days reading” as soon as her schedule relents or redefining what exactly “topping” herself means: writing a song, perhaps, that makes her feel even more passionate than composing “That's So True” drunk on the roof of Electric Lady with Hobert did, even if that song never beats it in terms of numbers. Take away all the noise and, from the beginning, it's always just been about her writing and whom she writes for — and she wants to make sure she's not missing out on either by moving a “million miles an hour.”


	“I think the best use of me as a human being on this planet, at least right now, is trying to use my writing or storytelling to make as many people as possible feel connected to themselves and to this community,” she says.


	With conviction coloring her voice, she adds: “That is what I think I'm here for right now.”

The actress, who hit the charts with her work on Buffy the Vampire Slayer's iconic musical episode, passed away in February at the age of 39.

	Almost two months on from the death of actress Michelle Trachtenberg, the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner has revealed the cause of her passing.


	According to People, a spokesperson from the Chief Medical Examiner's Office confirmed on Wednesday (April 16) that the actress's passing was ruled as natural, resulting from complications of diabetes mellitus.

	“The amended determination was made following review of toxicology testing results,” the spokesperson said, noting that a “toxicology testing can be done without autopsy.”

	Trachtenberg died on Feb. 26 at the age of 39, with New York City emergency services responding to an emergency call where they discovered the actress “unconscious and unresponsive.” 


	Though her death was not treated as suspicious, Trachtenberg's family declined an autopsy on grounds related to their Jewish faith, with her death therefore expected to be officially ruled as “undetermined.” However, the review of the toxicology results has ultimately provided a form of closure for those close to the actress.


	A New York native, Trachtenberg began acting as a child, receiving her breakthrough role by starring in the film Harriet the Spy in 1996, released when she was just 10. By then, she had also made multiple appearances on ABC's All My Children — working with Sarah Michelle Gellar. That connection led to Trachtenberg joining Gellar on Buffy the Vampire Slayer from 2000 through its 2003 finale.


	In 2001, the series' sixth season featured one of its most innovative and revered episodes, the musical Once More, with Feeling. While most of the show's stars had their singing talents showcased prominently, Trachtenberg – a trained ballet dancer – requested her dancing skills be the main focus for her appearance. Her vocal talents weren't entirely absent, however, opening the episode's coda, “Where Do We Go From Here?,” singing the opening title line a cappella.


	The 23-song Once More, with Feeling soundtrack was subsequently released (on Mutant Enemy/Twentieth Century Fox/Rounder Records). Mirroring the show's trademark witty dialog (one lyric features singing-averse Alyson Hannigan admitting, “I think this line's mostly filler”), the set slayed Billboard's charts, most notably debuting at its No. 3 best on the Soundtracks chart — a year after the episode aired. It also hit the Billboard 200 and Independent Albums charts.

	











	To date, the album has drawn more than 23 million streams in the U.S., according to Luminate.


	Trachtenberg's presence in the world of music also extended beyond the world of Buffy, with the actress also appearing in music videos for acts such as Trapt and Ringside, and Fall Out Boy's “This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race,” which peaked at No. 2 on the Hot 100.

Tetris Kelly:Bringing the ‘Chella vibes with my girl. Uncle Waffles, what's going on, boo? 


	Uncle Waffles:Hey! 


We're happy to have you here, but you gotta start by saying, you know, for the people out there that don't know you, how did you come up with the name? How did we get there? 


	So I'm Uncle Waffles. There isn't really a cool backstory. My friends came up with it in high school, and it just kind of carried on to where I am currently. It was never meant to be Uncle Waffles. It was just meant to be “Waffles,” but my manager decided that “Uncle Waffles” made me more unique. So here we are.


Listen, my name is Tetris, girl, so I understand. It also was a high school nickname, so it just happens. And then here we are. 


	Then here you are, like, yeah, I love it. 


Well, you're playing one of the hottest parties at Coachella. I gotta say, I'll be having myself a good time at Revolve. So how do you feel to be heading out there? 


	I am so excited. I'm so excited to be bringing the sound to the world. You know, I know a lot of people. They probably won't know what amapiano is, but I'm excited to be their first experience of it. I hope everyone loves it after they get to see me, you know.

					By Nellie Andreeva 

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	An original Emily In Paris cast member is leaving but it may not be who you think as all three of Emily's (Lily Collins) romantic interests will be back next season. That includes OG flame Gabriel, played by Lucas Bravo, following months of speculation whether the actor will continue on the show.


	Announcing a May start of production on Season 5 — first in Rome and then in Paris — for a 2025 premiere, Netflix has confirmed returning cast for the new installment. It includes Season 3 series regulars Collins (Emily Cooper), Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu (Sylvie Grateau), Ashley Park (Mindy Chen), Bravo (Gabriel), Samuel Arnold (Julien), Bruno Gouery (Luc) and William Abadie (Antoine Lambert) as well as Lucien Laviscount as Emily's former boyfriend Alfie, who, as Deadline reported in January, will be back full-time next season, and Eugenio Franceschini (Marcello) who was introduced in Season 4 as new recurring character. No word yet on fellow new addition Thalia Besson (Genevieve) who also may join them.

	











	The list hints that Franceschini, whose Italian heir Marcello was romancing Emily at the end of Season 4, may have been promoted to a series regular, though Netflix would not reveal the status of the returning cast beyond confirming that all will be in multiple episodes.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Missing from the list of returning cast is Camille Razat, who had been a series regular for the first four seasons as Camille, Emily's onetime friend and main rival for Gabriel's heart. This is not surprising as Camille packed up and left toward the end of Season 4 after one last go at a relationship with Gabriel under false pretenses as she faked a pregnancy.


	Asked by Deadline at the time of the Season 4 release in September whether Alfie and Camille were both out of the picture, Emily In Paris creator Darren Star said, “Not necessarily. I mean people come and go out of people's lives in shows for a period of time, but it doesn't mean that they're off the table.”


	It is not clear whether Alfie will be back for work, love or both. His boss Antoine also is returning next season, and the last time we saw Alfie, he had moved on from Emily with a new girlfriend, though Emily In Paris is known for keeping on-and-off romances going.


	Questions about Bravo's return for Season 5 started circulating in October when the actor admitted publicly that he was unsure whether he wanted to continue, admitting he felt “frustrated” and playing Gabriel was “not fun anymore” as the character was “being slowly turned into guacamole.”

	











	As Deadline reported in January, while U.S. series typically have series regular cast members under multi-year contracts, they don't have options on French actors like Bravo, so he had to sign on to return. At the time, conversations with the actor already had started and were moving in a positive direction.


	As expected, given that Emily was asked to relocate to Rome for work at the end of the Season 4 finale, Season 5 will begin production in Rome, this May before moving to Paris later in the summer.


	“She didn't change her Instagram handle to Emily in Rome. She is working in Rome sometimes. Sylvie's company has an office in Rome. Emily's getting that on its feet,” Star told Deadline in September. “I don't necessarily think that it means a permanent — in my mind, it's definitely not a permanent — move to Rome. We're not leaving Paris.”


	It will be a very quick turnaround because Netflix has confirmed that, as announced in January, Season 5 will premiere in 2025. 


	Creator-writer Star executive produces Emily In Paris with Tony Hernandez, Lilly Burns, Andrew Fleming, Stephen Brown, Alison Brown, Robin Schiff, Grant Sloss and Joe Murphy. The series is produced by MTV Entertainment Studios, Darren Star Productions and Jax Media.

EXCLUSIVE: Terrifier franchise backer Cineverse has announced the start of production for its reimagining of cult Santa slasher movie Silent Night, Deadly Night in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

					Cineverse Sets Iconic Events To Distribute 'The Toxic Avenger' Summer Reboot Of Troma Comedy-Horror Franchise		
			








	The movie is scheduled to release in the North America in time for Christmas 2025 on December 12.




			Watch on Deadline		







Silent Night, Deadly Night tells the story of a child who is traumatized after seeing his parents killed by a man dressed as Santa Claus. Years later, he dons a Santa suit himself and gets bloody revenge. The movie spawned multiple sequels over the years and a loose remake in 2012.


	The reboot of the franchise, Silent Night, Deadly Night is written and directed by Mike P. Nelson (Wrong Turn, V/H/S/85) and produced by the original 1984 Tri-Star film's producers Scott Schneid and Dennis Whitehead and New Dimension's Jamie R. Thompson (Old Henry, Gunslingers), Rebel 6's Erik Bernard, and White Bear Films' Jeremy Torrie


	Crew for the film include Director of Photography Nick Junkersfeld, Production Designer Oscar Fenogolio, Costume Designer Laura DeLuca, Stunt Coordinator Kristen Sawatzky, Special Effects Doug Morrow, Casting Director Jim Heber, Composers Blitz Berlin, and Line Producer Tanya Brunel.


	“As production officially kicks off this week, we are excited about the magic that is being made with both the original team behind the 1984 classic teaming up with a new vision from Mike P. Nelson,” said Cineverse Chief Content Officer Yolanda Macias. “We are delighted to welcome fans back into the Silent Night, Deadly Night universe with a reimagining that is sure to bring lots of merry mayhem.”


	“Silent Night Deadly Night has become a beloved cult classic since my partner Dennis and I created it with Michael Hickey over 40 years ago,” said original SNDN and reboot producer Schneid. “Den and I are huge fans of Mike's work, and his unique talents have reinvented the spirit of the original, taking us on a slayride that audiences won't soon forget.”

	











	When it was released in 1984, the first Silent Night, Deadly Night quickly became the most controversial movie of the year.  The film's original distributor Tri-Star pulled the film from theaters following outrage from parents, but this move only served to bolster its cult status.


	Executive producers are Steven Schneider (Insidious) Anthony Masi (Halloween: 25 Years of Terror, Unknown Dimension), and Sarah Eilts. Brandon Hill and Brad Miska (Terrifier 3) are overseeing for Cineverse and will executive produce alongside Erick Opeka and Macias, Bondit Media Capital's Matthew Helderman and Luke Taylor. Financing is Bondit Media Capital and Royal Bank of Canada.


	Studiocanal is handling worldwide sales excluding North America and releasing theatrically in its markets of UK & IRE, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Benelux and Poland). Silent Night, Deadly Night is the first acquisition for Studiocanal's new in-house genre label Sixth Dimension.


	Mike P Nelson is repped by Brillstein Entertainment Partners, Writ Large, and Jackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner Auerbach Hynick Jaime LeVine Sample & Klein. Campbell is represented by CAA, Webster Talent Management and Sol22. Modine is represented by UTA and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher.

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


	A Palestinian artist and photojournalist who is the protagonist of a documentary due to premiere in Cannes in May has been killed in an Israeli air strike.


	Fatima Hassouna died with nine members of her family in a direct strike on their home in Gaza City on Wednesday.


	Hassouna, who had gained international recognition for her photojournalism capturing the impact on the Gaza Strip's civilian population of the Israeli military campaign, appears in French-Iranian director Sepideh Farsi's Put Your Soul On Your Hand And Walk.

	Hassouna was killed 24 hours after the documentary was announced as having been selected for parallel Cannes section ACID, running from May 14 to 23 alongside the main festival.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The work revolves around video conversations between Farsi, whose credits include Berlinale-selected animated feature The Siren, and Hassouna. They began when the director connected with the young woman while researching a wider documentary on the events unfolding in Gaza.


	“She was such a light, so talented. When you see the film you'll understand,” Farsi told Deadline. “I had talked to her a few hours before to tell her that the film was in Cannes and to invite her.”


	Farsi recounts that Hassouna was open to the idea of attending the screening, as long as she could return to Gaza afterwards.


	“She said, ‘I'll come, but I have to go back to Gaza. I don't want to leave Gaza,” said Farsi.  “I was already in touch with the French Embassy. We'd just started the process. I was worried about how to get her out and back in safely. I didn't want to have the responsibility of separating her from her family.”


	“Now the whole family is dead. I'm trying to find out if her parents are dead but for sure Fatima and her sisters and brothers are dead. One of the sisters was pregnant. On a video call two days ago, she showed me her belly. It's so horrible and devastating. Fatima herself had gotten engaged a few months ago.”


	Farsi says she now fears that Hassouna may have been targeted because of her photojournalism work. According to figures released by the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) on February 16 at least 157 journalists and media workers have been killed in Gaza, and many more injured, since the beginning of the war. 

	











	“I was trying to be a voice and accentuate her and now I don't know. I even feel guilty… maybe they targeted her because the film was announced. I don't know. We'll never know.” she said.


	“The Israeli army said it bombed the house because there was a Hamas officer in there, which is totally false. I know the whole family. It's nonsense. It's just so devastating.”


	Israel's bombing and invasion of Gaza began in October 2023 in response to Hamas's October 7 attacks on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people and resulted in the taking of 251 hostages.


	Eighteen months on, at least 51,065 people have died according to figures released by the Hamas-run Gaza health authority, endorsed by the United Nations, although statistical research published by the Lancet medical journal in February suggested this figure may be 15,000 higher. 


	Another 116,505 people have also been injured in the Gaza Strip, while 90 percent of the territory's 2.1 million-strong population has been displaced. Of the 251 hostages taken during the October 7 attack, 59 remain in the Gaza Strip, with around 24 of them still believed to be alive.


	France's Association for the Diffusion of Independent Cinema, which organizes the ACID sidebar in Cannes and then promotes the films across the year in cinemas across France, put out a statement expressing its “horror' at the news of Hassouna's death.  


	“We met Fatima Hassouna when we discovered Sepideh Farsi's film Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk. Her smile was as magical as her tenacity: bearing witness, photographing Gaza, distributing food despite bombs, grief, and hunger. Her story reached us, and we rejoiced at each of her appearances to know she was alive; we feared for her,”  it read. “Yesterday, we learned with horror that an Israeli missile targeted her building, killing Fatima and her family.”


	“We had watched and programmed a film in which this young woman's life force was nothing short of miraculous. This is a different film than the one we will carry, support, and present in every theater, starting with Cannes.”

			By Zac Ntim, Andreas Wiseman 


EXCLUSIVE: Alliance Media Partners and the Aussie-based indie production house Prodigy Movies are taking their flick Recoil starring Chad Michael Collins (Sniper) to the upcoming Cannes Market. 


	Directed by Nick Robertson (The Pack), the film was produced by Michael Robertson and UK producer Chris Wheeldon. Robertson and Wheeldon previously teamed on the survival thriller Black Water.


	Set in an unforgiving desert, Recoil is described as a “relentless war thriller with a mind-bending supernatural twist that will grip you from the first frame and never let go.” 


	The synopsis reads: Three marooned soldiers. An immobilized infantry vehicle. The unforgiving desert. And a deadly curse that turns their reality into a waking nightmare. This is not just another Middle Eastern war film—this is war at its most psychological, its most visceral, and its most terrifying.

	“We're excited for everyone to experience the film's unapologetic intensity as the first feature movie drawing on Australia's involvement in the global ‘War on Terror' and very much look forward to working with AMP with this aim,” Robertson said in a statement. 


	Anthony Buckner, AMP's Head of Sales and Acquisitions, added: “We can't wait to throw buyers into RECOIL on the Croisette. It's a powerful mix of action, suspense, and horror that brings a new twist to the war genre as we know it.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Michelle Trachtenberg's Cause of Death Revealed by TMZ","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/michelle-trachtenberg-had-diabetes/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 00:56:15 GMT","

TMZ reported at 2:03 p.m. on April 16, 2025 that Michelle Trachtenberg‘s cause of death was complications of diabetes.

A post shared by Michelle Trachtenberg (@michelletrachtenberg)

The “Harriet the Spy” and “Ice Princess” star died on February 26, 2025. She was found by her mother in her NYC apartment, according to an NBC Channel 4 report.

STORY DEVELOPING.

TMZ says they got the information from NYC authorities.

The story quotes the medical examiner as saying Trachtenberg passed away from “complications of diabetes mellitus,” and says there is no word on whether the starlet had type 1 or 2.

TMZ also says the investigation is considered closed at this point, because authorities have deemed that the death was “natural.”

After hearing the news, fans may be wondering, “What is diabetes mellitus?” TMZ's report says “diabetes mellitus” is simply the formal name for diabetes. According to the Cleveland Clinic, diabetes is  “a condition that happens when your blood sugar is too high.” 

The hospital's summary goes on to say this takes place when the body isn't responding properly to insulin. It also says all ages can be affected, and the condition can typically be managed with medication and lifestyle changes.

Nick Jonas, Halle Berry, and former American Idol judge Randy Jackson are just a few stars who have publicly advocated for diabetes awareness and shared their own experiences with the condition.

Jonas told Stat he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes in 2005 at age 13. He said while at a school to give a performance, he “started feeling like I was evaporating, physically and emotionally.” He said earlier warning signs were weight loss, fatigue, and low appetite.

He said prioritizing meals and keeping up with his blood sugar is now an essential part of his life. 

The “Year 3000” singer said the thing that surprises him most as a celebrity publicly living with the ailment is “how quickly people assume someone's journey.” He pointed out that while the condition is manageable, the public often doesn't realize it can also be dangerous. “It can be life threatening and dangerous in so many ways,” he pointed out, before adding that he thinks “a sensitivity to others should be kind of inherent when someone shares their story or journey.”

Joanna Gaines is telling Chip to shove off… at least for a little while.

Although the couple hosts the long-running “Fixer Upper” as well as a number of spin offs including ones subtitled “The Hotel,” “Welcome Home” and “The Lakehouse,” this new show will be hyper focused on much smaller projects.

The famed host is setting up her own renovation project for Magnolia Network's “Mini Reni.”

Variety dropped the news that this new show will follow Gaines as she “takes on a series of ‘mini' projects with quick timelines. In each episode, she makes a few intentional, creative additions to transform smaller spaces with big impact.”

In a statement to Variety, Gaines says “Mini Reni” allows for unwavering freedom in more focused spaces.

A post shared by Joanna Gaines (@joannagaines)

“These aren't whole-house renovations, so the heart behind the show is to inspire people to design their home gradually, and thoughtfully,” she tells the outlet. “So that instead of having to wrap your mind around the million details that go into a bigger renovation, you can enjoy the process of creating beauty by narrowing in, flexing your creativity, and embracing the small details that really tell your story.”

Whether the show aims to renovate just rooms or feature smaller DIY projects remains to be seen. It's also unknown who the projects will be for in the storyline of the show itself.

This isn't the first time Gaines has gone solo. The host also heads a cooking series called “Magnolia Table.” She also cohosts “The Retro Plant Shop with Mikey & Jo” with Mikey McCall.

Gaines also has eight books available for purchase. Fans can check out two memoirs, three volumes of cookbooks, an interior design book and two children books.

Allison Page, the Magnolia Network president, is excited for the new show's distinct approach.

“To us, ‘Mini Reni' is a celebration of Magnolia Network and the platform it has been for so much creativity,” Page says. “Viewers are going to love seeing this side of Joanna, and I can't wait to share this special project.”

The show is produced by the Gaines couple via their company Blind Nil.

“Mini Reni” is set to land on Max on May 14. Meanwhile, linear TV viewers can catch the series on the Magnolia Network. New episodes of the nine episode season will premiere weekly on Wednesdays at 8 PM through July 9.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Patrick Schwarzenegger Shares ‘White Lotus' Secrets","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/patrick-schwarzenegger-shares-white-lotus-secrets/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 01:34:14 GMT","

Now that season 3 of “The White Lotus” has finished airing, Patrick Schwarzenegger gets honest about what it was like auditioning and bringing his character Saxon Ratliff to life on set. Plus, he details who he bonded with while filming the show in Thailand, and which costar gave him great acting advice.

This article contains some spoilers.

At a recent SAG-AFTRA Foundation screening in Manhattan for actors in the Screen Actors Guild union, Schwarzenegger, 31, got candid about the process of making the HBO series. First came the invitation to audition via self-tape for a show called “The Secret Garden.” The actor told the crowd that once he saw the name Mike White as the writer and director on the casting breakdown, he knew immediately that it was “The White Lotus.”

He only received three audition scenes for the role of Saxon – not a full episode script – and a short description of the character: “A finance bro who is a flirt.” Schwarzenegger knew he had to make the character his own, since all he had in the instructions was just “a sliver of what the character is.” One of those three audition scenes was from the first episode of season 3, where Saxon lies in bed next to his brother Lochlan and talks about how hot their sister Piper is. He called the scene “nuts,” prompting a laugh from the audience. 

In order to immediately give viewers what he thought was the right vibe for Saxon, Schwarzenegger stated that he “eye-f***ed the camera in the first five seconds” of his self-tape audition. He did his best to make the character a “horny, flirty guy” and the camera someone he wanted. His choices obviously paid off.

Another audition scene he had to perform was from Season 3 Episode 6, where Chelsea (played by Aimee Lou Wood) calls his character “soulless” while they sit next to one another. He called it a “big power shift” for his character as his ego gets destroyed. He went on to say that he usually becomes the most proud of those nerve-wracking scenes that can initially make him uncomfortable as an actor. 

According to Schwarzenegger, he was already flying to Thailand two to three weeks after the booking the role. His first day of filming involved a scene at the pool in season 3's first episode. A clip from that scene made the rounds on social media because of the way he adjusts himself after getting out of the pool. “It was my idea to adjust myself,” he told the group of actors, and director Mike White laughed at the moment. Thinking it was a perfect move for Saxon, White left it in the episode.

It was also Schwarzenegger's idea for his character to sleep naked in his hotel room, no matter who was near, like his brother. He explained that because Saxon is such a dominant, hypermasculine guy, he wants to control the room, and doesn't care if others might be uncomfortable with his nudity.

Schwarzenegger shared another memory that White had to pull him aside during filming because of a problem with his walking. He comically did a Mike White impersonation and repeated the note he was given on set that day: “You don't look rich. You gotta walk ‘richer.' Aren't you rich in real life?” The audience laughed, as did Schwarzenegger, who walked around the stage in that moment. Apparently his costar Parker Posey, an actor's actor and always a fan favorite, had then asked, “Which part of his body does he lead with?” which made Schwarzenegger laugh.

It's no doubt that cast members bond on a film or TV set, away from home for long periods of time. “The White Lotus” was no exception, as Schwarzenegger explained there was a lot of immediate family bonding with his costars. “We did everything together,” he said, adding that he especially connected with his TV siblings Sam Nivola and Sarah Catherine Hook and ate all meals with them for seven months in Thailand. One day, White had asked Schwarzenegger if he wanted to get dinner, but Schwarzenegger told him, “I'm getting dinner with my family.”

Because of this closeness with his coworkers, he stated that he got emotional at the end of filming his scenes. “I was surprised at how maybe emotional it was, or how much I actually rooted for specific characters and myself. You feel like you know these people.” The cast also watched the finale together, which Schwarzenegger said made him tear up. 

A post shared by Patrick Schwarzenegger (@patrickschwarzenegger)

The last question from the moderator was about the best acting advice Schwarzenegger has ever received. Besides a self-tape tip from his brother-in-law Chris Pratt, Schwarzenegger remembered what his costar Walton Goggins told him on his second day of filming. Schwarzenegger had asked the “Fallout” and “Justified” star if he ever gets nervous. After a pause, Goggins simply responded, “Yeah,” before seriously saying with a poke, “But I never f***ing question my process and that I'm the one for this role.” Schwarzenegger told the audience about his own self-doubts, but that Goggins' confidence boost will continue to stay in his mind.

Highlights from the Q&A can be seen on SAG-AFTRA's YouTube page here.

In the early days of “American Idol,” contestants — including current judge Carrie Underwood –developed a thick skin while facing harsh criticisms from original judge Simon Cowell. But social media has turned everyday viewers into the harshest critics of all and one producer says it's worse than ever.

Casting producer Audrey Pine Wright took to Instagram on April 16, 2025, to address how bad the online hate has become and urged viewers to “be kind.” Many current contestants thanked Wright for speaking out as they try to deal with the deluge of mean-spirited comments coming their way.

A post shared by Audrey Pine Wright (@audreypinewright)

Wright, who has been an artist manager for more than a decade and a casting producer on “Idol” since season 20, per LinkedIn, has posted numerous videos about the inner workings of the show for those curious about auditioning in future seasons. But on April 16, she recorded a video with a different purpose, focused on the importance of “being kind to people.” 

Wright said, “So, of course, all of the contestants come on the show knowing that they are going to be out there for all of the world to see. That comes with the territory of being in the public eye. But I have seen some of the most vile comments about contestants that I've ever seen in past years.”

“I don't know if it's the world that we live in or if it's just people hiding behind their screen,” she continued. “Probably a little bit of both.” 

Acknowledging that viewers are free to comment, good or bad, on each singer, she urged her followers, “However you want to react to the artists performing, do it with kindness and humility, and the tiniest bit of grace goes a long way. There's no need to comment on somebody's looks or whether or not you feel they deserve to be there. They all deserve to be on that (‘Idol') oval.” 

“So, when you're watching the show,” Wright concluded, “just remember, these are human beings trying to make a go at their careers. All of them, whether or not they are part of celebrity families or not, everybody's vying for the same position. So, just be kind.”

A post shared by penny (@pennysamar)

Multiple season 23 contestants expressed their gratitude to Wright for her message, including Slater Nalley, Kyana Fanene, and Drew Ryn, who commented, “🙌 Say it again”

Thunderstorm Artis wrote, “We are blessed to have you” and Zaylie Windsor added, “THIS🙌🏻”

Fellow casting producer and “Idol” warmup host Josh Randall chimed in, “Kindness costs nothing, but can mean everything ❤️”

Some contestants have tried a variety tactics for addressing mean comments, including Top 24 artist Penny Samar, who made a tongue-in-cheek “diss track” about herself (seen above). After the judges said her facial expressions were too exaggerated during her audition, viewers began peppering her with similar but far more searing comments online. 

Meanwhile, Baylee Littrell, the son of Backstreet Boy Brian Littrell, has been widely scrutinized on social media as a “nepo baby,” with some fans accusing “Idol” of advancing him because of his famous dad. 

His mom stuck up for the 22-year-old singer on social media, writing on April 7, “Love you bub! I love your heart ! I love your song writing , I love your voice! Don't listen to the negative peeps hating on you because of who your dad is You have so many people who love you for who you are and how talented you are! Keep shinning! Keep on keeping on! You have always carved your own path, and will continue too! We are so proud of you!!!!”

“American Idol” season 23 airs Sunday and Monday nights at 8 p.m. Eastern time on ABC and is available to stream on Hulu and Disney+.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Luke Bryan Says He ‘Accidentally' Got ‘Roped In' to Watching Katy Perry's Space Flight","https://entertainmentnow.com/american-idol/luke-bryan-katy-perry-space-flight/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 01:34:14 GMT","

Among the hundreds of thousands who watched pop star Katy Perry and an all-female crew blast off aboard a Blue Origin spacecraft on April 14, 2025, was her former “American Idol” castmate Luke Bryan. 

While appearing on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” the following night, Bryan described how he “accidentally” found himself live streaming the entire event from his farm in Franklin, Tennessee — mainly because he was worried it might “blow up.” 

Perry was one of six women on the April 14 Blue Origin flight, along with “CBS Mornings” anchor Gayle King, former TV personality Lauren Sánchez, NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, film producer Kerianne Flynn and bioastronautics research scientist and activist Amanda Nguyen.

When Kimmel asked Bryan what he thought of Perry's participation, Bryan replied, “I accidentally started following it. I was doing my morning walk around the farm, which turns into checking Instagram and stuff, and I saw where she was, like, posting on her Instagram that it was happening at 8:30 central, and totally got roped into the moment. I went and clicked on the links!” 

Bryan said he had reached out to Perry when she announced she'd be part of the flight, telling Kimmel, “I had sent her a text going, ‘Good luck, wow, that's crazy you're getting to do that!” 

“Couple months later, there I am walking around my farm, watching the one-hour telecast of it,” Bryan quipped, then mimicked the live stream announcer giving play-by-play details of the launch. 

Bryan added, “It roped me in because when you have a friend (going), I mean, let's let's face it — it could blow up! So, I wanted it to not do that.”

Of Blue Origin's 31 missions thus far, Perry's was the 11th flight with crew members, per People. The outlet said Blue Origin's spacecraft have taken 52 people past the Kármán line, the “internationally recognized boundary of space,” before returning to Earth.  

When Kimmel asked Bryan whether he saw what Perry said after her space mission, the country star said, “I saw her kiss the ground, which — that would be my reaction, too.” 

Kimmel then played a clip of Perry moments after returning to Earth, when she was asked how it felt to “officially” be an astronaut.  

“I feel super connected to love, so connected to love,” Perry replied. “I think this experience has shown me you never know how much love is inside of you, like how much love you have to give.” 

Laughing, Kimmel asked Bryan, “I mean, what do you think went on in that thing!?”

Looking puzzled, Bryan joked, “Was there a pre-flight meal? Did Bezos serve mushrooms on it? Like, I really want to go to space now!”  

“It must have been quite the euphoric ride through the cosmos,” he added. “Maybe she'll debrief me on those emotions.” 

When Kimmel asked Bryan whether he'd want to be a “space cowboy” on a similar flight, the dad of two teen boys said his family would give him a “resounding no,” but that his curiosity has been piqued. 

“It'd be a very delicate negotiation,” he smiled. “I probably would do it just because, I mean, you got to take that chance.” 

“Do you?” Kimmel laughed. “Do you? No, you don't, you really don't have to take that chance!”

HGTV has packed its April 2025 schedule with new shows, from kicking off the sixth season of “Rock the Block” to debuting the new series “Castle Impossible.” 

On April 4, the network added one more surprise to the schedule: a new season of “Vacation House Rules” with real estate investor and contractor Scott McGillivray and his designer, Debra Salmoni — music to the ears of fans in the U.S. who have wondered whether the Canadian-based show would air again on HGTV. 

Season 6 of “Vacation House Rules” is already scheduled to premiere on Canada's new Home Network on April 7. For U.S. fans, HGTV now says it will debut on April 26. 

A post shared by HGTV (@hgtv)

Fans were thrilled to see the news of Scott McGillivray's return on HGTV's social media accounts, given that there hadn't been any status updates on the shows since it last aired in the spring of 2024. Thousands liked and commented on the post. 

“I absolutely love Scott's show & any show he is on or hosts,” one person wrote on Facebook. “He so knowledgeable & so genuine. He's a wonderful host, am so happy he's back!!!!! ❤️❤️”

Another wrote, “I enjoy Scott and Debra so much! They have a great chemistry. Glad to see them back!”

On Instagram, one fan gushed, “😊😊This is GREAT news! LOVE, LOVE his show!” while numerous others called it “the best show ever 😍.”

A post shared by Scott McGillivray (@scott_mcgillivray)

In “Vacation House Rules,” McGillivray renovates vacation homes alongside designer and friend Debra Salmoni. Together, the duo transform spaces in ways that will help their clients create new revenue streams by renting out the getaways. Filmed in Ontario, the series typically premieres in Canada weeks before making its way to U.S. airwaves.

McGillivray, who is married with two daughters, first appeared on HGTV Canada on “Income Property” in 2009. He's also helmed the Canadian series “Moving the McGillivrays,” “Buyers Bootcamp,” and “Renovation Resort Showdown” with his longtime friend and fellow HGTV star Bryan Baeumler. In 2024, he pitched in on HGTV's “100 Day Hotel Challenge” with Brian and Mika Kleinschmidt. 

On April 3, McGillivray told CTV that he's grateful for every chance he gets to keep doing what he loves.

“I like fixing things, that's what I love to do,” he told the outlet. “So, fortunately for me, I get to get up every day find something wrong and try to fix it, whether it's a real estate challenge or a renovation challenge or a design challenge. You know, I've been kind of blessed to be able to share that with everybody throughout the shows for so many years.”

Julia Garner's Silver Surfer, AKA Shalla-Bal, has been finally unveiled in the latest trailer for “The Fantastic Four: First Steps.” 

The film, which stars Pedro Pascal, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Vanessa Kirby, and Joseph Quinn as the titular foursome, is set in 1960s Manhattan during the time of when the first comic book of the characters was released. The feature will serve as the origin story for Pascal's Reed Richards, AKA Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby's Sue Storm, AKA the Invisible Woman, Quinn's Johnny Storm, AKA the Human Torch, and Moss-Bachrach's Ben Grimm, AKA the Thing. Ralph Ineson also plays villain Galactus, with Paul Walter Hauser, Natasha Lyonne, and John Malkovich co-starring.

Matt Shakman (“WandaVision”) directs “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” from a script by Jeff Kaplan and Ian Springer. This is the first “Fantastic Four” iteration since the 20th Century deal with Marvel. Prior to the sale, the first “Fantastic Four” film was released in 2005, followed by 2007 sequel “The Silver Surfer.” The franchise was revived in 2015 with the standalone film “Fantastic Four.”

“First Steps” star Quinn recently told Entertainment Weekly that his interpretation of the Human Torch is different from previous franchise installments. The character was originally (and most famously) played by Chris Evans in 2005. 

“He's a man that leads with a lot of bravado, which can be an affront sometimes. But also he's funny,” Quinn said of the character. “Myself and [Marvel Studios boss] Kevin [Feige] were speaking about previous iterations of him and where we are culturally. He was branded as this womanizing, devil-may-care guy, but is that sexy these days? I don't think so. This version of Johnny is less callous with other people's feelings, and hopefully there's a self-awareness about what's driving that attention-seeking behavior.”

Feige additionally said in a 2023 interview with Entertainment Weekly that the “First Steps” film will be a “pillar” of the MCU franchise. 

“‘Fantastic Four' is the foundation for everything that came after in the comics,” Feige said while first announcing the project. “There's certainly been versions of it [onscreen], but never inhabiting the storytelling of the MCU. And that's something that is really exciting for us. People will start to hear more about that soon. We plan on that being a big pillar of the MCU going forward, just the way they've been in the comics for 50 or 60 years.”

 










Check out the new trailer below.

“The Fantastic Four: First Steps” premieres July 25 in theaters from Marvel Studios and Disney.

The busy Jacob Elordi is quickly becoming one of the most in-demand actors of his generation. His latest project is a return to TV with Justin Kurzel's limited series “The Narrow Road to the Deep North,” where he's a prisoner of both war and love. Following its Berlin premiere in February, the Australian limited series secured U.S. distribution on Prime Video just days before it debuts on April 18.

Adapted from Richard Flanagan's novel of the same name, the Aussie story follows Elordi as war doctor Dorrigo Evans in the 1940s, who is drafted to the Philippines to aid in the construction of the Burma Railway. Prior to going to war, Dorrigo is engaged to Ella (Olivia DeJonge) but falls into an all-consuming affair with his uncle's wife Amy, played by Odessa Young. Throughout the five episodes, we see Dorrigo go to battle in both senses, interweaving scenes of his future self in the 1980s, played by Ciarán Hinds.

The physical transformation for Elordi was quite drastic, dropping considerable weight to prepare for the role through a medically supervised six-week boot camp. “It's so boring [laughs],” Elordi told IndieWire of the boot camp experience. “We worked with a great trainer, Wade Farmer. I think it was called 98 Gyms. Then, we worked with a great nutritionist, and we all worked together, myself and the core unit of boys, to hold each other accountable, and go on this journey into a layer of hell together. It was a lot of not eating and just checking in with each other and staying with the process and trusting Justin [Kurzel].”

The bond that the men formed before filming is felt through watching the series, a rare portrayal of platonic love between men. “For me, Dorrigo's sole intention in the camps is, ‘How can I keep as many of my men alive as possible?' So when the thing that's sustaining you and keeping you alive is the survival of your brothers, that becomes sort of the immediacy of the character.”

He added, “For me, it was that I just needed to look at their faces and see the young men and understand. Back then, they were 15, 16, 17 years old. These men were trapped in these horrifying conditions and were slaughtered. So, looking around and realizing that if I just transported all of us back in time to that time, we'd all be in that situation. It happens pretty immediately, the care and the love for your fellow man.”

 










The chemistry he had with the men remained just as strong as with his two love interests, Ella and Amy.

“Richard Flanagan, the author of the book, said that there's sort of two explosive, meteorite firework moments in your life, that everything else in your life ripples off of these two explosions,” Elordi said. “His summer with Amy, that summer of love with Amy, is one of those explosions, and in the camps is the second explosion. I think that note from him was really helpful in understanding what it needed to be when we filmed it.”

Episode 4 contains torture scenes that might conjure images, for some viewers, of Pier Paolo Pasolini's “Salò.” “I actually haven't seen ‘Salò,'” Elordi said, “but you've just given me something to do for the rest of my day. He's fucking wicked.”

Elordi said of having to watch those scenes take place himself, “The biggest thing about that period was that the guards would make the men watch, and that's what the real torture was. Obviously [there's] the physical torture, but there's something about watching the people that you love get hurt, and there's nothing that you can do about it. And then remembering that he was just a boy, it was incredibly visceral and harrowing shooting it. My hat off to [actor Thomas Weatherall], because he put himself through it, which is commendable.”

 










In IndieWire's review of the series, he wrote that Elordi “gives the kind of brooding, Brando-esque performance he's become known for, smartly eschewing more comfortable studio roles to instead seek daring opportunities that only build upon what's become one of the best rising resumes in town.”

“That's just the coolest thing ever,” Elordi said of being compared to the great Marlon Brando. As for whether he referenced any other performances to prepare for the role, he said, “Maybe Montgomery Clift in a lot of ways, that kind of quiet watchfulness in placing someone who comes in there. I watched so many films, ‘Gallipoli' with Mel Gibson. But not so much the performances — there's something you watch while you're making [something] just to kind of stay in the tone. A big one actually was ‘Phantom Thread.' I remember sort of being half delusional putting that movie on every night when I went to sleep. There was a thing about his hands in that movie, the way that he makes the dresses reminded me of surgery.”

As for what's next, Elordi is currently in production for the third season of “Euphoria” in Los Angeles, just coming off the heels of production for Emerald Fennell's “Wuthering Heights.” When signing on for the second project with his “Saltburn” director, Elordi revealed that he didn't even have to audition. 

 










“I was really lucky. I was going to take a break for a while, and then Emerald just very simply texted me, and you can't run from that text.” As for his co-star Margot Robbie's performance in the project, he teases that “she's incredible in the film, she's a livewire. I'm so, so excited for people to see it. She's a beautiful actor and she gave so, so much.”

While we'll see it in theaters next February, coming sooner is Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein” later this year. Apart from reimagining the Mary Shelley novel, del Toro has been vocal about being influenced by the two Frankenstein films from the 1930s for his adaptation. “We watched them together, and with Mike Hill, who designed the creature and ran the prosthetics,” said Elordi, who's stepping into the role of Frankenstein's monster. “I think I've seen every creature film ever made. Strangely enough, Guillermo gave me a baby book — a baby development book — at the start of filming. [Those] two references I remember greatly.”

“The Narrow Road to the Deep North” premieres on Amazon Prime Video Friday, April 18.

Playing the still center of a musical storm for over 20 years has kept Tunde Adebimpe's music vibrant and necessary. The TV on the Radio lead singer's debut solo album brims with portents. But Thee Black Boltz, recorded before American voters decided we needed Donald Trump breaking shit again, has little use for I-told-you-so's: If listeners need solace now that the apocalypse is here instead of nigh, the album suggests, find it in beats and showmanship. Up to the minute, well sequenced, and straightforward in its melodic chewiness and rhythmic intentions, Thee Black Boltz complements Dear Science and Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes, Bush II-era canaries that have never stopped singing from their wretched coal mines.

Thee Black Boltz doesn't have master programmer-producer Dave Sitek on board, and on occasion I miss his thick sinister churn, but multi-instrumentalists and chief collaborators Guillermo Brown and Wilder Zolby brings clarity, shaping the album around Adebimpe as a singer instead of a member of a collective. A détente exists between the bright tunes and his lyrics. If Thee Black Boltz has a theme, it's finding a flower in a dung heap. “Just when things got darkest/A thought said, say say…walk down and through the hillside towns,” he sings on the title track. “Sad extremes” run through his head on “Ate the Moon,” but he prays for fire, which, of course, he rhymes with “desire,” but the anxious pat-pat-pat of the percussion and the punch of Zolby's keyboards offset the damage.

As weird as it might sound, Adebimpe might be looking for… hits? “Somebody New” has the thudding electronic swagger of the Weeknd's recent work; it's at least conceivable that Adebimpe's sending feelers in the superstar's direction. He pours sap all over “The Most,” in which he actually sings, “I still love you, baby,” while Zolby's small army of synthesizers and sampled car crashes do their best to sully the sentiment. Mason Sacks' acoustic guitar arpeggios on “ILY” flatter some of Adebimpe's prettiest singing, a reminder to fans about his a cappella cover of Neil Young's “Unknown Legend” from Rachel Getting Married, a film whose undertones of pre-Obama #hopeandchange come across as quaint as a bar fight in a John Ford cowboy picture.

At its strongest when loopiest, Thee Black Boltz features several moments when Zolby cocoons Adebimpe as the singer on a dance track, a serenader who closes his eyes and points towards the crowd with welcome camp overtones. The rattling bass on “Magnetic” serves as a platform for a ceiling-scraping performance. “Pinstack” goes for the streamlined sonics of Nine Types of Light while its vocal hook summons—get this—2 Live Crew's “One and One.” A return to the warning-from-the-pulpit mode of TV on the Radio's “Stork & Owl,” “Blue” has the spareness of a demo, with Zolby's Mellotron a spectral presence in a portrait of a town where “wickedness spreads like a disease.”

Thee Black Boltz has two huge pluses. Adebimpe simply loves to sing, as opposed to loving the sound of his own voice: no self-absorbed trills here. Almost as importantly, his acceptance of calamity hasn't resulted in complacency. He'll keep shouting as the void approaches. “Gimme that sound/I'm only tryin' to see someone,” he demands over drums and Miguel Atwood-Ferguson's strings on twitchy midtempo closer “Streetlight Nuevo,” and he doesn't sound quixotic. If, given his chops, Adebimpe decides to record an R&B album in the mode of Jamila Woods in some near future, it wouldn't feel anomalous. But then, Adebimpe has written and sung about anomalies for a long time.

The microphone dangling from the sky above the Instagram Reels page can feel like a dare: How long before you scroll past this pastiche of a rapper you've heard before? So when a light-skinned young woman with curly hair and freckles named Cortisa Star appeared one day behind that microphone, rapping, “He like my body, he know I'm a tranny,” it felt like a glitch in the system. Her choppy vocals sounded like they were coming through a walkie-talkie that was too far away, and her ad-libs were delivered in a Star Wars robot monotone. Everything felt out of place, especially for the beige world of Instagram Reels rap video content, and this experimentation was the hook that drew in fans, haters, and queerphobic bigots. Such is the polarized landscape of contemporary viral rap fame. Another Instagram account posted a quote attributed to Cortisa: “I'm like SOPHIE if she got posted on Worldstar.”

“FUN,” the song featured in the infamous From the Block video, blended regional and internet rap scenes, collapsing Jersey club bed squeaks into comedic levels of distortion. The dominant sound of E.M.O. (EVIL MOTION OVERLOAD), Star's debut EP, is more aligned with PC Music-branded hyperpop, a shift that positions her as a pop diva working on the borders of club music. But Star rarely sings, preferring to explore these soundscapes through her usual bratty punch-ins. While E.M.O. retains Star's quick verses and head-turning one-liners, it lacks the adventurousness of A.G. Cook's pop productions, or the dizzying flows of Azealia Banks' hip house, focusing more on Star's piercing, Kesha-like delivery.

Take “ALOT,” a runway-ready track built off a rumbling four-on-the-floor pattern. The jumpy percussive bassline evokes the excitement of Charli XCX's SOPHIE-produced “Vroom Vroom,” but there aren't enough moving parts for the track to fully develop; it keeps stalling, teasing some rhythmic shift or standout hook but never quite making it there. “FITS” suffers the same fate, grabbing attention with earthquake bass stabs that overwhelm Star's performance, which settles in the same pocket without stretching out. The massive proportions and pristine finish of the sound design present as larger than life, but the songs wind up feeling like they're all facade.

Star is at her best when her blisteringly ironic wordplay is bolstered by production that's equally self-aware. On “Cortisa Crump,” originally released in 2024, the tongue-in-cheek medieval chant sample and bowling-ball 808s help her unserious lines land. “Working these bitches like my name is Benson” sounds just as trashy as the low-bitrate choir recordings surrounding it. “Misidentify” works similarly; the high-drama buildup is so long it becomes funny. By the time she gets to “Mastered rapping high up, in the mountains with a samurai,” it's like she's poking fun at the entire hip-hop spectacle.

In a recent interview with The Fader, Star reflected on growing up as a queer rap fan: “I didn't know too many queer rappers just because there wasn't too many openly on the song saying, ‘I'm a tranny, I'm gay, this, this.'” What makes E.M.O. (EVIL MOTION OVERLOAD) more than a passing moment is its unabashed queerness to the point of vulgarity, a preemptive dismissal of any demand for respectability. When Star raps, “Fucked on that trade hoe and now I'm embarrassed” on “Paris,” it has an authentic bite; she's not trying to make a statement, just talking to those already in the know. E.M.O's abrasive sine waves, blown-out drums, and overproduced textures are familiar tropes of queer internet music that Star uses as a launchpad to explore her unique position as a transfemme in rap spaces. All she needs now is a sound palette that's as distinctive as her vision of nonconformity.

Opium / Interscope

Reviewed:

April 17, 2025

There's no collective in America commanding the youth like Opium is right now. Somewhere between cold nonchalance and masochistic vitriol lies the Atlanta-based neo-punk brigade, a coven of rappers and producers who mold piercing distortion into organized bedlam. When Playboi Carti launched the label with the release of 2020's Whole Lotta Red, he was already readying his first protégé.

Allow me to reintroduce Ken Carson, patient zero of the Opium Plan, one of the world's biggest rappers born in the 21st century. Ascending from Carti fan to Carti confidant, the diamond-grilled ruffian dethroned bars and rhyme schemes in favor of bludgeoning skulls with his bloodshot delivery. He's an avatar for Opium's dark, irreligious imagery, often seen with a St. Peter's cross around his neck. Last year, he tatted a pentagram on his chest and commissioned cover art of a buck 50 scar on his face. As his embrace of the macabre has grown tighter, Ken Carson's headstrong synthplay has become bitterly malevolent. It's a mutated extension of Red's vampiric lure that Opium stans can't get enough of: The Brooklyn listening party for his 2023 opus, A Great Chaos, was packed with disciples howling newly released songs word for word. “Opium aesthetic, yuh, type shit,” Ken boldly remarked on that album.

More Chaos is Ken Carson's affirmation of his influence. He is aware of his standing in rap culture now, almost to the point of spoofing the demon he's posturing as. “I'm the lord of chaos/I got the moshpit in control,” he declares after an alarming techno breakdown splits the album open. For better or for worse, he's right. Opium's lurid approach to sound and aesthetics has the kids in a headlock; at any rap festival in the past five years, you'd find fans draped in all black with painted nails and pants so baggy they can't see their shoes. They're rowdy and inconsolable at Opium sets, flailing and shoving even before a DJ takes the stage. It's all by design—Carti, Ken, Destroy Lonely, and company have distilled the symbolism of metal and the ethos of punk into an apolitical soup. There is no underlying message—this is rebellion just for the sake of saying “Fuck 12.” These are our Sex Pistols: The music at its best is rabid and freakishly exhilarating. At its worst, it exposes the empty core of its depravity. An environment that cultivates something like More Chaos is one where drug binges and violent misogyny go unchecked.

“How you mourn? What you gon' do when that pain hit?” Ken Carson asks on “Xposed,” the album's second track. “I been rockin', I been ravin', I been ragin'.” The scope of Ken's catalog can be summed up by these words alone. With each new album (More Chaos is his fourth), the hedonistic impulses reach new extremes. It's reflected in the lyricism, but it's the sound palette that really gets pushed to the brink. The trench warfare of 2023's “Hardcore” and “Lose It” are superseded by the hellish whir of “Xposed” and the double-sided clamor of “LiveLeak.” Hall-of-fame snippet-turned-banger “Money Spread” warbles like a spaceship with a corrupted motherboard. Ken's best work relies on this kind of raw urgency and Migos-level repetition that I wish this album had more of. “LiveLeak” is nearly as addictive, translating the crunchy, lo-fi elements of the snippet to the final mix: Mangled synths and snares, Mario Kart trills, and gruff 808s rumble like Goliath's footsteps. Egged on by a calamitous beat switch, Ken raps like he's a button-press away from a tectonic shift. When the mood softens later in the album, he loses the edge that makes these tracks so enticing.

“Dismantled” is another standout, for the right and wrong reasons. Sonically, it's a quintessential Ken Carson song: Its choppy blips of machinery are constantly in motion, grounded by a thick bassline that hums like a generator. He raps with the same conviction that dominated A Great Chaos, a presence that feels inconsistent on this album—extended verses on “K Hole” and “Evolution” show flashes but are too long-winded. (Not every song is “Me N My Kup.”) But “Dismantled” starts to get startling when you realize he's putting a woman through brutal sex: “Rip this bitch apart/When I get to the hotel, she gettin' dismantled,” he raps on the hook. It's easy to shrug off Ken's jarring one-liners when you can't help but laugh at them, but this isn't that. On “Root of All Evil,” he brags, “I go Chris Brown, wall to wall/She know how it get,” like that doesn't read as a grim double entendre in 2025. Add in the fact that Ken and Opium's own allegations of domestic abuse are public knowledge and these lyrics become nauseating. Even would-be romantic songs like “Kryptonite” talk about women like they're concubines.

One of the strangest songs of the bunch, final track “Off the Meter,” features Destroy Lonely and Playboi Carti—after half a decade, Carti has finally consummated his role as label boss by acknowledging his signees on wax. What's funny is how much it sounds like Carti found a random .wav file from 2022 and just threw a verse and some Swamp Izzo tags on it. It's a fun track, but Ken and Lone sound damn near pre-pubescent compared to the muddier cadences they've honed since, while Carti taps into a level of dynamism that Ken barely touches across More Chaos. Listen to Ken nodding off at the end of his “Confetti” verse, or flatlining through most of “2000,” and then listen to Carti stretching his vocal cords like putty, inflecting with reckless abandon. Even after all this time, it's still the teacher and the student.

All things considered, it's comfort at the top that holds Ken Carson back. It's why the back half of More Chaos drags; he's going through familiar motions in hopes of making lightning strike twice. Just like A Great Chaos, More Chaos offsets its aggressive first half with bubblier textures and candied Auto-Tune on side two, but sometimes Ken sounds so bored when he's not trying to jump out his body. “200 Kash” is delightfully sludgy, but the hollow, lust-driven relationships he croons about on “Down2Earth” and “Kryptonite” are tedious reminders of X, even if the beats are half-decent. By the time he claims that “Pat Bateman ain't got nothing on me” on “Psycho,” I start to wonder if this is just the equivalent of clocking in for him.

If lyrical density is a concern, you're missing the point of More Chaos, but Ken Carson's emphasis on vibes and pointed aggression can only take him so far. A Great Chaos separated him from his peers, demonstrating how much ground he could take up outside of Playboi Carti's shadow. A similar formula suffices here, thanks to a masterful crop of producers: Opium's usual suspects (F1lthy, star boy, Outtatown), DRACO.FM standouts (skai, legion), and SoundCloud veterans like 16yrold. But as a whole, More Chaos is a lateral move, not a step up. It doesn't help when you consider the chameleonic depth and firepower of last month's MUSIC, an even longer saga of postmodern trap. Carti's album left no room for his flow or cadence to get stale, shapeshifting in tight spaces like Orochimaru. Is it flawed? Definitely. But it thrives on the scathing unpredictability that More Chaos can't quite pull off.

Few real-world events have served as more durable prisms for American art than the Vietnam War. The conflict itself, the protest movement that opposed it, and the disillusionment its participants felt in its wake were all central to the New Hollywood, in brutal parables like Elia Kazan's The Visitors and Coppola's Apocalypse Now, exegeses like Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter and Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and even refracted through genre fare like the Rambo series and popular television like the adaptation of M*A*S*H, which was nominally about the Korean War but widely understood to be about Vietnam. In fact, that country's name has become shorthand for a certain solipsistic dread in American popular culture.

Films about the so-called war on terror have not been so tightly wound around a central ethos or anxiety. There are hagiographies that make a show of wringing their hands a little (Clint Eastwood's American Sniper) and others that don't (Michael Bay's 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi); Kathryn Bigelow has tried twice to locate a new kind of ambivalence, with 2009's The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty, from three years later. The former was awarded Best Picture and the latter was a widely discussed hit, but neither tidily distilled the psychological underpinnings and effects of this newer battle that is stranger, more diffuse, and more abstracted than any before. The definitive cinema about the war on terror may actually be the comic-book morality test of the surveillance apparatus that crops up in the third act of The Dark Knight.

As these wars, their consequences, and their attendant intelligence infrastructures sprawl and spiral, it was perhaps inevitable that the next attempts to translate them to the screen would grow narrower in scope. But even in their most hermetic iterations, these stories carry with them the weight of an incredibly tumultuous quarter-century. The second shot of Warfare, the new film co-directed by Alex Garland and Ray Mendoza, is of a street in Ramadi, Iraq, in the fall of 2006, after the eight-month battle that killed at least 1,000 Iraqis and 80 American soldiers. The area is deserted, eerily so, save for a series of telephone poles that line the street. Even if you presented this image to someone who did not know they were about to watch a movie about the second Iraq War, they would note what these particular poles look like: crosses. The viewer—the one aware of the marketing that posits Warfare as a uniquely transparent lens on modern combat—could also reasonably see them as symbols of the American imperial project that brought us all here.

Warfare cannot reconcile the difference between documentary and allegory. Mendoza, a retired Navy SEAL who co-wrote the script with Garland after serving as an adviser on the latter's Civil War, has reconstructed—through his own memory and interviews with his platoonmates—a doomed operation of which he was a part in November '06. But where a lack of explication about a fictional political ecosystem gave Civil War much of its dramatic tension, Warfare's supposed evenhandedness about the past can yield only propaganda.

This is true first and foremost because that reliance on memory is not borne out in Warfare's structure or mode of execution. There are attempts to make it seem (to use an impossibly loaded word) objective: It takes place in relative real time; the Americans, most of whom remain unnamed, are characterized through gesture if at all; the Iraqi combatants, at least once the ballistics start flying, remain unseen. And for stretches, this lack of initiation is intoxicating. Acronyms and jargon illegible to civilians are flying everywhere, and the world effectively shrinks down to a two-story duplex the Americans have commandeered and the market across the street viewed almost exclusively through a sniper's scope.

At times, this restraint is even revealing: The inane debate we witness over whether a “military-aged male” is “peeking” or “probing” underlines the arbitrariness of all our rules of engagement. (The eventual determination is that the man is “peeking with serious intent to probe.”) Of course, none of the jargon can drown out an American speculating that some Iraqis are “getting their jihad on,” or odd anachronisms like one solider saying that another has “new guy energy.” But crucially, this sense of anonymity and inscrutability is punctured by the cast. Garland is an in-demand filmmaker, and the cast, led by Charles Melton, Will Poulter, and the particularly excellent D'Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, is an impressive array of young male Hollywood talent. The performances are committed, well-directed, and served well in Fin Oates's edit; they also give the film the exact sheen of glamor that it stakes itself on avoiding.

Warfare will also not commit to a visual language that keeps the viewer in any sort of imagined reality. When grenades or bombs go off, the camera shakes—not like it might if it were mounted to a wall or standing on a tripod, but rather the way we're used to in action movies. When explosions temporarily deafen characters, it's in the echoey manner of television dramas, where we enter a clumsy, subjective approximation of their points of view. And so the film, for all its gore and austerity, ceases to be anything but another rote war drama, with predictable arcs that bend toward heroism. Despite lacking the aspirations toward domestic calm that anchor The Hurt Locker (or the romantic tinge of Dunkirk, Christopher Nolan's contemporary take on an evacuation mission from 70 years prior) Warfare, ironically, becomes even more ideologically pointed, its superficial claims to objectivity insisting that our emotional investment in the American soldiers' survival is, or should be, a given.

The directors evidently want the audience to consider the humanity of the Iraqi civilians caught in the conflict. The house that the Americans strategically position themselves in is home to two families; there are occasional insert shots of family photos and trinkets, and at several points these families are shown cowering, terrified by what's happening around them. It's difficult, even before the film's galling coda, not to find these images condescending, a nod to the human cost of what is necessary—and inevitable.

When the battle breaks out in earnest, those peeking/probing distincts are abandoned; rifles are fired indiscriminately into computer-generated fog, unreal fighter jets kick up artificial dust. A rescue mission like any other. At one point, we see one of the telephone poles from earlier, finally knocked askew.

Francois Truffaut famously said that every film about war ends up being pro-war. He was talking about things that are unavoidable, subliminal: the way our brains are programmed to invest in those characters we see first, the way war's viscerality is, when photographed, inherently romantic, even in all its ugliness. He surely would not have felt the need to explain that a film scans as pro-war when it ends with an extended making-of featurette, complete with side-by-side photos of actors with the SEALs they played—many of whose faces are blurred. Warfare, we learn, is dedicated to one team member in particular, and to the unit as a whole, for “always answering the call.” By the time we reach the final image, of these men giving their middle fingers to the camera, it might as well have been implied.

Bruce Springsteen has released “Blind Spot,” the latest song from the coveted box set of lost albums, Tracks II, that he announced this month. “Blind Spot” is the first song ever to be released from the Streets of Philadelphia Sessions, an album known among fans as the “loops record.” Listen below.

Springsteen recorded the 10-song album in the wake of its Oscar-winning title track. Inspired by West Coast hip-hop, he experimented with drum samples before creating his own bank of original “loops” with engineer Toby Scott. As such, Springsteen is the primary player on the whole record, though additional input comes from Patti Scialfa, Soozie Tyrell, Lisa Lowell, and his 1992-1993 touring band. Completed, mixed, and slated for a 1995 release, the album wound up being shelved when Springsteen decided to reunite with the E Street Band.

The song's lyrics concern doubt and betrayal in relationships, Springsteen said in a press release. “That was just the theme that I locked in on at that moment. I don't really know why. Patti and I, we were having a great time in California. But sometimes if you lock into one song you like, then you follow that thread. I had ‘Blind Spot,' and I followed that thread through the rest of the record.”

Of the decision to shelve the record, he went on, “I said, ‘Well, maybe it's time to just do something with the band, or remind the fans of the band or that part of my work life.' So that's where we went. But I always really liked Streets of Philadelphia Sessions… during the Broadway show, I thought of putting it out [as a standalone release]. I always put them away, but I don't throw them away.”

Tracks II arrives June 27, presenting a trove of seven albums of never-before-heard Springsteen music spanning from 1983 to 2018. With the initial announcement, he shared “Rain in the River,” which appears on the Perfect World collection—the one LP on Tracks II that was not originally conceived as a standalone album. The two songs shared so far are the first of 74 never-before-heard tracks that form the bulk of the bumper box set.

	Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) acknowledged during a leadership summit in Anchorage this week that “we are all afraid” three months into President Donald Trump's second term in office. Murkowski has been a fairly outspoken critic of Trump in a Republican Party that publicly worships him.


	An audience member asked Murkowski what she would say to people who are feeling afraid or to the lawmakers who represent them.


	“We are all afraid,” the Republican told the audience of 500 nonprofit leaders. She paused, then added: “It's quite a statement. But we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been before. And I'll tell ya, I'm oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that's not right. But that's what you've asked me to do. And so I'm going to use my voice to the best of my ability.”


	“I've got to figure out how I can do my best to help the many who are so anxious and are so afraid,” Murkowski said.

	











	Murkowski voted to convict Trump in his 2021 impeachment trial, when he was charged with inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol. She is the only Republican who voted to defund Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). She was also one of only three Republican senators to vote against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation, and one of two to vote against FBI Director Kash Patel.


	Trump called Murkowski “lousy” and “worse than a Democrat” at a 2022 rally in Alaska, and supported her opponent in her Senate election that year.


	“She is the worst. I rate her No. 1 bad, and we have a couple of bad ones, but she's by far the worst,” Trump said.


	Murkowski said Monday that protesters should continue challenging Trump. “Keep calling. Keep the emails. Keep the social media going,” she said. 


	“It's important that the concerns continue to be raised, rather than allow the fatigue of the chaos grind you down,” she added. “Don't let it grind you down.”

	Murkowsi said the situation is “as hard as anything that I have been engaged in, in the 20-plus years I've been in the Senate.”


	“It is head spinning,” she said of Trump's second term. “It seems that just when you've made a little bit of progress on one issue that had caused so much anxiety, there's another one.” Murkowski noted that she had recently texted Trump's Chief of Staff Susie Wiles about rumors that AmeriCorps would be cut, but she wasn't sure if that approach would be effective. Two days later, DOGE placed hundreds of AmeriCorps employees on leave.

	











	Murkowski also addressed the possibility that Republicans in Congress would significantly cut Medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income and disabled people. About 23 percent of Alaskans were on Medicaid in 2023, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. “I'm not saying you can't touch Medicaid at all,” she said. “What I hope we're moving away from is an $880 billion cut to Medicaid. Because if that happens, this is going to be a very, very different state.”


	Last month, Murkowski told reporters that Republican lawmakers are afraid of Trump.


	“That's why you've got everybody just zip-lipped, not saying a word, because they're afraid they're going to be taken down — they're going to be primaried, they're going to be given names in the media,” Murkowski said. “We cannot be cowed into not speaking up.”

	“It may be that Elon Musk decides that he's going to take the next billion dollars he makes off Starlink and put it directly against Lisa Murkowksi. And you know what? That may happen. But I'm not giving up one minute, one opportunity to try to stand up for Alaska,” she said.

	On Monday, Murkowski said that Congress needs to take an active role. 


	“Sometimes it's easy, particularly when things are so turbulent and really very, very chaotic right now, you want to be able to blame somebody else, but we cannot,” she said. “Congress has ownership in this, and this is where I say it's sitting down with our colleagues to say, ‘We have a role here too.' We just can't say, ‘Well, we'll let the courts sort it out.' We've got to step it up.”

							By 

	A.A. Dowd



	For a movie about an apocalyptic clash of vampires and gangsters, Sinners has moments of unexpected jubilance, even rapture. Take, for instance, the scene where a young, idealistic musician performs for the crowd at a newly opened juke joint in the Mississippi Delta of 1932. How good is Sammie (Miles Caton), a preacher's son and aspiring bluesman? When he plays and sings, all of history seems to metaphysically come together, conjuring visions of music's past and future. Suddenly, a rock & roll axeman is crashing this 1930s party, shredding like Hendrix. Someone scratches a turntable. Tribal dancers stomp and sway alongside breakdancers, all in one continuous shot that becomes an anachronistic continuum of Black musical expression across the ages. It's sublimely excessive. And then the camera tilts up from the throng of sweaty revelers to reveal a canopy of brightly glowing embers. Yes, the roof is on fire.


	Lots of sparks fly from Sinners, a cluttered but often rollicking original vision from Ryan Coogler, the writer-director who revitalized the Rocky series with Creed and reinvigorated the Marvel model with Black Panther (and, to a lesser extent, its baggier sequel). Relieved at last from franchise duty, Coogler has applied his considerable chops to a supersized supernatural thriller that betrays the depth of his interest in Black legacy, the blues, and a more lawless American yesterday. Watching the movie, you get the impression of a gifted artist convinced he may never get another chance to spend this kind of money again. As a result, Sinners often plays like several very different films crammed onto one IMAX screen, for better and worse. It's not just genres of music that mingle over the course of its leisurely 137 minutes.

	











	On the surface, for example, Sinners is a monster movie, pitting the nightlife of a Depression-era town against creatures of the night. But this is also Coogler's riff on the Western, with circling buzzards and black hats; his stylish crime-flick pastiche, with sleek suits and loaded guns; and a Southern Gothic melodrama about the sins of the father and the return of prodigal sons. Most eccentrically, and rewardingly, the movie is a kind of musical: Even the vampires are handed a couple of numbers, twisting sweet Irish ballads into unholy cult prayers. When characters aren't banging out their own songs, composer Ludwig Göransson is enveloping them in his country-fried symphony of guitar, banjo, and harmonica.

	Rather than build the movie around bright-eyed Sammie (a dreamer inadvertently drawing the darkness closer with his song), Coogler doubles down on Michael B. Jordan — the tragically murdered Oscar Grant of his Fruitvale Station, the hungry Adonis of his Creed, the complexly villainous Killmonger of his Black Panther. Here, via a dual performance, Jordan plays Smoke and Stack, twin brothers back in their hometown after consecutive stints in the trenches of WWI and Capone's Chicago. The two have stolen enough from warring mob families to buy an old sawmill from the Klan, with plans to transform it into a bustling watering hole for the community. “Only money can give you power,” reasons Smoke; he's the more serious of the brothers, identifiable by a glower or, conversely, a lack of the wolfish grin Jordan adopts whenever he's playing the slicker, cockier Stack.


	Nearly an hour elapses before evil descends upon the saloon. Along the way, Coogler deliberately lays out the geography of his small-town setting (sometimes one step at a time, via a couple long, unbroken shots) and builds his ensemble cast as the brothers assemble the staff and entertainment for opening night. Veterans of Spike Lee's battlefield, Delroy Lindo and Omar Benson Miller bring a glancing but palpable sense of history to the relationships of this prohibition-era South. And after his time in the skittishly sexless Marvel Cinematic Universe, Coogler seems liberated by the opportunity to follow characters with actual libidos. There's nothing chaste about Smoke's rekindled romance with the usefully witchy Annie (Wunmi Mosaku), nor Stack's pricklier reunion with feisty flapper Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), who's eager to see him head down south again in a whole other sense.

	Something wicked their way comes, belatedly, in the form of Remmick, a nomadic bloodsucker drawn by Sammie's music. Jack O'Connell creepily plays the fiend like a cult leader, not looking to feast so much as assimilate. If the delayed pivot into horror recalls another bar-set vampfest, From Dusk Till Dawn, the real source of inspiration here is the widescreen claustrophobia of John Carpenter, with a collection of desperate good guys holed up inside a sanctuary they're forced to defend from circling bad guys. Coogler even mimics the famous blood test from The Thing, this time with cloves of garlic to determine who among them is not themselves. Of course, that's just another continuum, like the one that links gospel to rock and soul: The line connecting Coogler to Carpenter runs further back, through Howard Hawks classics about camaraderie among men under duress.

	











	Truthfully, Sinners might be more interesting before the vampires show up. Coogler has fun with the logistics of letting the wrong one in, as former friends and neighbors try to finagle an invitation they didn't need before. But there's little new or novel about his play on the lore. All that gnashing and suckling is old hat — as old as the burgundy fedora Jordan slips on when playing the more jovial of these brothers in arms. And what, exactly, do the monsters represent? The allure of transgression? The stubbornly undying evil of the KKK? (The first of the head vamp's unwilling recruits is a pair of clueless hood-wearers.) It's most tempting to see them as the phantom of a lie Smoke and Stack tell themselves — their belief that they can truly buy into power and buy out of the racist world they've always known. But Coogler doesn't really commit to any one coherent metaphor. Maybe that's more blessing than curse in our age of baldly allegorical horror movies.

	Still, one might wish the filmmaker did commit to better sketching in the personal drama at the center of Sinners. His characters and relationships don't evolve much beyond the archetypal. That goes for Jordan's twin protagonists, whose conflict comes down to a sliver of exposition regarding their shared, traumatic childhood. Why cast an actor as charismatic as this star and then hand him two underwritten parts? Sammie, a troubadour of nearly messianic stature, is no more richly developed. He sings and yearns and then plays his larger role in a story that stretches forward in time, hitting multiple endings along the way, including a couple smuggled into the credits.


	But if Sinners is messy, it's sometimes pretty glorious, too. Coogler is swinging wide and far beyond the boundaries of franchise fare. Having spent most of his career finding loopholes in the devil's pact of Hollywood hit-making (which is to say, finding ways to assert himself during Marvel maintenance), he's now dabbled in something personal: a genre-blending blast of blood, sex, and homespun Delta blues. When the flaws fade from memory, you'll probably remember what's grand about Sinners: the musicality of its editing; the melody of a Tommy gun righteously firing on monsters much worse than vampires; and the moment when Coogler triumphantly expands his aspect ratio, like curtains lifting to reveal a brightly lit stage.

	When Amanda Knox was locked away in an Italian prison in 2007 for a murder she didn't commit, she'd find solace in singing. “Most of the people in prison knew my voice before they knew who I was,” she says; she favored sad songs by folks like Joanna Newsom and Regina Spektor. “People would hear me sing, and then they would yell down the hallway to hear certain songs. So I was basically like the jukebox for a while.” After a prison priest taught her how to play piano, she would practice on a paper keyboard in her room.


	Eddie Lowery had a similar experience back in the Eighties, locked up in a Kansas facility for a rape he's since been cleared of, noodling on a guitar his mother sent him. “At night, I would put my headphones on and I'd listen to the local rock-music station,” he says. “I'd lay there pretending I was onstage, playing next to these guys, with my guitar.”


	And then there's Bill Dillon, who wrote his first song on a roll of toilet paper after being hosed down and sent to solitary back in the 1980s. The track was called “Black Robes and Lawyers,” and he honed it using gear Lynyrd Skynyrd donated to his Florida facility.

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“It was basically a statement: Why isn't anybody listening to me?” he says. Dillon was wrongly convicted in 1981 for murder, and neither of the titular figures in the song title were swayed by his claims of innocence.


	Flash forward to 2025, and all three of these formerly incarcerated people have been exonerated — Knox in 2015 after serving nearly four years, Lowery in 2003 after nine years, and Dillon in 2008 after 27 years. Now, their musical dreams are coming true. All three are members of the Exoneree Band, an iteration of which recently performed with Pearl Jam guitarist Mike McCready at the annual National Innocence Network Conference in Seattle.


	“It was a joyous yet really heavy environment in terms of psychologically and healing,” McCready says. His wife, Ashley, is the board president of the Washington Innocence Project and helped him get involved. “I think music is critical to healing humans.”

	The Exoneree Band got their start in 2011 at a conference in Cincinnati, playing that song Dillon wrote on a roll of toilet paper. “We did kind of a talent show among our exonerees from all different projects from all over the country,” says Lara Zarowsky, an executive and policy director of the Washington Innocence Project. “There's a lot of talent in our community, as you might imagine. One of the main ways that some of them have made it through prison was through music.” 

	











	The original lineup was Lowery (lead guitar), Dillon (guitar and bass), Darby Tillis (vocals and bass), Antoine Day (vocals and drums), and Raymond Towler (guitars and keys). Together, the guys had served a collective 85 years. “We realized that we were better together, as a band,” says Dillon, who is currently on a break from the group while he awaits a heart transplant. “I had a catalog, so it was easy for us to go right out and play. We were raising awareness about wrongful convictions.


	The band has since played at independent Innocence Network organization concerts across the country and any stage that will have it; Grammy-winning producer Jim Tulio even produced Dillon's 2014 solo record. Tillis died in 2014, and Dillon has been off the road, but they're still considered part of the band — which now includes Knox on vocals and bassist Ted Bradford, who was exonerated after 10 years for a rape that DNA evidence proved he did not commit. 


	On April 5, the band hit the Rabbit Box in Seattle after the 2025 conference, where McCready filled in on guitar. “We did a couple of Pearl Jam songs,” he says. Namely “Black” and “Yellow Ledbetter, which Knox sang backup on. “I don't generally do those songs with anybody except for my band, but this is such an important occasion that I felt like: I'll do whatever these guys want to do, and I feel honored to be part of it.”

	Knox, a Seattle native who advocates against wrongful convictions, has known Pearl Jam for years. “They reached out to me when I first came home, because they had long been really supportive of these cases,” she says. “Truly the first exoneree that I ever met was Damian Echols through Pearl Jam, at Eddie Vedder's house. It was just the most awesome thing to just be rocking out with Mike on the stage at the Rabbit Box.”


	“She has great intuition,” McCready adds. “While we were playing, she was singing backup for ‘Black' and totally adding this cool dimension of pain and beauty and magic. I was playing along with it and catching it.”

	The band also played a few of Lowery's originals, such as “Name of Justice,” about our broken court system, and “My Cell,” which he wrote about those nights spent listening to the radio, picturing himself playing alongside his heroes. It's a dream that was realized that night as the band stood toe-to-toe with a Nineties legend.

	











	Knox, who says she's been into music since she was old enough to belt Disney songs, says she's next in line to teach the band some originals. She recently released her memoir, Free. “I gave the group a whole bunch of original songs that I've made in the meantime,” she says, adding that she's been working with Chris Ballew of Presidents of the United States of America. “The band just has a really special bond. I think it's really great that we get the opportunity not just to tell our stories, but to tell our stories through an art form. It's always been a source of comfort for me.”

Pam Bondi, the attorney general of the United States, was asked what a pretty simple question during a Fox News appearance on Monday night.


	“Is that legal?” Jesse Watters wondered, referring to Donald Trump musing earlier in the day about sending “homegrown” American citizens to El Salvador. Doing so would be unequivocally illegal, and acknowledging as much is an extremely low bar for the nation's top law enforcement official to clear.


	She didn't clear it.


	“Jesse, these are Americans who he is saying have committed the most heinous crimes in our country, and crime is going to decrease dramatically in our country because he has given us a directive to make America safe again,” Bondi said, repeating a Trump campaign slogan. She tacked on that “we're not going to let them go anywhere, and if we have to build more prisons in our country, we will do it.” This last bit was a tacit admission of what she was afraid to say outright, that deporting U.S. citizens would be wholly illegal.

	











	She didn't say it was illegal because Trump wants it to happen, and Bondi has made clear throughout her first few months on the job that she's not concerned with the law so much as pleasing the president. It was no secret that Trump had designs on turning the Justice Department into an arm of the White House, but the degree to which Bondi and other officials are publicly pushing MAGA propaganda  — largely through a steady stream of TV appearances — marks an alarming betrayal of the separation of powers that has undergirded American democracy since the nation's founding.

	The Department of Justice is supposed to operate independently of the White House. The president gets to nominate an attorney general to lead the department in its mission to enforce federal law, which it is supposed to carry out without any naked political biases.


	Trump's first-term attorneys general, Jeff Sessions and William Barr, certainly catered to the president, but they also had their limits. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation, leading to Special Counsel Robert Mueller's appointment, and Barr wouldn't play ball with Trump's effort to overturn his loss to Biden. Trump has spent plenty of time publicly lambasting both Sessions and Barr since forcing them out of their roles atop the Justice Department. He's once called Barr a “gutless pig,” among other invectives.

	Trump, in his second term, doesn't want an attorney general with limits. He wants one who is wholly loyal to him and him alone — not to any personal sense of duty, not to federal law, not to the Constitution, not to the United States.


	Bondi, who served as one of Trump's impeachment lawyers during his first term and supported his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, seems to fit the bill. She has stood by as Trump has pulled every lever he can to wrest power away from independent agencies, while openly touting how she's used the Justice Department to do his dirty work.


	“You gave us a directive to prosecute the people who are going after Tesla to the fullest extent of the law,” she said during a Cabinet meeting last week, seated across from a president who pardoned rioters who vandalized the United States Capitol and assaulted cops. “We've made four arrests. There will be no negotiations, at your directive. They are all looking at 20 years in prison.”


	She doesn't even pretend to operate with any independence. “You were overwhelmingly elected by the biggest majority, and Americans want you to be president because of your agenda,” she gushed at the same Cabinet meeting, before insisting that he, not Congress, has “the authority to determine how the money of this country will be spent.” (Freezing congressionally appropriated funds, an act known as “impoundment,” is widely understood to be unconstitutional.)

	Bondi sounds less like the nation's top prosecutor and more like a cable TV lackey — which is probably a better way to think of her. She routinely goes on TV to parrot the administration's talking points, bashing judges she argues are “trying to control our nation's agenda”; entertaining the idea that Trump could run for a third term in office; bragging about sending Tesla vandals to prison for decades; and, of course, offering effusive “thanks to President Trump.”


	Media Matters for America, a nonprofit that tracks right-wing media, found that Bondi has appeared on weekday Fox News programs 11 times from when she took over as attorney general on February 5 through last week — and she's made at least three more appearances since then. The number doesn't include weekend appearances or hits on other networks (including Fox Business), and so it only represents a portion of the time she's spent in front of a camera, using her stature in the Justice Department to lend legitimacy to the president's talking points. 

	











	Bondi isn't the only federal prosecutor going on TV to stump for Trump. The president in March tapped Alina Habba — one of his personal lawyers who has no prosecutorial experience — to serve as the interim U.S. attorney for New Jersey. Habba was a TV fixture throughout Trump's campaign, and as a counselor to the president before moving into her home state's U.S. attorney's office. She's continued to go in front of the camera since taking the job.


	Habba has been on TV defending Trump's deportation agenda, pushing misinformation about Social Security, and otherwise touting the president's agenda. She announced to Sean Hannity last Thursday that she is opening an investigation into New Jersey's Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, who she says is working to thwart the administration from expelling migrants from the state. “Pam Bondi has made it clear and so has our president that we are to take all criminals — violent criminals and criminals — out of this country and completely enforce federal law,” she said.


	Media Matters found Habba has been on Fox News 27 times from when Trump was inaugurated until last week, including six times since she took over as New Jersey's top prosecutor in March. The number, again, doesn't include weekend appearances or hits on other networks.


	“We have seen the capture of the Justice Department for purely political purposes to a degree that we've never seen before,” Steve Vladeck, law professor at the University of Texas, tells Rolling Stone.


	There seems to be at least some awareness within the Justice Department that this kind of overt politicization isn't a good look — and might hurt the department's cases. 


	Reuters reported on Tuesday that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche — another one of Trump's personal attorney installed in a high-ranking Justice Department position — is behind a new social media policy prohibiting Justice Department employees from “injecting their political views into the work they perform” or from posting anything that might “heighten condemnation of an accused.”


	It's unclear if Blanche's policy applies to his only superior at the Justice Department. Reuters points out that Bondi posted to X on March 27 that law enforcement arrested a “top MS-13 national leader,” despite the criminal complaint only stating investigators found “indica” of the suspect's “association” with the gang. The charges were later dropped and the suspect is expected to be deported instead. Bondi's post is still up.

	











	So is a post from Ed Martin, the interim U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., who in February described himself and those in his office as “President Trumps' lawyers.” Martin's time in front of a camera has mostly come on Russian state TV prior to this year, but he's demonstrated astonishing political bias in both his social media posts and official actions since taking his new role. He is currently preparing for what could be a hotly contested confirmation process to take the job permanently, and has been reposting a host of MAGA commentators, including Donald Trump Jr., calling for Senate Republicans to confirm him.


	Martin's colleague in New Jersey acknowledged on the air last week that she shouldn't be letting her own bias show. “I can't speak politically so I'm going to speak solely on criminal,” Habba began before responding to a question from Fox News host Jesse Watters about why the Supreme Court ruled the administration can't leave Kilmar Abrego Garcia to rot in a Salvadoran prison.


	Habba's supposedly non-political explanation was that federal law required Abrego Garcia to be deported. The Trump administration has admitted, however, that it should not have sent him there, chalking the mistake up to an “administrative error,” as a federal judge had ruled that he could not be deported to El Salvador and granted him a “protection from removal” order. The law literally stipulates the opposite of what Habba is claiming.


	“You commit a crime, you're out — that's what America asked for, that's what they want,” Habba added, despite Abrego Garcia's never having even been charged criminally.


	“We have an administration that thinks you govern by going on television,” Vladeck says. “Where sound bites are more important than policies, and photo ops are more important than achievements, where getting a video of Kristi Noem in El Salvador is more important than actually accomplishing the goal of reducing crime by undocumented immigrants.”


	The White House recently posted a video of Noem, the head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), sporting a Rolex worth tens of thousands of dollars as she spoke about the administration's deportation blitz in front of a prison cell in El Salvador, carefully staged with tatted up inmates. Trump's entire crackdown seems mostly like a propaganda effort designed to produce these types of videos, as the vast majority of those sent to El Salvador did not have a criminal record, including Abrego Garcia. Noem's DHS has simultaneously budgeted up to $200 million on TV commercials effusively thanking Trump “for closing the border.”

	











	The propaganda has intensified in recent days as Abrego Garcia's case has found its way to the center of the news cycle. Trump and his top administration officials have pushed a torrent of misinformation about the case while resisting the Supreme Court's order to return him. One might think the attorney general could offer a relatively level-headed assessment of the situation without throwing the administration under the bus — but with Abrego Garcia's case, as with Trump's broader weaponization of the Justice Department, there is no level-headed way to rationalize what is happening.


	Bondi, then, is less an attorney general than a front-facing spokesperson for the administration. She was pushing misinformation in the Oval Office on Monday as Trump welcomed Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, claiming Abrego Garcia's case is an “international matter” and that the Supreme Court only ruled that the U.S. needs to “facilitate” his return if El Salvador first decides to release him. (The Supreme Court ruling is somewhat vague, but it specifies that the U.S. should “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's “release” from custody in El Salvador.)


	A few hours later, Bondi was talking to Watters about how Trump wants to “make America safe again” by sending U.S. citizens to El Salvador.

Haley Joel Osment was arrested for alleged public intoxication and possession of an unidentified controlled substance in Mammoth Lakes, California, earlier this month. 


	The actor was identified as an “unruly skier” at Mammoth Mountain Ski Area by the Mammoth Lakes Police Department, according to Entertainment Weekly. Osment was held by ski patrol until around 2 p.m. when police arrived and arrested him. He is no longer in custody. Charges have yet to filed against Osment and the Mono County district attorney will determine whether to prosecute the case. 


	Osment, who lost his home in the Eaton Fire earlier this year, has had occasional run-ins with the law. In 2006, he was charged with a DUI and marijuana possession after being involved in a car crash, and was sentenced to three years probation. In 2018, the actor was involved in a verbal scuffle at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, with police being called about an “unruly passenger.” 


	Although Osment is best known as a child actor, who memorably starred in The Sixth Sense, he has continued to appear onscreen in recent years. He co-starred in Zoë Kravitz's 2024 directorial debut, Blink Twice, and he is set to play an undisclosed role in the second season of Netflix's Wednesday. Recently, Osment joined the cast of Poker Face‘s Season Two, which will premiere May 8 on Peacock.

Randy Newman returned to late-night television with a performance of his 1972 song “Political Science” on Everybody's Live With John Mulaney.


	The legendary singer-songwriter also played a rendition of his oft-covered “I Think It's Going to Rain Today” on the Netflix show, Newman's first late-night performance since a Covid-era virtual performance on The Tonight Show in June 2020 and his first onstage performance in over two years.

	Since the pandemic, Newman has only appeared onstage on less than a handful of times, including a Newport Folk pop-up show in July 2021 and a New Orleans Jazz Fest set in May 2022.


	However, the 81-year-old singer's legacy continues to be felt across the music industry, notably at the 2025 Grammy Awards, where an all-star lineup of artists — including Brad Paisley, Sheryl Crow, Dawes, St. Vincent and Brittany Howard — performed his classic “I Love L.A.” to open the ceremony, a rendition that was a tribute to the city following the massive wildfires earlier this year; Newman did not take part in that performance.

	Given the current administration, “Political Science” was a fitting choice for Newman's return, as its a satirical song that poked fun at America's foreign policy at the time it was written. Newman previously played the song on late-night during the George W. Bush administration in 2006, performing it on The Colbert Report.


	Wednesday's episode of Everybody's Live also featured guests David Letterman, Nikki Glaser, Hannibal Buress, “the thing that lives behind the dumpster in Mulholland Drive,” and a surprise cameo by Jimmy Kimmel, who appeared onstage as an officially 6-foot-tall person:

Aerospace engineer Mike Bara breaks down the states best ranked for preparing for an alien invasion on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

A group of unidentified flying objects spotted by Navy sailors is raising eyebrows after witnesses reported watching the oddly-shaped aircraft rise from the ocean before jetting off in a synchronized fashion last year. 

The four aircraft were spotted by sailors aboard USS Jackson while off the coast of California last year, Jeremy Corbell, co-host of the ""Weaponized"" podcast, told Fox 11. 

""[This] is a machine that is able to outpace, outmaneuver, and outperform anything that we know of that's been made by technology and terrestrial nations,"" Corbell said.

The UFOs reportedly emerged from the Pacific Ocean and were spotted by sailors before showing up on the ship's radar, an unnamed witness told Corbell. 

Footage recorded by the Navy warship and obtained by Corbell shows the four aircraft grouping together before racing off in unison. 

""Everybody on the ship knew they were seeing something extraordinary,"" Corbell said. ""So obviously people thought it was important to document and then finally witnesses came forward.""

The Navy and Corbell did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. 

Corbell noted the footage shows the objects do not have a wing or tail, raising questions regarding the aircraft's ability to fly. However, Corbell does not believe the unidentified objects are nefarious or operated by a foreign adversary. 

""I'd rather these things be from another planet than an adversarial nation, because if it was an adversarial nation then their ability to weaponize that technology would be unprecedented,"" Corbell said. ""Luckily, we don't see a fingerprint for that.""

However, military officials claim the sighting was never recorded.

""[The All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office] has no record of this alleged UAP incident,"" a Pentagon spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement. 

The flying objects draw striking similarities to the infamous ""Tic Tac""-shaped aircraft sighting by USS Nimitz off the coast of Southern California in 2004. The incident drew national attention in 2017, exposing previously unknown programs within the Department of Defense relating to UFO research. 

In 2020, the Pentagon released three unclassified Navy videos from November 2004 and January 2015.

""The aerial phenomena observed in the videos remain characterized as ‘unidentified',"" the Pentagon said in a statement. 

Last year, a Pentagon official testified to Congress that the Pentagon had solved a well-known mystery surrounding a flying object spotted by USS Theodore Roosevelt in 2016. 

The UFO spotted flying at high speeds above the Atlantic Ocean was nothing out of the ordinary, but instead a trick of the eye causing objects to appear as if they were moving much faster, referred to as a ""parallax,"" according to Dr. Jon Kosloski, the director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.

""Through a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry, we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water, but is rather closer to 13,000 feet,"" Kosloski said. 

As for the four aircraft spotted by Navy sailors last year, Corbell believes there is no cause for alarm.

Several News On 6 viewers reported seeing a line of lights moving across the night sky, prompting speculation about unidentified flying objects.

Despite their drone-like appearance, these lights are most likely Starlink satellites launched by SpaceX. The satellites often appear in a closely spaced formation shortly after launch, creating a visual effect sometimes described as a ""string of pearls.""

According to Starlink, this phenomenon is especially visible during the first few days after launch, when the satellites are still close together and reflecting sunlight or light. During this period, the satellites are often only visible during the first couple of days due to changes in the orientation of the solar panels and the addition of sunshades, which were implemented to reduce their brightness and impact on astronomical observations.

A STARLINK SATELLITE OBSERVING GROUP on Facebook shared a video of some in Coweta, Oklahoma, on Wednesday night.



The sunshades, known as ""VisorSats,"" block sunlight from reflecting off the satellites' surfaces, while the adjusted solar panel angles further reduce visibility.

For those interested in observing Starlink satellites, timing and viewing conditions are crucial. The satellites are most visible shortly after launch, under clear skies, and when the sun's angle allows for optimal reflection. Websites like Heavens-Above and FindStarlink offer real-time tracking to help skywatchers plan their observations.

The FindStarlink website confirmed the satellites' location in Oklahoma.



It also predicts that the satellites could be visible on Thursday and Friday night as well.

If you've ever walked by the beautiful St. Cecilia Music Center in downtown Grand Rapids and felt a little chill run down your spine… well, you might not be imagining things.

This historic building isn't just an incredible place to catch a concert. It was actually founded way back in 1883 by a group of trailblazing women who wanted to bring music appreciation to the community. By 1894, they had raised the funds and hired architect Henry Ives Cobb to design the Renaissance Revival building we see today. Fun fact: it's the only building in the country built by women specifically for music. Pretty awesome, right?

But what makes St. Cecilia even more interesting are the whispers that it might be haunted.

Over the years, people have reported some spooky stuff happening between their walls. Some reports include chairs moving on their own, some shadowy figures seen on the stage, and voices, even accounts of echoing through empty rooms.

One of the creepiest reports? The elevator moving by itself and items vanishing or showing up in totally different spots without any reason. (Sounds like ghosts to me)

Carla Messing, the center's event and facility director, has had her own weird experiences. She once stayed overnight during a paranormal investigation and said she heard music playing when no one else was around. Her group also spotted a ghostly figure that resembled a former staff member. Totally chill, right?

Despite the ghostly rumors, most people believe the spirits at St. Cecilia are friendly. Maybe they just love music as much as the rest of us. So next time you're at a show and feel something strange, maybe someone's just enjoying the music from the other side.","{'href': 'https://mix957gr.com', 'title': 'Mix 95.7'}","other"

Scientists have discovered evidence of large quantities of biosignature chemicals — only known to be made by life on Earth — on an exoplanet more than 100 light-years away. It could be the most promising sign yet of alien life.

Chemical fingerprints of life have been found on a distant exoplanet by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). It is the ""most promising"" evidence yet for alien life, scientists say.

These chemicals were detected in the atmosphere of an exoplanet named K2-18b, which is located 124 light-years away from Earth and orbits its star in the habitable zone — the region around a star where liquid water can exist on a planet's surface — according to a new study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on April 17.

On Earth, these molecules — dimethyl sulfide (DMS) and dimethyl disulfide (DMDS) — are only produced by life, such as marine algae and other microbes. Before now, DMS and DMDS hadn't been definitively detected in the atmospheres of any other planets or moons. While it is theoretically possible for these chemicals to be created without the presence of life, they are considered potential biosignatures on other worlds.

""Our findings provide new independent evidence for the possibility of a biosphere on K2-18 b"" and ""present an important step forward in the search for signatures of life on exoplanets,"" the researchers wrote in the paper.

K2-18b, which is 2.6 times the size of our planet and 8.6 times the mass, is suspected to be a ""hycean world,"" meaning that it potentially has a planet-wide ocean and an atmosphere rich in hydrogen.

In a previous paper published in 2023, the same team of researchers detected methane (CH₄) and carbon dioxide (CO₂) in the planet's atmosphere, marking the first time that carbon-based molecules had been found in the atmosphere of an exoplanet in its star's habitable zone. The scientists also discovered potential signs of DMS. However, the levels of DMS had ""low statistical significance,"" so the researchers couldn't be certain that it was indeed present.

""We didn't know for sure whether the signal we saw last time was due to DMS, but just the hint of it was exciting enough for us to have another look with JWST using a different instrument,"" Nikku Madhusudhan, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Cambridge and lead author of both studies, said in a statement.

In the latest study, the researchers found that new measurements of the planet's atmosphere taken by JWST's Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) show specific features that can only be explained by the presence of either DMS or DMDS. Due to the similarities of these two molecules, they appear very alike in the measurements that JWST takes from the atmospheres of exoplanets, meaning it is hard to tell which molecule is present in greater quantities.

""This is an independent line of evidence, using a different instrument than we did before and a different wavelength range of light, where there is no overlap with the previous observations,"" Madhusudhan said. ""The signal came through strong and clear.""

The researchers noted that levels of DMS and/or DMDS in the atmosphere may be as high as 10 parts per million by volume, which is much higher than the levels seen here on Earth, which are below one part per billion by volume.

The researchers said that these observations have reached a ""three-sigma"" level of significance. This means there is just a 0.3% probability that they occurred by chance. To confirm a discovery, scientists typically require a five-sigma significance level, where there is below a 0.00006% probability of occurring by chance.

DMS and DMDS are not known to be produced in large quantities through non-biological processes on Earth, meaning that their detection in such large quantities on K2-18b is a major indicator for the potential presence of life.

—Intelligent aliens would need a power supply to jump-start their civilization — would they require fossil fuels?

—'Perhaps it's only a matter of time': Intelligent life may be much more likely than first thought, new model suggests

""Given everything we know about this planet, a Hycean world with an ocean that is teeming with life is the scenario that best fits the data we have,"" Madhusudhan said.

The researchers said that more measurements need to be taken to achieve five-sigma significance and also differentiate between the presence of DMS and DMDS. They hope to take these measurements soon, whenever they can get the JWST to look at this exoplanet for a few more hours. They also noted that the presence of DMS and/or DMDS could have arisen from as-yet-unknown chemical reactions not involving any life at all, which they hope to test experimentally.

""It's important that we're deeply sceptical of our own results, because it's only by testing and testing again that we will be able to reach the point where we're confident in them,"" Madhusudhan said. ""That's how science has to work.""

Human skeletons from a large stone tomb may help archaeologists understand a mysterious pre-Inca population in Peru.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The battle-scarred skeletons of two dozen people have been discovered in Peru, revealing new evidence of an ancient conflict.

The site, El Curaca, is located in the Atico River Valley in south coastal Peru and was occupied around A.D. 1000 to 1450 by the Chuquibamba or Aruni people, who lived there before and after Spanish conquest. Archaeologists know little about the Aruni, beyond the many petroglyphs they left on cave walls in the area.

But in October 2024, Jósef Szykulski of the Institute of Archaeology at the University of Wrocław in Poland and his team launched an excavation at the site and uncovered a large circular stone tomb filled with 24 skeletons of men, women and children.

The collective burial included fragments of pottery, bone and stone tools, corn cobs and textiles. Preliminary analysis of the skeletons — which were wrapped in textiles — suggested that all of the people died due to injuries consistent with battle wounds.

The bodies were buried in a tomb along with rich grave goods, so Szykulski concluded that their side won the battle, with their surviving compatriots giving the massacred victims an honorable burial, according to a translated Facebook post.

Szykulski and his team are continuing their work in Peru until the end of April. They are currently documenting the skulls using 3D scanning, working to conserve the textiles they found, and analyzing the pottery and wood items recovered from the burial.

Gold is having a stellar year — and its surge may not be over yet.

Spot prices hit another record high of $3,357.40 per troy ounce on Wednesday before falling back after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said President Donald Trump's tariffs were ""significantly larger"" than expected.

He warned that the policies could lead to weaker economic growth and higher inflation.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank called gold's latest price surge the ""biggest daily jump in two years"" in a note on Wednesday.

Last week Goldman Sachs raised its overall price forecast by $400 to $3,700 an ounce by the end of the year.

Lina Thomas, a commodities strategist at the bank, and Daan Struyven, cohead of global commodities research, said in a note on April 11 they expected gold to trade in a range between $3,650 to $3,950, up from $3,250 to $3,520.

The increase was based on stronger-than-expected central bankdemand and a boost from increased recession risk. The Goldman analysts said that stresses in bond markets ""increase our conviction that gold is uniquely positioned to hedge recession risk.""

The bank's economists say there's a 45% chance of a US recession in the next 12 months. If that happens, the analysts said gold could hit $3,880 by the end of the year — or even as much as $4,500 under certain scenarios.

Gold regained momentum after losing ground in the days following the announcement of tariffs on April 2 as investors seek out safe-haven assets, which typically maintain or increase their value during market turbulence.

Goldman put the dip down to investors liquidating gold ""to meet margin calls"" in last week's stock market selloff.

The metal has hit a number of records this year, passing the $3,000 threshold for the first time last month.

At the end of last week, UBS analysts raised their 2025 gold price target to $3,500, citing ""escalating tariff uncertainty, weaker growth, higher inflation and lingering geopolitical risks."" Bank of America also has a price target of $3,500.

Russia escaped unscathed from President Donald Trump's trade tariffs unveiled earlier this month, but the Kremlin says Moscow is not immune from the economic aftershocks that could ensue in a potential global trade war.

""Of course, instability in the global economy cannot but affect Russia,"" Kremlin Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov told CNBC on Wednesday, according to a Google translation.

""At the same time, we manage to maintain macroeconomic stability even in the face of numerous sanctions,"" Peskov added in emailed comments.

Unlike many U.S. allies who were hit with trade tariffs in Trump's early-April announcement, Russia was spared new import tariffs when Trump announced his wide-ranging list of new duties to be imposed on imports from more than 180 countries, ostensibly aimed at leveling up the global trading playing field.

Russia was left out, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Axios media outlet, because U.S. sanctions on the country for its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 already precluded ""any meaningful trade"" between the two nations. 

Analysts question that assertion, saying Russia still did more trade with the U.S. than a number of other countries that made it onto the tariffs list, such as Brunei and Mauritius. Ukraine, incidentally, was hit with a 10% tariff.

A White House official told CNBC Thursday that Russia, along with Cuba, Belarus and North Korea, were ""not subject to the Reciprocal Tariff Executive Order because they are already facing extremely high tariffs and our previously imposed sanctions preclude any meaningful trade with these countries."" The official added that President Trump has also recently threatened to impose strong sanctions on Russia.

Global market turbulence prompted Trump to temporarily reduce the tariff rates on imports from most countries — barring China — to 10% for 90 days. Whether negotiations taking place with various trading partners in the interim can lead to compromise and, ultimately, trade deals is highly uncertain.

Russia's reaction to Trump's trade duties has been mixed, with state media observing the measures and market fallout with a mixture of cool detachment, some concern over global economic volatility and a touch of schadenfreude at the turbulence hitting the West.

Trump's destabilization of the existing U.S.-led ""global world order"" — which Moscow would like to dismantle — is also seen as a potential benefit of the tariffs to Kremlin, analysts say. They warn that Russia is not immune to the impact of any trade war.

""On the surface you see a lot of giggles and genuine relief [in Russia] that, for once, it is not Russia that is at the center of attention,"" Anton Barbashin, a Russian political analyst and editorial director of the journal Riddle, told CNBC on Wednesday, noting that ""Russia does see itself better positioned in the world of a more pronounced bipolarity.""

""Russia wants a less global U.S. that is engaged in permanent conflict with China (though not war), so that Washington does not have enough time for Europe,"" he said in emailed comments.

Barbashin said two schools of thought had emerged in Russia — one recognizing the damage that a trade war could do to the country, and the other acknowledging that economically weakened rivals benefit Russia geopolitically.

""Russia is still dependent on global economy and high demand for her exports. If a global recession is to follow, it could seriously hurt Russia's pockets. Yet there is another level of analysis in Russia that suggests that ... the more he [Trump] does to harm the transatlantic relationship the easier it would be for Moscow to split Europe on issues related to Ukraine,"" Barbashin noted.

Russia analysts have questioned why Russia was not subjected to any tariffs, and whether its exclusion could be part of a White House plan to try to gain leverage over Moscow in any Ukraine peace talks.

""The White House said Russia was not hit with tariffs because there was no trade between the two countries due to the Western sanctions ... That's not entirely true,"" Alexander Kolyandr, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, noted.

Exports of Russian goods to the U.S. totaled a 30-year low of around $3 billion in 2024, and the U.S. exported $526 million worth of goods to Russia over the period, he noted.

""These are tiny numbers when it comes to overall U.S. trade, but, for example, Lesotho, an African kingdom with a population of 2 million, sells even less to the U.S. — about $2 billion worth of goods a year — but was hit with a 50% tariff,"" Kolyandr noted.

According to the formula used to determine the tariffs on trading partners, Russia should have faced a 40% tariff, based on 2024 numbers. Kolyandr noted, however, that in recent pre-war years, Russia and the U.S. have enjoyed relatively balanced trade, which would have meant Russia hit instead with the baseline 10% tariff rate.

Kolyandr told CNBC on Thursday that if there is a desire in the White House to use the tariffs as a way to induce Moscow into peace negotiations on Ukraine, ""then it's a delusion.""

""The size [of trade] is very small, and even before the war, the U.S. was not Russia's significant trade partner compared to places like the European Union, Turkey, China or India.""

""Russia does need some technological stuff from the United States, such as spare parts for Boeing (airplanes], for example. And apart from Tungsten and Titanium, Russia has very little to offer to the United States which is not elastic, in other words, which cannot be procured somewhere else. So I don't think that the trade tariffs are something Moscow can be seduced with to stop the war.""

The World Trade Organization on Wednesday warned that the outlook for global trade has ""deteriorated sharply"" in the wake of Trump's tariffs regime.

Based on the duties currently in place, and including a 90-day suspension of ""reciprocal tariffs,"" the volume of world merchandise trade is now expected to decline by 0.2% in 2025, the WTO said. It added that global economic growth would take a direct hit from a decline in global trading volumes.

Even if Russia is not a direct target, it's certain to suffer collateral damage from tariffs and a potential trade war, analysts agree, with a decline in prices and demand for Russia's main oil global export supplies posting a major economic risk.

Russia is already laboring under significant domestic inflation — which hit an annual 10.3% in March — and the country's central bank has maintained high interest rates of 21% recently in a bid to deal with war-led price pressures.

""If the trade war pushes the global economy into a recession, and especially if overall trade goes down, which means fewer goods criss-cross the globe, that would mean that demand for oil would also go down if there is a recession, and it is painful for Russia,"" Kolyandr told CNBC.

""But Russia's problems do not end with oil. With global instability and a spike in inflation and, presumably, a decline of oil revenues, Russia's central bank will find it difficult to start easing its base rate. It's stifling the Russian non-military economy. So, basically, about two thirds of the national economy has to borrow at 21%. You cannot be healthy with such a high rate.""

Follow:


            A federal appeals court rejected the Trump administration's request that it halt the next steps Judge Paula Xinis is seeking to take in the case concerning a migrant who was wrongly deported to El Salvador, with a strident warning about the rule of law and the possibility the dispute presented an “incipient crisis.”
    


            The 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals said in its seven-page ruling Thursday that the Trump administration's assertions in the case “should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”
    


            The unanimous ruling was written by Judge Harvie Wilkinson, an appointee of former President Ronald Reagan. In it, he was extremely critical of the administration's effort to undo some of Xinis' recent orders in the case, sounding alarm bells about how its maneuverings in the matter have resulted in the two branches “grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both.”

            “The Judiciary will lose much from the constant intimations of its illegitimacy, to which by dent of custom and detachment we can only sparingly reply,” Wilkinson wrote. “The Executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions. The Executive may succeed for a time in weakening the courts, but over time history will script the tragic gap between what was and all that might have been, and law in time will sign its epitaph.”
    


            The appeals court used the order to weigh in on the broader atmosphere around President Trump's conflict with the judiciary.
    


            “The basic differences between the branches mandate a serious effort at mutual respect. The respect that courts must accord the Executive must be reciprocated by the Executive's respect for the courts,” the 4th Circuit said. “Too often today this has not been the case, as calls for impeachment of judges for decisions the Executive disfavors and exhortations to disregard court orders sadly illustrate.”
    


            The court's rejection of the Justice Department's bid for emergency intervention sets the stage for the dispute to return to the Supreme Court, one week after the justices left most of the Xinis' order that the government facilitate the migrants return.

            The order, nonetheless, ended with a note of optimism.
    


            “It is, as we have noted, all too possible to see in this case an incipient crisis, but it may present an opportunity as well,” the 4th Circuit said. “We yet cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.”

Follow:


            President Donald Trump has falsely claimed this week that grocery prices are “going down” and “are down.” In fact, grocery prices have continued to rise under Trump – and they were up even before he imposed near-global 10% tariffs earlier this month.
    


            Trump made the latest version of the false claim while denouncing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Powell had warned in Wednesday public remarks that Trump's tariff policies are likely to lead to slower economic growth and higher inflation.
    


            Trump wrote on social media Thursday that Powell should have lowered interest rates “long ago” and should do so now, as the European Central Bank did again on Thursday.Trump's argument: “Oil prices are down, groceries (even eggs!) are down, and the USA is getting RICH ON TARIFFS.” He had similarly claimed on social media on Tuesday that the US is taking in hefty tariff revenue “with the cost of almost all products going down, including gasoline, groceries, and just about everything else.”
    


            But grocery prices are not down or going down.
    


            Average grocery prices were about 2.41% higher in March 2025 than they were in March 2024, Consumer Price Index data shows. This was the highest year-over-year grocery inflation rate since August 2023.
    


            And average March 2025 grocery prices were up about 0.49% from February 2025. That was the highest month-to-month grocery inflation rate since October 2022.
    


            Month-to-month grocery inflation was quite low in February 2025, with average prices essentially the same as they were in January 2025. The jump in March 2025, though, meant that average grocery prices last month were about 0.49% higher than they were in January 2025, the month Trump returned to office. (It's possible that prices at some particular grocery stores have fallen under Trump.)
    


            And this increase in average grocery prices happened before Trump imposed 10% tariffs in early April on imports from most countries (notably excluding goods from major agricultural trading partners Canada and Mexico that are compliant with Trump's USMCA deal).Those 10% tariffs are certain to increase grocery prices, though it's not clear by how much. Prices would likely rise further if Trump re-imposed the higher tariffs he put on pause for 90 days hours after they briefly went into effect in early April.
    


Assessing Trump's other claims in the social media posts



            We'll briefly assess Trump's other claims about inflation in the two social media posts this week.
    


            It is true that oil prices have gone down since Trump returned to office. But Trump didn't mention that many analysts say this decline is partly related to concerns that the tariff wars he initiated will slow the global economy and therefore reduce demand for oil. 



            US retail gas prices have fallen slightly so far this month, per data provided to CNN by AAA, declining from a national average of about $3.20 per gallon on April 1 to about $3.17 per gallon on Thursday. But prices are up slightly since Trump returned to the White House on January 20, when the national average was about $3.12 per gallon.
    


            Retail egg prices have spiked under Trump amid an avian flu outbreak, hitting a new high of about $6.23 per dozen on average in March – about 25.7% higher than the average in January. Wholesale egg prices, however, have declined sharply since late February, so it's possible egg prices paid by consumers are falling this month, too.
    


            Trump has at least one data point to cite as evidence for his claim that overall consumer prices are coming down: there was a tiny decline in overall prices in March 2025 compared to February 2025, about 0.05%, on a seasonally adjusted basis. But that, too, was before Trump imposed his 10% tariffs in early April. And even as of March, prices were about 0.17% higher on a seasonally adjusted basis than they were in January 2025 and about 2.41% higher than they were in March 2024.

UK researchers have claimed to have found a possible sign of life on a faraway planet. Scientists from the University of Cambridge have announced the detection of a gas that on Earth is only made by living organisms.

The discovery, which was made using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, could be the strongest hint yet of life beyond Earth.

The team studied K2-18 b, a planet about 124 light-years away in the Leo constellation. It is known as a “hycean” planet, meaning it may have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere and liquid water oceans. Such conditions make it a promising candidate for life.

The telescope detected dimethyl sulfide and dimethyl disulfide in the planet's air. On Earth, both gases are made only by living organisms, mainly marine microbes such as phytoplankton. Levels of these compounds on the planet K2-18 b were found to be thousands of times higher than those on Earth.

Dr. Nikku Madhusudhan, a Cambridge University astrophysicist and lead author of the study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters on Thursday, said the implications could be profound.

The findings “provide new independent evidence for the possibility of a biosphere on K2-18 b,” the study claimed. “What we are finding at this point are hints of possible biological activity outside the solar system,” he told a press conference. “Frankly, I think this is the closest we have come to seeing a feature that we can attribute to life,” he added.

Madhusudhan explained that detecting chemical fingerprints of gases that on Earth are created only through biological processes could point to a potentially inhabited alien world. “This is a revolutionary moment,” he added.

However, the team warned that the detected gases could also be the result of unknown natural processes. Additional telescope observations are needed to determine if living organisms truly are the source.

Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani in Moscow on Thursday to discuss regional security issues in the Middle East, focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the situation in Syria.

The visit marked Al Thani's first official trip to Russia since 2018.

Both leaders expressed concern over the ongoing civilian suffering in Gaza. Al Thani said Israel had failed to uphold the internationally brokered ceasefire deal agreed with Palestinian authorities in January, in which Qatar played a key mediating role.

“As you know, we reached an agreement months ago, but unfortunately, Israel did not abide by this agreement,” Al Thani stated, adding that Doha continues its efforts to broker a lasting ceasefire in the region.

Putin and Al Thani both reiterated their support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

“Civilians continue to die in Palestine, which is an absolute tragedy,” Putin said. “We believe – and our positions here are the same – that a long-term settlement can be achieved only and exclusively on the basis of the United Nations decision on the creation of the Palestinian state.”

The leaders also discussed the situation in Syria following the ouster of longtime President Bashar Assad by a broad coalition of armed groups led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) late last year. Assad, a close ally to Moscow, was replaced by HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.

“We would like to do everything to ensure that Syria remains a sovereign, independent and geographically integrated state,” Putin said. He added that Moscow was ready to work with Doha to address the humanitarian crisis and stabilize Syria, citing ongoing challenges in politics, security and the economy.

Al Thani said he recently met with Syria's new leader, who conveyed an interest in maintaining strong relations with Russia.

“We discussed with [al-Sharaa] the historical ties between Syria and Russia, which were and are of a strategic nature. He is determined to continue cooperation [with Russia], to secure ties based on mutual respect and the interests of the two peoples,” Al Thani said. Syria is “going through a very difficult period” and needs international support to preserve its territorial integrity and sovereignty, he added.

Both leaders also praised the state of Russia-Qatar relations and reaffirmed their commitment to expanding cooperation in trade, investment, and regional diplomacy.

MOSCOW, April 17. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has vehemently rejected the Franco-British proposal to send a ""multinational peacekeeping contingent"" to Ukraine, labeling it as utterly insane.

""Despite their persistent efforts, Paris and London have failed to secure unanimous backing for their reckless plan to deploy what they term a 'multinational peacekeeping contingent' consisting of troops from several NATO member states,"" Zakharova stated at a news briefing.

She noted that, alongside the French and the British, ""only similarly frenzied Russophobes in the Baltic states"" are willing to join this venture, which risks a direct confrontation between the alliance and Russia.

""I am referring, of course, to the regimes. The countries and their peoples are often unaware that their leaders act on orders from outside,"" Zakharova explained.

According to her, most participants in the ""coalition"" doubt the feasibility of this military intervention without U.S. support. ""Judging by the current discussions, Washington still has no intention of becoming involved in such an adventure. It seems to be realistically assessing where all this could lead,"" she added.

Zakharova highlighted that 21 billion euros had been pledged for the needs of the Ukrainian military, a figure that had previously been mentioned in NATO statements.

""Once again, London has taken the lead. It announced a package of assistance amounting to 350 million pounds, which includes, as stated, hundreds of thousands of drones, radar systems, and more,"" she noted. ""In total, the British plan to spend 4.5 billion pounds on military support for Kiev in 2025.""

Zakharova observed that Berlin is attempting to keep pace with London. ""An additional 30 missiles for Patriot launchers have already been shipped to Ukraine, but, as you know, Berlin cannot provide the American systems. Germany is prepared to allocate four more IRIS-T anti-aircraft missile systems and supply combat vehicles, tanks, ammunition, and other equipment,"" she emphasized. ""In total, Germany plans to allocate approximately 3 billion euros for these purposes."".","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Move paves the way for Moscow to normalise ties with leadership of Afghanistan 

Russia has suspended its ban on the Taliban, which it had designated for more than two decades as a terrorist organisation, in a move that paves the way for Moscow to normalise ties with the leadership of Afghanistan.

No country currently recognises the Taliban government that seized power in August 2021 as US-led forces staged a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years of war. But Russia has been gradually building ties with the movement, which Vladimir Putin said last year was now an ally in fighting terrorism.

The Taliban was outlawed by Russia as a terrorist movement in 2003. State media said the supreme court lifted the ban on Thursday with immediate effect.

Russia sees a need to work with the Taliban as it faces a major security threat from Islamist militant groups based in a string of countries from Afghanistan to the Middle East.

In March 2024, gunmen killed 145 people at a concert hall outside Moscow in an attack claimed by Islamic State. US officials said they had intelligence indicating it was the Afghan branch of the group, Islamic State Khorasan (Isis-K), that was responsible.

Fourth circuit court rejects appeal saying it  ‘shall not micromanage the efforts of a fine district judge' who is interpreting supreme court decision

A federal appeals court has rejected an effort by the justice department to halt a judge's investigation into whether the Trump administration violated court orders to “facilitate” the release of Kilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador.

In its order on Thursday, the court said the Trump administration's request to bar US district judge Paula Xinis from opening her inquiry was “both extraordinary and premature”.

We shall not micromanage the efforts of a fine district judge attempting to implement the supreme court's recent decision,” the order states.

“It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter. But in this case, it is not hard at all,” it continues.

The government is asserting a right to stash away residents of this country in foreign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the foundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is nothing that can be done.

This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is reportedly planning to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status in what would be a probably illegal move amid Donald Trump's concerted attack on the independence of US institutions of higher education. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said late on Wednesday that Harvard would lose its ability to enrol foreign students if it did not meet demands the Trump administration demands to share information on some visa holders.

A US appeals court denied the Trump administration's request for a stay of Judge Paula Xinis' order in the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, the Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador. The court described the administration's request as “shocking”.

Cory Booker, a Democratic senator from New Jersey, reportedly plans to travel to El Salvador, as Democrats seek to pressure the Trump administration to return Ábrego García. Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen, who traveled to El Salvador this week, said he attempted to drive to the prison where his Maryland constituent is being held, but was stopped by the military at a checkpoint.

Donald Trump condemned the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, for not lowering US interest rates, and expressed a wish for him to be gone from his role. Trump claimed Powell would resign if he asked him to. Powell himself has said that he would not resign if asked to do so by the president.

Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni said Trump had accepted her invitation for an official trip to Rome, as the pair met in Washington in an attempt by Meloni to bridge the gap between the EU and US amid trade tariff tensions.

The supreme court said it will hear arguments next month over Trump's bid to broadly enforce his executive order to restrict automatic birthright citizenship.  The court will hear arguments in the case set on 15 May.

Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish PhD student and former Fulbright scholar detained after co-authoring a campus newspaper op-ed about Gaza has been denied bond by an immigration judge.

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called on the justice department to investigate whether the arson attack on Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro's home qualifies as a federal hate crime.

James Comer, the chair of the House oversight committee, and Elise Stefanik, chair of the House Republican leadership, have launched an investigation into Harvard University, accusing the university of a “lack of compliance with civil rights laws”.

In a letter on Thursday, Comer and Stefanik directed Harvard to provide documents relating to hiring, admissions and diversity, equity and inclusion.

The congressional inquiry follows Harvard's refusal to comply with demands from the Trump administration.

Elon Musk's SpaceX and two partners have emerged as frontrunners to win a crucial part of Donald Trump's “Golden Dome” missile defense shield, six people familiar with the matter said.

Musk's rocket and satellite company is partnering with the software maker Palantir and the drone builder Anduril on a bid to build key parts of Golden Dome, the sources said, which has drawn significant interest from the technology sector's burgeoning base of defense startups.

All three companies were founded by entrepreneurs who have been major political supporters of Trump.

Here's more on the order from a US appeals court denying the justice department's request to suspend Judge Paula Xinis's investigation into whether the Trump administration complied with an order to return Kilmar Ábrego García, the man wrongly deported to El Salvador.

A three-judge panel from the 4th US circuit court of appeals unanimously refused to suspend Xinis's decision to order sworn testimony by Trump administration officials to determine if they complied with her instruction to “facilitate” Ábrego García's return.

The panel said the administration's claim that it could not do anything to free Ábrego García and return him to the US “should be shocking”.

It comes after the justice department appealed after Xinis on Tuesday ordered sworn testimony by at least four officials who work for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department.

The executive and judicial branches of the federal government “come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both,” the judges wrote in their order today. “This is a losing proposition all around.

The Judiciary will lose much from the constant intimations of its illegitimacy, to which by dent of custom and detachment we can only sparingly reply. The Executive will lose much from a public perception of its lawlessness and all of its attendant contagions.

A Massachusetts family is demanding answers from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), complaining its agents smashed a car window with a large hammer and detained a man whom they say had applied for asylum.

A lawyer for the family also claims agents were not looking for the man in the car, Juan Francisco Mendez, when they grabbed him on Monday in New Bedford while he was driving to a dental appointment. He is now believed to have been taken into Ice detention.

The lawyer, Ondine Galvez-Sniffin, told the Associated Press in an interview that the agents claimed they were looking for another man with a different name before they dragged Mendez and his wife out of the car.

This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.

The supreme court said it will hear arguments next month over Donald Trump's bid to restrict automatic birthright citizenship.

The justices, in an unsigned order, did not immediately act on a request by Trump's administration to narrow the scope of three nationwide injunctions issued by federal judges in Washington state, Massachusetts and Maryland that halted his 20 January order while the matter is litigated.

Instead, the court deferred any decision on that request until it hears arguments in the case set for 15 May.

Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen said he attempted to drive to the prison where his Maryland constituent Kilmar Ábrego García is being held, but was stopped by the military at a checkpoint.

Ábrego García was deported to his home country last month due to what the Trump administration has admitted was an “administrative error”. The supreme court has ordered the government to “facilitate” his return to the United States, but Donald Trump has refused to do so.

Van Hollen arrived in El Salvador yesterday intending to meet Ábrego García and report on his well-being to his family. The senator met with vice-president Félix Ulloa, who refused his request to see the deportee in person, or speak to him on the phone.

The senator said he attempted today to drive to the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), where Ábrego García is being held.

Van Hollen said in a video filmed on the side of a road:

I understand we're about three kilometers now from Cecot, and as you can see, they're letting other cars go by, but they stopped us because they're under orders not to allow us to proceed to check on the well being of Kilmar Ábrego García.

You can watch it here. Here's more on Van Hollen's attempt to visit Ábrego García.

Trump said he had been “fully briefed” on the mass shooting at Florida State University, which has reportedly resulted in multiple casualties.

“It's a horrible thing. It's horrible that things like this take place,” he said.

Trump said the US and Ukraine would sign a new minerals deal next Thursday.

“We have a minerals deal,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “We have a deal on that.”

Asked about Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump said “I'm not happy with him,” adding:

I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job.

Donald Trump continued his criticism of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell and indicated he believes he has the power to remove him from his post.

“Oh he'll leave. If I ask him to, he'll be out of there,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. He added:

I don't think he's doing the job. He's too late, always too late. Little slow, and I'm not happy with him. I let him know it, and if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast.

He did not respond to a follow-up question on whether he would try to remove Powell from the post.

Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni said Donald Trump has accepted her invitation to come to Italy for an official visit.

“I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Rome in the near future and consider [the] possibility to meet also with Europe,” Meloni told reporters in the Oval Office.

She said her goal is to “make the west great again”. “I think we can do it together.”

When I speak about [the] west, I don't speak about geographical space. I speak about a civilization, and I want to make that civilization stronger.

Donald Trump and Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni have been speaking to reporters in the Oval Office.

Trump praised Meloni as a “friend” who has done a “fantastic job” and “taken Europe by storm”.

“Everybody loves her and respects her, and I can't say that about many people,” Trump said. “We really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves.”

Students, faculty and members of the Harvard University community have been protesting on campus, a day after the Trump administration threatened to revoke the university's ability to enrol international students.

Harvard made headlines on Monday by becoming the first university to stand up against a series of onerous demands from the Trump administration, setting the stage for a showdown between the federal government and one of the US's most prestigious institutions.

Donald Trump has also threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status, after freezing $2.3bn in federal funds to the school.

Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni has invited Donald Trump to visit Italy as the two leaders sat down for talks at the White House.

Their meeting comes a day before Meloni hosts vice-president JD Vance in Rome, and the back-to-back talks could be critical in determining whether she can play a mediator role between the US and Europe.

Meloni added that she expected Italy would announce at the next Nato meeting in June that her country would be able to reach the alliance requirement that each member nation spend 2% of GDP on defense spending.

Donald Trump and Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni have said they are certain they can make a trade deal ahead of talks at the White House.

“I am sure we can make a deal, and I am here to help with that,” Meloni said as she sat across a table from Trump ahead of a lunch on Thursday.

Trump said that broadly speaking he expected he would make an announcement about trade deals but was “in no rush”. Per pool report:

Oh, there will be a trade deal, 100% … Of course there will be a trade deal. They want to make one very much. And we are going to make a trade deal. I fully expect it. And it will be a fair deal.

Asked about what countries were on his priority list, Trump said, “Everybody is on my priority list.”

Brendan Carr, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has attacked Comcast, claiming that the media company is “misleading the American public” by describing Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a 29-year old Salvadorian man living in Maryland who was wrongfully sent to El Salvador, as a “Maryland man.”

Carr, who was appointed to his position by Trump, targeted Comcast outlets and accused them of “news distortion” on X.

The FCC chair's comments come a day after Trump attacked Comcast in a separate Truth Social post this week, writing that Comcast and its leadership “are a disgrace to the integrity of Broadcasting!!!”

Last week, the supreme court unanimously ruled and ordered the administration to “facilitate” the return of Garcia, who was supposed to have been protected from deportation to El Salvador, regardless of whether he was part of the MS-13 gang – a claim that the Trump administration has repeated and which García's family and attorneys staunchly refutes.

Garcia has no criminal record in the US, according to court documents. It's also noteworthy that while members of the Trump administration continue to make the claim on television, the Department of Justice has not made the MS-13 accusation in court papers and has admitted the deportation was an error.

Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni has arrived at the White House ahead of talks with Donald Trump.

Speaking to reporters before their formal bilateral meeting, Trump praised Meloni, calling her a “great prime minister” and “one of the real leaders of the world”.

Meloni said she wants to “speak frankly about the needs that every one of us has” and “find the best way to make us both stronger”.

In respose to whether Meloni will be the one to “mediate your relationship with Europe”, Trump said: “Well, I do like her very much… I'm very proud to be with her…can't do better than that.”

Treasury secretary Scott Bessent has cautioned White House officials to avoid firing Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, Politico reports, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Trump's frustration with Powell stems from Powell's refusal to cut interest rates, something which Trump has repeatedly advocated for. On Thursday, Trump took to Truth Social and vowed that Powell's “termination cannot come fast enough”!

Since Trump issued sweeping tariffs – which he later scaled back as part of a 90-day pause on most countries – the president has been calling for lower rates. However, Powell has kept rates elevated in attempts to control rising prices across the country.

Politico reports that according to federal law, members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors are appointed for 14-year terms and are can only be dismissed for “cause”.

Powell has previously said that the removal and demotion of top Federal Reserve officials are “not permitted under the law”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Trump praises Italian PM and accepts invitation that could present chance to meet other European leaders

Giorgia Meloni said Donald Trump had accepted her invitation for an official trip to Rome, as the pair met in Washington in an attempt by the Italian prime minister to bridge the gap between the EU and US amid trade tariff tensions.

Meloni said Trump's trip could happen “in the near future” and could present an opportunity for him to meet other European leaders.

“The goal for me is to make the west great again,” Meloni said.

Trump opened the summit in the Oval Office on Thursday by saying Meloni was “doing a fantastic job” and had “taken Europe by storm”, adding that she “has become a friend”.

Trump and Meloni had earlier both expressed optimism about resolving the EU-US trade conflict. The EU faces 25% import tariffs on steel and aluminium and cars, and broader tariffs on almost all other goods, under Trump's policy to hit countries he says impose high barriers to US imports.

“I am sure we can make a deal and I am here to help with that,” Meloni said before the summit.

Trump said that broadly speaking he expected he would make an announcement about trade deals but he was in no rush. “We're going to have very little problem making a deal with Europe or anybody else, because we have something that everybody wants,” Trump said.

Before leaving for Washington, Meloni discussed the summit with the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen.

Germany's outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and his successor, Friedrich Merz, also discussed the meeting with Meloni, according to reports in the German edition of Politico. Scholz failed to get a meeting with Trump and Merz's request is reportedly pending.

Meloni had previously described Trump's tariffs on EU goods as “wrong” but she appears to be taking a more cautious approach as she manages a delicate balancing act between her political ideals, which are more in tune with Trump's, and Italy's role within the EU.

The meeting provoked trepidation among some of Italy's European allies as well as Meloni's domestic opposition amid fears their closeness risks jeopardising the bloc's unified approach to the tariffs and other issues.

Enrico Borghi, a politician with the centrist Italia Viva party, told a TV talkshow: “The advice from the opposition is that the prime minister returns home with reopened negotiations between the US and EU that will guarantee a framework of relative tranquility to our economic and productive system, which has been weakened by what is a real trade war.”

Italy is the third-largest exporter to the US from the EU. Meloni's office denied she would seek special tariff exemptions on Italian products. Italy has strong economic ties with the US that go beyond exports, including foreign direct investments.

The summit was expected to address Trump's demand that Nato partners increase military spending to 2% of GDP. Italy is at 1.49%, among the lowest in Europe.

It was Meloni's third visit to the White House, with the two previous occasions taking place during Joe Biden's administration.

She will return to Rome in time to meet on Friday Trump's vice-president, JD Vance, whose blistering attack on Europe at the Munich Security Conference in February she has defended.

Vance will also meet Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state, during his Easter weekend visit.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The first page of Hudson's Bay Co.'s Royal Charter, 1670.Supplied

Hudson's Bay Co. has announced it intends to auction off historically significant artifacts it still owns, including its 1670 charter that played a pivotal role in the history of Canada.

In an announcement on Wednesday evening, Hudson's Bay said that it will seek court approval for an auction of its collection of art and artifacts. The auction will take place separately from the sale process currently seeking bids for all or part of the company's assets and operations. Those bids are due by the end of the month.

The Globe and Mail previously reported that the collection was included in a confidential information memorandum, which was sent to potential bidders in the sale process and provided an overview of HBC's corporate assets.

The memorandum, which was obtained by The Globe, advertised “a collection of artwork and items that date back to the company's role in the founding and development of Canada.”

That includes the 1670 royal charter, which granted HBC exclusive trading rights over nearly one-third of the territory that is now Canada. The document, which includes the wax seal of King Charles II, claimed dominion over that land without the consent of the Indigenous peoples who already resided there.

The memorandum obtained by the Globe states that the charter “will be provided special consideration given its important role in Canadian history and significance to the Canadian population.”

In Wednesday's press release, Hudson's Bay Co. wrote that it recognized “the extraordinary cultural and historical value of these items,” and that holding a separate auction would take that significance into account.

“This approach ensures that the care, consideration, and expertise required for these pieces can be fully prioritized through a separate process facilitated by a fine art auction house,” the release said. Hudson's Bay and its financial advisor in the sale process, Reflect Advisors LLC, will assist in facilitating the auction.

While many of the Bay's most prized historical objects and records were donated to the province of Manitoba and the Manitoba Museum in 1994, a number of artifacts – including the charter – are still owned by the company. Those include store paraphernalia, packaging, private-brand items, company awards and plaques. Memorabilia in the collection include a number of Bay point blankets – which have been in continuous production since 1780, and which are a fraught symbol of the fur trade and of colonization.

An art collection, primarily made up of Canadian works, will also be part of the auction. Those artworks include 17th- and 18th-century portraits, historical calendar paintings, Inuit prints and sculptures, and photographic and limited-edition prints. One example of a piece featured in the confidential memorandum is Woman Juggling by Sorosiluto Ashoona, an Inuit graphic artist from Kinngait (Cape Dorset), Nunavut.

Facing a financial crisis, Hudson's Bay was granted court protection from its creditors on March 7 under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act. It has begun liquidating all but six of its stores across the country – including 74 Hudson's Bay locations, as well as two Saks Fifth Avenue and 13 Saks Off Fifth stores that the company operates in Canada.

Hudson's Bay is seeking buyers or investors that could keep some of the business going. But lawyers for the company have told the court that if a plan is not found, the entire company will be forced to wind down operations.

The Hudson's Bay archives have been designated as part of the UNESCO Memory of the World registry, which seeks to preserve “documentary heritage” and ensure continuing public access to important records.

The keeper of the Hudson's Bay Company Archives at the Archives of Manitoba – which were part of the 1994 donation and are separate from the company – told The Globe in an interview earlier this month that she hopes the charter will become part of a public collection.

“It kicks off everything, all the records we have here – records that have been designated by UNESCO as internationally significant heritage resources,” said Kathleen Epp. “It seems like this is the only place for it.”

In the memorandum obtained by The Globe, Hudson's Bay compared the value and historical importance of the charter to the American Declaration of Independence and the Canadian Constitution.

“By naming and claiming almost a third of what is known today as Canada, the royal charter is foundational in understanding the country's past,” the memorandum stated.

Further details about the procedures of the auction will be provided to interested bidders “in due course,” according to Wednesday's release.

Ahead of talks with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, the US president told reporters ""of course there will be a trade deal"" with Europe, which he has threatened with tariffs. More on DW. 

Here are the latest global developments regarding the Trump administration on Thursday, April 17:

The US Supreme Court will keep legal hold on President Donald Trump's executive order ending birthright citizenship, but has agreed to hear the case on May 15, the court announced.

Trump issued an executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship for the children of people who are in the US illegally or on temporary visas.

The move has been halted by three district courts around the country, while appeals courts have allowed those rulings.

The Trump administration then appealed the case to the Supreme Court on March 13.

The right to citizenship by birth was enshrined in the US constitution soon after the Civil War and it stipulates that anyone born on US soil is an American citizen, regardless of their parents citizenship or residency status.

But Trump and his supporters are seeking to toughen up rules.

The president has called US citizenship ""a priceless and profound gift"" and his administration has argued that children of non-citizens are not entitled to US citizenship because they are not ""subject to US jurisdiction,"" a phrase used in the amendment.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has become the first European leader to meet with Donald Trump since the US president announced his major tariffs against friends and rivals alike.

Trump told Meloni that a deal between the EU and US would ""100 percent"" be reached ""at a certain point,"" but added ""we're in no rush.""

He added that he was happy about the revenues that he was expecting for the US government from the tariffs.

Meloni said she was ""sure"" the US and EU could find an agreement, calling the United States a ""reliable partner,"" despite the outcry caused by Trump's tariffs.

Meloni leads a far-right government in Italy and so has a lot of ideological overlap with the Trump administration, making her a preferred choice to mediate between Washington and Brussels.

The US president has called Meloni ""a wonderful woman"" who has shown ""strong leadership.""

The Italian leader has previously criticized Trump's 20% duties on EU exports, which were later suspended for 90 days, but told reporters Thursday she believed in ""unity"" despite trade tensions. 

Trump made the comments in response to a journalist's question about what would happen if there was no agreement at the end of the 90-day pause he had set.

US President Donald Trump attacked US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates. 

The Federal Reserve serves as the US central bank and is responsible conducting monetary policy and moderating long-term interest rates. 

In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said Powell's ""termination cannot come fast enough.""

Trump, without evidence, claimed that everyday goods such as groceries and eggs are going down in price. 

Powell ""should have lowered interest rates like the ECB, long ago, but he should certainly lower them now,"" Trump said. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced on Thursday it would again cut interest rates.       

The Fed's benchmark interest stands at 4-25%-4.50%, and has been stable since December. Powell cut rates several times last year.   

Trump comments come after Powell said at the Economic Club of Chicago that the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on goods from other countries will be paid ""by the public.""

Powell said that as Trump continues with his tariff policy, ""unemployment is likely to go up as the economy slows."" He said that prices would rise due to the tariffs as well. 

Powell became Fed Reserve Chair in February 2018. He is expected to stay in his position until at least next year.  

Although Trump has suggested that he would like to fire Powell, the Fed Chair has said for now that the president does not currently have the power to terminate him. Powell has also said a case before the Supreme Court regarding Trump's dismissal of two from federal labor boards doesn't apply to the Fed.  

The administration of US President Donald Trump has said it will stop Harvard University from enrolling international students if the college does not agree to government demands placing it under political supervision. 

Trump is furious with university — which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners — for rejecting his request to submit to oversight on admissions, hiring and political opinion.

""If Harvard cannot verify it is in full compliance with its reporting requirements, the university will lose the privilege of enrolling foreign students,"" read a statement from the Department of Homeland Security.

Trump himself called Harvard a ""joke"" on Wednesday and said it should lose its contracts for government research.

Earlier this week, the White House said it would freeze more than $2.2 billion (€1.94 billion) in grants and $60 million in contracts with Harvard.

US Vice President JD Vance is travelling to Italy this week, when he is due to meet Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.

Meloni's office said she will host the US vice president on Friday, just one day after she is due to meet President Trump in Washington DC.

The Catholic convert is also due to meet Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and participate in ceremonies around Easter Sunday.

Vance rattled Europe in February when he said that freedom of speech was in decline in the continent during his speech at the Munich Security Conference.

The highly controversial speech was however endorsed by Meloni, who later said she agreed with the US vice president's criticism of Europe as a continent where both freedom of speech and democracy in retreat.

A Democratic US senator visiting El Salvador was denied access to the man wrongly deported by the US and then held in a notorious prison.

Maryland's Senator Chris Van Hollen said on Wednesday that authorities in El Salvador would not let him visit or speak to Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who lived in Maryland before his deportation.

Van Hollen added that El Salvador's Vice President Felix Ulloa told him he could not authorize a visit or a call with Abrego Garcia, and that El Salvador was not releasing him as the US was paying to keep him locked up.

""Why should the government of the United States pay the government of El Salvador to lock up a man who was illegally abducted from the United States and committed no crime?"" Van Hollen said.

The 29-year-old Abrego Garcia fled gang-related violence in El-Salvador at age 16 and received in 2019 a protective order to continue living in the US, according to his lawyers. He has never been charged with or convicted of any crime.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Van Hollen was potentially using taxpayer dollars to ""demand the release of deported illegal alien MS-13 terrorist."" Abrego Garcia's lawyers have denied he is a member of the criminal gang.

While Washington acknowledged the Salvadoran man was deported due to an administrative error, the Trump administration has resisted an order from the US Supreme Court to facilitate his return, arguing he is now solely in Salvadoran custody.

El Salvador, meanwhile, argues it doesn't have the authority to send him back to the US. In a visit to Trump on Monday, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele ruled out plans to return the wrongfully deported man.

Abrego Garcia is one of some 300 individuals, mostly Venezuelans, whom the US under Trump has deported to El Salvador in the past few months.

Rights groups are concerned El Salvador and its notorious CECOT prison, where Abrego Garcia is being held, are becoming a ""black hole"" for the US to get rid of expelled migrants with no legal repercussions.

In a report last week, Human Rights Watch said the US and El Salvador have subjected dozens to ""enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention.""

California Governor Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration, accusing it of using unlawful action to enact sweeping tariffs, and arguing that it bore ""an inordinate share"" of the levies' costs.

California's 12 ports take in some 40% of the goods imported to the US. 

""President Trump's new tariff regime has already had devastating impacts on the economy, creating chaos in the stock and bond markets, wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars in market capitalization in hours, chilling investment in the face of such consequential Presidential action with no notice or process, and threatening to push the country into recession,"" the lawsuit said.

Retaliatory tariffs from China and other nations could harm California's agricultural exports, which totaled $23.6 billion in 2022, potentially costing thousands of jobs, according to the lawsuit.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is scheduled to meet with Donald Trump on Thursday during a visit to Washington, DC.

Ahead of her trip, Meloni told business leaders she supported a European Commission proposal for a ""zero-tariffs"" system between the US and the EU.

""We're governing at probably the most difficult time since the post-war period,"" Meloni said ahead of her trip. 

Meloni was the only European leader to have attended Donald Trump's inauguration as US president, and maintains friendly relations with the US president.

This gives her an edge over other EU leaders to convince the US of the merits of the zero-tariff system for all industrial goods between the US and the 27-member bloc.

""We'll address the issue of tariffs with determination and pragmatism, without alarmism,"" Meloni said in an interview on Italian state television station RAI.  

""Of course, we don't agree with the choice of the United States but we're ready to deploy all negotiations and economic measures that are needed to support our businesses and the sectors affected,"" she added.

Can Meloni sway the Trump administration away from a tariff war with the EU? DW explains.

The US Internal Revenue Service is making plans to rescind Harvard University's tax-exempt status, according to US media outlets CNN and the Washington Post.

A final decision on rescinding the university's tax exemption is expected soon, CNN added. 

Most American private colleges and universities are exempt from taxes because of their status as 501(c)(3) organizations and their educational mission.

Harvard made headlines earlier in the week after it rejected what it said were unlawful demands to overhaul academic programs.

President Donald Trump announced he would freeze $2.2 billion in federal money after the prestigious college refused to comply with the list of goverment demands.

""Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and should no longer receive Federal Funds,"" Trump posted to his Social Truth platform. 

The US Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Wednesday said the department was canceling two grants worth over $2.7 million meant for the college.

Trump demanded that Harvard submit to government supervision on admissions, hiring and political stances, which it rejected. 

China replaced its trade representative on Wednesday as talks with Washington over its escalating tariff war remain stalled.

China's Human Resources and Social Security Ministry announced that Li Chenggang will replace Wang Shouwen, who led Beijing's trade negotiations with Washington in 2020.

Chenggang's master's degree is in law and that might give him a leg up in tough negotiations with the US in the trade war that shows no signs of cooling down, explains DW's Kassandra Sundt (see video below).

Since taking office in January, Trump has particularly targeted China with tariffs, which were raised to 145% last week.

Unlike other countries which sought negotiations, China responded with escalation, with levies on US imports hiked to 125%.

Li previously served as China's ambassador to the World Trade Organization, with Beijing having filed a legal case there.

The step came after official data showed foreign direct investment plummeted 27.1% in local currency terms in 2024 on the year, for its largest such drop since the 2008 global financial crisis.

A US federal judge has found probable cause to hold the White House in contempt of court for violating orders blocking deportation flights.

Judge James Boasberg's order gives the Trump administration a final opportunity to come into compliance before it moves ahead with contempt proceedings.

In a 46-page ruling, Boasberg wrote that ""The Court does not reach such conclusion lightly or hastily.""

""Indeed, it has given Defendants ample opportunity to rectify or explain their actions. None of their responses has been satisfactory.""

DW explains the case.

The US State Department will close an office that played an important role in combating Russian and Chinese disinformation or false information that is meant to mislead people.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he was shutting down the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (R/FIMI) hub, accusing it of censoring conservative speech.

""Over the last decade, Americans have been slandered, fired, charged, and even jailed for simply voicing their opinions,"" Marco Rubio posted to X. ""That ends today.""

Rubio said the office cost US taxpayers over $50 million (roughly €43.8 million) annually and that it ""spent millions of dollars to actively silence and censor the voices of Americans they were supposed to be serving.""

""This is antithetical to the very principles we should be upholding and inconceivable it was taking place in America,"" he added, without providing details about how the office silenced the voices of Americans.

The office was previously known as the Global Engagement Center (GEC) had already shut down in December 2024 under former Democratic President Joe Biden after Congress did not extend its mandate that was set to expire.

It was reorganized to create a different public diplomacy office known as R/FIMI. 

The GEC had come under intense criticism from some Republicans who said it was straying from its mission, accusing it of disfavoring opinions by conservative media in particular. 

The Trump administration announced it was shutting down an office that aimed at countering foreign disinformation, accusing it of censorship.

This comes after the US president issued an executive order last month to shrink an independent federal agency that provided news outlets like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty with funding.

Meanwhile, a US federal judge said there was ""probable cause"" to hold Trump administration officials in criminal contempt of court for defying his order to halt deportations.

Brussels wants to accelerate asylum procedures with a list of safe countries of origin that includes countries like India, Bangladesh and Egypt.

The European Union on Wednesday published a list of seven countries that it considers ""safe,"" as member states seek to speed up migrant returns.

The list includes Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia.

The expanded list means EU member states will process applications from the countries deemed safe using an accelerated procedure because they have a low chance of success.

""Many member states are facing a significant backlog of asylum applications, so anything we can do now to support faster asylum decisions is essential,"" said Magnus Brunner, the EU's commissioner for migration.

Although the EU presented a similar list in 2015, the plan was abandoned due to heated debates over whether or not to include Turkey.

Brussels is under mounting pressure to crack down on irregular arrivals and ramp up deportations, as hard-right parties ride a wave of anti-migrant sentiment across Europe.

Hawks including Sweden, Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands in October demanded fast-tracked legislation to boost returns — and urged the Commission to act swiftly.

Harvey Weinstein was wheeled into a Manhattan courtroom on Thursday wearing a hospital wristband to indicate he is a “fall risk” as his MeToo rape retrial resumed.

Weinstein, 73, has chronic myeloid leukaemia, heart issues, diabetes, sleep apnoea and sciatica. A recent tongue infection was misdiagnosed and required hospitalisation and his lawyers claim he has gained nearly 20 pounds in the past month.

The former movie titan's lawyers are lobbying for their client to be moved to a New York City hospital during the criminal trial, which is expected to start in earnest next week.

Weinstein is being tried again after New York's highest court last year overturned his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence, citing improper rulings and prejudicial testimony.

Wearing a navy suit and blue tie, the Oscar-winning producer was seen sitting at the defence table with Jonathan Franzen's 2001 novel, The Corrections, and Eric Clapton's autobiography in front of him.

He is being retried on two charges – allegations he raped an aspiring actor in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013 and a criminal sex act by forcing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant in 2006.

He is also charged with another count of criminal sex act based on an allegation from a woman who was not a part of the original trial. That woman, who has asked not to be named publicly, alleges that Weinstein forced oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel.

Weinstein has denied all charges against him.

Imran Ansari, Weinstein's lawyer, has claimed the “deplorable” conditions at Rikers Island jail are exacerbating his client's health issues.

“He is consistently mistreated for serious infections, medication is given incorrectly, or not at all, he is experiencing unhealthy and atypical weight gain, and he is forced to endure freezing temperatures while not even being provided clean clothing,” Mr Ansari said.

“Because of this mistreatment, he has been worn down considerably health wise, and now faces the stress of trial in this condition, which may very well lead to serious health complications, even death,” Mr Ansari said Wednesday in a statement.

Situated in the East River between the Bronx and Queens boroughs, Rikers Island prison has long had a reputation for overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and violence.

The lawyer has called for Weinstein to be moved to Bellevue Hospital where he has already been taken in recent months for urgent health care.

Judge Curtis Farber has yet to rule on the transfer request.

Mr Farber has said a total of 12 jurors and six alternates will be picked for the trial, with opening statements expected to start next week.

On Wednesday nine jurors – five women and four men – were selected.

Several dozen prospective jurors indicated they could not give Weinstein a fair trial because of what they know about the case.

Since his downfall, Weinstein has been accused of harassment, sexual assault or rape by more than 80 women, including actors Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow, Lupita Nyong'o and Ashley Judd.

Weinstein has never acknowledged any wrongdoing and has always maintained that the encounters were consensual.","{'href': 'https://www.telegraph.co.uk', 'title': 'The Telegraph'}","world"

Heritage Foundation research fellow EJ Antoni on President Trump's slated announcement on semiconductor tariffs and DOGE's new website enabling the American people to recommend potential cuts.

The Trump administration placed roughly 75% of full-time AmeriCorps employees on administrative leave on Wednesday as the administration looks to rebuild the Clinton-era volunteer agency from scratch, Fox News Digital learned.

A total of 535 full-time AmeriCorps employees out of the agency's 700 staff were placed on leave, an administration official confirmed to Fox News Digital Thursday.

Volunteers with AmeriCorps' National Civilian Community Corps, a program that focuses specifically on volunteer opportunities for youth between the ages of 18–26, were preemptively pulled out of the field ahead of the Trump administration placing the agency's full-time staffers on leave Wednesday, Fox Digital learned. Roughly $250 million in AmeriCorps contracts have also been canceled. 

AmeriCorps is expected to remain in existence, according to the admin official, but the operations will essentially restart from scratch.

Former President Bill Clinton created the AmeriCorps National Service Program in 1993, during his first year in office, as a volunteer arm of the government to help aid communities nationwide. 

The agency has received roughly $1 billion in taxpayer funds every year, the House Higher Education and Workforce Development Subcommittee previously found, but had failed eight consecutive audits across the past decade. 

""Unfortunately, AmeriCorps has a long history of abusing taxpayer dollars,"" chair of the House subcommittee, Republican Utah Rep. Burgess Owens, said in a statement in December 2024. 

""AmeriCorps is entrusted with over $1 billion of taxpayer funds every year, with the result of failure of eight consecutive audits,"" he continued. ""In 2023, the AmeriCorps Inspector General issued a 'Management Challenges' report detailing significant challenges AmeriCorps faces. This includes being unable to detect fraud. We have no real idea when AmeriCorps will be able to have a clean audit again. In fact, this year's audit includes 78 recommendations still open, even after AmeriCorps said it addressed 20 last year.""

Fox News Digital examined AmeriCorp's budget in recent years and found its 2023 fiscal year budget stood at $1,312,806, which included $99,686,000 in expenses and salaries, while fiscal year 2024 saw a budget of $1,262,806, which included the same figure for expenses and salaries. The Biden administration proposed a budget of $1,342,093,000 for fiscal year 2025. 

The agency's annual management report for fiscal year 2024 showed that it had $3.7 billion in assets, including over $1.5 billion in investments.

Diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change initiatives have been a top priority for the volunteer-focused agency, with the 2024 annual management report identifying ""advancing racial and economic equity"" as one of its top priorities, Fox Digital found.

""AmeriCorps has a decades-long commitment to advancing racial and economic equity through national service and volunteering,"" the report stated. ""These efforts are designed to expand pathways to opportunity for all Americans. Racial and economic equity will be central to AmeriCorps' planning and implementation of all priorities, ensuring AmeriCorps members and volunteers reflect the diversity of the American people and the communities in which they serve."" 

Owens said in 2024 that while some of the agency's programs are ""well-intentioned,"" taxpayers should not continue funding the office and called for it to land on the Department of Government Efficiency's chopping block.

""It makes no sense to expand this agency or give it more money when it continuously fails to meet basic accountability standards,"" he said. ""Every time its representatives come before this Committee, AmeriCorps assures us that they will implement reforms, and year after year nothing changes. We can tell AmeriCorps to modernize and reform until we are blue in the face, but nothing will change unless we recognize the system is built on a flawed idea. It is time to admit that this is a failed program that needs a complete overhaul or elimination. It should be on DOGE's chopping block.""

President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence shake hands at former President Carter's funeral 

EXCLUSIVE: Former Vice President Mike Pence is urging House Republicans to stand firm against hiking takes on the country's top-earners, as sources tell Fox News Digital the White House is floating a millionaire tax hike proposal to offset the cost of eliminating taxes on overtime pay, tipped wages and retirees' Social Security.

Advancing American Freedom (AAF), the conservative policy advocacy group Pence launched in 2021, sent a letter to congressional Republicans, including House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, advising Congress to ""stand firm against tax hikes.""

""President Trump and Republicans in Congress promised to make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent and work to secure further tax cuts. Republicans should stick to their promises and not pull pages from Kamala Harris' losing policy platform,"" AAF President Tim Chapman and Board Chairman Marc Short wrote in the letter, referring to Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is set to expire this year.

WHITE HOUSE QUIETLY FLOATS MILLIONAIRE TAX HIKE PROPOSAL IN CONGRESS AS GOP LEADERS SIGNAL OPPOSITION

""The American people voted for tax cuts, not tax hikes. Advancing American Freedom calls on Republicans to swiftly renew the across-the-board tax cuts that unleashed prosperity during President Trump's first term and deliver on the promise to make America prosperous again,"" they wrote. 

Pence added in a statement to Fox News Digital, ""The Trump-Pence tax cuts lowered taxes across the board – for working families and businesses large and small. The results were historic. We got America's economy booming like never before and created more opportunity for all Americans. Republicans know that less taxes mean more jobs.""

HAWLEY URGES REPUBLICANS TO CUT TAXES FOR WORKING-CLASS VOTERS WHO 'PUT TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE'

Two sources familiar with the discussions told Fox News Digital that White House aides have been quietly floating a proposal to House Republicans that would raise the tax rate for people making more than $1 million to 40%. The plan is intended to mitigate the cost of Trump's ambitious 2024 campaign promise to cut taxes on overtime pay, tipped wages and retirees' Social Security.

The sources stressed the discussions were only preliminary, and the plan is one of many being discussed as congressional Republicans work on advancing Trump's ""big, beautiful bill."" 

Pence responded to Fox News Digital's reporting on Wednesday, urging House Republicans to resist tax increases on the wealthy.

""Republicans Don't Raise Taxes. Republicans Cut Taxes,"" Pence responded on X. ""Raising the Top Marginal Rate would be a Huge Tax Increase on Small Business America.""

Pence has often criticized Trump's policies during his second term, most recently critiquing Trump's tariff uncertainty, arguing even 10% tariffs would drive inflation higher and hurt American families. In a call for limited government, Pence also advocated for Congress to reclaim their authority over tariffs during remarks this week. 

Trump's former vice president refused to endorse him in 2024. Pence, who himself launched a short-lived 2024 presidential campaign, unexpectedly dropped out of the race for the White House during remarks at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual event in Las Vegas in October 2023. Trump spoke on the same stage soon after Pence's announcement without acknowledging the news.

However, Trump and Pence were seen shaking hands at former President Jimmy Carter's funeral in December – their first public appearance together in nearly four years. Pence congratulated Trump on winning the 2024 election, despite refusing to endorse him. 

Pence has distanced himself from his former boss since the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when Pence defied Trump's wishes by affirming that former President Joe Biden rightly won the 2020 election. Rioters called for Pence to be hanged, and the former vice president has faced the ire of Trump's most loyal supporters ever since.

The former vice president's campaign failed to gain traction as Trump's lead over the crowded Republican Party widened, and Republican voters proved they had not forgotten Pence's ""disloyalty"" to Trump during the attacks on the U.S. Capitol. 

Pence ran on a traditional conservative platform, framing the future of the Republican Party against what he called the rise of ""populism"" in the party. Among the slim anti-Trump base of the Republican Party, Pence received praise for his courage on that day. As Pence campaigned in Iowa and New Hampshire, voters at town halls often thanked Pence for standing up to Trump.

""Mike Pence stood for the Constitution. He deserves, not grudging credit. He deserves our thanks as Americans for putting his oath of office and the Constitution of the United States before personal, political and unfair pressure,"" former Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., the candidate who rejected Trump most during the Republican primary, said on the debate stage. 

The White House did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment by deadline.

Fox News correspondent Madeleine Rivera reports on the Democratic Party's resistance to the Trump administration on ‘Fox Report.'

FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., chartered a private jet worth up to a staggering $15,000 an hour for several West Coast stops on their ""Fighting Oligarchy"" tour. 

Sanders boarded the luxury Bombardier Challenger private jet at the Meadows Field Airport in Bakersfield, California, on Tuesday afternoon, according to a photo captured by a source on the ground and shared exclusively with Fox News Digital. Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, whom the source also spotted boarding the private jet, spoke at their ""Fighting Oligarchy"" event in Bakersfield just hours earlier. 

Flight records reveal the jet landed at Sacramento Mather Airport on Tuesday evening, which is about a 20-minute drive to Folsom, California, where the self-identified Democratic socialists hosted their second rally of the day. 

The jet Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were seen boarding made stops in Salt Lake City and Boise prior to landing in Bakersfield, according to flight records. The arrival dates match the duo's ""Fighting Oligarchy"" events in Salt Lake City and Nampa, which is about a 25-minute drive from Boise Airport.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. (Fox News Digital)

""Champagne socialists Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez demand Americans surrender their pick-up trucks, air conditioning and meat from the luxe leather seats of their private jets that cost more per hour than most Americans earn in months. Their hypocrisy is staggering,"" National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesperson Ben Petersen said in a statement to Fox News Digital. 

BERNIE SANDERS COMPARES TRUMP, MUSK AND OTHER 'OLIGARCHS' TO 'HEROIN ADDICTS,' SAYS DRUG OF CHOICE IS 'GREED'

The Bombardier Challenger private jet is operated by Ventura Air Services, which touts ""one of the widest cabins of any business jet available today"" and provides ""superior cabin comfort for its passengers."" According to their website, the private jet can cost up to $15,000 an hour. 

Sanders has long been ridiculed for relying on luxury private planes while crisscrossing the country, warning Americans about climate change and the threats of billionaires seizing political power. Despite his Democratic socialist platform advocating for universal healthcare, the Green New Deal and ending wealth inequality, Sanders flying private has become infamous. 

Sanders' campaign committee, Friends of Bernie Sanders, spent over $221,000 chartering private jets during the first quarter of 2025, according to Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings reviewed by Fox News Digital. The filing, which was released on Tuesday, shows that Sanders dropped the massive haul between three private jet companies: Ventura Jets, Cirrus Aviation Services and N-Jet.

The six-figure spending on private jets this year follows Sanders spending over $1.9 million on private jets during his failed presidential campaign in 2020. A Fox News Digital review found that Sanders dished out almost $2 million to Apollo Jets and the Advanced Aviation Team, a Virginia-based private jet company.

Private jets have faced the ire of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's fellow climate activists. According to 2021 Transport and Environment report, private jets are up to 14 times more polluting than commercial planes.

""For real, how many private jets do these CEOs need? It is insatiable. It is unacceptable,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in 2023, in one example of the New York congresswoman herself railing against private jets.

Both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez championed the Democrats' failed Green New Deal, the aggressive climate change policy targeting carbon emissions and fossil fuel production. Ocasio-Cortez proposed the controversial legislation in 2019, and Sanders designed his own Green New Deal plan during his 2020 presidential primary campaign. 

Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have welcomed massive crowds to their ""Fighting Oligarchy"" stops across the country. On Saturday, the two political leaders hosted what they said was their largest rally ever, with 36,000 people in Los Angeles.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","Due process is not a one-way open borders ratchet","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/3382036/due-process-open-borders-activist-judges-trump/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 04:00:00 GMT","

Former President Joe Biden admitted over 1.4 million illegal immigrants into the United States through both his CBP One app and Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, or CHNV, parole programs. An estimated 4 million more illegal immigrants were arrested while illegally crossing the southern border and then released on parole into the U.S. None of these migrants received a thorough background check, nor were they screened for valid asylum claims. Yet now, Democratic activist judges demand that each of them be given full due process protections before their parole may be revoked.

Neither the Constitution nor federal law supports these expansive due process claims. Biased Democratic judges are trying to disable the federal government so it cannot enforce immigration law by flooding an overwhelmed system with specious asylum claims. The Trump administration has every right, in fact a duty, to fight these rulings all the way to the Supreme Court, where it should win — and we are confident that it will.

On Oct. 19, 2022, after a record 231,000 arrests of illegal immigrants crossing the border, the Biden administration announced a new program under which Venezuelans who obtained a U.S. sponsor were allowed to fly into the U.S. and be granted parole despite the fact that they were still inadmissible aliens. The initial cap for the program was set at 24,000 inadmissible Venezuelans admitted every month.

In January 2023, the program was expanded to include citizens from Cuba, Haiti, and Nicaragua, and the cap was raised to 30,000 a month. Parolees in this program were immediately given work permits, food stamps, Medicaid, and welfare. The parole term was allegedly set by Biden at two years, but he claimed that future presidents had the authority to extend it indefinitely.

The Biden administration also claimed these parolees received “a national security and public safety vetting,” but these checks were only cursory. The migrants' names were put through Department of Homeland Security databases for past trouble with the law but without any check being made on data from their home countries. No interviews were conducted. No claim of persecution was required. All a migrant needed to do to enter the U.S. was find a willing sponsor here in America, many of whom later turned out to be fraudulent. DHS, of course, did little to vet the domestic hosts, for the Democratic administration wanted as many migrants as it could get.

On his first day in office, President Donald Trump ended admitting more migrants through the CHNV program, and then on March 25, DHS began the administrative process of revoking the parole status of those who were already here. A group of Nicaraguan and Venezuelan migrants sued in federal court to keep their parole, and their case was assigned to a judge who, before she was appointed to the bench, volunteered for Democratic Party political campaigns, including those of Barack Obama for president and Elizabeth Warren for Senate.

This leftist judge then held that Trump could not issue a blanket revocation of parole and instead must review each and every migrant on a case-by-case basis. This is absurd on its face and will eventually be overturned by higher courts.

The Democrats' strategy on immigration has been, and still is, to flood migrants into the country with little to no vetting and then turn around and demand maximum due process for every migrant a Republican administration tries to deport. It's heads Democrats win and tails Republicans (and U.S. citizens) lose.

While illegal immigrants are due some process, they have no right to demand the same process that citizens get when tried for a crime in the U.S. As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority in Department of Homeland Security v. Thuraissigiam, “While aliens who have established connections in this country have due process rights in deportation proceedings, the Court long ago held that Congress is entitled to set the conditions for an alien's lawful entry into this country and that, as a result, an alien at the threshold of initial entry cannot claim any greater rights under the Due Process Clause.”

NO MORE UNION TIME ON TAXPAYER DIME

Scalia went on, “It was Congress's judgment that detaining all asylum seekers until the full-blown removal process is completed would place an unacceptable burden on our immigration system and that releasing them would present an undue risk that they would fail to appear for removal proceedings.”

The due process clause of the Constitution is not a “get out of deportation free” card for illegal immigrants. Trump does not have the power to detain people at random and deport them to randomly chosen countries, and there is no evidence that is what he is doing. Biden's CHNV program was illegal from the start. Trump had the right, and was right, to end it and begin deporting every migrant who entered the country under its bogus aegis.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Supreme Court will hear arguments next month on a Trump administration plan to limit birthright citizenship, a major test of the 14th Amendment's reach.

The high court agreed Thursday to review lower court rulings that blocked the administration from enforcing an executive order denying automatic citizenship to children born in the United States to illegal immigrants.

At least four orders from federal courts across the country have indicated Trump's plans would violate the Constitution's citizenship clause, which guarantees birthright citizenship to “all persons born or naturalized in the United States.”

The administration argued that the clause was never intended to apply to children of parents who are unlawfully in the country. If upheld, the policy would reverse decades of immigration precedent.

Oral arguments are scheduled for May 15.

The United States deployed B-1B bombers to East Asia earlier this week for multiple geopolitical assignments, first in South Korea and then in Japan. 

First, the long-range bombers participated in joint military drills with jets from South Korea on Tuesday, an operation that drew the ire of North Korean government officials. The military aerial collaboration reportedly occurred on the 113th birthday of the country's first leader, Kim Il Sung, an important anniversary in the country's culture.

The Air Force issued a release regarding the joint drills and emphasized the importance of the continued cooperation between the U.S. and South Korea.

“Two U.S. Air Force B-1 Lancers and two F-16 Fighting Falcons joined two Republic of Korea Air Force F-35A Lightning IIs and KF-16s for combined training in airspace over western ROK April 15,” the release read. “The fighters and bombers engaged in offensive and defensive counter-air training together, refining combined tactics, techniques, and procedures. The bombers then performed a low pass over the flightline of Osan AB before departing Korean airspace.”

“Regular training with strategic assets like long-range bombers and fifth-generation fighters enables Seventh Air Force to maintain its strong, combined readiness posture with the Republic of Korea Air Force and demonstrates its continued ironclad commitment to the ROK-U.S. Alliance,” the release noted.

Additionally, CBS News reported that South Korea's Defense Ministry announced the drills were meant to enhance “operational capabilities” between the two countries and promote deterrence against any possible North Korean aggression. The communist country on the Korean peninsula has fired multiple ballistic missiles in recent months. North Korean government officials said the launches were a sign of their own deterrence against the U.S.

North Korean state media blasted the joint military operation, considering it an act of aggression. Reuters reported that a spokesman for North Korea's defense ministry called the drills “reckless bluffing.”

NO MORE UNION TIME ON TAXPAYER DIME

“The recent military move of the U.S. and the ROK is an open threat to the security of our state,” the spokesperson said.

Later, the same B-1B bombers flew to Misawa Air Base in Japan to participate in the “U.S. Air Force's first-ever Bomber Task Force rotation based in Japan.” The presence of the bomber planes marked an increase in U.S. aerial military might in the Indo-Pacific, reported Air & Space Forces Magazine. It's also the first time since the Vietnam War era that there were U.S. bombers in Japan. During that time, B-52 bombers were at Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Sellers are putting more homes on the market. But it's proving difficult to find buyers.","https://www.businessinsider.com/housing-market-buying-a-home-inventory-sellers-market-zillow-listing-2025-4","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 16:05:00 GMT","

The housing market saw a pronounced buyer-seller mismatch last month, and it's proving difficult to draw prospective home buyers off of the sidelines, according to Zillow.

That could spell good news on the housing-affordability front. Buyers holding back from buying a home due to cost concerns could eventually prompt price cuts, and just in time for one of the hottest home-buying seasons of the year.

Sellers put more than 375,000 homes on the market last month, a 32% increase from last month and a 9% increase compared to levels recorded the same month last year, according to a report Zillow released on Monday.

But buyers haven't been keeping pace with the growth in new listings. Pending home sales for the month remained flat compared to last year's levels, with just 265,000 listings transitioning into a pending sale in March.

That means the housing market added a net 110,000 listings last month, pushing overall inventory up 19% year-over-year to 1.15 million, Zillow estimated.

That's the most inventory the market has seen since March 2020, when the pandemic pushed the housing market into a near-standstill, according to Skylar Olsen, the chief economist at Zillow.

""Home price growth paused and inventory swelled during what is typically one of the most competitive home shopping months of the year. That's despite mortgage rates reaching a 2025 low in March,"" Olsen wrote in the note. ""While sellers leaned on the gas, buyers didn't keep up,"" she added.

Olsen said buyers may have been held back by affordability concerns, with high home prices keeping mortgage payments elevated.

The typical mortgage payment, assuming a 20% down payment on a home, cost around 25% of the median US household income in March, Zillow estimated, outside the recommended guideline to keep housing costs under 30% of one's total income.

Sellers have already started to give in to pressure to slash home prices. with 23% of listings on Zillow seeing a price reduction over March. That's the largest share of homes with a price cut since 2018, and up slightly from last month's share, when 21% of homes on Zillow had a price cut, the firm said.

That said, the housing market has been tipped towards sellers' favor for most of the last five years. Zillow's Market Heat Index, which shows whether the housing market is more favorable to buyers or sellers, moved from ""neutral"" territory to ""sellers market"" territory in March, the first time it's done so since June of last year.

Companies are expected to raise prices in response to President Donald Trump's slew of tariffs.

While firms raise prices for many reasons, some were blaming hikes on tariffs long before Trump's so-called ""Liberation Day."" On April 2, he announced a 10% baseline tariff on imports from most countries, except Canada and Mexico. China faces even higher rates of up to 245% on some goods, the White House said on April 16. Autos are another area of focus after Trump announced a 25% tariff on all car imports into the US.

""April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,"" Trump said during his remarks.

Some economists have said that Trump's tariffs — and the uncertainty with his overall trade policy — could lead companies to raise prices on the goods they produce.

""The tariffs are larger than forecasters expected, certainly larger than we expected in our upside case,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said April 16 during a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago. ""Our role is to make sure this will be a one-time increase in prices and not something that turns into an ongoing inflation process.""

Powell said the Federal Reserve is monitoring how much prices rise, which is still unclear.

Beginning at the end of 2024, some companies warned that they would consider raising prices on consumers if Trump implemented his broad tariff proposals. While it's still possible they could absorb some of the costs of the tariffs, here are the companies that have warned of price increases.

The two Chinese retailers released almost identical notices on April 16, both reading: ""Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up.""

""To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025,"" Shein's statement said.

Shein, a fast-fashion retailer, and Temu, a marketplace for everything from home goods to electronics, promised their US customers eight final days of low-price shopping.

In addition to hiking tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump also cracked down on the de minimis trade loophole that allowed small parcels under $800 to enter the US tax-free. Shein and Temu were large beneficiaries of this loophole.

Bloomberg reported that the automaker plans to raise prices on new gas and electric cars starting next month unless Trump gives the industry some relief from tariffs.

Ford, in a memo to dealers viewed by Bloomberg, said that the company anticipates ""the need to make vehicle pricing adjustments in the future, which is expected to happen with May production."" Prices won't change for vehicles in inventory now.

On April 14, Trump told reporters that he was contemplating a temporary tariff exemption for autos to give manufacturers more time to move production to the US.

Conagra Brands CEO Sean Connolly told Reuters on April 3 that the food company may have to hike prices to offset the cost of tariffs on ingredients like cocoa, olive oil, palm oil, and a type of steel used for its canned products.

Connolly said that Conagra, which makes products such as Hunt's ketchup and Chef Boyardee, imports tin plate steel for its canned food and tomatoes from Mexico.

It was too early to tell how big price hikes on the company's food products would be, he added. During an April 3 earnings call, he stressed that the trade situation remains ""volatile"" and changes hourly.

According to a memo first reported by Automotive News, Volkswagen said it would place an import fee on vehicles made outside of the US in response to Trump's 25% tariff on car imports.

The company said it would provide more details on its pricing changes in response to the tariffs by mid-April.

Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said during the company's March earnings call that Trump's tariff plans are likely to increase prices.

""Trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronic supply chain is highly global, technical and complex,"" Barry said. ""We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely.""

Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in a March interview that Trump's 25% tariff plan on goods from Mexico and Canada would likely result in price increases on produce.

""Those are categories where we'll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days,"" Cornell said.

Donald Allan, the CEO of the manufacturing company Stanley Black & Decker, said during a February earnings call: ""Our approach to any tariff scenario will be to offset the impacts with a mix of supply chain and pricing actions, which might lag the formalization of tariffs by two to three months.""

Allan had previously told analysts in an October earnings call that the company had been evaluating ""a variety of different scenarios"" to plan for new tariffs under Trump.

""And obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we put into the market,"" Allan said, adding that ""there's usually some type of delay given the processes that our customers have around implementing price.""

Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC on November 19 that the company will likely raise prices if Trump's tariff proposals are implemented.

""We never want to raise prices,"" he said. ""Our model is everyday low prices. But there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.""

The company's CEO, Doug McMillan, said during a February earnings call that ""tariffs are something we've managed for many years, and we'll just continue to manage that.""

Tim Boyle, the CEO of Columbia Sportswear, told analysts on an October earnings call that the company was ""very concerned about the imposition of tariffs. "" He said that while he considered Columbia adept at managing tariffs, ""trade wars are not good and not easy to win.""

Boyle also told The Washington Post in October that the company was ""set to raise prices.""

""It's going to be very, very difficult to keep products affordable for Americans,"" he said. He later said in a February interview with CNBC that ""we need some surety about what is going to happen"" before making price changes.

Philip Daniele, the CEO of the auto-parts company AutoZone, told analysts on a September earnings call that tariff policies had ""ebbed and flowed over the years,"" and if Trump implemented more tariffs, ""we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer.""

""We generally raise prices ahead of that,"" Daniele said, adding that prices would gradually settle over time. ""So, that's historically what we've done,"" he said.

Trump's 25% tariff on car imports is expected to increase manufacturing costs by anywhere from $4,000 to $12,000.

Wildly expensive and with unproven demand, venture capitalists, automakers and aerospace firms are racing for a piece of what soon may be a $1 trillion market.

The first generation of electrified personal aircraft, formally called Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing Aircraft or eVTOLs, have already taken flight. Now the race is on to cash in on a market that could exceed a trillion dollars.

The idea of a flying car wasn't far behind the invention of the automobile. But for more than a century, the dream has remained largely science fiction, relegated to the imagination of visionary film directors. Now technology may finally be catching up, and both Wall Street and industry are taking notice.

The first generation of electrified personal air transport, formally called Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing Aircraft or eVTOLs for short, have already taken flight.

Shares of Chinese tea chain Chagee climbed 20% during its public market debut on Thursday, as the company plans a U.S. launch despite trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.

The stock, which is trading on the Nasdaq using the ticker ""CHA,"" opened at $33.75 per share. Chagee shares soared as high as 49% initially but lost much of those gains during afternoon trading.

The company priced its initial public offering at $28 per share on Wednesday, on the high end of its expected range of $26 to $28. Chagee sold 14.7 million shares, raising $411 million and valuing the company at roughly $5 billion.

Since its founding in 2017, the company has grown to more than 6,400 teahouses across China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Last year, Chagee generated net income of $344.5 million from revenue of $1.7 billion, according to regulatory filings.

The company is preparing to open its first U.S. location later this spring at the Westfield Century City mall in Los Angeles.

Founder and CEO Junjie Zhang created the chain after being inspired by the success of international coffee companies. China is Starbucks' second-largest market.

Chagee's initial public offering follows several weeks of market turmoil after President Donald Trump imposed new tariffs and ignited a trade war with China. Other IPO hopefuls, including Klarna and StubHub, delayed their plans to go public after markets plunged.

In recent years, it has also become less popular for Chinese companies to list on U.S. exchanges. From January 2023 to January 2024, the number of Chinese companies listed on the three largest U.S. exchanges fell 5%, according to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.

In this article

Spirit Airlines on Thursday appointed Dave Davis as its new chief executive officer, weeks after the U.S. discount carrier emerged from bankruptcy and reconstituted its board.

Davis, joining from rival Sun Country Airlines where he was the finance chief since 2018, will be tasked with a business overhaul as Spirit works to move away from its no-frills image and rebrand itself as a premium airline, after years of mounting losses.

The appointment, effective April 21, comes just more than a week after Ted Christie stepped down from the helm of Spirit with immediate effect as part of a shakeup.

Davis had previously worked as the CFO of Northwest Airlines before its merger with Delta Air Lines.

""Dave's background at both Northwest Airlines and, more recently, at Sun Country Airlines, positions him well to lead Spirit's continued transformation,"" Spirit Chairman Robert Milton said.

Sun Country, in a separate regulatory filing on Thursday, announced Davis' departure was effective immediately.

Spirit had set up an interim office of the CEO, consisting of Chief Financial Officer Fred Cromer, Chief Operating Officer John Bendoraitis and General Counsel Thomas Canfield, to lead the airline until it appoints a new chief.

The Florida-based carrier had filed for bankruptcy protection last November, following years of losses and heavy debt, and failed merger attempts.

Spirit had been in merger talks with Frontier Group since at least 2022, but ended them in favor of a more attractive offer from rival JetBlue Airways.

Its merger with JetBlue was ultimately scrapped after a U.S. judge blocked it on anti-competition concerns.

Frontier had also approached the airline with a merger proposal during Spirit's bankruptcy proceedings, but Spirit rejected the offer, saying it was less favorable for shareholders and opted instead to pursue its own restructuring plan.

Project Eleven, a quantum computing research and advocacy firm, has launched the Q-Day Prize, a global competition offering 1 bitcoin (BTC) to the first team able to break an elliptic curve cryptographic (ECC) key, the cryptography which secures the Bitcoin network, using Shor's algorithm on a quantum computer.

Shor's algorithm is a quantum computing method that efficiently factors large numbers into their prime components, theoretically allowing quantum computers to break cryptographic algorithms like RSA and elliptic-curve cryptography used in Bitcoin and other blockchain networks.

We just launched the Q-Day Prize. 1 BTC to the first team to break a toy version of Bitcoin's cryptography using a quantum computer.Deadline: April 5, 2026Mission: Protect 6M BTC (over $500B)

The contest comes as quantum computing advancements mean that a workable quantum computer might only be years away. Project Elevent has also identified more than 10 million bitcoin addresses with non-zero balances potentially at risk of quantum attacks.

The Bitcoin community is aware of the quantum computing threat and is working on solutions.

As CoinDesk previously reported, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP), titled Quantum-Resistant Address Migration Protocol (QRAMP), was introduced in early April, which suggests enforcing a network-wide migration to post-quantum cryptography to safeguard Bitcoin wallets. This would require a hard fork, however, and getting that sort of consensus would be an uphill battle.

Quantum startup BTQ has also proposed its own solution: a quantum-based alternative to Bitcoin's Proof of Work called Coarse-Grained Boson Sampling (CGBS).

CGBS works by using quantum computing to generate unique patterns of photons (light particles called bosons), replacing traditional mining puzzles with quantum-based sampling tasks for validation. 

But BTQ's CGBS also requires a hard fork, and the appetite for such a change isn't yet known.

Highlights

The crypto market has been under bearish pressure because of President Trump's tariff policy. The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has also sparked concerns after his recent remarks revealed that US inflation may also rise because of these tariffs. This article explores the top altcoins that crypto traders should sell as the economic climate flips bearish. 

According to Powell, the ongoing tariff war will have a negative impact on inflation. Following these remarks, Reuters reported that experts are also expressing concerns about US economic growth. One expert noted, 

“Powell is confirming what investors have been worried about, and that is the likelihood of slowing economic growth and more stubborn inflation as a result of the tariffs.” 

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump attributes the wrangles in the financial markets to Powell's hawkish stance on inflation. In his recent post on Truth Social, Trump noted that other central banks were lowering their rates to stimulate economic growth. 

Despite the mounting concerns, data from CME FedWatchTool shows that 87% of investors believe that interest rates will remain the same next month after the FOMC meeting. If this happens, the crypto market faces volatility, hence the need for traders to seek the best altcoins to sell to minimize risks. 

The harsh macroeconomic situation is spooking crypto investors, and some are looking for the best altcoins to sell. The top altcoins to sell amid growing concerns are Mantra (OM), Pi Network (PI), and Trump (TRUMP) 

One of the top altcoins to sell to avoid losses is Mantra. This token recently recorded one of the worst crashes in crypto history, and it is now down by 92% from its all-time high recorded only two months ago. 

Despite this dip, the RSI remains historically low at 27, which highlights a bearish momentum. At the same time, the ADX line is rising, which is a sign that the downtrend is gaining strength. This technical outlook supports a bearish Mantra price prediction. 

Pi Network (PI) is also another altcoin to sell due to upcoming token unlocks. On-chain data shows that over 10M PI Coin tokens will be added to the circulating supply in the next month. 

According to an X post by analyst Dr Altcoin, these unlocks are the main reason that the Pi Coin price is falling. These events have led to the Pi Coin market being flooded by more sellers than buyers, which is having a bearish effect on the price. 

TRUMP is also one of the top altcoins to sell as traders remain concerned about inflation and tariffs. Data from Coinglass shows that TRUMP's funding rates have been predominantly negative in the last month. This indicates that many traders are taking long positions, further showing bearish momentum. 

The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned that US inflation may rise again due to tariffs. His remarks have drawn criticism but have also caused concerns in the crypto industry about a possible downtrend. If the market starts to drop, the top altcoins to sell are Mantra (OM), Pi Network (PI), and the TRUMP meme coin.

 The executive added that most of the millions of cryptocurrencies in circulation today lack any real monetary value. 

Barry Silbert, the CEO of Digital Currency Group, said he would have secured higher investment gains by just holding the Bitcoin that he invested in early-stage crypto projects around 2012.

During an April 17 appearance on Raoul Pal's Journey Man podcast, Silbert said he discovered Bitcoin (BTC) in 2011, purchasing BTC at $7-$8 per coin. Once the price of BTC surged, Silbert started looking for early-stage crypto companies to invest in. The executive told Raoul Pal:

Silbert's comments come at a time when Bitcoin maximalists, including Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor, forecast a seven-figure Bitcoin price in the coming decade, and BTC receives greater attention from governments worldwide.

Zach Shapiro, the head of the Bitcoin Policy Institute (BPI) think tank, recently predicted BTC would hit $1 million per coin if the United States government were to purchase 1 million BTC.

“If the United States announces that we are buying a million Bitcoin, that's just a global seismic shock,"" Shapiro told Bitcoin Magazine in an April 16 podcast appearance.

Bo Hines, the executive director of President Trump's White House Crypto Council, signaled that the council is exploring several budget-neutral strategies for acquiring more Bitcoin for the US Strategic Reserve.

These strategies included revaluing the US Treasury's gold reserves, which are currently priced at $43 per ounce while the market rate is at an all-time high of $3,300 per ounce, and funding Bitcoin acquisition through trade tariffs.

BTC has been floated as a way to eliminate or alleviate the growing national debt by President Trump and several market analysts.

According to asset management firm VanEck, Bitcoin could help claw back the $36 trillion national debt by $14 trillion if the US Treasury introduces long-term bonds with BTC exposure.

 Since at least 2023, Bit Digital has been expanding into artificial intelligence and high-performance computing to diversify its revenue beyond crypto mining. 

Bitcoin mining company Bit Digital has acquired an industrial building in Madison, North Carolina, upping the ante in a business diversification strategy that includes strategic pivots into AI and high-performance computing. 

Bit Digital agreed to buy the property for $53.2 million through Enovum Data Centers Corp., the company's wholly owned Canadian subsidiary, regulatory filings show. The investment includes a $2.25 million initial deposit, with $1.2 million being non-refundable. The transaction is expected to close on May 15.

Bit Digital's regulatory filing was submitted around the same time that it announced a new Tier 3 data center site in Quebec, Canada, which will support the company's 5 megawatt colocation agreement with AI infrastructure provider Cerebras Systems. 

The Quebec facility is being retrofitted with roughly $40 million in upgrades to meet Tier 3 standards — strict requirements that ensure high reliability for critical systems and continuous operation.

Bit Digital CEO Sam Tabar said at the time that the Quebec operation “represents continued momentum in our strategy to deliver purpose-built AI infrastructure at scale.”

Faced with volatile crypto prices and a quadrennial Bitcoin halving cycle that squeezes revenues, several mining firms have leveraged their existing infrastructure to pivot to other data-intensive workloads. Mining companies like Hive Digital say AI data centers offer potentially higher revenue streams than crypto mining. 

In the latest sign of economic pain, public Bitcoin miners sold more than 40% of their Bitcoin (BTC) holdings in March, according to data from TheMinerMag publication. 

Public miners that can't keep their costs under control struggle the most in maintaining their Bitcoin operations, placing more pressure on executives to seek out alternative revenue streams.

An October report by CoinShares suggested that the least profitable miners are more likely to shift gears to AI and other workloads.

Science Organizations Should Protest Loudly against Trump Cuts

Similar to other professions, science has organizations that represent scientists and the research they do. Too many are staying silent as Trump dismantles research

By Angel Algarin 

U.S. President Donald Trump holds up an executive order on January 20, 2025 in Washington, DC

When the tide goes out, everyone can see who's swimming naked. In the Trump era's tsunami against science, we're learning that among those pretenders—long mouthing support for vulnerable people but then standing silent when it matters—are too many scientific societies, the professional or special interest groups that are supposed to advocate for their researcher members. Scientific organizations must act—not just to defend research, but to defend the lives and communities that depend on their work.

Since January the Trump administration has slashed federal funding for research projects centered on equity, health disparities and marginalized communities. Some scientific organizations, like the American Public Health Association, have taken a stand and joined an ACLU lawsuit filed on April 2 to protect these essential projects, and just two days later 16 state attorneys general followed suit.

Yet no other scientific societies I am aware of have taken steps to join such funding-related legal challenges, despite the vocal resistance of individual scientists.*

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

I experienced this passivity firsthand in late March, while attending the Society of Behavioral Medicine conference in San Francisco, where 1,900 researchers came to discuss medical advances in today's changing health care environment. As a public health researcher and professor whose work focuses on HIV, stigma and health equity, I've spent my career trying to ensure groups that have been historically overlooked or excluded are not erased from research agendas. So witnessing my own professional society choose silence in this moment hit differently.

At the meeting, grassroots scientists circulated a petition asking SBM's leadership to join the ACLU's lawsuit. Sparked by the tireless work of social psychologist Laramie R. Smith, whose research has illuminated how stigma drives HIV's unequal distribution both in the U.S. and globally, we asked our discipline to join in halting politically motivated grant cancellations, under the hashtag #TerminatedScience.

In less than 24 hours on March 27, the petition had over 300 signatures. It now has more than 400.

Beyond the numbers, the comments from signatories were powerful—and damning. Researchers voiced deep concern about the erosion of academic freedom and scientific integrity. Many described the Trump administration's cancellations as a direct attack on science and research rooted in facts, warning that political interference is not just stalling progress but actively endangering public health.

They also highlighted the human effects. Many terminated projects centered on advancing health equity—addressing disparities faced by LGBTQ+ individuals, BIPOC communities, women, immigrants and rural populations. These aimed at improving lives, preventing illness and responding to unmet needs. Defunding this work is not just a blow to science—it's a betrayal of the communities that science is supposed to serve.

“These projects weren't just data points on a spreadsheet. These were projects designed to reach people who have long been excluded from health care and research,” said Smith. “Canceling these projects isn't just bad policy; it's harmful to the health of real people in our community.”

Early-career scientists in particular spoke to the devastating toll: careers interrupted, research halted midstream, trainees left without mentorship or direction. There was a palpable sense of destabilization—of demoralization. One signatory warned that the scientific pipeline for young scientists is being dismantled before our eyes.

Nevertheless, the SBM board voted against joining the lawsuit. Their follow-up communication, sent to the membership listserv, stated that they had “given serious and lengthy consideration” and ultimately decided that, with the board's fiduciary duties in mind, “it is not in the best interest of the Society to become a co-plaintiff.” No further explanation was provided—no criteria for future action, no timeline, and no invitation for open dialogue. For a society grounded in behavioral and social science, this lack of transparency and community engagement was stunning.

While this experience served as a master class in grassroots scientific advocacy, it also left me with a more unsettling realization—one I hadn't fully questioned until now: Are the scientific organizations we belong to actually willing to defend science when it is under attack? While APHA has stepped up, will other organizations like the American Psychological Association, National Academy of Sciences, and American Association for the Advancement of Science, also do so? The APA has 173,000 members. AAAS has more than 120,000 members. No one could have a more powerful voice than these organizations that represent so many scientists and researchers.

Scientists should be asking this question of their professional societies—and demanding real answers. These organizations represent us, our values, and our work. If they are unwilling to take a stand now—when science is being politicized, targeted and punished—what message does that send about their commitment to our collective mission?

And it's not just scientists who deserve answers. So do the taxpayers who have supported this work for decades, in the belief that science truly serves the public—especially the most vulnerable. When institutions choose silence over advocacy, it raises serious questions about whose interests they are really protecting.

It's not just HIV research that's under threat. Projects focused on LGBTQ+ health, reproductive justice, youth mental health and racial equity have all come under fire—signaling that no area of socially conscious science is safe from political interference. This isn't a moment for professional societies to be cautious. It's a moment for them to be bold.

Even if your area of research isn't currently in the crosshairs, it may be next. The pattern is clear, and the list of terminations is growing. This isn't limited to research focused on racial justice or LGBTQ+ equity; recently terminated grants have included work on biobanking infrastructure, Alzheimer's risk and memory mechanisms, and global food safety regulation. Will you wait until they're knocking on your door to cancel your funding before you speak up?

I urge you to ask this simple but critical question: What is my professional society actively doing to protect science right now?

And if the answer is “nothing,” perhaps it's time to rethink your membership.

Because silence isn't neutrality. It's complicity. And science deserves better.

How burned artifacts offer a window into the dismantling of a dynasty.

Archaeologists discovered clues to a fire in Guatemala from between 733 and 881 AD that they say represents a key turning point in Maya rule—a very public turning point. 

The discovery at the Maya site of Ucanal in Guatemala “marked a public dismantling of an old regime”—a rather pivotal moment in the collapse of rulers and key point in political power that isn't often shown so clearly from an archeological find, the authors write in a study published in the journal Antiquity.

The event in question occurred at the capital of the K'anwitznal kingdom near a burial site. The bodies and their ornaments—items include a jewel-adorned stone mask, fragments of a greenstone diadem, and jade ornaments—were moved from a tomb to a public burning site, where fire engulfed some of the centuries-old items for all to see. 

“This event marked a moment of change in the kingdom and in the lowlands,” the authors write. “Rather than examine this fire-burning event as a bookend to Maya history, we view it as a pivot point around which the K'anwitznal polity reinvented itself and the city of Ucanal went on to a flourishing of activities.” 

The new leadership regime welcomed a non-royal leader called Papmalil, and there is little in the written record indicating how he came to power. “Papmalil's rule was not only seminal because of his possible foreign origins—perhaps breaking the succession of ruling dynasts at the site—but also because his rule shifted political dynamics in the southern Maya lowlands.” 

The study's authors, led by Christina Halperin at the University of Montreal, state that Papmalil appears to have ushered in an era of prosperity. Substantial construction occurred in both the civic-ceremonial core and outer residential zones of the city following the power shift. 

That new era may have had a dramatic beginning.

The team discovered the fire event during 2022 excavations in the construction fill of a temple-pyramid situated in a public plaza, and the evidence shows that there was no effort to protect the burial deposit. The team believes that at least four adults were part of the burn remains, and that the fire reached a temperature of over 800°C. Included with the bodies were 1,470 fragments of greenstone pendants, beads, plaques, and mosaics, along with large blades—all representing a “single burning event.” The quantity and quality of the burnt and broken ornaments indicate they came from a royal tomb, likely belonging to multiple individuals. 

The team said evidence indicates that the human bone and ornaments had once been part of the contents of a Late Classic royal tomb, and the deposit was part of a fire-entering rite that “marked the symbolic and literal destruction of an earlier K'anwitznal dynastic line.” 

The authors state that the event “appears to have bene an act of desecration: it was dumped at the edge of a crude wall used as a construction pen and no effort was made to protect the fragmented bones and ornaments from the tomb blocks deposited on top of them as construction fill.” It all likely made for a “dramatic public affair” meant to be charged with emotion. “It could dramatically mark,” they wrote, “the dismantling of an ancient regime.”

Publishers are being offered hundreds of thousands of euros for journals indexed by scholarly databases.Credit: Dave Whitney/Getty

Research-integrity analysts are warning that ‘journal snatchers' — companies that acquire scholarly journals from reputable publishers — are turning legitimate titles into predatory, low-quality publications with questionable practices.

In an analysis published on the preprint repository Zenodo in January1, researchers identified three dozen journals that have been caught in this predicament after being bought by what they describe as a network of recently established international companies with no track record in the publishing industry. The scholarly database Scopus has removed the titles from its index after an investigation. 

“We found at least 36 journals but we think that there may be more,” says study co-author Alberto Martín-Martín, an information scientist at the University of Granada in Spain. Nature was able to reach one of the companies named in the study, Oxbridge Publishing House, which disputes the allegations.

The titles were previously indexed by databases such as Scopus and Web of Science, and were owned by various institutions, including the Dutch publishing giant Elsevier; the academic publisher Palgrave Macmillan, based in London; Indiana University Northwest, in Gary, Indiana; and the University of São Paulo, in Brazil. They range in discipline from linguistics, psychology and criminology to biology and medicine. (Palgrave Macmillan is owned by Springer Nature, which also publishes Nature. Nature's news team is independent of its publisher.)

Predatory publishers' latest scam: bootlegged and rebranded papers

Predatory publishers' latest scam: bootlegged and rebranded papers

Martín-Martín's study describes how, in the past few years, these journals were acquired by various companies, including Oxbridge Publishing House — a firm registered in the United Kingdom in September 2022 — another UK-based firm called Open Access Text, JCF Corp in Singapore and Intellectual Edge Consultancy in Malaysia.

According to emails evaluated by Martín-Martín and his co-author, Emilio Delgado López-Cózar, also an information scientist at Granada, publishers are being offered hundreds of thousands of euros in exchange for each journal. “For small journals, this is a very attractive offer,” Martín-Martín says.

After acquisition, the analysis found, a common trend appears across the publications: the journals introduce or raise article-processing charges — fees some open-access journals impose for publishing papers — and churn out more studies. Many of these papers are outside the scope of topics covered by the journal before acquisition. 

These practices are typically associated with predatory publishing, where questionable publishers cut corners to generate low-quality or fraudulent research papers in exchange for high publication fees.

Most of the companies named in the analysis did not respond to Nature's requests for comment. David Radhor, relationship manager at Oxbridge Publishing House, says the company is “not a publisher” and does not directly own all of the titles in Martín-Martín's preprint. (The study claims that Oxbridge has directors in common with some of the other companies, and suggests that it is part of a network of linked firms that are actively acquiring journals.)

Radhor adds that for the journals Oxbridge Publishing House does own, the company “has not been involved in their editorial decision-making” and does not have oversight of the number of papers published, the article-processing charges or the authors who submit manuscripts. Those decisions are made independently by each journal's editorial board, he says. “Our role is primarily operational, focusing on production and formatting, publishing and distribution, sales and revenue management, marketing and promotion, legal and compliance, and technology and infrastructure.”

How big is science's fake-paper problem?

Nature also attempted to contact all 36 journals listed in the study. Amjid Iqbal, managing editor of the American Journal of Health Behavior (AJHB) in Los Angeles, California, says his journal increased their publication fees (from US$1,595 to £2,000 according to the study) because of inflation and because its vendors increased their charges. He adds that all editorial decisions are made by the journal's editorial board. The study claims that payments to AJHB from authors based in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East are handled by Oxbridge Publishing House, but Iqbal says that the journal has no relationship with the company.

Representatives from the International Journal of Medicine and Science of Physical Activity and Sport and ArtsEduca declined to answer questions about their ownership and editorial oversight. The remaining journals did not respond to requests for comment.

In two other cases, researchers contacted by Nature said they had been falsely listed as editors on journal websites. 

“One of the problems of these companies is that when they buy journals, they are not very open about this, and in many cases, the journals don't give any information about this new owner,” Martín-Martín says. “They don't even display the name of the new owner on the journal website.”

Metrics details

Three-dimensional (3D) cell cultures have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to represent complex tissues or organs more faithfully than conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture. This article reviews the application of both 2D and 3D microscopy approaches for monitoring and studying 3D cell cultures. We first summarize the most popular optical microscopy methods that have been used with 3D cell cultures. We then discuss the general advantages and disadvantages of various microscopy techniques for several broad categories of investigation involving 3D cell cultures. Finally, we provide perspectives on key areas of technical need in which there are clear opportunities for innovation. Our goal is to guide microscope engineers and biomedical end users toward optimal imaging methods for specific investigational scenarios and to identify use cases in which additional innovations in high-resolution imaging could be helpful.

Metrics details

Mitochondria-ER membrane contact sites (MERCS) represent a fundamental ultrastructural feature underlying unique biochemistry and physiology in eukaryotic cells. The ER protein PDZD8 is required for the formation of MERCS in many cell types, however, its tethering partner on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is currently unknown. Here we identify the OMM protein FKBP8 as the tethering partner of PDZD8 using a combination of unbiased proximity proteomics, CRISPR-Cas9 endogenous protein tagging, Cryo-electron tomography, and correlative light-electron microscopy. Single molecule tracking reveals highly dynamic diffusion properties of PDZD8 along the ER membrane with significant pauses and captures at MERCS. Overexpression of FKBP8 is sufficient to narrow the ER-OMM distance, whereas independent versus combined deletions of these two proteins demonstrate their interdependence for MERCS formation. Furthermore, PDZD8 enhances mitochondrial complexity in a FKBP8-dependent manner. Our results identify a novel ER-mitochondria tethering complex that regulates mitochondrial morphology in mammalian cells.

Mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) form contact sites (mitochondria–ER contact sites: MERCS), where the two membranes are juxtaposed within 10–50 nm, an ultrastructural feature conserved in unicellular eukaryotes and metazoans. MERCS are the most abundant membrane contact sites (MCS) between organelles in many cell types and serve as a unique subcellular signaling platform for exchanging metabolites such as Ca2+ and glycerophospholipids. In addition to these critical biochemical reactions, key physiological and cell biological events essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, including mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial DNA replication, and autophagosome biogenesis occur at these contact sites1,2,3.

Observations using electron microscopy (EM) have demonstrated that mitochondria and ER membranes are closely apposed at MCS, requiring proteins able to tether these two membranes within tens of nanometers of one another4. Intensive screening studies have identified multiple proteins localizing at MERCS in mammalian cells1,5,6,7. Among those, the ER-resident protein PDZD8 was identified as a paralog of yeast Mmm1, a component of the ER–mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES)8,9. Although the ERMES as a full complex formed by four proteins is lost in mammals, PDZD8 is required for forming the majority (~40–80%) of MERCS in various cell types, and its deletion in cell lines and in mammalian neurons results in the disruption of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics by decreasing the fraction of Ca2+ released from the ER that can be imported directly into mitochondria8,10,11,12,13,14,15. Consistent with its role in neurons of central nervous system (CNS), PDZD8 regulates dendritic Ca2+ dynamics in hippocampal CA1 and underlies their response properties in vivo16. Furthermore, genetic loss of function mutations of PDZD8 in humans leads to syndromic intellectual disability17. In addition, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism affecting the expression of PDZD8 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a population of patients with high risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)18. Therefore, PDZD8 plays a critical role in controlling neuronal and circuit function, and proper brain development and homeostasis in mammals12.

In addition to MERCS, the ER forms various MCSs with other organelles such as lysosomes, endosomes, Golgi apparatus, lipid droplets, and the plasma membrane (PM)2,19,20,21,22. We and other groups have previously shown that PDZD8 localizes at MERCS in various cell types8,23,24. However, it has also been reported recently that overexpression of Rab7 or LAMP1 can recruit PDZD8 to the ER–late endosome or ER–lysosome contact sites, respectively23,25,26. In addition, overexpression of PDZD8 and Rab7 recruits the mitochondria to ER–endosome contact sites and was proposed to lead to the formation of three-way MCS23. Therefore, PDZD8 might participate in the formation of MCS networks besides tethering MERCS. As such, we hypothesized the existence of a currently unknown molecular effector required to recruit PDZD8 specifically to MERCS. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying PDZD8-dependent MERCS formation, we used multiple independent proximity-based proteomic approaches relying on endogenous protein tagging. Since overexpression of PDZD8 can alter its subcellular distribution8. we implemented CRISPR–Cas9 technology to generate knock-in cell lines where endogenous PDZD8 is tagged with various epitopes, fluorescent proteins or catalytic enzymes, allowing its localization by microscopy or proximity-based proteomic screens. We demonstrate that the mitochondrial LC3 receptor FK506 binding protein 8 (FKBP8 also known as FKBP38) is a novel, direct PDZD8-interacting protein, and that the PDZD8–FKBP8 complex is required for MERCS formation in metazoan cells. Using combinations of Cryo-EM tomography and correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM), we revealed the ultrastructural features of MERCS mediated by the PDZD8–FKBP8 tethering complex. Finally, our serial scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that PDZD8 regulates mitochondrial complexity through inhibition of FKBP8 function.

While we previously reported that a significant fraction of PDZD8 localizes at MERCS8, PDZD8 was recently shown to localize to the ER–late endosome and ER–lysosome contact sites11,23,25,26. Some of these studies failed to detect the enrichment of PDZD8 at MERCS, however, in the absence of reliable antibodies detecting endogenous PDZD8 protein by immunofluorescence, these studies often relied on overexpression of tagged forms of PDZD8 which disrupts both its subcellular localization and can generate gain-of-function phenotypes, for instance by increasing the number and size of MERCS or other MCSs where it is localized. Therefore, to determine the subcellular distribution of endogenous PDZD8 protein at MCS formed by the ER, we developed a knock-in mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH3T3 cell line fusing the fluorescent protein Venus sequence to the C-terminus of the Pdzd8 coding sequence (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). To avoid an artifactual increase in size and/or biogenesis of late endosome/lysosome due to overexpression of key effector proteins Rab7 or LAMP1, colocalization analyses were performed by detecting these proteins at endogenous levels with antibodies against endogenous markers: LAMP1 for lysosomes, Rab7 for the late endosomes, and Tomm20 and OXPHOS proteins for mitochondria. In agreement with previous studies11,25, confocal microscopy imaging showed that 14.8% of PDZD8-Venus visualized by an enhancement with anti-GFP antibody staining overlapped with LAMP1 staining, and under these endogenous expression conditions 7.7% overlapped with Rab7 staining. However, a significantly larger fraction overlapped mitochondria labeled either with Tomm20 (25.0%) or OXPHOS staining (22.1%), suggesting that endogenous PDZD8 is present at multiple MCS but is most abundant at MERCS (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d).

We next investigated the dynamics of endogenously expressed PDZD8 using time-lapse imaging in live cells. Because native signal of Venus was undetectable in PDZD8-Venus KI NIH3T3 cells, we established the PDZD8-HaloTag KI HeLa cell line and transiently transfected the ER-localized reporter (BiP-mTagBFP2-KDEL) and an outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM)-localized reporter (YFP-ActA27,28) (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). The PDZD8-HaloTag was labeled with Janelia Fluor (JF) 549 dye. Triple-color time-lapse imaging using confocal microscopy demonstrated that PDZD8-Halotag puncta can be stably localized at MERCS despite significant dynamics of both ER and mitochondria, suggesting a direct association of PDZD8 with mitochondria may be present (Supplementary Fig. 2c, Supplementary Movie 1).

Recent work demonstrated that the ER-resident MERCS forming protein VAPB exhibits transient but highly frequent visits to MERCS29. Thus, to determine the localization and molecular dynamics of PDZD8 along the ER membrane relative to MERCS, we performed single particle tracking-photoactivation localization microscopy (sptPALM)30. Single PDZD8 molecules were visualized by labeling overexpressed PDZD8-HaloTag with a photoactivatable version of JF646 in COS7 cells (Supplementary Movie 2). Analysis of localization probabilities using a spatially defined probability function29 revealed PDZD8 localization was entirely restricted to the ER (Fig. 1a). Strikingly, we observed regions along the ER where the probability was significantly higher (hotspots), presumably as a result of tethering and engagement with interacting proteins at contact sites with other organelles. In agreement with our endogenous labeling, ~47% of these hotspots were in close proximity with mitochondria (Fig. 1a–c, Supplementary Fig. 3; 90 out of 192 hotspots). By following the trajectories of single PDZD8 molecules outside and within these mitochondria-associated PDZD8 hotspots (MitoHS), we found that PDZD8 can dynamically enter and exit these hotspots in seconds (Fig. 1b, d, Supplementary Movie 3). Importantly, the effective diffusion (Deff) of single PDZD8 molecules within MitoHS was significantly reduced compared the rest of the ER (0.22 ± 0.0025 μm2/s in MitoHS, mean ± SEM, n = 90; Fig. 1e) suggesting that PDZD8 is captured at MERCS but still remains mobile at these contact sites. Consistent with this, PDZD8 single particles dwelled at the hotspots for a median time of just 1.1 s per each visit (Fig. 1g). In addition to MitoHS, we also observed spots with high probability of PDZD8 that were not mitochondria-associated (OtherHS: Other hotspots, Fig. 1a, c, d). The Deff and dwell time of PDZD8 in the OtherHS is similar to those in MitoHS, but the mean of individual HS area was significantly larger at MitoHS than at the OtherHS (Fig. 1e, f).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

We note that the size of the hotspots observed with PDZD8 is significantly larger and the mean dwell time of PDZD8 at the hotspots was significantly longer compared to those reported with VAPB (Fig. 1f, g)29. The fact that the behavior of PDZD8 and VAPB at the MCS differs suggests that PDZD8 interaction at MERCS may represent a distinct, specific tethering from the interactions described for VAPB. Taken together, these data suggest that PDZD8 is highly dynamic along the ER but drastically slows down at contacts between ER and mitochondria as well as other potential MCS between ER and other organelles. These results strongly suggest the existence of an unknown tethering partner for PDZD8 along the OMM.

To identify the tethering partner of PDZD8 facilitating this behavior at MERCS, we designed unbiased proteomic screens using endogenous PDZD8 protein immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry (IP–MS) (Fig. 2a). To avoid artifacts due to PDZD8 overexpression, we established a mouse line engineered with a 3× HA tag fused to the endogenous PDZD8 protein using CRISPR–Cas9-mediated genomic knock-in (Pdzd8-3× HA KI mouse line) (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). Since PDZD8 is expressed at high levels in neurons, protein complexes containing PDZD8 were isolated from the neocortex of either Pdzd8-3× HA KI mice or control littermates at postnatal day 10 by IP using anti-HA antibody. Identification of the corresponding proteins immunoprecipitated in a complex with PDZD8-3× HA by LC–MS/MS revealed that, in addition to previously identified PDZD8 interactors such as Protrudin, VAPA and VAPB11,31, proteins known to localize at MERCS and/or mitochondria were significantly enriched in the immunoprecipitates from the KI mice compared to the control mice (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Data 1).

The p-value was calculated using an unadjusted two-tailed Student's t-test. g Numbers of proteins highly enriched in the IP–MS (c) and TurboID-MS (f) are shown in a Venn diagram. Twelve proteins are commonly found in the two proteomes. Note that FKBP8 is the only protein annotated with mitochondrial localization. h, i Analysis of the interaction between endogenous FKBP8 and endogenous PDZD8-3× HA from the mouse neocortex (h), or endogenous PDZD8-Venus from NIH3T3 cells. Extracts from neocortex in Pdzd8-3×HA KI mouse (h) or Pdzd8-Venus KI NIH3T3 cells (i) were subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibodies to HA or GFP respectively. The resulting precipitates as well as the original tissue extracts (Total) were subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to FKBP8, VAPA, MFN2, HA (h), GFP (i), and β-actin (i). Data are representative of three independent experiments. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

Next, in order to narrow down the protein list to only proteins in close proximity to PDZD8, we employed an independent approach, a proximity-based labeling screen using a biotin ligase TurboID (Fig. 2d)32. Again, to avoid overexpression-induced artifacts, we established a PDZD8-TurboID KI HeLa cell line using CRISPR–Cas9 knock-in technology (Fig. 2e). These PDZD8-TurboID KI HeLa cells were treated with biotin for 6 h and biotinylated peptides were isolated using tamavidin 2-REV beads and identified by LC–MS/MS (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Data 2). Among 166 proteins identified by this screening approach, 12 proteins were also identified by the IP–MS-based screen (Fig. 2g). Among these candidate interactors, the only protein previously shown to localize at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) was FKBP8 (Fig. 2g).

Finally, we also performed a proteomic screen using TurboID in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro2a) and again identified FKBP8 in the list of biotinylated proteins (Supplementary Fig. 4c, d). Specific co-immunoprecipitation of FKBP8 and PDZD8 was confirmed by Western blotting using the Pdzd8-3× HA knock-in mouse (Fig. 2h) and Pdzd8-Venus KI NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2i). These three independent proteomic approaches converge to strongly suggest that PDZD8 and FKBP8 reside in the same protein complex.

To test if the interaction between PDZD8 and FKBP8 is direct, we measured the binding affinity of PDZD8–FKBP8 interaction in vitro. We used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with purified recombinant cytosolic portions of both FKBP8 and PDZD8 (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b). Recombinant PDZD8 proteins without their transmembrane domain (∆TM) were immobilized on a sensor chip and changes of the surface resonance upon recombinant FKBP8∆TM injection were measured. As expected, the SPR responded in a FKBP8 dose-dependent manner in the 2–90 µM range (Fig. 3a). Even though the titration did not reach a plateau, by assuming a monovalent binding of FKBP8 and PDZD8, fitting Req (SPR responses in equilibrium) and FKBP8 concentration to the titration curve provided a KD value of 142 µM (74–447 µM, 95% confidence interval) (Fig. 3b). Thus, the affinity between recombinant PDZD8 and FKBP8 is in the same range as other previously reported VAPB-PTPIP51 MERCS tethering complex and agrees with the unexpectedly rapid exchange observed by sptPALM33.

Recombinant human PDZD8 (1, 28–)—FLAG was immobilized on the sensor chip and FKBP8 (1–380)—Histag with indicated concentrations were injected. b SPR responses at equilibrium (Req) were plotted against FKBP8 concentration.

Data are representative of two independent experiments. f HA-Pulldown assay with recombinant human PDZD8 (1, 28–506)—HA and recombinant human FKBP8 (1–380)—Histag in vitro.

Next, to identify the protein domains of PDZD8 required to mediate interaction with FKBP8, we conducted co-IP experiments by expressing a series of 3× FLAG-tagged PDZD8 deletion mutants together with HA-tagged FKBP8 (Fig. 3c). Based on the previous reports suggesting that PDZD8 can homodimerize, endogenous full-length PDZD8 can act as a bridge between exogenously expressed truncated forms of PDZD8 and FKBP8, even in the absence of direct binding26. To avoid this, we established a tamoxifen-inducible Pdzd8 conditional KO mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (Pdzd8f/f::CreERT2 MEFs) (Supplementary Fig. 5c–e). Using a time-course analysis, we determined that PDZD8 was undetectable 45 h after CreERT2-mediated deletion of the floxed allele by treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; Supplementary Fig. 5f). Whereas truncated forms of PDZD8 including TM-SMP domains co-precipitated FKBP8 efficiently, none of the other domains showed strong binding to overexpressed FKBP8 (Fig. 3d). These results suggest that TM-SMP domains of PDZD8 represent the minimal domain mediating interaction with FKBP8.

Next, we tested if SMP-C2n-PDZ domain of PDZD8 directly binds to FKBP8 using purified recombinant proteins. Recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)—Thrombin cleavage site - human PDZD8 (1, 28–506) - HA and human FKBP8 (1–380)—Histag were expressed in E. coli and purified with GST-binding beads and TALON affinity columns, respectively. These purified proteins were mixed in vitro, applied to a column with GST-binding beads and eluted by cleaving the thrombin cleavage site. Western blotting analysis revealed that FKBP8 was isolated only when it was incubated with GST-PDZD8 (1, 28–506)—HA (Fig. 3e). This binding of FKBP8 and PDZD8 was confirmed by a pull-down assay using the same set of purified proteins and anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3f). Collectively, these results suggest that the SMP domain of PDZD8 plays a dominant role in interacting with FKBP8 while the TM domain is necessary for the interaction in cellulo, presumably for recruiting PDZD8 to the ER membrane. Given that protein binding and late endosome/lysosome recruitment functions of PDZD8 are suggested to be independent of the SMP domain23,25,34, the SMP domain of PDZD8 may represent a unique binding interface with FKBP8.

Our live imaging of endogenously expressed PDZD8 and the single molecule tracking of PDZD8 showed that PDZD8 is highly mobile throughout the ER but shows distinct interactions (confined diffusion) where the ER is contacting mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 3, Fig. 1b, e, Supplementary Movie 1). Therefore, the direct binding of PDZD8 and FKBP8 prompted us to examine whether FKBP8 is required for capturing of PDZD8 to mitochondria. To achieve this, Cas9 and guide RNAs targeting Fkbp8 gene locus were transiently expressed in the PDZD8-Venus KI NIH3T3 cell line. Immunocytochemistry confirmed that FKBP8 was not detectable in more than 81% of transfected cells (labeled with mTagBFP2; Supplementary Fig. 6a). By quantifying the ratio of PDZD8 closely associated with mitochondria (stained by the anti-Tomm20 antibody) using a confocal microscopy equipped with a super resolution Nikon Spatial Array Confocal (NSPARC) detector, we found that colocalization of PDZD8 with mitochondria was significantly reduced in the FKBP8-depleted cells (Fig. 3g, h). This demonstrates that FKBP8 is required for recruiting the ER protein PDZD8 to mitochondria.

Our results demonstrate that a direct binding between FKBP8 and PDZD8 and also that FKBP8 is required for PDZD8 recruitment to mitochondria. Thus, we investigated if the interaction between PDZD8 and FKBP8 is critical for MERCS formation. To measure the size of MERCS, we visualized the ER and mitochondria membranes using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and segmented the contact sites between the two organelles. As previously reported in HeLa cells constitutively deleted with PDZD88, conditional deletion of PDZD8 induced by a treatment with 4-OHT to Pdzd8f/f::CreERT2 MEFs (Pdzd8 cKO) significantly decreased the size of MERCS, defined as the fraction of OMM membranes associated (≤3 pixels: 23.4 nm) with ER, compared to the vehicle-treated control isogenic MEFs (Fig. 4a, b). Strikingly, shRNA mediated knock-down (KD) of Fkbp8 (validated in Supplementary Fig. 6b) in the vehicle-treated control MEFs significantly decreased the size of MERCS to the same extent as in conditional Pdzd8 cKO cells (Fig. 4a, b, Supplementary Fig. 6c). Importantly, Fkbp8 KD in Pdzd8 cKO MEFs did not further reduce the fraction of MERCS compared to Pdzd8 KO MEF only (Fig. 4a, b, Pdzd8 cKO vs Pdzd8 cKO + Fkbp8 KD). Two-way ANOVA analysis shows that there is a strong functional interaction between the effects of FKBP8 and PDZD8 loss of function regarding the size of MERCS (Fig. 4c, d). We also observed the same trend when MERCS were defined as OMM membranes associated with the ER at a longer distance, specifically 32.4–54.6 nm (4–7 pixels) (Supplementary Fig. 6d). Therefore, these results demonstrate that PDZD8 and FKBP8 tether the ER and mitochondria interdependently.

Dots show the mean of each condition. d The results of the two-way ANOVA test. The low (<0.01) variation of the interaction shows that PDZD8 and FKBP8 cooperatively affect the areas of MERCS.

Although the vast majority of FKBP8 localizes at the mitochondria, an escape of FKBP8 from mitochondria to the ER has been reported upon mitophagy induction35. Therefore, to determine if PDZD8 colocalizes with the ER-resident FKBP8 (cis-interaction) or with the mitochondrial FKBP8 (trans-interaction), we determined the subcellular compartments where PDZD8 and FKBP8 colocalize. Immunostaining using anti-FKBP8 antibodies showed a puncta-like distribution of endogenous FKBP8 and revealed that 88.2% of FKBP8 is localized at mitochondria in HeLa cells (Fig. 5a, b, Supplementary Fig. 7a). Calculation of the distance from the centroids of each PDZD8 puncta to the nearest FKBP8 puncta within the mitochondria (‘on mito regions') revealed that the number of FKBP8 within 450 nm of PDZD8 was considerably higher compared to the control where the centroids of FKBP8 puncta were placed at scrambled positions within ‘on mito regions'. This juxtaposition of PDZD8 and FKBP8 was not observed outside the mitochondria (‘off mito regions') (Fig. 5c). These suggest that FKBP8 localizes near PDZD8 within mitochondria but not in other cytoplasmic region. Additionally, we found that the ratio of PDZD8 intensity overlapped with FKBP8 on mitochondria was significantly reduced by the FKBP8 randomizing (Fig. 5d). Moreover, PDZD8 puncta were significantly enriched in the FKBP8-positive area of mitochondria (Fig. 5e), indicating that PDZD8 colocalizes with FKBP8 more frequently than random occurrences on mitochondria. To independently confirm these results in cells derived from a different species and using endogenous tagging of FKBP8 and PDZD8 simultaneously, we developed a dual KI strategy (Supplementary Fig. 7b), whereby an HA-tag was knocked-in at the Fkbp8 genomic locus to express HA-FKBP8 in the Pdzd8-Venus KI NIH3T3 cell line. Consistent with the localization in HeLa cells, PDZD8 significantly accumulated in FKBP8-present regions on mitochondria compared to FKBP8-absent regions (Supplementary Fig. 7c–e). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that an ER-resident protein PDZD8 colocalizes with FKBP8 specifically on the mitochondria.

a Immunofluorescence analysis of PDZD8-Halotag KI HeLa cells. The cells were treated with 200 nM of Janelia Fluor 549 for 20 h and then stained with antibodies to FKBP8 and to Tomm20. The boxed regions of the top panels are shown at higher magnification in the corresponding lower panels. Arrowheads indicate PDZD8 colocalized both with FKBP8 and Tomm20.

Error bar is mean ± s.e.m. of nine cells from two independent experiments. The average of three cytoplasmic regions cropped from each of the nine cells was used for the analysis. c Distribution of PDZD8 puncta with the indicated distance to the nearest FKBP8 puncta was determined for images obtained as described in a. The distance from centroids of each PDZD8 punctum to the nearest FKBP8 centroids was calculated within mitochondria (on mito) or outside of the mitochondria (off mito) respectively. The scrambled FKBP8 centroids were created by shuffling pixels within mitochondria or outside of the mitochondria in the images showing FKBP8 centroids. Nine cells from two independent experiments were used in the calculation. Two-sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to test statistical significance. ****P < 0.0001, *P = 0.0254. d The ratios of PDZD8 intensity overlapped with FKBP8 on mitochondria (Mander's coefficients) were determined for images as described in a.

We next tested if overexpression of the mitochondrial FKBP8 is sufficient for recruiting endogenous ER-localized PDZD8 to mitochondria. We overexpressed a mutated form of FKBP8 previously shown to lock its localization at the OMM (FKBP8N403K)35 in the PDZD8-Halotag KI HeLa cells. Strikingly, the overlap of PDZD8 with an OMM-marker YFP-ActA in HA-FKBP8N403K overexpressing cells was significantly increased (Fig. 6a, b). This suggests that the mitochondrial FKBP8 binds to PDZD8. Then, we examined if overexpression of FKBP8N403K recruits the ER together with PDZD8 by a correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM) analysis (Supplementary Fig. 8a). Endogenous PDZD8 was labeled with JF549 dye in the PDZD8-HaloTag KI HeLa cell expressing with Venus-FKBP8N403K or YFP-ActA (OMM marker). Confocal microscopy with an NSPARC detector was used to visualize JF549 labeled PDZD8-HaloTag and Venus-FKBP8N403K or YFP-ActA signals within fixed cells, and the area imaged by confocal microscopy was subsequently re-identified in EM images (Supplementary Fig. 8b–e). OMM and the ER membrane within 25 nm of each other (MERCS) were segmented in the EM images and then 3D-reconstructed from 8 slices with 50 nm thickness (total 400 nm thick in z-axis) (Fig. 6c, Supplementary Fig. 8d, e). The 3D-reconstructed mitochondria and MERCS was aligned to the confocal microscopy image using the FKBP8 signals or ActA signals as landmarks for mitochondria (Fig. 6d, Supplementary Movie 4). Notably, PDZD8 puncta observed near mitochondria were highly accumulated in MERCS of the FKBP8N403K-overexpressing cell (arrowheads in Fig. 6e, Supplementary Movie 4). Taken together, using multiple independent approaches, our results demonstrate that PDZD8 and FKBP8 form a complex between the ER and mitochondria and the overexpression of FKBP8 at OMM increases the abundance of this protein complex at MERCS.

Cells transfected with either the control plasmid (upper two rows) or the plasmid encoding HA-FKBP8N403K (bottom two rows), along with the mitochondrial marker YFP-ActA, were treated with 200 nM of JF549 for 20 h, and subsequently, the fixed cells were observed using a confocal microscope equipped with a Nikon Spatial Array Confocal (NSPARC) detector.

Cells overexpressing with Venus-FKBP8N403K or YFP-ActA (for the control) were treated with 200 nM of JF549 for 20 h and then fixed cells were observed by a confocal microscope. After that, ultra-thin sections (50 nm thick) were created and observed in a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE–SEM). Electron micrographs of the serial 8 slices were corresponding to an optical section of fluorescence images. Segmentations and 3-demensional (3D) reconstructions of mitochondria and the ER within 25 nm of mitochondria (MERCS) in electron micrographs were shown in c. 3D reconstruction from electron micrographs (shown as “EM”) were merged with fluorescence images (shown as “LM”) in d.

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) provides a resolution range of 3–50 Å that is not accessible with other techniques and, importantly, allows the quantification of ultrastructural features of MERCS in situ under native conditions. Using correlative cryo-light microscopy and cryo-ET, we studied the in situ topology of mammalian mitochondria and mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM). First, we overexpressed FKBP8N403K in Pdzd8-Venus KI NIH3T3 cells and replicated the effect of recruiting and stabilizing PDZD8 in cells grown on cryo-EM grids (Fig. 7a). We then used cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling to generate lamellae (<200 nm-thick slice per cell) from PDZD8-HaloTag KI HeLa cells overexpressing mScarlet-FKBP8N403K (Fig. 7b–e). Cryo-fluorescence images of the lamellae overlaid on their corresponding high-resolution medium-mag TEM montage confirmed the presence of FKBP8N403K-mScarlet in the target cells. Since mScarlet-FKBP8N403K overexpression significantly increased the number of associations between mitochondria and MAM in each lamella compared to control cells, we fully segmented and labeled 20 or 6 membrane structures at OMM within 50 nm of their associated membranes in the FKBP8N403K overexpression condition or in the control cells, respectively. Using surface morphometrics analysis36, we quantified MAM–OMM distances at the level of a fraction of MAM. Our cryo-ET analyses demonstrate that MAM–OMM distances at any given interface are quite heterogeneous ranging from 10 to 50 nm (Fig. 7f, Supplementary Fig. 9). Moreover, an aggregate analysis for both the overexpressed and control conditions showed that overexpression of FKBP8N403K significantly (p < 0.0005, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) shifted MAM–OMM distances to shorter values with a weighted median value at 25.7 nm compared to 30.1 nm in control cells (Fig. 7g). These results suggest that overexpression of FKBP8N403K, which efficiently recruits ER-localized PDZD8 to MERCS, imposes distances shorter than 25 nm between the MAM and OMM.

a Overexpression of FKBP8N403K increases the intensity and the abundance of the PDZD8-Venus puncta. At cryogenic temperatures, autofluorescence of the NIH3T3 cells in the green channel is strong, hence the presence of puncta in the control cells. The Venus fluorophore also emits light in the red channel. The images represent two stacks (field of view: 638.9 µm2) for the control and four stacks (field of view: 638.9 µm2) for FKBP8N403K OE, respectively. b–e For the cryo-ET analysis, mScarlet-FKBP8N403K overexpression (OE) was used to increase the number of associations between mitochondria and mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) captured in cryo-FIB milled lamellae. An SEM image of a target cell before Cryo-FIB milling is shown (b). Cryo-fluorescence imaging of lamellae confirmed the presence of mScarlet-FKBP8N403K in the target cells. Note that the apparent mismatch between the cryo-fluorescence image and cryo-TEM is due to factors including autofluorescence, differences in resolution, registration errors, distortions in the imaging plane, and ice-crystal contaminations (c). Using medium-mag high-resolution TEM montages of the lamellae, mitochondria with MAM were targeted for high-resolution tilt series acquisition (d). Eighty tomograms containing MAM were obtained for the OE condition (of which 20 were fully segmented and labeled), and 10 tomograms containing MAM were obtained for the control (of which 6 were fully segmented and labeled). Two representative tomograms from the OE condition corresponding to the arrows in panel (d) are shown (e). The image of b represents more than 35 cells. The image of c represents 13 lamellae. FLM: fluorescent light microscopy. f A surface morphometrics analysis was used to calculate the MAM-outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) distance. The distances are shown as a heatmap. Mammalian OMM and MAM show a great deal of heterogeneity in their membrane ultra-structure. g Aggregate analysis of the area-weighted MAM–OMM distance histogram shows a shift to smaller distances in the overexpression condition compared to the control.

MERCS represent hotspots for both fission and fusion of mitochondria37,38,39. Importantly, previous reports suggested that FKBP8 promotes mitochondrial fission40,41. Thus, we decided to examine the role of PDZD8–FKBP8 complex in the regulation of mitochondrial morphology. Quantitative volume analyses of mitochondria reconstructed from serial electron microscopy images revealed that mitochondria in PDZD8 cKO cells were significantly spherical represented by the smaller mitochondria complexity index (MCI42) compared to the control (Fig. 8a–d, Supplementary Fig. 10, Supplementary Movie 5). In contrast, mitochondria in FKBP8 KD cells were more elongated and branched compared to the control, resulting in higher MCI (Fig. 8c, d). These data suggest that PDZD8 increases but FKBP8 decreases the mitochondrial complexity. Interestingly, PDZD8 KO did not reduce the MCI in FKBP8 KD background (Fig. 8c, d). This indicates that PDZD8 suppresses the function of FKBP8 in regulating mitochondrial structure.

After cropping the volume, the mitochondria in the volume were semi-automatically extracted with an AI-assisted pipeline. b Formula of calculating MCI (mitochondrial complexity index)42.

The biology of organelle contacts has emerged as molecularly complex and highly dynamic but mediating many crucial aspects of cell physiology. In particular, MERCS play key roles in exchanging Ca2+ and lipid between the ER and mitochondria8, regulating mitochondrial fission/fusion, and biogenesis of autophagosomes1,3,43,44. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of MERCS formation and its role in regulating mitochondrial morphology by analyzing the dynamics of the ER–mitochondria tethering protein PDZD8 using endogenous tagging, single particle tracking, identifying the partner protein on the mitochondrial side, and investigating mitochondrial morphology at a nanometer scale.

Our results show (1) specific PDZD8 recruitment at MERCS under endogenous conditions, (2) PDZD8 moving dynamically along the ER membrane and exhibits a significant increase in dwell time or transient ‘capture' near points of contacts with mitochondria, and (3) that FKBP8, identified using a battery of endogenous tags and biotin ligase mediated proteomics, is a novel PDZD8 binding partner mediating its tethering function at MERCS across multiple systems and species. Super-resolution optical imaging and CLEM analysis revealed that FKBP8 is necessary and sufficient for recruiting PDZD8 to MERCS. Furthermore, our ultrastructural analysis suggested that the binding between FKBP8 and PDZD8 is necessary for the formation of a significant fraction of MERCS. We took advantage of a cryo-ET pipeline for characterizing mitochondria and their associated membranes at sub-nanometer resolution in native conditions and discovered that the MAM–OMM distances are highly variable with a range of 10–50 nm and narrowed by overexpressing FKBP8N403K. Taken together, our results revealed a novel molecular mechanism underlying the formation of contacts between the ER and mitochondria. Given that our screenings identified VAPA and VAPB (VAPs), known participants in the MERCS formation, as candidate proteins interacting with PDZD8, it would be intriguing to explore whether PDZD8 and these proteins form a complex and how they regulate MERCS.

The ER spreads throughout the cell and works as a hub exchanging a wide variety of molecules with other organelles especially through membrane contact sites. It has been shown that PDZD8 is an ER protein required for the formation of MERCS, but also localizes at MCS between ER–lysosome, ER–late endosome, and at the ER–late endosome–mitochondria tripartite contacts, all of which we can observe with some frequency in our data11,23,25. The results of sptPALM showing the dynamic exchange of PDZD8 inside and outside hotspots at ER-mitochondrial contacts suggest that PDZD8 may be able to move rapidly between different types of MCS, as suggested for VAPB. One mechanism that could help facilitate recruitment of PDZD8 to the late endosome is its ability to directly bind to Rab7. Thus, it is possible that FKBP8 and Rab7 are competing for sequestration of PDZD8 and therefore might control the balance between the areas of MERCS and ER–lysosome contacts. Although the absence of Rab7 and other late endosomal/lysosomal proteins in the protein list from our screening results suggests that our current experimental system may not be ideal for investigating this hypothesis, single-particle tracking analyses exploring the sequestration of PDZD8 in cells where it binds with both FKBP8 and Rab7 would be of great interest.

Previous studies revealed that FKBP8 expression induces mitochondrial fragmentation and mitophagy through its LC3-interacting region motif-like sequence (LIRL) and LC3-interacting region (LIR), respectively40. In agreement with this, our high-throughput volume EM analysis demonstrated that FKBP8 limits mitochondrial volume possibly by limited fusion or promoting fission (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Together with the fact that MERCS provides isolation membranes for autophagy45, the MERCS formation via the PDZD8–FKBP8 complex might be a prerequisite for the onset of mitophagy. Of note, a combination of FKBP8 KD and PDZD8 KO revealed that PDZD8 enhances mitochondrial complexity through inhibition of FKBP8. Considering that PDZD8 is required to suppress mitophagy in Drosophila neurons12, one potential function of PDZD8 binding to FKBP8 could be to arrest the progression of mitophagy by inhibiting FKBP8-dependent modulation of mitochondrial shape after initiating the formation of the isolation membrane. The CLEM analysis in this study showed that the overexpression of the mitochondrial FKBP8 brought PDZD8 on the positive curvature of mitochondria (Supplementary Fig. 8f). Future studies using high-resolution live imaging will be required to clarify how the localization of this complex affects the morphological changes of mitochondria.

Cryo-ET pipelines will pave the way for sub-nanometer analysis of intact mammalian MCS in their native state. However, cryo-ET has limitations: (1) it is restricted to imaging lamellae thinner than 200 nm, which makes it challenging to capturing the entire ultrastructure, including whole mitochondria and MERCS, and (2) its technically demanding sample preparation limits its use for large datasets and broader fields of view. To compensate these limitations, we performed a 3D ultrastructural analysis using array tomography on chemically fixed cells using wide-field SEM. This complementary technique confirmed the essential role of the PDZD8–FKBP8 complex in MERCS formation and the regulation of mitochondrial morphology.

Although our cryo-ET analysis demonstrated FKBP8's role in controlling distances between membranes at mitochondrial contact sites in a near-native state (Supplementary Fig. 9d), fixation-induced artifacts remain a potential limitation, regardless of whether chemical or cryo-fixation methods are used. Thus, studying the PDZD8–FKBP8 complex's role in MERCS formation within living cells, especially in relation to ER and mitochondrial dynamics, is an important direction for future research. Furthermore, protein localization analysis using confocal microscopy revealed that FKBP8 is essential for MERCS formation by recruiting PDZD8 to the vicinity of mitochondria. Although FKBP8 knockout did not completely block PDZD8 recruitment to mitochondria, it is important to note that the limited resolution of the z-axis in fluorescence microscopy may have added background signals to overestimate the localization of PDZD8 near mitochondria. While this limitation makes it difficult to precisely define MERCS using fluorescence microscopy alone, the combination of fluorescence and electron microscopy (3D-CLEM) ensured that PDZD8 is indeed localized within MERCS. These analyses were performed using endogenous protein observation, as overexpression can obscure true localization due to excessive protein levels. Although the low expression levels of endogenous PDZD8 prevented us from observing its dynamics using sptPALM, photoactivation enabled us to track the dynamics of individual molecules in overexpressed proteins. Future studies are needed to investigate the dynamics of endogenous PDZD8.

This study elucidates a molecular pathway that regulates mitochondrial morphology at the interface with the ER. Given the dynamic nature of MERCS, revealing how cellular conditions utilize this pathway to modulate mitochondria will provide novel insights into cellular homeostasis.

Pdzd8f/f mouse embryos were dissected from anesthetized females at embryonic day 13.516. The embryos were minced, and after treatment with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco), 50 μg/mL of DNaseI (Merck) and 0.67 mg/mL of Hyaluronidase (Merck) in PBS for 20 min, the cells of the resulting suspension were plated onto 100-mm culture dishes and maintained in culture medium for 4 days. The cells were then immortalized by transfecting with plasmids encoding simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen (pMK16_SV40 T ori (−)47). After that, the cells were infected with lentivirus carrying Cre-ERT2 and single cell clones were obtained using a limiting dilution in 96-well plates.

CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing was performed using the iGONAD method48. Two- to three-month old female mice (Jcl:ICR, CLEA Japan) were mated with male mice the day before electroporation. The female mice with virginal plug were used for iGONAD at embryonic day 0.75. Genome editing solution was prepared with 1 mg/ml Cas9 protein (IDT, 1081059), 30 mM crRNA (annealed with tracrRNA, IDT, 1072534), 2 mg/ml ssODN (IDT, Ultramer DNA Oligo, standard desalting), and FastGreen (Fujifilm Wako, 061-00031) in OPTI-MEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 11058021). The oviducts of the female mice were exposed and injected with the solution through microcapillary injection. Oviduct electroporation was performed using NEPA21 and CUY652P2.5 × 4 (NEPA gene) with the following protocol: three poring pulses (50 V, 5 ms, 50 ms interval, and 10% decay [±pulse orientation]) and three transfer pulses (10 V, 50 ms, 50 ms interval, and 40% decay [±pulse orientation]). After electroporation, the oviducts were returned to their original position. The sequences of crRNA and ssODN were as follows: crRNA, 5′-ATT GAT TAC ACT GAC TCA GA-3′ and ssODN, 5′-AGC CAT TCA GCA ACA TTT CCG ATG ACT TGT TCG GCC CAT CTG AGT CAG TGT ACC CAT ACG ATG TTC CAG ATT ACG CTG GCT ATC CCT ATG ACG TCC CGG ACT ATG CAG GAT CCT ATC CAT ATG ACG TTC CAG ATT ACG CTG TTT AAT CAA TAA GCT ATT TCA ACT TTC ACA TGG ATG GAG GGG ACA AGA CGT A-3′. For Supplementary Fig. 4b, mouse tail fragments were boiled with a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Tween20, and 0.5 mg /mL Proteinase K (Nacalai) at 55 °C for 20 h.

Insoluble pellets and supernatants were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were boiled with 1× Laemmli's sample buffer containing 10% mercaptoethanol at 98 °C for 5 min. The cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel or a 4–15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad) and the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Merck). The membrane was incubated first with primary Abs for 24 h at 4 °C and then with HRP–conjugated secondary Abs (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at room temperature. After a wash with TBS-T (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), the membrane was processed for detection of peroxidase activity with chemiluminescence reagents (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1.25 mM Luminol, 0.2 mM P-coumaric acid, 0.01% H2O2) and the signals were detected by Image Quant LAS4000 instrument (GE Healthcare).

Pups were then put on the ice for 5 min and exsanguinated by terminal intracardial perfusion with ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde (Merck) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The neocortex was then removed and sonicated five times for 30 s with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton-X100, PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor (Roche) and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Insoluble pellets and supernatants were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were incubated in rotation at 4 °C for 20 h with a protein complex of anti-HA antibody (Cell signaling technology, C29F4) and Sera-Mag SpeedBeads Protein A/G (Cytiva). After the rotation, beads were washed three times with TBS buffer. The immunoprecipitates were eluted from beads by incubating in 2× Laemmli's sample buffer containing 10% mercaptoethanol at 98 °C for 10 min and then subjected to immunoblotting. Total fraction samples were prepared using 2% of the cell extracts.

Cells were fixed with 0.1% PFA for 10 min at room temperature, and 100 mM glycine–NaOH was treated for 4 min at RT. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton-X100, 1 mM Na3VO4 and cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche)). Cell extracts were incubated on ice for 15 min, then insoluble pellets and supernatants were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were incubated in rotation at 4 °C for 20 h with a protein complex of anti-GFP antibody (MBL) and Dynabeads Protein A (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After the rotation, beads were washed three times with TBS buffer. The immunoprecipitates were eluted from beads by incubating in 2× Laemmli's sample buffer, then mercaptoethanol was added at the final concentration of 9%. Samples were boiled at 98 °C for 5 min and then subjected to immunoblotting. Total fraction samples were prepared using 1.5% of the cell extracts.

Pdzd8f/f::CreERT2 MEFs were treated with 1 μM 4-OH tamoxifen for 24 h and then transfected with plasmids encoding 3× FLAG-tagged full-length PDZD8/deletion mutants and HA-tagged FKBP8. Twenty-four hours post transfection cells were lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% Triton-X100, 1 mM Na3VO4 and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)), and insoluble pellets and supernatants were separated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatants were incubated in rotation at 4 °C for more than 3 h with a protein complex of anti-HA antibody (Cell signaling technology) and Dynabeads Protein A (Thermo Fisher Scientific). After the rotation, beads were washed twice with TBS-T buffer and once with TBS buffer. The immunoprecipitates were eluted from beads by incubating in 2× Laemmli's sample buffer, then mercaptoethanol was added at the final concentration of 9%. Samples were boiled at 98 °C for 5 min and then subjected to immunoblotting. Total fraction samples were prepared using 20% of the cell extracts.

The pCAX–Cas9 and gRNA backbone vector (YT210) were generously provided by Matsuzaki49. To enhance knockout (KO) efficiency, three gRNAs targeting different exons were designed for the CRISPR/Cas9-based KO system50. The gRNA sequences were designed using either Crispor51 or the CRISPRdirect52. Target sequences were amplified using forward and reverse oligonucleotides through PCR and subsequently cloned into the gRNA backbone vector at the AflII restriction sites49.

Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C, permeabilized with 90% methanol in PBS for 20 min under −20 °C and incubated for 20 h (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 7c) or 1 h (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7a) in PBS containing 2% FBS and 2% BSA (blocking buffer) at room temperature. They were then exposed at room temperature first for 1 h to primary Abs in blocking buffer and then for 30 min to Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary Abs (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in blocking buffer. ProLong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a mounting medium. Images were acquired on a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse microscope with an A1R confocal, a CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda D 100× Oil (NA 1.45), a laser unit (Nikon; LU-N4, 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm), and filters (450/50 nm, 525/50 nm, 595/50 nm, 700/75 nm for 405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, 640 nm laser, respectively). All equipment was controlled via NIS Elements software (Nikon). Optical sectioning was performed at Nyquist for the longest wavelength. The resulting images were deconvoluted with NIS-elements (Nikon) and processed with NIS-elements (Nikon) or ImageJ (NIH). In Fig. 5a and Fig. S7c, the images were taken as z-stack images (interval; 100 nm) and then 3D-deconvoluted with NIS-elements (Nikon) to enhance resolution. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of point spread function (PSF) in this setup had the following measured values: 488 nm: x 139 nm, y 156 nm, z 307 nm; 561 nm: x 139 nm, y 156 nm, z 345 nm; 640 nm: x 172 nm, y 244 nm, z 368 nm. One z-slice image was arbitrarily selected in each cell as a representative image and used in the analyses in Fig. 5b–e, and Fig. S7d, e.

All analyses of PDZD8 or FKBP8 localization in fluorescent images were conducted using homemade programs written with Python, as detailed below. All binarized images were created using OpenCV's threshold function. In Supplementary Fig. 1c, d, mitochondrial area, lysosomal area, or late endosomal area were defined by binarizing signals of Tomm20/OXPHOS, Lamp1, or Rab7, respectively, and then the percentages of PDZD8 intensity on mitochondria, lysosome or late endosome were calculated. In Fig. 3g, h, the mitochondrial areas were defined by binarizing signals of Tomm20 with global thresholding and then the percentage of PDZD8 intensity on mitochondria (Mander's coefficient, M1) was calculated. In Fig. 5b–e, mitochondrial areas were defined by binarizing signals of Tomm20. In Fig. 5b, to calculate Mander's coefficient between FKBP8 and Tomm20, the sum of FKBP8 intensity on mitochondria divided by total FKBP8 intensity was calculated. In Fig. 5c, using OpenCV's connectedComponentsWithStats function, the puncta of PDZD8 and FKBP8 were segmented in the binarized images of PDZD8 and FKBP8, respectively, and then obtained the centroids of individual puncta. To define the centroids in the “on mito” or “off mito” regions, the images mapping PDZD8 and FKBP8 centroids were masked using the binarized images of Tomm20. To obtain scrambled images of FKBP8, the pixels of the image mapping FKBP8 centroids on mito or off mito regions were shuffled in the corresponding area using the random module of Python. The distance map of FKBP8 was created using OpenCV's distanceTransform function in the images with FKBP8 centroids “on mito”, shuffled “on mito”, “off mito”, and shuffled “off mito”, respectively. Then the number of PDZD8 puncta with the distance from the nearest FKBP8 corresponding to each bin indicated in x-axis of the graph was calculated. In Fig. 5d, to calculate Mander's coefficient between PDZD8 and FKBP8 on mitochondria, the sum of PDZD8 intensity on FKBP8-present mitochondrial regions divided by total PDZD8 intensity on mitochondria was calculated. The scrambled images of FKBP8 were created by shuffling the pixels of FKBP8 channel within mitochondrial area using the random module of Python. In Fig. 5e, FKBP8-present or FKBP8-absent mitochondrial areas were defined as ROIs using binarized images of Tomm20 and FKBP8, and then the sum of PDZD8 intensity at ROIs divided by the area of ROIs was calculated. Image analyses in Fig. S7d, e were performed using the same methods as in Fig. 5d, e. In Fig. 6a, b, the ROIs were manually defined as the cytoplasmic region using the YFP-ActA signal as a guide. The mitochondrial area was defined as binarized images of YFP-ActA with Otsu's method and then the percentage of PDZD8 intensity on mitochondria (Mander's coefficient, M1) was calculated.

Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C. The fixed cells were mounted by ProLong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were acquired on a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse microscope with a Nikon AX confocal microscopy with a Nikon Spatial Array Confocal (NSPARC) detector and a CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda D 100× Oil (NA 1.45). The wavelength range of 430–463 nm, 503–545 nm, or 582–618 nm was obtained by excitation with a 405 nm, 488 nm, or 561 nm laser, respectively.

For the expression of FLAG-tagged human PDZD8 (1, 28–), human PDZD8 sequences were cloned into the pCAG vector. Recombinant human PDZD8 (1, 28–)—FLAG was expressed in Expi293 Cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using ExpiFectamine 293 Transfection Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were cultured for 4 days after transfection at 37 °C and 8% CO2. The Expi293 cell pellets were homogenized with lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) 150 mM NaCl) and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.8-μm pore-size filter and subsequently applied to a DDDDK-tagged protein purification gel (MBL) equilibrated with the lysis buffer. After washing with the lysis buffer once, the FLAG-tagged proteins were eluted with 1 M l-arginine-HCl (pH 4.4). The eluted fraction was dialyzed with an SEC buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0 containing 300 mM NaCl, and 5 mM DTT). The dialyzed fraction was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography in a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column equilibrated with the SEC buffer in an AKTA system (GE Healthcare). The purified fractions were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 (Cut off: 100 kDa) Centrifugal Filter Units (MERCK). For expressing GST-tagged human PDZD8 (1, 28–506)—HA, human PDZD8 sequences were cloned in pGEX4-T-1 vector (Cytiva) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. After culturing 24 h at 37 °C, the cells were incubated at 28 °C until OD600 reaches 0.6–1.0. Then 0.5 mM of IPTG was added into the LB medium and incubated at 20 °C. 16–20 h after IPTG induction, the cells were collected by centrifugation (8000 × g 10 min 4 °C), frozen by liquid nitrogen, and stored at −30 °C. The frozen pellet was mixed with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM EDTA, and Benzonase diluted at 1:5000) and lysed with an ultrasonic disruptor. The cell lysate was centrifuged (40,000 × g for 30 min) at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.8-μm pore-size filter and subsequently loaded onto a Glutathione Sepharose 4B (Cytiva) equilibrated with a lysis buffer. After washing with (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X100) once, with (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT) twice, and the GST-hPDZD8 (1, 28–506)—HA, was eluted with a buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM reduced glutathione, pH 8.0). For the elution of hPDZD8 (1, 28–506)—HA, the Glutathione Sepharose beads were treated with a buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT) supplemented with 0.04 U/µL Thrombin (Cytiva) for 2 days. For the expression of His-tagged human FKBP8 (1–380), pRSETA-hFKBP8 (1–380)—Histag (a kind gift from Dr. Chrisostomos Prodromou53) was transformed into Escherichia C43 (DE3) cells. After culturing for 24 h at 37 °C, the cells were incubated at 28 °C until the OD600 reached 0.6–1.0. Then, 0.5 mM of IPTG was added to the LB medium and incubated at 20 °C. 16–20 h after IPTG induction, the cells were collected by centrifugation (8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −30 °C. The frozen pellet was homogenized with lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM imidazole, Benzonase diluted at 1:10,000) and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.8-μm pore-size filter and subsequently loaded onto a TALON Metal Affinity Resin (Clontech) equilibrated with the lysis buffer. After washing with the wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl 5 mM imidazole) twice, the protein was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 100 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole). The eluted fraction was dialyzed with an SEC buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 500 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DTT). The dialyzed fraction was subjected to size-exclusion chromatography in a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column equilibrated with the SEC buffer in an AKTA system (GE Healthcare).

The interactions of hPDZD8 (1, 28−)—FLAG with hFKBP8 (1–380)—Histag were analyzed using SPR in a Biacore T200 instrument (Cytiva). A Series S CM5 Biacore sensor chip (Cytiva) was activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride, followed by immobilization of hPDZD8 (1, 28–)—FLAG at 618 resonance units. After the immobilization, the activated surface of the sensor chip was blocked with 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8.5). Binding analysis was performed at 25 °C in a running buffer of HBS-T (10 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20). A series of five 2.5-fold dilutions of the FKBP8 solution was injected into the sensor chip at 30 μL/min, with a contact time of 120 s and a dissociation time of 120 s. The KD values were calculated with the Steady State Affinity model on Biacore T200 Evaluation Software, version 3.2 (Cytiva). The 95% CI of the KD value was calculated with Saturation binding analysis on Prism 10 (GraphPad Software).

GST-hPDZD8 (1, 28–506)—HA and hFKBP8 (1–380)–Histag were mixed with Glutathione Sepharose 4B (Cytiva) in a buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 500 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT) and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing with a wash buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT) twice, the proteins were eluted by cleaving the thrombin cleavage site with 0.04 U/µL thrombin (Cytiva) in an elution buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2). The eluate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and processed for Western blotting with anti-Histag and anti-HA antibodies. During the elution process, GST-hPDZD8 (1, 28–506)—HA was cleaved by Thrombin between the GST and hPDZD8 (1, 28–506)—HA. As a result, the IP fraction primarily contained hPDZD8 (1, 28–506)—HA, which has an estimated protein size of 55 kDa based on its amino acid sequence, rather than GST-hPDZD8 (1, 28–506)—HA, which has an estimated size of 81 kDa.

Anti-HA antibodies (C29F4, from Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 3724) were mixed with Dynabeads protein A (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat# 10001D, Lot#2791319) in a buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT) with 100 mg/mL BSA and 0.4% Triton-X100 overnight at 4 °C. Following three washes with a buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT), only a buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.2 % Triton-X100), 0.5 mg/mL BSA in a buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.2% Triton-X100), or 0.5 mg/mL hPDZD8 (1, 28–506)—HA in a buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 0.2% Triton-X100) was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Following two washes with a buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT), 0.5 mg/mL hFKBP8 (1–380)—Histag was added and incubated for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Following two washes with a wash buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT, 1% Triton-X100) and one wash with a buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5 containing 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT), the immunoprecipitates were eluted from the beads by incubating them in 2× Laemmli's sample buffer. Finally, mercaptoethanol was added at a final concentration of 9%. The samples were heated to 98 °C for 3 min and then subjected to immunoblotting.

For Figs. 4 and 8, the cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C. After being washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (0.02 M sodium dihydrogenphosphate dihydrate, 0.08 M disodium hydrogenphosphate), the cells were scraped and collected with 0.2% BSA/0.1 M phosphate buffer followed by centrifugation at 820 × g. After being embedded in low melting agarose (2% in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, MP Biomedicals), cell pellets were sectioned at 150-µm thickness with a Leica VT1000S vibratome. The sections were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) in a 0.05 M phosphate buffer for 30 min. After being rinsed for 3 times with H2O, the cells were stained with 1% thiocarbohydrazide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min. After being rinsed with H2O for 3 times, cells were stained with 1% OsO4 in H2O for 30 min. After being rinsed twice with H2O at room temperature and 3 times with H2O at 50 °C, the cells were treated with Walton's lead aspartate (0.635% lead nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.4% aspartic acid (pH 5.2, Sigma-Aldrich)) at 50 °C for 20 min. The sections were followed by incubations in an ascending ethanol series (15 min each in 50% on ice, 70% on ice, and 10 min each in 90%, 95% ethanol/H2O at room temperature), 10 min in 100% ethanol 4 times and 60 min in butyl 2,3-epoxypropyl ether (Fujifilm Wako pure chemical corporation). This was followed by infiltration of Epok812 resin-butyl 2,3-epoxypropyl ether for 24 h at a 1:1 dilution. After incubating with 100% Epok812 resin for 4 h, followed by 2 h, the resin was cured at 40 °C for 12 h, followed by 60 °C for 48 h. Epok812 resin was made by mixing 7.5 g of MNA (Oken), 13.7 g of Epok812 (Oken), 3.8 g of DDSA (Oken), and 0.2 g of DMP-30 (Oken). Resin blocks were trimmed with a TrimTool diamond knife (Trim 45; DiATOME). For Fig. 4, 50–80 nm thick ultra-thin sections made with a diamond knife (Ultra 45; DiATOME) were collected on a cleaned silicon wafer strip in a Leica Ultramicrotome (UC7). The ultra-thin sections were imaged with a scanning electron microscope (JSM7100F; JEOL). Imaging was done at 5 kV accelerating voltage, probe current setting 12, 1280 × 960 frame size, and 7.4-mm working distance, using the Backscattered Electron Detector. The final pixel size was a 7.8 nm square. For Fig. 8, in the array tomography analysis, the resin blocks created above were serially sectioned further at a 50-nm thickness with a diamond knife (Ultra JUMBO, 45°; DiATOME) fitted in a Leica Ultramicrotome (UC7) to obtain a ribbon of 70–200 serial sections. The serial sections were imaged by a field emission scanning electron microscope (JSM-IT800SHL; JEOL) with the Array Tomography Supporter software (System in Frontier). Imaging was done at 3 kV accelerating voltage, 268 pA beam current, 2560 × 1920 frame size, 6.5 mm working distance, 32.0 × 24.0 µm field of view (pixel size is 12.5 nm) and 2.67 µs dwell time, using the scintillator backscattered electron detector.

For Fig. 4, electron micrographs were manually annotated using PHILOW software54. Mitochondria and ER in the vicinity of mitochondria were annotated and ER regions within 3 pixels (23.4 nm) of the mitochondrial periphery were defined as MERCS. One cell in the Pdzd8 cKO condition was excluded from the statistical analysis because it was considered an outlier in the ROUT test (Q = 0.1%). The numbers of analyzed cells are 33, 29, 39, and 34 cells from two independent experiments for the control, Pdzd8 cKO, Fkbp8 KD, and Pdzd8 cKO + Fkbp8 KD cells, respectively. For Extended Fig. 6d, the same analysis was performed, defining MERCS as ER regions located within 4, 5, 6, and 7 pixels (32.4, 39.0, 46.8, and 54.6 nm) from the mitochondrial periphery. One cell in the Pdzd8 cKO condition was also excluded from the statistical analysis in the Extended Fig. 6d.

The electron micrographs were aligned using the linear stack alignment with scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) Plugin, implemented in ImageJ (NIH). Mitochondria, whose entire volume is within the imaging volume, were semi-automatically annotated using Empanada software55 and PHILOW software54. The volumes of mitochondria were calculated as the number of mitochondrial voxels multiplied by the voxel size (12.5 nm × 12.5 nm × 50 nm). The method for calculating mitochondrial surface area from electron microscopy images is as follows: The number of voxels along the circumference of mitochondrial cross-sections in the xy-plane was counted for each z-plane, and the totals were summed. This allowed for the enumeration of the voxels facing the surface in the direction perpendicular to the z-axis. Subsequently, this sum was multiplied by the 12.5 nm × 50 nm. To account for the mitochondrial surfaces facing along the z-axis the aforementioned voxel count was multiplied by 0.5, and the product was then multiplied by the dimensions of 12.5 nm × 12.5 nm. The sum of these two values was considered the total mitochondrial surface area. MCI was calculated by the following formula proposed by Vincent et al.56:

where SA is surface area and V is volume.

4, 9, 2, and 2 mitochondria in the control, Pdzd8 cKO, Fkbp8 KD, and Pdzd8 cKO + Fkbp8 KD condition were excluded from the statistical analysis because it was considered outliers in the ROUT test (Q = 0.1%) (Supplementary Data 5). 3D visualization of the mitochondrial structure was performed using Imaris version 9.6.0 (Bitplane).

293 T cells (BRC) were co-transfected with shuttle vectors (FUW-CreERT2-P2A-NeoR), HIV-1 packaging vectors Delta8.9 and VSV-G envelope glycoproteins, or shuttle vectors (pLKO-shFKBP8 or pLKO-scramble), LP1, LP2, and VSV-G using FuGENE transfection reagent (Promega, catalog no. E2311)57. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the media were exchanged with 8 mL of fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin, and 24 h later, supernatants were harvested, spun at 500 × g to remove debris and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter (Sartorius). The filtered supernatant was concentrated to 125 μL using an Amicon Ultra-15 (molecular weight cut-off 100 kDa) centrifugal filter device (Merck Millipore), which was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. Then, 100 μL of viral supernatants was added to each 6-well dish containing MEFs.

Prior to imaging, cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated in phenol red-free full DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S for approximately 30 min. During imaging, cells were maintained at 37 °C in an incubation chamber (Tokai Hit). Images were acquired on a Nikon Ti2 Eclipse microscope with an A1R confocal, a CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda D 100× Oil (NA 1.45), a laser unit (Nikon; LU-N4, 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm), and filters (450/50 nm, 525/50 nm, 595/50 nm for 405 nm, 488 nm, and 561 nm, respectively). All equipment was controlled via NIS Elements software (Nikon). Optical sectioning was performed at Nyquist for the longest wavelength. The resulting images were deconvoluted with NIS-elements (Nikon). The resulting images were processed with NIS-elements (Nikon) or ImageJ (NIH).

PDZD8-HaloTag knocked-in HeLa cells were incubated with 200 nM JF549 dye (Promega, catalog No. GA1110) at 37 °C o/n. Three hours before the confocal imaging, three times PBS washes were performed and mediums were changed to JF549 free DMEM, then incubated at 37 °C.

Coverslips (25 mm, No. 1.5, high tolerance, Warner Scientific) were cleaned according to a previously described protocol58 and stored in dry, sterile, 35 mm tissue culture dishes sealed with parafilm until use within 3 months. Immediately before plating, coverslips were coated with 500 μM phenol red-free Matrigel (Corning) for 1 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were then washed once with sterile PBS before being overlaid with 2 mL of complete, phenol red-free DMEM. Simultaneously, 1 × 106 COS7 cells per sample were trypsinized and resuspended directly into a transfection cocktail made of 750 ng PrSS-mEmerald-KDEL, 500 ng mTagRFP-T2-Mito-7, and 250 ng of msPDZD8-HaloTag-N1 mixed with Fugene HD (Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Cells were incubated in the suspension for 15 min at 37°, and then the entire mixture was plated onto the coverslip and incubated for 18–22 h until imaging. Any cells that were not imaged before 24 h post transfection were discarded. Immediately prior to imaging, coverslips were loaded into a custom imaging chamber, labeled for 1 min with 10 nM PA-JF64659 in OptiMEM (Gibco), and washed excessively (at least 5 times) with 10 mL of sterile PBS. Washing was performed while simultaneously aspirating from the chamber, taking extreme care to never expose the cells directly to the air. Cells were then washed once with 10 mL of complete, phenol red-free medium and allowed to recover in 1 mL of complete, phenol red-free DMEM for 15 min before imaging.

Single molecule imaging was performed using a custom inverted Nikon TiE scope outfitted with a stage top incubation system to maintain cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and appropriate humidity during imaging (Tokai Hit). Regions amenable to sptPALM (primarily the flat lamella of cells, 500 nm thick or less) were located by eye using the fluorescence of the ER label. The experimenter was always blinded to the single molecule tracers when choosing the cell region for imaging. Once a region with sufficiently flat ER was chosen, excitation was achieved using three fiber couples solid state laser lines (488 nm, 561 nm, 642 nm, Agilent Technologies) to illuminate the sample. The excitation beams were introduced into the system with a traditional rear-mount TIRF illuminator, which was used to manually set the angle of incidence beneath the critical angle to provide the most even illumination across the ER in the field of view. The illumination by the 488 nm and 561 nm lines were adjusted for each sample to minimize the bleed through into the single molecule channel, but both were always kept beneath 50 μW (488 nm) and 150 μW (561 nm) total power into the back aperture. The single molecule channel was always collected with a constant 11.5 mW of 642 nm light introduced into the back aperture.

Emission light was collected using a 100× α-plan apochromat 1.49 NA oil immersion objective (Nikon Instruments). The collected light was focused onto three simultaneously running, electronically synchronized iXon3 electron multiplying charged coupled device cameras (EM-CCD, DU-897; Andor Technology), using a MultiCam optical splitter (Cairn Research) and sequential 565LP and 647LP dichroic mirrors (Chroma) within the optical path. The three emission paths were additionally cleaned up with a 525/50 BP, 605/70 BP, and 705/60 BP filter (Chroma) to filter extra light in the system.

The microscope was operated in sptPALM mode using only 128 × 128 pixel region on the camera (20.48 μm × 20.48 μm) to drive the system quickly enough to unambiguously track single proteins. The location of the region was always selected close to the center of the camera chip, since the objective being used is only chromatically well corrected at the center of the field of view. Imaging was performed with 5 ms exposure times, and the final speed was monitored using an oscilloscope directly coupled to the system (mean frame rate ~95 Hz).

Single molecule localizations were linked to form trajectories using the TrackMate plugin in Fiji. Linking parameters were experimentally selected for each data set to minimize visible linkage artifacts and identified by eye. The resulting trajectories were then projected on to the ER network and manually curated for linkages that are close in 2D space but prohibitively far in the underlying ER structure itself. The resulting trajectories were exported from TrackMate and analyzed in Matlab for subsequent analysis, as described elsewhere29.

Probability analysis was performed largely as described elsewhere30, where a spatially-defined probability mass function was derived from the total number of localizations observed within a 30 s time window. Note that while enrichments in the probability can correspond to regions of slowed movement, there are several other potential explanations for this phenomenon. Thus, an orthogonal analysis approach was also used where localizations are grouped into Voronoi tessellations and a simple Langevin motion model was applied. The resulting best fit values for diffusion coefficients for each tessellation were then mapped, and in this context they were directly compared to the mean diffusion coefficient of PDZD8 in regions of ER far from the putative contact sites.

PDZD8-Halotag knocked-in HeLa cells were overexpressed with plasmids encoding Venus-FKBP8N403K or YFP-ActA and then treated with 200 nM JF549 dye (Promega) for 20 h at 37 °C. After that, cells were washed with PBS twice and plated in No. 1S gridded coverslip-bottom dishes (custom made, based on IWAKI 3922-035; coverslips were attached inversed side), precoated with carbon by a vacuum coater and then coated with poly-d-lysine (Merck, catalog No. P0899)60. The cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS at room temperature for 10 min and then washed with PBS. Fluorescence imaging was conducted using Nikon AX confocal microscopy with a Nikon Spatial Array Confocal (NSPARC) detector and a CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda D 100× Oil (NA 1.45). The wavelength range of 503–545 nm or 582–618 nm was obtained by excitation with a 488 nm or 561 nm laser, respectively. The cells were then fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 days at 4 °C. After washing with 0.1 M phosphate buffer, the cells were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 (Electron Microscopy Sciences), 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide (Fujifilm Wako pure chemical corporation, catalog No. 161-03742) in a 0.05 M phosphate buffer for 30 min. After being rinsed 3 times with H2O, the cells were stained with 1% thiocarbohydrazide (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min. After being rinsed with H2O for three times, the cells were stained with 1% OsO4 in H2O for 30 min. After being rinsed with H2O for two times at room temperature and three times with H2O at 50 °C, the cells were treated with Walton's lead aspartate (0.635% lead nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.4% aspartic acid (pH 5.2, Sigma-Aldrich)) at 50 °C for 20 min. The cells dehydrated with an ascending series of ethanol (15 min each in 50% on ice, 70% on ice, and 10 min each in 90%, 95% ethanol/H2O at room temperature, 10 min in 100% ethanol 4 times at room temperature) were embedded in epoxy resin (LX-112) by covering the gridded glass with a resin-filled beam capsule. LX-112 resin was made by mixing 4.85 g of NMA (Ladd Research Industries), 7.8 g of LX-112 (Ladd Research Industries), 2.35 g of DDSA (Ladd Research Industries), and 0.3 g of BDMA (Ladd Research Industries). Polymerization was carried out at 42 °C for 12 h and 60 °C for 72 h. After polymerization, the gridded coverslip was removed and the resin block was trimmed to a square of about 150–250 μm. The block was sectioned using an ultramicrotome (EM UC7, Leica) equipped with a diamond knife (Ultra JUMBO 45°, DiATOME) to cut 50 nm thick sections. The serial ultra-thin sections were collected on the cleaned silicon wafer strip and imaged with a scanning electron microscope (JSM-IT800SHL; JEOL). Imaging of the Venus-FKBP8N403K overexpressing cell was done at 2 kV accelerating voltage, 34.1 pA beam current, 5120 × 3840 frame size, 6.5 mm working distance, 12.8 × 9.6 µm field of view (pixel size is 2.5 nm) and 1.33 µs dwell time, using the Scintillator Backscattered Electron Detector. Imaging of the YFP-ActA-overexpressing cell was done at 2 kV accelerating voltage, 48.8 pA beam current, 2560 × 1920 frame size, 6.9 mm working distance, 12.8 × 9.6 µm field of view (pixel size is 5 nm) and 14.1 µs dwell time, using the Scintillator Backscattered Electron Detector. The images taken by confocal microscopy were processed with ImageJ (NIH). The electron micrographs were stitched by Stitch Sequence of Grids of Images Plugin and aligned using the Linear Stack Alignment with Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) Plugin, implemented in ImageJ (NIH). After that, pixel size of images from the Venus-FKBP8-overexpressing cell was converted 2.5 nm to 5 nm by OpenCV's resize function. Mitochondria and ERs in the vicinity of mitochondria in electron micrographs were semi-automatically annotated using Empanada software55 and PHILOW software54. ER regions within 5 pixels (=25 nm) of the mitochondrial periphery were defined as MERCS. Reconstructing segmented images of the electron micrographs to three-dementional images and overlaying it with fluorescence images were conducted using Imaris software (Bitplane). The z projection of electron micrographs was created using ImageJ (NIH). For the analysis of mitochondrial membrane curvature at PDZD8-localized MERCS, the arbitrary area was extracted from the z-projection images of 3D-reconstructed electron micrographs merged with fluorescence images and counted the number of PDZD8-localized MERCS with positive, negative, and neutral OMM using ImageJ.

Cells were transiently transfected with FKBP8N403K-mScarlet plasmid for 24 h and then were transferred to cryo-EM grids (Quantifoil, 200-Au-mesh with carbon film) (pre-treated with 50 µg/ml fibronectin for at least 15 min) and incubated for 3 h. The cells were incubated with 5% glycerol in the media for 15 min right before freezing after which the media was exchanged with PBS and 5% glycerol, and the grids were plunge-frozen. A Leica GP2 was used for plunge freezing with double blotting each for 7 s. The grids were stored in liquid nitrogen for the following steps. First, the grids were imaged using a Zeiss LSM900 AiryScan and the Linkam cryo-stage to screen for overall quality and transfection efficiency. Second, 4 grids were milled in one session using an Aquilos2 FIB-SEM equipped with the Delmic IceShield. Thirty-five lamellae were generated with a thickness of around 170 nm and varying surface areas. These lamellae were loaded on a Titan Krios equipped with a K3 detector and BioQuantum energy filter. High-resolution medium-mag montages of lamellae were collected and manually inspected for MAM. Mitochondria and MAM were then targeted for high-resolution tilt series acquisition at a pixel size of 2.07 Å/pixel. Grids were loaded into the cassette with a lamella pre-tilt of −9°, thus the tilt series acquisition started at 9 degrees, with a target range of −42 to +60° on the grid (−51 to +51 on the lamellae) acquired in 3° increments in a dose-symmetric fashion using SerialEM61. The data collection was monitored live using Warp62. After cryo-ET data collection, the lamellae were imaged in the Zeiss AiryScan with a 100× objective. This was feasible since we discovered that the mScarlet tag survives TEM radiation. The fluorescence images were overlaid on the TEM montages using the MAPS software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tilt series alignment was done using AreTomo. Weighted back projection tomogram reconstructions were CTF-deconvolved using ISONET63. Initial Segmentation was done using TomoSegMemTV64 on the deconvoluted tomograms. The segmentations were corrected and labeled manually using Amira. The segmentations were subsequently processed and analyzed using the surface morphometrics analysis toolkit36. In the OE condition, 73 out of 116 collected tomograms (63%) contained at least one contact site, while in the control, only 19 out of 49 collected tomograms (38%) contained at least one contact site. Full analysis was on 20 mitochondria–MAM associations for the OE condition, and 6 for the control.

Pdzd8-3× HA knock-in mice and control littermates at postnatal 10 days were put to sleep using medetomidine hydrochloride (Domitor, Nippon zenyaku kogyo, 0.75 mg/kg), midazolam (Sandoz, 4 mg/kg) and butorphanol (Vetorphale, Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd., 5 mg/kg). Pups were then put on the ice for 5 min and exsanguinated by terminal intracardial perfusion with ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde (Merck) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The neocortex was then removed and sonicated five times for 30 s with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes-NaOH pH7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% Na-deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 1% NP40, Benzonase (Merck), PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor (Roche) and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). After the lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the resulting supernatants were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with a 2.5 µL slurry of Sera-Mag SpeedBeads Protein A/G (Cytiva) pre-incubated with 2.5 µL of anti-HA-tag rabbit mAb (Cell signaling technology, C29F4). The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer and then twice with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Proteins on the beads were digested by adding 200 ng trypsin/Lys-C mix (Promega) at 37 °C overnight. The resulting digests were reduced, alkylated, acidified, and desalted using GL-Tip SDB (GL Sciences). The eluates were evaporated and dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroactic acid and 3% ACN. LC–MS/MS analysis of the resultant peptides was performed on an EASY-nLC 1200 UHPLC connected to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer through a nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The peptides were separated on a C18 reversed-phase column (75 mm [inner diameter] x 150 mm; Nikkyo Technos) with a linear 4%–32% ACN gradient for 0–100 min, followed by an increase to 80% ACN for 10 min and final hold at 80% ACN for 10 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode with a maximum duty cycle of 3 s. MS1 spectra were measured with a resolution of 120,000, an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 4e5, and a mass range of 375–1500 m/z. HCD MS/MS spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap with an AGC target of 1e4, an isolation window of 1.6 m/z, a maximum injection time of 35 ms, and a normalized collision energy of 30. Dynamic exclusion was set to 20 s. Raw data were directly analyzed against the SwissProt database restricted to Mus musculus using Proteome Discoverer version 2.5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Sequest HT search engine for identification and label-free precursor ion quantification. The search parameters were as follows: (i) trypsin as an enzyme with up to two missed cleavages; (ii) precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm; (iii) fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da; (iv) carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification; and (v) acetylation of the protein N-terminus and oxidation of methionine as variable modifications. Peptides and proteins were filtered at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% using the Percolator node and Protein FDR Validator node, respectively. Label-free quantification was performed on the basis of the intensities of precursor ions using the Precursor Ions Quantifier node. Normalization was performed such that the total sum of abundance values for each sample over all peptides was the same.

PDZD8-TurboID knocked-in HeLa cells were plated into a 15 cm dish at the density of 2 × 106 cells/dish and cultured two overnight. The cells were treated with Biotin at the final concentration of 50 μM, and incubated for 6 h. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold Hepes-saline and lysed in 6 M guanidine-HCl (Wako) containing 100 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH7.5), 10 mM TCEP (Nacalai), and 40 mM chloroacetamide (Sigma). After heating and sonication, proteins (1.3 mg each) were purified by methanol–chloroform precipitation and resuspended in 200 μL of PTS buffer (12 mM SDC, 12 mM SLS, 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0)65. After sonication and heating at 95 °C for 10 min, the protein solutions were diluted 5-fold with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0 and digested with 13 μg of trypsin (Pierce) at 37 °C overnight. After heating at 95 °C for 10 min, the digested peptides were incubated with the ACN-prewashed Tamavidin 2-REV beads (FUJIFILM Wako) for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing five times with TBS (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl), biotinylated peptides were eluted for 15 min at 37 °C twice with 100 µL of 1 mM biotin in TBS. The combined eluates were desalted using GL-Tip SDB, evaporated, and redissolved in 0.1% TFA and 3% ACN. LC–MS/MS analysis of the resultant peptides was performed on an EASY-nLC 1200 UHPLC connected to an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer. The peptides were separated on the C18 reversed-phase column with a linear 4–32% ACN gradient for 0–60 min, followed by an increase to 80% ACN for 10 min and final hold at 80% ACN for 10 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode with a maximum duty cycle of 3 s. MS1 spectra were measured with a resolution of 120,000, an AGC target of 4e5, and a mass range of 375–1500 m/z. HCD MS/MS spectra were acquired in the linear ion trap with an AGC target of 1e4, an isolation window of 1.6 m/z, a maximum injection time of 200 ms, and a normalized collision energy of 30. Dynamic exclusion was set to 10 s. Raw data were directly analyzed against the SwissProt database restricted to Mus musculus using Proteome Discoverer version 2.5 with Sequest HT search engine for identification and label-free precursor ion quantification. The search parameters were as follows: (i) trypsin as an enzyme with up to two missed cleavages; (ii) precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm; (iii) fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da; (iv) carbamidomethylation of cysteine as a fixed modification; and (v) acetylation of the protein N-terminus, oxidation of methionine, and biotinylation of lysine as variable modifications. Peptides and proteins were filtered at a FDR of 1% using the Percolator node and Protein FDR Validator node, respectively. Label-free quantification was performed on the basis of the intensities of precursor ions using the Precursor Ions Quantifier node. Normalization was performed such that the total sum of abundance values for each sample over all peptides was the same.

For Fig. 2g, the highly enriched proteins were selected according to the following criteria: log2 (fold change) > 1 and −log10 (p-value) > 1 for IP–MS and log2 (fold change) > 3, −log10 (p-value) > 1.25 for TurboID-MS.

Pdzd8-v5-TurboID knock-in cell (mouse Neuro2a) were grown in T75 (75 cm2) cell culture flask. One flask per each triplicate samples were prepared for MS analysis. The cells were then treated with biotin (50 μM) in complete DMEM medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The labeled cells were washed three times with cold DPBS 30 min after the in situ biotinylation, following next cell lysis. The cells were lysed with 750 μl of 1× TBS (25 mM Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.2) containing 2% SDS and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail. Lysates were clarified by ultrasonication (Bioruptor, diagenode) to physically break down nucleic acid such as DNA for 5 min three times with iced water bath.

The 4 ml of cold acetone were added to the lysates and incubated at −20 °C for at least 2 h to 16 h. After first precipitation with acetone, the samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was gently discarded. To completely reconstitute all proteins, samples were incubated with cooled 10% TBS/90% acetone at −20 °C for at least 2 –16 h. The samples were centrifuged at at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was gently discarded. The pellets were reconstituted with 500 μl of 8 M urea containing 50 mM ABC, followed by measuring protein concentration using BCA assay. Denaturation was performed at 650 rpm for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were reduced by reducing agent, 10 mM DTT and alkylated with 40 mM IAA at 650 rpm for 1 h at 37 °C, respectively. The. Samples were diluted 8-fold with 50 mM ABC containing 1 mM CaCl2. Samples were digested with (50:1 w/w) trypsin at 650 rpm for at least 6–18 h at 37 °C. Insoluble fractions were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The 150 μl of Streptavidin magnetic beads were firstly washed with 1× TBS containing 2 M urea four times and then added to the digested solution. The binding with the beads were for 1 h room temperature, followed by washing the beads two times with 50 mM ABC containing 2 M urea. The washed beads were washed with pure water compatible with LC–MS and transferred to new protein lobind tubes (Eppendorf). For elution of biotinylated peptides from the beads, 150 μl of elution solution (80% ACN, 20% pure water, 0.2% TFA, and 0.1% formic acid) were incubated at 60 °C three times repeatedly. Total elution fractions were completely dried using a speedvac. The resulting peptides were analyzed by Q Exactive Plus orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. To separate the peptide mixture, we used a C18 reverse-phase HPLC column (500 mm × 75 μm ID) using an acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid gradient from 4 to 32.5% for 120 min at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. For MS/MS analysis, the precursor ion scan MS spectra (m/z 400–2000) were acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 400 with an internal lock mass. The 15 most intensive ions were isolated and fragmented by High-energy collision induced dissociation (HCD).

All MS/MS samples were analyzed using the Sequest Sorcerer platform (Sagen-N Research, San Jose, CA, USA Sequest was set up to search the Mus musculus protein sequence database (86320 entries, UniProt, http://www.uniprot.org/) assuming the digestion enzyme stricttrypsin. Sequest was searched with a fragment ion mass tolerance of 1.00 Da and a parent ion tolerance of 10.0 ppm. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was specified in Sequest as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine, acetyl of the n-terminus, phospho of serine, threonine and tyrosine and biotin of lysine were specified in Sequest as variable modifications. Scaffold (Version 4.11.0, Proteome Software Inc., Portland, OR, USA) was used to validate MS/MS-based peptide and protein identifications. Peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 95.0% probability by the Scaffold Local FDR algorithm. Protein identifications were accepted if they could be established at greater than 99.0% probability and contained at least 2 identified peptide. Protein probabilities were assigned by the Protein Prophet algorithm66. Proteins that contained similar peptides and could not be differentiated based on MS/MS analysis alone were grouped to satisfy the principles of parsimony. Proteins were annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms from the National Center of Biotechnology Information database (NCBI; downloaded November 1, 2019)67.

All statistical analyses were performed in Prism 10 (GraphPad Software).

Metrics details

Biogenesis of mitoribosomes requires dedicated chaperones, RNA-modifying enzymes, and GTPases, and defects in mitoribosome assembly lead to severe mitochondriopathies in humans. Here, we characterize late-step assembly states of the small mitoribosomal subunit (mtSSU) by combining genetic perturbation and mutagenesis analysis with biochemical and structural approaches. Isolation of native mtSSU biogenesis intermediates via a FLAG-tagged variant of the GTPase MTG3 reveals three distinct assembly states, which show how factors cooperate to mature the 12S rRNA. In addition, we observe four distinct primed initiation mtSSU states with an incompletely matured rRNA, suggesting that biogenesis and translation initiation are not mutually exclusive processes but can occur simultaneously. Together, these results provide insights into mtSSU biogenesis and suggest a functional coupling between ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation in human mitochondria.

Ribosomes are large macromolecular RNA-protein complexes that synthesize proteins in a highly efficient and accurate manner. Human cells contain ribosomes in the cytosol, but also within mitochondria, where they synthesize the essential core subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. Defective mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) lead to OXPHOS deficiency and thus to a decline in cellular energy production, ultimately leading to severe mitochondrial disorders (mitochondriopathies)1. To form functional ribosomes, the assistance of auxiliary factors is required that mediate RNA processing, modification and folding, recruit and guide ribosomal proteins, and that facilitate molecular switches by releasing other factors. Mitoribosomes and their assembly factors are evolutionarily related to the prokaryotic translation system. However, their structures and assembly pathways differ substantially2,3,4,5. The 55S human mitoribosome has a higher protein and reduced RNA content compared to its bacterial counterpart. It is composed of a 39S large subunit (mtLSU) containing the 16S rRNA, tRNAVal and 52 proteins (MRPs), and a 28S small subunit (mtSSU) comprising the 12S rRNA and 30 MRPs. While all MRPs are encoded in the nucleus, synthesized in the cytosol and imported into mitochondria, the rRNA is encoded by the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA), transcribed as part of a polycistronic transcript and processed by mitochondrial RNase P and Z6,7,8,9. Due to these differences in composition and its dual genetic nature, mitoribosomes follow different biogenesis routes by forming protein-only submodules during early assembly, which are RNA-independent5. Later assembly steps ensure the proper folding of critical regions at the subunit interface, such as the peptidyltransferase center (PTC) and the decoding center (DC). These steps depend on biogenesis factors including RNA modifying enzymes like methyltransferases, helicases, chaperones and a conserved group of GTPases10. In particular, PTC folding depends on MRM2, MTERF4-NSUN4 and the GTPases GTPBP5, −6, −7, and −10, as recently revealed by high-resolution cryo-EM structures11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18. Similarly, mtSSU maturation requires MCAT, mtRBFA, the methyltransferases METTL17, -15 and TFB1M, and the GTPases ERAL1 and MTG319,20.

Loss of MTG3 (also called NOA1 or C4ORF14) causes mitochondrial translation deficiency in different model systems; embryonic lethality in mice and reduced cell viability in isolated MEFs suggest a crucial role of MTG3 in mitoribosome assembly, however the molecular consequences of MTG3 ablation have remained to be addressed21,22. Initial studies have shown that MTG3 interacts specifically with the mtSSU and not with the mtLSU or 55S, indicating a function during mtSSU assembly, similar to its bacterial homolog YqeH10,22. A previous study has shown that multiple mutations within the GTPase domain impair the ability of MTG3 to bind mtSSU particles, thus indicating the requirement of GTP-binding or -hydrolysis for mtSSU biogenesis22. Recent structural data have revealed its binding site at the subunit interface of the maturing mtSSU and suggest that MTG3 is bound very early in the assembly pathway, when the head is still immature20. The release of MTG3 from the mtSSU has been suggested to occur prior to binding of mS38 and mtRBFA20. However, the precise role of MTG3 during mtSSU biogenesis and how its release from the maturing subunit is triggered remain unknown.

Here, we combine genetic perturbation with biochemical and structural analyses to elucidate the role of MTG3 during mtSSU biogenesis. We show that loss of MTG3 leads to a substantial decrease in mitochondrial translation due to a disturbed mtSSU assembly. Surprisingly, immunoprecipitation experiments of MTG3-containing mtSSU complexes reveal the co-isolation of translation initiation factors. Cryo-EM structures of MTG3-bound mtSSU particles show that MTG3 remains bound to late maturing particles and even to initiation complexes via its N-terminal domain (NTD), preventing the docking of an rRNA helix (h44) and therefore subunit joining. Taken together, these data suggest that MTG3 may act as a quality control factor that couples late mtSSU maturation with the formation of primed translation initiation complexes.

To study the role of MTG3 in mitoribosome biogenesis, we generated MTG3 knockout cell lines using CRISPR/Cas9 technology with guide RNAs targeting its first exon. Two knockout clones were isolated for which MTG3 is not detectable via western blotting (Fig. 1a). Genomic DNA sequencing shows that both clones contain premature stop codons, leading to truncated and presumably unstable variants of MTG3 (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1a). As both clones show a similar behavior, we proceeded with only one of them for further downstream approaches. The loss of MTG3 significantly affects cell growth and is accompanied by rapid acidification of the media even with high-glucose, indicating a mitochondrial dysfunction (Fig. 1c). Indeed, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) is strongly reduced in Mtg3−/− while extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) is elevated (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In agreement with decreased OXPHOS capacity we observed reduced in gel activity for respiratory chain complexes I and IV (Supplementary Fig. 1c). To understand the reason of the OXPHOS deficiency, we monitored mitochondrial translation by [35S]Methionine incorporation into newly synthesized mtDNA-encoded proteins, which is strongly impaired, but not completely abolished (Fig. 1d). Mitochondrial protein synthesis is restored upon expression of a FLAG-tagged variant of MTG3 in the knockout background, excluding possible off-target effects in the knockout cell line and confirming that tagged MTG3 is physiologically functional (Fig. 1d). To dissect the underlying basis of this translation defect, we analyzed the protein steady state levels of multiple nucleus-encoded components of the mitochondrial gene expression machinery, in particular ribosomal proteins, assembly- and translation factors (Fig. 1e, f). Interestingly, we observe a differential reduction in multiple MRPs of the mtSSU. The mt-rRNA-dependent MRPs uS14m and uS15m and the late binding protein mS37 are drastically decreased to 20–30%, whereas other proteins remain more stable, indicating a role of MTG3 in late maturation steps. In contrast, assembly factors such as the methyltransferases TFB1M and NSUN4 or the GTPase ERAL1 are slightly elevated. A notable exception is mtRBFA, which is slightly reduced. Components of the mtLSU are not affected or slightly increased, consistent with a role of MTG3 in mtSSU- but not mtLSU biogenesis. In agreement with the reduced protein steady state levels of mtSSU MRPs, we observe a significant reduction of 12S mt-rRNA steady state level to 40%, whereas the 16S mt-rRNA remains stable (Fig. 1g, h). The level of mRNA encoding for COX1 (MT-CO1) does not differ, suggesting that the observed defect in mitochondrial translation is not caused by a decrease in mitochondrial transcripts. To investigate the consequences of MTG3 ablation on mtSSU biogenesis in more detail, we separated mitoribosomal complexes from both wildtype and Mtg3−/− cells by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Fig. 1i). MTG3 is only detectable in less dense (2-5) and in mtSSU-corresponding fractions (6/7) in the wildtype sample, consistent with a role of MTG3 during mtSSU biogenesis as previously suggested22. In agreement with the reduction in de novo mitochondrial translation, we observe a strong decrease in assembled 55S mitoribosomes in fraction 11 when comparing Mtg3−/− to the wildtype sample. The mtSSU in fractions 6/7 is also drastically reduced, as monitored with individual mtSSU components. However, mtSSU proteins such as mS40 or mS27 are unaffected in less dense fractions 2 to 4, indicating that intermediate complexes of the mtSSU can be stably formed independently of MTG3. Interestingly, assembly factors ERAL1 and TFB1M remain detectable or are slightly increased in mtSSU-corresponding fractions 6/7 although the overall level of mtSSU is decreased, indicating a stalling in the mtSSU assembly pathway. In contrast, mtRBFA is significantly decreased in fraction 6/7, suggesting that MTG3 action is required upstream of mtRBFA. Components of the mtLSU accumulate in fractions 8/9, as they cannot proceed to form functional 55S mitoribosomes due to the absence of sufficient matured mtSSU in Mtg3−/−. In conclusion, MTG3 ablation affects mtSSU biogenesis, leading to a reduced pool of translationally active mitoribosomes.

a Confirmation of MTG3 knock out in two cell lines generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Isolated mitochondria (10 µg) from wildtype and Mtg3−/− cell lines (cl.1 and cl.2) were analyzed by western blotting with antibodies as indicated. Similar results were obtained in n ≥ 3 biologically independent experiments. b Schematic representation of the genomic locus of the generated Mtg3−/− cell line (cl.1) in comparison to the wild type sequence. The guide RNA targets exon 1 of the MTG3 gene, which encodes for a 648 aa protein. A two bp deletion and a four bp insertion in the two alleles of the Mtg3−/− cl.1 lead to premature stop codons and truncated proteins (65 aa). c Ablation of MTG3 reduces growth rate. Equal amounts of wild type and Mtg3−/− cells were seeded in three biologically independent experiments on day 0 and counted at the indicated time points (n = 3; mean ± SEM). Significance was calculated by two-sample one-tailed Student's t-test and defined as **p ≤ 0.01. d Translation of mtDNA-encoded proteins is disturbed upon loss of MTG3. Mitochondrial translation in wild type, Mtg3−/− and Mtg3−/− cells inducibly expressing MTG3FLAG was analyzed via [35S]Methionine de novo incorporation and subsequently visualized via autoradiography and with indicated antibodies. The signal in Mtg3−/− using MTG3 antibody represents unspecific binding of the antibody in whole cell lysates as we confirmed several times the loss of MTG3 in isolated mitochondria. Similar results were obtained in n ≥ 3 biologically independent experiments. e, f MTG3 loss leads to reduced mtSSU MRP level. Steady state analysis of MRPs, assembly factors, and translation-related proteins in the Mtg3−/− cells in comparison to wild type cells. Isolated mitochondria were analyzed via western blotting with indicated antibodies (e) and protein levels in Mtg3−/− were quantified relative to wild type control (f). SDHA was used as a loading control. Statistical analysis was performed as two-sample one-tailed Student's t-test with n ≥ 3 biologically independent samples shown as mean ± SEM (individual data points are shown as circles). Significance was defined as *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, ***p ≤ 0.001. g, h Effect of MTG3 loss on rRNA and mRNA stability. g RNA isolated from Mtg3−/− and wild type cells was subjected to northern blotting using indicated probes (MT-RNR1: 12S rRNA; MT-RNR2: 16S rRNA; MT-CO1: mRNA encoding for COX1). 18S-rRNA was used as loading control. h Quantification of RNA signals in Mtg3−/− from (g) relative to wild type signals. Statistical analysis was performed as two-sample one-tailed Student's t-test with n = 3 biologically independent samples shown as mean ± SEM (individual data points are shown as circles). Significance was defined as ***p ≤ 0.001. i mtSSU and monosome levels are severely reduced in Mtg3−/− cells. Isolated mitoplasts (500 µg) were lysed and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Fractions (1-16) were collected and analyzed via western blotting with antibodies against MRPs and assembly factors as indicated. Input = 10% of total. Similar results were obtained in n ≥ 3 biologically independent experiments.

To reveal the precise role of MTG3 during mtSSU biogenesis, we inducibly expressed a FLAG tagged variant of MTG3 in HEK293 cells and purified endogenous MTG3-containing complexes via MTG3FLAG-co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2a). Under the chosen conditions, all tested MRPs of the mtSSU co-purified via MTG3 while components of the mtLSU are not detectable, validating the assumption that MTG3 only associates with mtSSU complexes, but not with the mtLSU or the 55S mitoribosome (Fig. 2a). ERAL1 and TFB1M, but not NSUN4 co-purify with MTG3-containing mtSSU particles, suggesting that MTG3 is part of an assembly intermediate with these and other factors, consistent with previous reports20. A reciprocal experiment using ERAL1FLAG in an Eral1−/− background as a bait likewise results in the co-isolation of MTG3 and TFB1M, thus supporting this hypothesis (Supplementary Fig. 1e). In contrast to previous observations, however, MTG3 also associates with factors characteristic of late mtSSU biogenesis steps. For example, mtRBFA, one of the final mtSSU assembly factors19, can be also co-purified with MTG3. Likewise, mS37, which is the last MRP that joins the maturing mtSSU19, is also detectable, although to a slightly lesser extent compared to other mtSSU constituents. This suggests that MTG3 remains bound to very late assembly states of the mtSSU.

a MTG3FLAG co-isolates mtSSU MRPs and several mtSSU assembly factors. FLAG-immunoprecipitation was performed with lysed mitochondria from HEK293 wild type (WT) cells and a stable HEK293 cell line inducibly expressing MTG3FLAG, and subsequently analyzed via western blotting with indicated antibodies (total = 3%, eluate = 100%). Similar results were obtained in n ≥ 3 biologically independent experiments. b Schematic depiction of the mature 12S rRNA secondary structure.

(e, g, i) Close-up views of the foot region in each state, showing the densities for MTG3 (state A, map A3), or MTG3NTD and h44 with altered trajectory (state B-C, 15 Å low-pass filtered maps B1 and C1). Mature h44 is depicted by red dashed lines and would clash with MTG3 and MTG3NTD.

To further investigate the role of MTG3 during late maturation of the mtSSU, we analyzed the endogenous MTG3-containing ribosomal complexes isolated via co-immunoprecipitation with MTG3FLAG as the bait by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). After extensive particle classification, we obtained reconstructions for three distinct mtSSU assembly intermediates with immaturely folded 12S rRNA (States A-C) at overall resolutions ranging from 3.1 to 3.4 Å (Fig. 2b, c Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, Supplementary Table 1).

State A represents the earliest intermediate exhibiting the highest degree of immaturely folded rRNA helices in the 12S rRNA (Fig. 2b, d). Compared to the mature mtSSU2, we observe three additional densities which could be unambiguously assigned as assembly factors MTG3, TFB1M and mtRBFA, together constituting a combination of assembly factors which has not been described to date. Consistent with recently reported structural data20, MTG3 consists of a C-terminal globular GTPase domain, which resides on the face of the 12S rRNA, and a N-terminal domain (NTD), which occupies the binding site of an extended lasso structure in the mature h44 (1501-1549)19,20 (Fig. 2c, e). MTG3 binding to the mtSSU thus prevents folding of h44 into its mature state via its globular domain as well as its NTD (Supplementary Fig. 4a). TFB1M binds next to MTG3 and assists in maturation of the DC by carrying out a di-methylation reaction in h4523. The rRNA adopts a premature conformation in this state, with a completely disordered h44 (1481-1572), partially disordered h45, and a misplaced h24 in the DC due to interactions with TFB1M and mtRBFA (Fig. 2b, d).

State B and C represent later assembly intermediates in which the 12S rRNA is partially matured (Fig. 2f–i). They both do not show densities for the MTG3 globular domain or TFB1M, but contain mtRBFA and an additional density, which corresponds to the methyltransferase METTL15 (Fig. 2c). mtRBFA has previously been shown to adopt two different states on the mtSSU, termed “in” and “out”19. While states A and B contain mtRBFA in the “in” conformation, it adopts the “out” conformation in state C, which has been reported to be a hallmark of very late-stage assembly steps19. METTL15 has been shown to interact with h24 and h44 to methylate residue C1486 in h4424 (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Consistent with this, h24 and the region of h44 containing C1486 are moved towards METTL15 compared to their locations in the mature mtSSU (Fig. 2f, h, Supplementary Fig. 4b). In both state B and C, h18 and h27 adopt a mature conformation and mS38 is present. Although we do not observe density for the MTG3 globular domain in these states, the density is consistent with the NTD of MTG3 remaining associated with the mtSSU in the h44 binding site. Consistent with this, the trajectory of h44 faces away from the foot of the mtSSU and the lasso region (1501-1549) appears absent (Fig. 2c, g, i, Supplementary Fig. 4a). These observations suggest that MTG3 may remain associated to the mtSSU even during late assembly steps via its NTD, thereby preventing docking of h44 and in turn binding of the mtLSU.

A recent study provided structural snapshots of MTG3 bound to the mtSSU together with the assembly factors TFB1M, MCAT, METTL17, and ERAL120 (Fig. 3a, b). While TFB1M and MTG3 facilitate the maturation of h27, h44, and h45 in the body, MCAT and METTL17 are thought to mature the rRNA in the head. ERAL1 is located at the interface between head and body, binding the 3'end of the 12S mt-rRNA and recruiting the bS21m–uS11m–h23 module. Recruitment of mtRBFA and docking of the bS21m-uS11m-h23 module causes platform compaction and was suggested to occur after MTG3 dissociation and subsequent h44 docking. Recruitment of this module further induces di-methylation of two residues in the hairpin loop in h45 (A1583/A1584) by TFB1M.

The 12S rRNA and MRPs are indicated as transparent surface.

The three states we observe differ from previously reported states both in their composition and their rRNA maturation states (Fig. 3a). In state A, the head is already fully matured but METTL17 and MCAT are not present (Fig. 3b). In addition, ERAL1 is replaced by mtRBFA(in) and the bS21m–uS11m–h23 module, causing a rotation of the head by 25 Å (Fig. 3b). This also moves the NTD of TFB1M away from the bS21m-uS11m-h23 module to a location that differs from a previously reported late assembly intermediate containing mtRBFA(in) and TFB1M19 (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Fig. 5a). In addition, we observe a density that appears to correspond to a flexible helix at the N-terminus of TFB1M (Fig. 3c). Close to this region, METTL17 was previously observed to form contacts with h44 together with the flexible helix of TFB1M (Supplementary Fig. 5c). In contrast, METTL17 is absent in state A and TFB1M may instead form contacts with the partially disordered h18 (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 5c). Within the rRNA, h44 is disordered to a larger extent than previously observed and does not form any contacts with TFB1M or h45 (Supplementary Fig. 5b). In addition, h18 in the shoulder region is partially disordered and oriented towards TFB1M19,20 (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 5c), and h27 is in its mature conformation, although it has been predicted that this would lead to clashes with MTG3 and TFB1M (Supplementary Fig. 5d). This is possible because both assembly factors adopt distinct arrangements in state A compared to previous structures. In the observed conformation, MTG3 would clash with mS38, which locks h27 and h44 in their final conformation in the mature mtSSU, but mS38 is not present in our state A and replaced by interactions between TFB1M, MTG3, and the rRNA helices. Finally, h27 is in its mature conformation in state A (Supplementary Fig. 5d), which is a prerequisite for bS21m-uS11m-h23-module recruitment, platform compaction and TFB1M-NTD re-orientation. This is in contrast to the previous structure of a MTG3- and TFB1M-bound intermediate, in which h27 adopts a more immature conformation (Supplementary Fig. 5d) and which suggested that platform compaction and TFB1M catalytic activity is precluded by MTG3-bound h27 until h44 docking has occurred. Taken together, state A differs substantially from previously reported MTG3-containing mtSSU intermediates as the rRNA fold in the head and platform more closely resembles later stages of mtSSU maturation19, even though h44 docking and h18 maturation has not yet occurred.

We also observed differences in MTG3 compared to previously reported data. The NTD of MTG3 is composed of the mS27-interacting peptide (residues: 69-79) which anchors the NTD to the mitoribosome followed by a long α-helix sitting on the base of the platform (residues: 87-115) (Supplementary Fig. 5e). The NTD is connected via a linker to a helical insertion (residues: 179-195) at the GTPase domain of MTG3. This helical insertion was previously observed to partially occupy the empty GTP-binding site, preventing switch I loop from entering a GTP-binding competent conformation. Based on the bacterial homolog YqeH, it has been suggested that the helical insertion and switch I loop rearrange during the GTPase cycle, which triggers h27 and h44 maturation21,25. In state A, the long α-helix and the helical insertion of MTG3 are disordered and their previously observed position is occupied by uS15m (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 5e). In contrast to previous MTG3-bound structures, the N-terminal helix of uS15m is ordered and occupies the position of the long α-helix (Fig. 3d). In this conformation of MTG3, the nucleotide-binding site is accessible and the switch I loop may adopt a conformation competent for GTP-binding. In agreement with this, we observe a density in the nucleotide binding pocket which would be consistent with a bound nucleotide (Fig. 3d, Supplementary Fig. 5f)25. However, we refrained from modeling a ligand due to the limited resolution of the map in this region. Taken together, these data indicate that MTG3 can adopt multiple conformations while bound to the mtSSU and that its GTP-bound conformation is compatible with mature folding of h27 and binding of uS15m. This links MTG3 GTPase function to docking of its own NTD into the foot region and re-organization of rRNA content, but also to re-orientation of an MRP.

The structural data also provide insights into the role of METTL15 during mtSSU biogenesis. METTL15 interacts with h44 to methylate m4C1486, but this residue is ~40 Å away from its catalytic center in its mature conformation in state C (Supplementary Fig. 4b), resembling a previously described post-catalytic state19. In contrast, while the overall fold of the rRNA in states B and C resembles previously observed conformations, the segment containing m4C1486 appears less well ordered in state B, suggesting that it may represent an intermediate state previously not observed (Fig. 3e-f, Supplementary Fig. 4b).

Previous studies have suggested that METTL15 plays an important structural role during mtSSU biogenesis in addition to its catalytic activity as a methyltransferase19. Consistent with this previous report, we observe METTL15 together with mtRBFA in its “out” conformation (mtRBFA(out)) in state C (METTL15C). By contrast, state B contains mtRBFA in its “in” conformation together with METTL15B, a combination that has not been previously described (Fig. 3a, e). This is possible because a mitochondria-specific extension of METTL15, which would clash with mtRBFA(in), is disordered in METTL15B (Fig. 3g, Supplementary Fig. 4b). In previous mtRBFA(in) containing structures, its C-terminal extension (mtRBFA-CTE) was observed to be disordered. By contrast, we observe a density at the interface to METTL15B, which is consistent with the presence of the mtRBFA-CTE (Fig. 3g). This suggests that in state B, the mitochondrial specific extension of METTL15 is disordered, but folds upon m4C1486 methylation and maturation of this part of h44 upon transition to state C, thereby inducing a conformational switch of mtRBFA from “in” to “out”. The mtRBFA(in) conformation has been associated with earlier mtSSU intermediates than mtRBFA(out), and the transition from “in” to “out” was suggested to cause the head to rotate closer to its mature position, constituting a checkpoint in the mtSSU assembly pathway19. Our structural data suggest how conformational changes of METTL15 and mtRBFA may be coupled, and thus provide a molecular rationale for this checkpoint.

In all previously reported METTL15 and mtRBFA containing states19,20 the lasso of h44 adopts its mature conformation. It has thus been suggested that these two factors are hallmarks of the final steps of mtSSU maturation, and are released by mS37 as well as the initiation factor mtIF3 during the transition from assembly to initiation19. However, state B and C both contain a disordered h44 lasso, which is not yet docked into the foot region. Instead, its location is occupied by the MTG3NTD (Fig. 2g, i, Supplementary Fig. 4a). This suggests that docking of h44 and MTG3 dissociation is not necessarily required for late stage mtSSU assembly steps, and that initiation complex assembly could potentially commence already prior to completed mtSSU maturation.

Consistent with a potential link between mtSSU assembly and initiation complex formation, we noticed accumulation of mtSSU initiation factors, namely mtIF2 and mtIF3, together with mtSSU proteins during immunoprecipitation via FLAG-tagged MTG3 (Fig. 2a). Reciprocally, using FLAG-tagged mtIF3 to isolate native mtSSU complexes accumulated mtIF2 as well as the assembly factors mtRBFA and MTG3 (Fig. 4a). Thus, our data suggest that IC intermediates co-purify with the assembly factor MTG3 and vice versa. In agreement with this, particle classifications showed that a substantial proportion of mtSSU particles in our cryo-EM dataset indeed had translation initiation factors bound (Supplementary Fig. 2). This enabled us to resolve four distinct (pre-) translation initiation complexes ((P)-IC) (states D-G) at overall resolutions ranging from 3.1 to 3.6 Å (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, Supplementary Table 2).

a Western blot analysis of mitoribosome complexes co-purified via mtIF3FLAG. FLAG-immunoprecipitation was performed with lysed mitochondria from wild type cells and cells inducibly expressing mtIF3FLAG. Samples (total = 3%, eluate = 100%) were subsequently analyzed via western blotting with indicated antibodies. Similar results were obtained in n ≥ 3 biologically independent experiments. b Cryo-EM structures of the mtIF3-bound small mitoribosomal subunit (mtSSU) (state D), mtIF2- and mtIF3-bound mtSSU (state E), mtIF2-bound mtSSU (state F), and mtIF2-, mRNA- and fMet-tRNAMet-bound mtSSU (state G). The 12S rRNA and indicated initiation factors are shown as cartoon and the remaining mitoribosomal proteins (MRPs) are indicated as white transparent surface. 12S rRNA: red, mtIF3: yellow, mtIF2: blue, fMet-tRNAMet: light yellow, mS37: beige. c Zoomed-in view of the codon-anticodon interaction in state G.

The trajectory of the mRNA is shown by superimposing with a known IC state (7PO219;) and depicted as transparent cartoon. d–g Views of the foot region in each state, showing the densities for MTG3NTD and for h44 from the 15 Å low-pass filtered maps D1-G1. Mature h44 is depicted by red dashed lines and would clash with MTGNTD.

State D resembles a previously described structure of the PIC with mtIF3 bound19. State E additionally contains mtIF2, thus resembling another recently reported PIC26. State F represents a so-far undescribed PIC state that contains only mtIF2. State G contains mtIF2 and fMet-tRNAMet19. In this state, we observe clear density for the codon-anticodon interaction, consistent with a published IC state primed for translation initiation (Fig. 4c)19. In all four (P-)IC states, most of the mt-rRNA is matured and mtRBFA is replaced by mS37, consistent with previous data (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 3). However, h44 remains immature in all PICs, similar to the assembly states B and C, with the trajectory of the lasso region protruding from the complex instead of docking into the foot region. In addition, the foot region shows density which is most consistent with the presence of the MTG3NTD (Fig. 4d–g, Supplementary Table 3). This suggests that h44 maturation is not required to start IC formation and that translation initiation factors can be recruited before mtSSU maturation is finalized. However, the association of MTG3 during first steps of IC formation prevents docking of h44 and thus mtLSU recruitment to the mtSSU.

The N-terminal region of MTG3 displaces h44 from its mature conformation and is highly conserved across vertebrates (Supplementary Fig. 6a)20. Our data indicate that it may remain stably bound to the mtSSU, even when mS38 binds and the globular domain of MTG3 is displaced (Fig. 2g, i, Fig. 4d–g, Supplementary Table 3). To further dissect the impact of this domain on MTG3 function, we expressed a FLAG-tagged mutant variant of MTG3 lacking the highly conserved 10 aa (69-83) which interact with mS27 and displace h44 (ΔN-MTG3FLAG) in the Mtg3−/− cell line (Supplementary Fig. 6a). Deletion of these 10 aa does not interfere with the import of ΔN-MTG3 into mitochondria, as the upstream N-terminal pre-sequence remains preserved and ΔN-MTG3FLAG is comparably detectable in isolated mitochondria like the wildtype variant of MTG3FLAG.

To dissect the role of this N-terminal helix, we monitored mitochondrial translation by [35S]Methionine de novo synthesis in Mtg3−/− expressing MTG3FLAG wildtype or ΔN-MTG3FLAG mutant. Although mitochondrial translation seems to be slightly increased upon ΔN-MTG3FLAG expression in comparison to the full knockout, in contrast to full-length MTG3, the ΔN-MTG3FLAG can only partially restore mitochondrial translation (Fig. 5a). Interestingly, we did not observe a uniform restored translation pattern. While translation of e.g., ATP6 and ATP8 seems to be completely rescued in the mutant cell line, the levels of newly synthesized COX1 and corresponding protein steady state are only marginally increased in comparison to the full knockout, but by far not restored as by expressing MTG3FLAG. This indicates that the N-terminal region of MTG3 is essential for its full functionality. This is further supported by the fact that the mutated ΔN-MTG3FLAG cannot co-immunoisolate any mtSSU proteins, assembly factors or translation initiation factors, indicating that the N-terminal region is responsible for stable binding of MTG3 to the mtSSU (Fig. 5b). However, as indicated by the partially restored translation phenotype, translationally active mitoribosomes must be formed in Mtg3−/−+ΔN-MTG3FLAG cells.

a ΔN-MTG3FLAG lacking 10 conserved aa in the N-terminus can only partially restore mitochondrial translation. Translation of mtDNA-encoded proteins in wild type, Mtg3−/− and Mtg3−/− cell lines expressing full length (MTG3FLAG) or mutated MTG3 (ΔN-MTG3FLAG), respectively, were analyzed using [35S]Methionine de novo incorporation and visualized via autoradiography and western blotting. GAPDH was used as a loading control. Similar results were obtained in n ≥ 3 biologically independent experiments. b ΔN-MTG3FLAG does not co-purify any MRPs. FLAG-immunoprecipitation was performed with wild type cells, wild type cells expressing MTG3FLAG and Mtg3−/− cells expressing MTG3FLAG or ΔN-MTG3FLAG, respectively. Samples were analyzed using western blotting and antibodies as indicated (total = 3%, eluate = 100%). Similar results were obtained in n ≥ 3 biologically independent experiments. c, d Monosome level can be restored upon ΔN-MTG3FLAG expression. Mitoplasts (500 µg) were isolated from wild type, Mtg3−/− and Mtg3−/− cell lines expressing full length (MTG3FLAG) or ΔN-MTG3FLAG, respectively. Mitoribosomal complexes were separated via sucrose density gradient centrifugation and collected fractions (1-16) were analyzed via western blotting with indicated antibodies against MRPs and assembly factors (c) or northern blotting with probes against 12S rRNA (MT-RNR1) and 16S rRNA (MT-RNR2) (d). Similar results were obtained in n ≥ 3 biologically independent experiments. e Abundance of mt-mRNAs bound to monosomes is similar in the Mtg3−/− + ΔN-MTG3FLAG cell line in comparison to wild type MTG3FLAG. Fraction 11 from sucrose gradients from (c) were used to isolate RNA and perform NanoString analysis. Level of mt-mRNAs were normalized to 16S-rRNA and RNA abundance bound to monosomes in the Mtg3−/− + ΔN-MTG3FLAG cell line was calculated relative to Mtg3−/− + MTG3FLAG cell line (n = 3 biologically independent samples shown as mean ± SEM; individual data points are shown as circles). Statistical analysis was performed as two-sample one-tailed Student's t-test. Significance was defined as *p ≤ 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01.

Interestingly, sucrose gradient analysis revealed similar levels of 55S mitoribosomes in fraction 11 comparing Mtg3−/−+MTG3FLAG and Mtg3−/−+ΔN-MTG3FLAG, but different levels of assembled mtSSU in fractions 6/7 (Fig. 5c, d). While expressing MTG3FLAG in Mtg3−/− completely rescues the mtSSU assembly defect and leads to comparable levels of assembled mtSSU as the wildtype control, ΔN-MTG3FLAG appears incapable of restoring the pool of assembled mtSSU. In contrast, mtSSU assembly intermediates in the lower dense fractions seem to accumulate in the ΔN-MTG3FLAG-expressing cell line. The relative amount of assembly factors such as ERAL1, TFB1M, and mtRBFA co-migrating with the mtSSU is increased, considering the decreased amount of mtSSUs in fraction 6/7 in the ΔN-MTG3FLAG cell line. This suggests that the majority of mtSSU in ΔN-MTG3FLAG-expressing cells represent immature biogenesis intermediates. Nevertheless, some assembled mtSSUs seem to be able to bind the mtLSU and are thus directly transferred to the monosome pool in fraction 11, but the mitochondrial translation assay indicates that those particles are not as active as when expressing MTG3FLAG wildtype. Thus, the stable binding of MTG3 to the mtSSU during late maturation steps might ensure quality control steps and prevent the association of immature mtSSU to the mtLSU. However, as the mutant variant is not able to stably interact with the mtSSU to prevent subunit joining, some 55S particles might be formed containing defective mtSSU.

To elaborate the nature of these particles further, we asked whether they have mt-mRNA bound and whether MTG3 plays an active role in mt-mRNA loading during translation initiation. Thus, we measured the abundance of mt-mRNAs in fraction 11 relative to the 16S mt-rRNA and did not observe a strong reduction of mitoribosome-associated mt-mRNAs (Fig. 5e, Supplementary Fig. 6b). In fact, some mt-mRNAs, including MTCO1, appear to be elevated in Mtg3−/−+ΔN-MTG3FLAG compared to Mtg3−/−+MTG3FLAG cells, which might indicate a compensatory mechanism to counteract the inefficient translation of COX1. Nevertheless, the overall mt-mRNA loading does not seem to be affected, suggesting that the deletion in the NTD of MTG3 and subsequently the potential loss of bound MTG3 in the late-maturation steps does not affect the mt-mRNA binding to the mtSSU.

In order to study the role of the GTPase domain of MTG3 during mtSSU maturation similar mutational analyses were performed. A mutant variant of MTG3 with a glycine to proline substitution (G499P) in the G3 motif (switch II) was expressed in the Mtg3−/− background (MTG3-G499PFLAG). The G3 motif interacts with the γ-phosphate of a bound GTP and the G499 was shown to be essential for GTP hydrolysis in other GTPases10,27,28. Indeed, the MTG3-G499PFLAG cannot restore mitochondrial translation (Supplementary Fig. 6c), indicating that GTPase activity is abolished and mtSSU biogenesis impaired. As the ΔN-MTG3FLAG mutant was at least partially able to restore translation (Fig. 5a), the GTPase domain seems to be more relevant for the role of MTG3 in maturing the mtSSU than the NTD. To further compare and dissect the roles of these two domains, mitoribosome assembly was investigated by sucrose gradient centrifugation with cell lines expressing the mutated variants of MTG3 in comparison to Mtg3−/− and Mtg3−/−+MTG3FLAG rescue (Supplementary Fig. 6d). The MTG3-G499PFLAG mutant reveals mtSSU levels in fractions 6/7 and monosomes in fraction 11 comparable to those of Mtg3−/−, explaining the inability to restore mitochondrial translation. In contrast to the ΔN-MTG3FLAG mutant, almost no monosomes are formed in MTG3-G499PFLAG mutant. FLAG-immunoprecipitation reveals that the MTG3-G499PFLAG can co-isolate mtSSU particles, however it seems that these only resemble early-stage mtSSU intermediates (Supplementary Fig. 6e). While early-binding proteins such as mS27, uS17m and mS40 as well as early assembly factors ERAL1 and TFB1M can be co-isolated, uS15m and the late-binding MRP mS37 as well as the assembly factor mtRBFA are absent in the elution fraction. This indicates that mtSSU biogenesis gets stalled at an early assembly step when the GTPase hydrolysis function of MTG3 is abolished. Taken together, these data suggest that the GTPase activity of MTG3 is essential for mtSSU assembly.

Our structural and biochemical data suggest that mtSSU assembly and translation initiation are two processes that do not stringently occur sequentially after each other, and allow us to deduce an alternative model of mtSSU biogenesis (Fig. 6). First, the assembly factors TFB1M, MTG3 and mtRBFA(in) associate with the mtSSU to facilitate maturation of h44, h45, h44-h45-linker and parts of h27 (Supplementary Table 3). The globular CTD of MTG3 then dissociates, but MTG3 remains associated with the mtSSU via its N-terminal region thereby preventing h44 maturation. This allows the MRP mS38 to be recruited in the next step. The late-step assembly protein METTL15 is then recruited, and its catalytic activity triggers the maturation of h24 and the h44-h45 linker, thereby inducing a conformational switch of mtRBFA from “in” to “out”. Upon dissociation of METTL15, mtRBFA(out) also dissociates from the mtSSU, which allows mS37 to bind at the same position, locking the head in its final rotation towards the body. Although h44 is still immature and MTG3 remains bound via its NTD, translation initiation factors can be recruited to this mtSSU assembly intermediate. From state F onwards, fMet-tRNAMet and mt-mRNA associate with the mtSSU generating state G, while h44 remains immature. After priming of the IC by codon-anticodon formation, MTG3 must be released to allow docking and maturation of h44 at the foot and subsequent binding of mtLSU. What triggers the dissociation of MTG3 remains to be addressed. Taken together, our data suggest a mitoribosome assembly and translation initiation pathway in which MTG3 is the last factor to be released from the mtSSU before the complete mitoribosome is formed.

Intermediate states of the mtSSU are depicted as surface and factors and rRNA content is colored as in Figs. 2–4. Models for mature mtSSU IC (PDB: 7PO219), mtLSU and mature IC (PDB: 6GAW53) have been reported previously.

Ribosome biogenesis is an energetically expensive process that requires multiple auxiliary factors to mediate rRNA and protein folding and to coordinate the sequential binding of ribosomal proteins. Especially late maturation steps require the assistance of quality control factors which facilitate and monitor the folding of critical regions including the PTC and the DC. Thus, multiple biogenesis factors bind to the intersubunit interface of the mtLSU and mtSSU and thus prevent immature subunit joining. It was assumed for a long time that ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation are separated processes that follow a single stringent route and occur sequentially after each other.

Using a combination of biochemical and structural analysis, we here show that the mtSSU biogenesis factor MTG3 plays a critical role during late-stage maturation of the mtSSU. We describe several previously unobserved mtSSU assembly intermediates, which provide molecular insights into the role of the biogenesis factors MTG3, METTL15, and mtRBFA. Surprisingly, we were not able to resolve an MTG3-bound mtSSU with associated ERAL1. The reason for this could be that such particles represent a minor fraction of the sample or due to flexibility of the GTPase ERAL1. The challenge of solving GTPases co-purified with assembling mitoribosomal subunits is a common phenomenon in the field14. Nevertheless, together with previous data, these structural snapshots enable us to propose a unified model for mtSSU maturation. In addition, we show that MTG3 can remain bound to the mtSSU via its NTD until the final maturation steps and even during initiation complex assembly. Surprisingly, our data suggest that the latter can commence before the rRNA, and in particular h44, is completely matured. This suggests the existence of several mtSSU biogenesis pathways and, for at least one of them, a coupling of mtSSU maturation and translation initiation by the action of MTG3, which may act as a quality control factor.

Our biochemical analysis of cells expressing mutant variants of MTG3 provides insights into the molecular function of this factor. In particular, the differential effects of mutations within the NTD and the GTPase domain suggest a potential dual role of MTG3 during mtSSU assembly and maturation: First, MTG3 is bound to the mtSSU with its N-terminus and the globular GTPase domain. GTP hydrolysis might lead to rearrangements in the mtSSU such as h27 maturation, allowing mS38 to bind and displace the globular domain of MTG3. The GTPase activity of MTG3 seems to be essential for continuing mtSSU maturation, as the MTG3-G499PFLAG is unable to form mature mtSSUs. The N-terminus of MTG3 remains stably bound to the mtSSU during late maturation steps and even during the formation of initiation complexes, potentially acting as a quality control mechanism, preventing docking of h44 and therefore premature mtLSU binding. The N-terminal region is not conserved in yeast or bacterial MTG3 homologs, but is highly conserved in other vertebrates, suggesting its function was newly acquired in the course of evolution. Once the mtSSU is matured and primed for translation initiation, the NTD-MTG3 needs to dissociate so that h44 can mature allowing the formation of intersubunit bridges to the mtLSU. Our data do not give insights into what triggers the dissociation of MTG3, we can only speculate that other, unidentified factors might be involved. In the ΔN-MTG3FLAG cell line, the globular GTPase domain can fulfill its function, so mtSSU maturation can continue and monosomes can be formed. However, without the N-terminus, MTG3 might dissociate after mS38 has displaced the globular domain, and cannot act as a quality control factor. Thus, immature mtSSU particles bypass this critical quality checkpoint leading to premature subunit joining and thus to the formation of translational inactive or less-active mitoribosomes.

The presence of a quality control check point for proper ribosome maturation coupled to translation initiation is reminiscent to the systems described in bacteria, the eukaryotic cytosol, and also in Trypanosoma brucei mitochondria. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms differ. In bacteria, IF2 as a GTPase has been discussed as a ribosome assembly factor acting as a chaperone during cold stress29,30. The initiator tRNA has been ascribed a direct role during late maturation steps by licensing RNases to perform the final processing steps of the bacterial 16S rRNA31. For cytosolic ribosomes, a translation-like cycle has been reported to monitor the integrity and the ability of the 40S SSU to bind translation factors and the 60S LSU forming 80S-like particles32. Final maturation, including the final processing of the rRNA, occurs within these 80S-like complexes. The recruitment of the mature 60S LSU to the immature 40S depends on eIF5B, a translation factor with GTPase activity akin to bacterial IF2. After maturation of the SSU, assembly factors are released and Rli1 dissociates the particles, releasing the mature subunits into the translating pool. These 80S-like ribosomes do not represent translation initiation intermediates as they lack initiator tRNA, mRNA and eIF2. In Trypanosoma brucei mitochondria, mtIF2 acts as a quality control factor monitoring the proper folding of the DC while other late assembly factors remain bound to the mtSSU33. Together with an mtIF3-like factor, mtIF2 interacts with elements of the DC and blocks the mRNA channel preventing mRNA binding and therefore the formation of a canonical initiation complex. In contrast, we report for human mitochondria an mtSSU complex with bound initiator tRNA, mRNA and mtIF2, but with immature h44 due to the association of MTG3NTD. Thus, our data suggest that MTG3 acts as a late quality control factor which remains to be bound until all elements for translation initiation are in place. The release of MTG3 then vacates the binding site of the h44 lasso region and thus licenses the primed initiation complex to enter the translating pool by establishing intersubunit bridges to the mtLSU.

A common principle in all systems seems to be that domains close to the 3' end, such as h44, are the last regions that are matured31,33,34,35. This also includes RNA modifications such as 12S methylation within h44 and h45 catalyzed by METTL15, NSUN4, and TFB1M23,24,36. However, the 12S mt-rRNA requires no further trimming of the 5' or 3' ends after its release from the polycistronic transcript by RNase P and—Z and its assembly with MRPs, which again is distinct from the maturation process described for bacterial and eukaryotic cytosolic SSU. The binding of MTG3 to IC particles might also indicate a function as a splitting factor that dissociates 55S complexes reminiscent to the dual function of GTPBP6, which is required for PTC maturation, but which can also actively dissociate 55S mitoribosomes11,27. However, overexpression of MTG3 has no negative impact on mitochondrial translation, which is in contrast to elevated levels of GTPBP6 and thus argues against a function as a ribosome dissociation factor.

In contrast to a previous report, which suggests the dissociation of MTG3 from the mtSSU prior to binding of mS38 and mtRBFA20, our data indicate that MTG3 remains bound via its NTD to the mtSSU during final maturation steps and even during IC formation. As alternative assembly pathways might occur especially during late assembly steps, these observations are not necessarily in conflict. While it cannot be excluded that ICs with immature rRNA represent an unproductive OFF-pathway, it appears to be a common principle that ribosome maturation is a dynamic process with alternative routes to ensure efficient proper maturation of ribosomes35,37. For bacterial ribosomes, for example, it was shown that assembly blocks can join the assembling 50S LSU in a flexible order37,38. Under optimal conditions, the most effective pathway is preferred. However, the flexibility ensures that ribosome biogenesis can still continue under non-optimal conditions, such as when a ribosomal protein is depleted, through re-routing of the process. Similarly, alternative pathways that do not require MTG3 might also explain the appearance of pre-SSU states during late assembly and translation initiation, but with folded h4419,20 and also explain why translation-competent ribosomes can still be formed in Mtg3−/−, although less efficiently (Fig. 1d). In addition, different isolation strategies may lead to the enrichment of different particle populations. While Harper et al.20 enriched for METTL17-containing complexes via affinity purification of tagged METTL17, and Itoh et al.19 isolated mitoribosome population from cells deficient in TRMT2B (another known assembly factor of mtSSU), our approach followed the immunoisolation of MTG3-containing complexes. Thus, depending on the bait and background, different populations from earlier or later maturation steps will be enriched. Taken together, our data suggest an alternative pathway for mitoribosome biogenesis in which MTG3 can remain bound to the mtSSU during the first steps of translation initiation. Whether and under which conditions this pathway is physiologically relevant remains to be determined.

In summary, our work suggests the presence of an alternative mtSSU maturation pathway, where MTG3 has a quality control function during the final maturation steps of the mtSSU by preventing the docking of h44 during the IC formation primed for translation initiation.

HEK293 cell lines (Human Embryonic Kidney 293-Flp-In T-Rex, Thermo Fisher Scientific; R78007) were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium) supplemented with 10% FCS (Fetal Calf Serum), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 50 µg/ml uridine under standard cultivation conditions (37 °C under 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere). Cells were regularly tested to be free of Mycoplasma contaminations by GATC Biotech.

To monitor cell growth 7.5 × 104 cells were seeded into 6-wells plates on day 0 and cell numbers were counted after 1, 2, and 3 days.

HEK293 Mtg3−/− and Eral1−/− cell lines were generated by using the Alt-R CRISPR/Cas9 system (Integrated DNA Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were co-transfected with Cas9 enzyme and a crRNA-tracrRNA duplex carrying a fluorescent dye to select successfully transfected cells. The crRNAs were designed to target the first exon of Mtg3 or Eral1, respectively. Knockout clones were first tested via immunoblotting and further confirmed via TOPO sequencing. Sequencing of the Eral1−/− clone revealed premature stop codons in the first exon (Supplementary Fig. 1d), leading to truncated and probably unstable variants of ERAL1.

Stable inducible HEK293 cells lines expressing C-terminal FLAG-tagged MTG3, mutant versions of MTG3 (ΔN-MTG3FLAG lacking aa 69-78 and MTG3-G499PFLAG), mtIF3 or ERAL1 were generated as described previously39,40. Briefly, cells were transfected with pOG44 and pcDNA5/FRT/TO plasmids containing the FLAG construct using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen) as transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after the transfection selection of cells carrying the FLAG construct was started using 100 µg/ml Hygromycin B and 5 µg/ml Blasticidin S.

For measuring oxygen consumption rates (OCR) and extracellular acidification rates (ECAR), a Seahorse XFe96 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (5 × 104 per well) were seeded into a Seahorse XF cell culture plate. For OCR analysis, basal respiration was determined, and subsequently different metabolic conditions were analyzed by adding 3 µM oligomycin, 1.5 µM CCCP, and 0.5 µM antimycin A and rotenone each. For ECAR analysis, acidification of the media was measured under basal conditions and after the addition of 25 mM glucose, 3 µM Oligomycin, and 25 mM 2-deoxy-D-glucose.

For in gel activity measurements of complex I and IV, first a BN-PAGE was conducted. Isolated mitochondria were solubilized (1% digitonin, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF) at a concentration of 2 µg/µl for 20 min on ice. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), BN loading buffer (100 mM Bis-Tris pH 7, 500 mM amino caproic acid, 5% Serva Blue G250) was added to the samples, which were subsequently loaded onto a 3–10% polyacrylamide gradient gel and run at 4 °C. Gels were incubated in complex I in gel activity solution (2 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.1 mg/ml NADH, 2.5 mg/ml nitro tetrazolium blue) or complex IV solution (0.5 mg/ml diaminobenzidine, 20 µg/ml catalase, 1 mg/ml reduced cytochrome c, 75 mg/ml sucrose, 50 mM KPi pH 7.4), respectively.

Cell lysis was performed in nonionic lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, and 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PI-Mix, Roche)).

For isolation of mitochondria, cells were harvested and resuspended in trehalose buffer (300 mM trehalose, 10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF, and 0.2% BSA) and homogenized with a Homogenplus Homogenizer (Schuett-Biotech). After removing cell debris (centrifugation at 400 × g, 10 min), mitochondria were pelleted at 11,000 × g for 10 min.

To generate mitoplasts, isolated mitochondria were incubated in trehalose buffer with 0.1% digitonin for 30 min on ice following Proteinase K treatment (0.5 µg Proteinase K per 100 µg mitochondria) for 15 min and blocking of the reaction with 2 mM PMSF for 10 min.

Lysed mitoplasts (500 µg in 3% sucrose, 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1x PI-Mix, 0.08 U/µl RiboLock RNase inhibitor (Thermo Fisher) and 1% digitonin) were separated by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (5–30% sucrose (w/v) in 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 1x PI-Mix) at 79,000 × g for 15 h at 4 °C using a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). Fractions (1-16) were collected with a BioComp fractionator, precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol and 1/3 volume of 3 M sodium acetate pH 6.5. Samples were subsequently used for western blotting or RNA was isolated for northern blotting or NanoString analysis.

Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins was performed as described previously with some modifications40. Isolated mitochondria or mitoplasts were lysed in buffer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4 or 20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 100 mM NH4Cl or 100 mM KCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 10% Glycerol, 1 mM PMSF, 1x PI-Mix, 1% Triton X-100 and in some cases 0.5 mM GppNHp as indicated. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, the lysate was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma) for 1 h. For the elution of co-purified proteins, FLAG peptides were added. Eluate was either analyzed via western blotting, or used for cryo-EM.

[35S]Methionine labeling of newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins was performed as described previously40,41. Cells were incubated in methionine-free media without FCS for 10 min, followed by 10 min incubation in methionine-free media containing 10% FCS and 100 µg/ml emetine to block cytosolic translation. Then 100 µCi/ml [35S]Methionine was added and cells were incubated for 1 h. After harvesting, cells were lysed using nonionic lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 130 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF and 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (PI-Mix, Roche)) and centrifuged for 2 min at 600 × g. Supernatants were collected and protein concentration was determined by Bradford. Protein samples (25 µg) were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting. Radioactive labeled mitochondrial products were visualized with Typhoon imaging system (GE healthcare).

Total RNA or RNA from sucrose gradient fractions was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) or the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen), both according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was separated on a denaturing formaldehyde/formamide 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to an Amersham HybondTM-N membrane (GE healthcare) or GeneScreen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer). [32P]-radiolabeled probes targeting mitochondrial RNAs were used for visualization with Typhoon imaging system (GE healthcare) (Supplementary Table 4).

RNA was isolated from sucrose gradient fractions and total mitochondrial lysate using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) and RNA Clean and Concentrator kit (Zymo Research). RNA was further processed following the manual (NanoString Technologies). In brief, isolated RNA pools were hybridized with TagSet (nCounter Elements XT Reagents, Nanostring Technologies) and specific probes targeting mitochondrial transcripts (Supplementary Table 4)39,42. Samples were analyzed with an nCounter MAX system (nanoString Technologies) and data were processed with nSolver software. Raw data of mt-mRNAs were normalized to the abundance of 16S rRNA in the respective fractions.

Cell lysates, mitochondria samples, or samples recovered from sucrose gradient fractions were separated on 10–18% Tris-Tricine gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Cytiva) via semi-dry western blotting. For detection of specific proteins, primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C following incubation with secondary antibodies coupled to HRP or with fluorescence labeled antibodies for 1 h at room temperature (Supplementary Table 4). Signals were detected using ECL western blotting solution (ThermoFisher Scientific) or LI-COR Odyssey CLx system, and analyzed using Fiji Image J43.

FLAG-immunoprecipitation was conducted with lysed mitoplasts from a stable HEK293 cell line inducibly expressing MTG3FLAG. The eluate was crosslinked with 0.15% glutaraldehyde for 10 min on ice and the reaction was stopped by adding 50 mM lysine pH 7.5 and 50 mM aspartate pH 7.5. The sample was then desalted using Zeba Spin Desalting columns 7 K MWCO (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

For grid preparation, 4 µl of the sample were applied to freshly glow-discharged R 3.5/1 holey carbon grids (Quantifoil) that were precoated with a 2–3 nm carbon layer using a Leica EM ACE600 coater, at 4 °C and 95% humidity in a Vitrobot (FEI). Grids were blotted for 5 s with a blot force of 0 and 60 s before plunge-freezing in liquid ethane.

Cryo-EM data collection was performed with SerialEM using a Titan Krios transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 keV44. Images were acquired in EFTEM mode using a GIF quantum energy filter set to a slit width of 20 eV and a K3 direct electron detector (Gatan) at a nominal magnification of 81,000x corresponding to a calibrated pixel size of 1.05 Å/pixel. Exposures were recorded in counting mode for 3 s with a dose rate of 14.82 e−/px/s resulting in a total dose of 40.33 e−/Å2 that was fractionated into 40 movie frames. Images were acquired in 14 by 1 hole per stage movement.

Motion correction, CTF-estimation, particle picking, and extraction were performed using Warp45. Further processing was carried out using Relion 3.1.046 and final non-uniform refinement and local refinement in cryoSPARC47. A representative micrograph and the cryo-EM processing workflow are depicted in Supplementary Fig. 2. For initial processing steps, the dataset was split into four batches containing 1,521,397, 1,592,662, 1,569,593 and 1,046,895 4-times binned particles, respectively. From initial 2D classification in Relion, 2,456,047 particles were selected and joined together. From a second round of 2D classification, 663,593 “SSU candidates” and 811,261 “ambiguous SSU” particles were selected. The ambiguous set was re-classified in 2D revealing 242,768 “rescued SSU (1)” particles. The “SSU candidates” were unbinned to a factor of 2 and used for initial 3D auto-refinement and subsequent local 3D classification sorting them into 544,822 good classes (“SSU candidates (1)”) and 118,771 “ambiguous SSU (2)”. 2D classification of “ambiguous SSU (2)” revealed 53,601 “rescued SSU (2)”. All “rescued SSU” sets were joined and unbinned to a factor of 2 followed by 3D auto-refinement and local 3D classification. 78,528 “SSU candidates (2)” were rescued from those and merged with “SSU candidates (1)” ending in 623,350 good SSU particles (10.9% of initially extracted particles) for further processing.

The particles were unbinned and subjected to 3D auto-refinement with a mask around the entire SSU leading to a consensus refinement of 3.0 Å resolution. Two rounds of Bayesian polishing and CTF refinements particles followed by 3D refinement led to a “shiny” reconstruction at 2.8 Å resolution (Supplementary Fig. 2, “Shiny”). A head-focus map (Supplementary Fig. 2, “Head”) at 2.7 Å resolution was generated by subsequent focused 3D refinement with a mask encompassing the head. Signal subtraction with the same mask followed by 3D refinement with a mask around the SSU body generated a body-focused reconstruction without the SSU head (Supplementary Fig. 2, “body”) at 2.7 Å resolution.

A second round of signal subtraction with a mask around the factor binding site followed by focused 3D classification without image alignment using the same mask revealed subsets containing densities for METTL15, mtRBFA, TFB1M, MTG3, mtIF2, fMet-tRNAMet, or empty classes. Re-classification of METTL15 in combination with either mtRBFA(in) or mtRBFA(out) with a mask around METTL15 was performed to increase the signal for METTL15, which was reduced due to its intrinsic flexibility on top of the SSU. All three empty classes were joined together, and all classes were backprojected using the angles from the shiny refinement followed by filtering by local resolution. The final reconstructions of TFB1M and MTG3 (map A2), METTL15 and mtRBFA(in) (map B2), METTL15 and mtRBFA(out) (map C2), mtIF2 and fMet-tRNAMet (map G2) are summarized in Supplementary Fig. 2. The joined empty classes and mtIF2-only classes were again subjected to double signal subtraction and local refinements to subtract the SSU head and everything outside a mask encompassing the mtIF3 binding site, revealing three additional classes containing only mtIF3 or mtIF2 or both factors together (Supplementary Fig. 2, maps D2, E2, F2). Subsequent non-uniform refinement of these subsets in cryoSPARC47 led to improved maps of the respective regions (Supplementary Fig. 2, maps A-G1). Local refinements using masks encompassing the head, the body, METTL15, mtIF2 (for state F) or mtIF2 and fMet-tRNAMet (for state G) were generated in cryoSPARC (Supplementary Fig. 2, maps A-G4−6). For final model building and refinements, composite maps were generated in ChimeraX48,49 (Supplementary Fig. 2, maps A-G3). For states A-C, composite maps were generated using unsharpened local refinement maps to improve visibility of the factors, while the composite maps of state D to G were generated using sharpened local refinement maps.

In order to generate an initial model of the SSU, we rigid-body fitted all residues belonging to the SSU head into the head-focus map (Supplementary Fig. 3, “Head”) and all residues belonging to body in the global mtSSU reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. 3, “Shiny”) in ChimeraX, using a published structure from19 (PDB: 7PO1) as starting model. For state C, which mainly resembles pre-SSU-3a from19 (PDB: 7PNX), we used this model as a starting point. For state G, which mainly resembles the IC state from19 (PDB: 7PO2), we used this model as a starting point. The models were manually adjusted and rebuilt in Coot50 using both unsharpened and postprocessed maps, and subsequently refined in phenix_real_space_refine (PHENIX)51. The head and body models were then rigid-body fitted into each of the composite maps (Supplementary Fig. 3, maps A-G3) in ChimeraX followed by manual adjustments in Coot.

In all other states, published structures of factors were used as initial models and could be unambiguously fit into our densities. The models for MTG3, TFB1M, and mtRBFA(in), were taken from20 (PDB: 8CSP, 8CSR), while mtRBFA(out), METTL15, and mtIF2, mtIF3, and fMet-tRNAMet were taken from19 (PDBs: 7PNX, 7PO1, 7PO2). All residues within missing or weak density were deleted, and differently folded rRNA content was adjusted to some extent or deleted due to weak densities. Residues in h44 that differ from its mature orientation in states B and C were modeled by rigid-body fit these residues from (PDB: 7PO2) followed by manual adjustments in Coot.

In order to obtain stereochemically sound models, the models for states A-C were interactively re-build and refined using molecular dynamics force fields in ISOLDE52 within ChimeraX followed by real-space refinements against the composite maps (map A-C3) in PHENIX, while the models for states D-G were real-space refined against the composite maps (map D-G3) in PHENIX. This resulted in models with excellent stereochemistry. To obtain B-factors that adequately represent the conformational flexibility of head towards body, as well as weaker signal of the factors at the periphery of the whole mtSSU body (Supplementary Tables 1, 2), the models were refined by a final real-space refinement in Phenix against the local B-factor filtered maps (map A-G2).

Metrics details

Crystallization stands as a prime example of self-assembly. Elementary building blocks converge, seemingly adhering to an intricate blueprint, orchestrating order from chaos. While classical theories describe crystallization as a monomer-by-monomer addition, non-classical pathways introduce complexity. Using microscopic charged particles as monomers, we uncover the mechanisms governing the formation of ionic colloidal crystals. Our findings reveal a two-step process, wherein metastable amorphous blobs condense from the gas phase, before evolving into small binary crystals. These small crystals then grow into large faceted structures via three simultaneous processes: addition of free monomers from bulk, capture and absorption of surrounding blobs, and oriented attachment of other crystals. These complex crystallization pathways occur both in bulk and on surfaces across a range of particle sizes and interaction strengths, resulting in a diverse array of crystal types and morphologies. Harnessing our ability to tune the interaction potential through small changes in salt concentration, we developed a continuous dialysis approach that allows fine control over the interaction strength in both time and space. This method enables us to discover and characterize various crystal structures in a single experiment, including a previously unreported low-density hollow structure and the heteroepitaxial formation of composite crystal structures.

Charged colloidal particles are well-known model systems for studying self-assembly, as their interactions can be finely tuned through surface charge density and surrounding ionic conditions. When oppositely charged colloidal particles interact, they can form ordered binary structures akin to atomic crystals1,2. While such electrostatically driven assemblies have been extensively investigated in the context of simple crystalline lattices3, the detailed mechanisms governing their nucleation and growth remain largely unexplored. Previous studies on binary colloidal crystals have primarily focused on equilibrium structures and phase behavior, often assuming direct monomer-by-monomer attachment4. However, accumulating evidence suggests that electrostatically driven crystallization follows more complex pathways, involving intermediate amorphous phases, aggregation-driven nucleation, and particle reorganization5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. Despite theoretical predictions and computational models supporting these non-classical pathways8,13,14,15, direct observation has remained limited, particularly in systems where interaction potentials can be dynamically controlled16,17,18,19,20,21. Here, we investigate the formation of ionic binary colloidal crystals under conditions where electrostatic interactions dictate crystallization pathways.

We use binary mixtures of oppositely-charged colloids coated by a neutral polymer brush as model ions, carefully observing their assembly behavior as they transition from homogeneous suspensions to fully-formed macroscopic crystals. The particles interact via a superposition of a screened Coulomb interaction between their surface charges and the steric repulsion arising from overlap of their associated polymer coatings2. The pair potential for these model ions features an attractive minimum whose depth increases monotonically with decreasing salt concentration in the system. This relationship is key to understanding how variations in salt concentration influence the assembly process from dispersed particles to structured macroscopic crystals, and has been validated through the close correspondence of crystallization behavior observed within simulations accounting for these effects2,3. To initiate crystallization, we first prepare both positively and negatively charged particles in the same, precisely controlled, salt solution. We then mix the two groups of particles in an approximately 1:1 stoichiometric ratio and immediately transfer the resulting mixture into an observation cell. The time-lapse images captured through bright-field microscopy in Fig. 1a clearly show a two-step crystallization pathway. This process, which is believed to play significant roles in a range of systems13,22,23,24,25,26, begins with the rapid formation of particle blobs - a condensed liquid-like phase containing both positive and negative colloidal ions. Crystal nucleation starts within these blobs, and, as shown in Supplementary Movie 1, the crystallization front becomes visibly distinguishable as it progresses through the blob, eventually rendering it fully crystalline. Using 3D confocal microscopy to image refractive index-matched particles3, we thoroughly characterize the distinct phases present in the samples over time, confirming the amorphous nature of the blobs and pinpointing the precise locations of nucleation events within them (Fig. 1b). The transient phases were further validated by imaging quenched samples with SEM (Fig. 1c).

a Optical microscopy images showing a time-lapse of the nucleation of NaCl-like colloidal crystals via a two-step mechanism involving a metastable amorphous phase (Supplementary Movie 1). Crystal (C), liquid- (L), and gas-like (G) phases are labeled. The red dashed area highlights small blobs dissolving through Ostwald ripening. The white arrows indicate the movement of the crystallization boundary, marked by the white dotted line. b Laser-scanning confocal microscopy images showing volumetric scans of a similar two-step nucleation process for CsCl-like colloidal crystals formed from fluorescently-labeled PFPMA colloids3. (left) The 3D scans confirm the amorphous nature of the precursor liquid phase, and reveal their binary composition. (right) Crystalline regions can be seen nucleating and growing within the liquid phase. c SEM image of a quenched sample, capturing the initial transient state during the crystallization process, where both blobs and crystallites are present. All scale bars are 10 μm.

Following nucleation, the newly-formed crystallites transition into the growth phase, where they mature into faceted macroscopic crystals. This growth unfolds through a series of simultaneous mechanisms which are illustrated in detail in Fig. 2.

Sequential time-lapse microscopy images capturing the growth of CsCl-like colloidal crystals. a Well-defined faceted crystals formed via a classical nucleation pathway and growing through direct monomer-by-monomer addition from the gas phase (see also Supplementary Movie 2). b Similar crystals formed via a non-classical crystallization pathway, growing through the attachment and absorption of amorphous blobs (see also Supplementary Movie 3). c–d SEM imaging of fixed samples reveals detailed features during the blob absorption process such as well-developed CsCl crystals with particle blobs in the midst of absorption (c) and crystal facets with distinct step-edges (d), which correspond to the surface waves observed in growing crystals (Supplementary Movie 3). Certain crystals and blobs have been colored yellow and blue, respectively, for enhanced clarity. Similarly, in (d) some of the growing crystal planes have been false-colored, with white arrows indicating their growth direction. e Time-lapse optical microscopy (from Supplementary Movie 4) captures the oriented attachment of two CsCl-like colloidal crystals. The white arrow points to the contact region where the crystals locally melt and recrystallize, resulting in a single, seemingly defect-free crystal. All scale bars are 10 μm.

The most intuitive growth mechanism is monomer-by-monomer addition, where individual particles from the gas phase add to the crystal one-by-one. This is evident in Fig. 2a and Supplementary Movie 2, showing isolated crystals in contact with the gas phase growing at similar rates.

Ostwald ripening serves as a second key mechanism. In this process, the exchange of particles between the blobs and the bulk solution leads to net growth of nearby crystals through monomer addition, without necessitating direct contact between the crystals and the blobs (Fig. 1a).

A third mechanism comes into play when crystals do make physical contact with blobs. Under these conditions, particles from the blob flow directly onto the growing crystal, bypassing evaporation into the gas phase. This process manifests in experiments through the rapid deflation of the connected blob (Fig. 2b) and the emergence of surface waves that propagate from the blob to the crystal (Supplementary Movie 3). These waves are reminiscent of wetted step-edge crystal growth, where particles from a liquid phase deposit onto the edges of crystal steps and then integrate into the lattice27. Bright-field microscopy provides a comprehensive view of the entire process dynamics, while SEM images—captured from quenched samples—provide snapshots at single-particle resolution (Fig. 2c, d).

The fourth mechanism involves instances where small crystals come together and fuse in a specific, orientation-dependent manner to form a larger crystal (Supplementary Movie 4). This process differs from the more common random aggregation leading to polycrystalline structures; here, the particles align according to their crystallographic axes before merging, thereby maintaining a common crystallographic orientation across the newly formed, larger crystal28,29,30. During these oriented attachment events, we frequently observe the melting and subsequent re-crystallization of the contact region between the two crystals. This process, which facilitates the proper alignment of the crystals, results in a flawless area, completely eliminating the seam that initially separated the two structures (Fig. 2e).

While our colloidal model system allows us to observe these processes with high precision, capturing the very earliest steps of crystal formation remains challenging. We therefore employ our previously developed computational model2,3 to confirm that these mechanisms emerge naturally from our proposed interaction potential. We perform Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of 210 nm and 170 nm particles interacting via a pair potential that accounts for the combination of surface charge and polymer brush coating on the particles used in the experiment (details in Methods). As described throughout the rest of this article, these simulations recapitulate crystallization via a two-step process and subsequent crystal growth through Ostwald ripening and blob absorption, both on surfaces and in bulk, depending on the particle concentration and solution salt concentration.

A representative example of the formation of CsCl-like crystals can be seen in Supplementary Movie 1. Here, nucleation occurs from within these blobs, often starting from the surface where interfacial fluctuations more easily allow for transient changes in density. For lower interaction strengths, particles can rearrange resulting in blobs that are spherical to minimize surface tension, but for higher interaction strengths we also observe more dendridic gel structures14, which then crystallize through nucleation within the dense phase, followed by propagation as in Fig. 1. Absorption of neighboring blobs is common, especially at higher density where many small blobs nucleate initially. For some of these cases, we tracked the particles in the blob being absorbed and found that the vast majority of those in the final crystal arrived via direct flow rather than through evaporation from the blob then subsequent deposition.

To assess the generality of this two-step crystallization process, we conducted crystallization experiments varying the size ratio (β) between positive and negative particles. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1a, we observed no substantial differences in the crystallization mechanism, although the resulting crystal structures varied as expected31. Specifically, we examined systems with β = 0.36, 0.43, 0.50, 0.74, and 0.81, leading to the formation of Cs6C60–, NaCl–, K4C60–, Th3P4–, and CsCl–like structures, respectively.

We also investigated if our results were influenced by gravitational settling by conducting crystallization experiments under density-matching conditions. This was achieved by using a H2O/D2O mixture as the solvent, which made the polystyrene particles buoyancy-neutral. As we show in Supplementary Fig. 1b, we again observed no substantial differences in the crystallization behavior compared to the density-mismatched samples, which was predicted based on the observation of non-classical crystallization mechanisms in simulations of bulk assembly.

We hypothesized that the strength and range of particle interactions plays a crucial role in modulating the crystal formation pathways we observed, a phenomenon recognized in a growing number of particle systems11,32,33,34,35,36. To investigate this, we first conducted a series of simulations and experiments in which crystals were allowed to form in sealed capillaries at different fixed values of Debye length (λD). Both approaches revealed similar qualitative trends: at short λD, the samples remained in a gaseous state. As λD increased, we observed a narrow window where classical crystallization occurred, followed by a regime of two-step crystallization, and finally, at even higher λD, random aggregation (Fig. 3)

a Experimental behavior of oppositely charged 210 nm (+) and 190 nm (−) diameter PS particles mixed at various volume fractions (ϕp) and interaction energy minima (Eb). As the salt concentration increases (decreasing Eb), the assembly behavior transitions from forming amorphous aggregates (blue triangles) to polycrystal networks (green squares) and finally to well-separated crystals (green/yellow diamonds) of increasing sizes. Further increasing the salt concentration results in a stable gas phase (red circles). Most samples crystallize via a non-classical pathway (green area), but a small window of Eb and ϕp leads to classical crystallization behavior (yellow area). Simulations performed with settings mirroring experimental conditions show the same qualitative trend as experiment, albeit requiring slightly stronger interactions to observe nucleation within the fixed amount of available simulation time. Experimentally, we observe that with increasing ϕp, the boundaries between the different observed final states and assembly processes shift toward less negative Eb values. b Representative optical microscopy images showing the initial and final state for samples with ϕp=0.5% and Eb = −5.27, −5.56, −5.87,−6.20, −6.56, and −68.52 kBT. The initial states were captured approximately 5 minutes after sample preparation and the final states were captured after 48 hours. Scale bar, 5 μm. c Representative snapshots from simulations of systems with ϕc=1.0% and Eb = −6.00, −6.30, −6.50, −6.70, −7.20, and −68.52 kBT, showing similar trend as in experiments. Scale bar, 5 μm.

Next, we concentrated on designing experiments that allowed us to gradually, and in a controlled fashion, scan different particle interaction strengths over time. Because the interaction strength is highly sensitive to salt concentration, we modified our experimental setup to allow for gradual and continuous variation of the salt concentration. These experiments begin with a high salt concentration (short λD), maintaining the particles in a stable gas-like state. We subsequently reduce the salt concentration by connecting the observation cell to a deionized water reservoir (Fig. 4a). As salt diffuses out of the sample into the reservoir, the Debye length and interaction strength between the particles increase, eventually initiating crystallization (Fig. 5a–c). This design provides spatiotemporal control over the salt concentration because we can predict how the profile of ions should look given the initial inside and outside concentrations and the geometry of the capillary (Fig. 5a, Methods), and allows us to monitor and capture images of the crystallization front (Fig. 5b,c and Supplementary Movie 5). The gradual decrease of salt concentration enables us to pinpoint the relatively small window of interaction strengths where the formation of amorphous blobs is completely suppressed and where instead classical crystallization takes place.

The Petri dish is mounted on an inverted microscope and monitored with air objectives. b Representative bright field images taken at regular intervals along the capillary at the end of the crystallization experiment, assessing crystal types, sizes, and quality as a function of distance from the open end. The zoomed-in images (bottom) show aggregates and small crystallites near the open end, progressively larger single crystals toward the middle, and a mixed region of different crystal types near the sealed end. Scale bars, 100 μm.

The experimental data points represent the positions of the crystallization front over time, determined both macroscopically (black circles) and microscopically (white circles), as well as the end of crystal growth (gray circles). The solid lines represent concentration contours for 3.55 mM (white) and 3.40 mM (gray), corresponding to approximate bond energies of 6.5 and 7.0 kBT, respectively (see “Methods). b, c Macroscopic and microscopic time-lapse images showing the evolution of the crystallization front inside the capillary. d–f Bright-field (left) and SEM (right) images showing regions where one type of crystal dominates. These regions are typically found in the central part of the capillary (indicated by a star symbol). For this sample with a size ratio of 0.81, we observed and characterized CsCl–like (d), Th3P4–like crystals (e), and a third crystal form termed L3S4 (f) which is studied further in Fig. 8. g Representative microscopy image showing small crystallites and disordered aggregates typically found near the open end of the capillary (indicated by the square symbol). h A microscopy image shows various crystal structures coexisting near the closed end of the capillary (indicated by the circle symbol), including CsCl (I), Th3P4 (II), L3S4 (III), as well as two examples of heteroepitaxial crystals (IV, V), with one still unidentified (V) (Supplementary Movie 7). All scale bars in the bright field images are 50 μm, and in the SEM images, they are 10 μm.

Continuous dialysis allows us to create well-defined, spatially and temporally variable interaction potentials between particles, enabling the identification of optimal conditions for crystal growth in a single experiment. By assessing the size and quality of the crystals in various regions of the observation cell at the experiment's conclusion, we can infer the temporal evolution of particle interaction strength that led to the formation of those crystals. For instance, in regions where the interaction strength increases very rapidly—akin to supercooling—crystal formation is interrupted, with crystalline assemblies showing small, defective, and irregular structures, along with visible presence of disordered aggregates. In contrast, in areas of the same sample where the interaction strength increases more gradually, crystals develop with well-defined polyhedral habits (Figs. 5 and 4b).

Figure 5 provides a comprehensive experimental overview, where experimental observations are superimposed onto a simulated spatiotemporal map of interaction energies in the experiments.

Continuous dialysis allows us to discover and spatially resolve crystal structures with similar nucleation energy barriers, which might be overlooked in experiments using static interaction potentials. For example, in sealed capillaries, binary mixtures with β = 0.81 primarily form CsCl–like crystals that take on macroscopic rhombic dodecahedral shapes (Figs. 5d and 6). However, under continuous dialysis, we also observe crystals structurally similar to Thorium Phosphide (Th3P4) exhibiting distinct triakis tetrahedral habits, and this is also observed in simulation for certain values of λD and volume fraction (ϕp) (Figs. 5e and 7).

a Bright-field microscopy image of CsCl–like colloidal crystals, displaying rhombic dodecahedral habits. The crystals were assembled from a 1:1 mixture of 170 nm (+) PS and 210 nm (−) particles. Scale bar, 25 μm. b SEM images and the accompanying schematics (below) display crystals in various orientations, all exhibiting rhombic dodecahedral habits bounded by {110} planes. Scale bar, 10 μm. c SEM image (bottom) and rendering (top) of the crystal surface showing the same motif, with rows of negative particles (yellow lines) converging at the intersection vertices of three equivalent {110} planes (yellow points in b). Scale bar, 1 μm. d Potential energy per particle of the entire system and representative snapshots from MD simulations display classical (purple) and non-classical (green) crystallization of CsCl–like rhombic dodecahedral crystals from bulk under two different conditions. Classical crystallization (ϕp=0.01, λ=5.41 nm, ψ±=+70/−30 mV) exhibits as a sudden decrease in energy as a crystal rapidly grows after initial nucleation, whereas two-step nucleation through a liquid phase (ϕp=0.027, λ=5.15 nm, ψ±=+50/−50 mV) is characterized by a large dwell time in the condensed state before a crystal nucleus forms within the blob. e Distribution of Steinhardt-Dellago order parameter (\(\overline{{q}_{6}}\))52 for CsCl–like crystals (orange), amorphous blobs (blue), and for an intermediate structure (red). \({\overline{q}}_{6}\) in this case can clearly distinguish the state of each particle. f Volumetric confocal scan (left) and corresponding three-dimensional reconstruction (right) of a typical CsCl–like crystal.

The dotted lines highlight the crystal edges, while the intersections of three adjacent {112} planes with cyclic indices. All faces of the crystals consist of equivalent {112} planes, displaying the same particle arrangement. The crystals were assembled from a 1:1 mixture of 170 nm (+) PS and 210 nm (−) particles. Scale bars, 3 μm. b A zoomed-in SEM image of one crystal face, showing the complex particle motif with yellow lines highlighting the characteristic zig-zag pattern. Scale bar, 1 μm. c Schematics showing the Th3P4 (112) plane with the zig-zag pattern highlighted in yellow, alongside the crystal's unit cell. d Time-lapse of snapshots from MD simulation showing formation of Th3P4–like crystals in bulk via a non-classical crystallization pathway, whereby particles condense into a blob and subsequently the crystal nucleates and grows within the blob. In the main panels, particles are displayed with diameters scaled by 20% to allow the crystalline order to be observable, while insets show the true particle sizes. Particles are colored according to their similarity to a Th3P4 neighborhood as in (f). e Reference distance distribution functions calculated for individual particles within a blob and Th3P4–like crystal formed and empirically identified in MD simulations. f Calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD)53 for a particle relative to these two reference distributions allows us to classify and highlight particles as amorphous or Th3P4–like depending on if a particle is more similar (lower KLD) to amorphous or Th3P4. g Diffraction patterns calculated from coordinates of the final structure of in (d) and a natural Th3P4 crystal allow us to confirm the identity of this structure, following Ref. 3.

In addition to the Th3P4 crystals, we have discovered a previously unreported crystal structure that, surprisingly, forms in the same sample from the same building blocks and exhibits a distinctive needle-like morphology (Fig. 5f). As shown in Fig. 8a,b, this crystal features an unusual open structure with empty channels running through its entire length. By analyzing the distribution of distances between particles, we constructed the crystal's unit cell, which has a 3:4 ratio of large to small particles and a remarkably low volume fraction of 56%. Hereafter, we refer to this new crystal as L3S4. Unlike CsCl and Th3P4, L3S4 seems to nucleate only heterogeneously on the charged surface of the crystallization chamber, and simulations show that for sufficiently large surface charge the nucleation of L3S4 can be greatly enhanced relative to CsCl despite it less favorable bulk energy (Figs. 9 and Supplementary Movie 6). So far, we have only observed L3S4 formation under dialysis conditions, whereas simulations reproducibly assembled L3S4 under static conditions, suggesting that its formation might occur only within a very narrow range of λD values.

a (left) Bright-field microscopy image displaying the rod-like habit of the type (III) crystals shown in Fig. 3, formed from a 1:1 mixture of 170 nm (+) and 210 nm (−) PS particles. (right) SEM images showing particle arrangements in two characteristic planes of this crystal. b (top) MD simulations depict similar rod-like crystals nucleating on a negatively charged substrate. Cross-sections along the (100) and (010) planes reveal an unusual open structure with empty channels running through the entire length of the crystal. (bottom) The distribution of pairwise distances from simulations allows us to construct a detailed crystal unit cell with dimensions a = 254 nm, b = 509 nm, c = 923 nm, and a Cmmm (No. 65) space group symmetry with an L3S4 stoichiometry (where L stands for large and S for small particles). The particle coordinates within the unit cell, labeled from 1 to 5, are (0, 0, 0.28), (0, 0.5, 0.22), (0, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.21, 0.14), and (0.5, 0.29, 0.36), respectively. c Bright-field (left) and SEM (right) images illustrating the heteroepitaxial growth of thin triangular crystals on L3S4 substrates. d Similar heteroepitaxial growth is observed in simulations when the L3S4 crystal shown in (b) is used as a seed and allowed to grow in bulk. In this case, two types of epitaxial crystals are clearly observed: the same thin triangular crystals seen in (c) and a CsCl-type crystal. Analysis of the two epitaxial interfaces (yellow lines) reveals a close similarity between the particle arrangements of the substrate and the epitaxial crystals. Within the L3S4 crystals, negative and positive particles are colored soft pink and lavender, respectively. To enhance visualization, the color scheme shifts to pink and azure for epitaxial crystal A and red and blue for epitaxial crystal B. All scale bars in the bright field images are 50 μm, and in the SEM images, they are 2 μm.

a SEM images and MD simulation snapshot showing the coexistence of L3S4– and CsCl–like crystals nucleated on a negatively charged substrate using particles with size ratio of 0.81. Scale bars, 5 μm. b The potential energy per particle for the entire system, along with key snapshots, shows that high surface potentials (-50 mV) tend to favor the nucleation of L3S4 through a classical-like behavior, while lower surface potentials (−45 mV) promote the nucleation of CsCl-like structures via a two-step process. Key snapshots are highlighted with a bottom view of layers attached to the charged wall. c Final frames for the two simulations in (b) showing the resulting single crystals with L3S4 (top) and CsCl–like (bottom) structures. Highlighted are the particle layers in contact with the charged substrate for the two structures. The surface potentials of -50 mV and -45 mV correspond to attractions between the wall and positive particles of 2.9 and 2.6 kBT, respectively. Both simulations used λD = 5.15 nm and similar ϕp. d The interaction between the first layer of L3S4 and the surface is more attractive than for CsCl–like structure, confirming that a charged substrate is crucial for L3S4 nucleation. This interaction considers the total energy of attraction between the wall and first-layer particles, attraction between the first and second layer particles, and repulsion between like-charged particles in the first layer. The reduction in repulsion is dominant due to the arrangement of positive particles. e L3S4 unit cell highlighting two characteristic distances between the small positive particles: long (red line) and short (yellow line). Also shown is a characteristic angle between three large negative particles (purple line). By examining the (100) plane of a larger crystal, these characteristic distances and angles form easily distinguishable patterns, revealing a ∣ABBA∣ stacking sequence of small positive particles with hollow channels between A − A or B − B layers and a zig-zag pattern of negative particles between A − B layers (purple line).

While in the middle of our dialysis setup we observe regions where each one of these structures seem to be individually dominant (Fig. 5d–f), towards the sealed end of the capillary, we observe coexistance of all three of these structures and several others within a single field of view (Figs. 5h and 4b). Since these structures had the most time available to nucleate at low salt concentration, we infer that the barriers to nucleation for these structures must be similar.

So far, we have described how our dialysis setup allowed us to observe formation of numerous large binary single crystals with an array of forms for a system prepared with a fixed ratio of particle size, surface charge, and number ratio. Within our setup, we are also able to observe more complex hierarchical assemblies, in particular crystals formed through heteroepitaxial growth37 of one structure templated by another (e.g., Fig. 5h structures IV and V, Supplementary Movie 6). Focusing on samples of L3S4, we frequently observe formation of thin flag-like protrusions from the sides of L3S4 rods (Fig. 8c,d). SEM images of these flags show that they have a sharp 80 degree corner, and a surface arrangement of particles that does not belong to the structure we determined for L3S4. To inspect this behavior in more detail, we seeded MD simulations with the large L3S4 crystal from Fig. 8b in bulk, which allowed the crystal to grow in all directions. After several rounds of continued addition of particles, we observed not one but two simultaneous instances of heteroepitaxial growth, one of which produced a structure commensurate with the flags observed in SEM, and one of which we identified as CsCl–like (Supplementary Movie 7). Using our full knowledge of particle positions in the MD simulation, we are able to demonstrate that the nucleation of these secondary crystals occurs due to commensurate arrangements of particles within the two different unit cells. This investigation shows that the (210) face of CsCl and (022) face of L3S4 are able to interlock, and that the flag structure seen in simulation can be formed by extending a rhombic subset of particles from the L3S4 unit cell (Supplementary Fig. 2). The flag formed in MD simulations has a surface structure that closely matches the one observed in experiments. The compatibility of the CsCl unit cell with L3S4 may also explain why they are often observed in contact within the experiments. Another example of hetero-epitaxial growth can be observed in Fig. 5h (structure V) and Supplementary Fig. 3, where anisotropic crystals stem from a central seed, forming a repetitive branched structure. Further work is required to fully characterize these structures, as their extreme thinness and fragility make them prone to damage during the fixing process required for SEM imaging.

We believe this previously unobserved variety of crystal structures, habits, and crystallization behaviors was obscured by our inability to precisely modulate particle interaction potentials in time and space. Our continuous dialysis setup addresses this limitation, unveiling a spectrum of crystallization phenomena not readily apparent under static conditions. These capabilities reveal the underlying mechanisms governing colloidal crystallization pathways and underscore the intricate interplay between particle interactions and crystallization outcomes. This approach lays the groundwork for developing precisely tunable control over colloidal crystallization, enabling the creation of materials with tailored microstructures. A particularly promising outcome of this work is the potential to control the formation of specific structures or polymorphs by creating charged patterns on the substrate.

Low-density (ρ = 1.05g/cm3) polystyrene (PS) and low-refractive-index (n = 1.39) pentafluoropropyl methacrylate (PFPMA) colloids were synthesized via surfactant-free emulsion polymerization for bright-field microscopy and laser scanning confocal microscopy experiments, respectively3,38.

For the synthesis of 200 nm diameter positively charged PS particles, a mixture of 550 mL deionized water and 3 mL styrene monomer (≥99% from MilliporeSigma) was stirred at 330 rpm in a 1 L three-neck round-bottom flask. After purging with nitrogen for 1 hour, 0.5 g of 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AIBA) (97% from MilliporeSigma), dissolved in 10 mL deionized water, was injected into the mixture. The components were then heated to 60 °C and stirred at 330 rpm under nitrogen overnight. The particles were stabilized by adding 5 mL of 5 wt% Pluronic F108 solution and washed via repeated sedimentation and resuspension cycles. Finally, the particle suspensions were dialyzed against deionized water for one week using 50 kD Spectra/Por dialysis tubing, with daily water changes to ensure complete removal of salt. Negatively charged PS particles were synthesized similarly, replacing AIBA with an equivalent weight of potassium persulfate (KPS) (≥99% from MilliporeSigma).

To prepare 375 nm diameter positively charged PFPMA particles, a mixture of 100 mL deionized water, 8 mL 2,2,3,3,3-pentafluoropropyl methacrylate monomer (SynQuest Labs), and 20 μL of (2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)trimethylammonium chloride comonomer (75 wt% in H2O from MilliporeSigma) was stirred at 330 rpm in a 250 mL three-neck round-bottom flask. After purging with nitrogen for 1 hour, 0.1 g AIBA, dissolved in 5 mL deionized water, was injected. The mixture was heated to 60 °C and stirred at 330 rpm under nitrogen for 12–16 hours. The particles were filtered (Whatman, pore size 20 μm) to remove aggregates, stabilized by adding 1 mL of 5 wt% Pluronic F108 solution, washed via sedimentation and resuspension, and dialyzed as for the PS particles. Negatively charged PFPMA particles were synthesized using the same procedure, excluding the comonomer and replacing AIBA with an equivalent weight of KPS.

The sizes of PS particles and negatively charged PFPMA particles were controlled by varying the monomer concentration, achieving diameters ranging from 100 nm to 700 nm. For positively charged PFPMA particles, diameters from 150 to 400 nm were obtained by adjusting the comonomer-to-monomer ratio. Larger sizes required repeated seeded growth.

Fluorescent labeling of PFPMA particles was done using the swell-deswell method39. BODIPY FL NHS ester and BODIPY 581/591 NHS ester dyes (ThermoFisher) were used for positively and negatively charged particles, respectively. Typically, 100 μL dye solution (1 mg/mL in toluene) mixed in 9 mL 60 vol% THF was added to 10 mL of particle suspension stabilized with 2.5 wt% Pluronic F108, resulting in a final concentration of 28.5 vol% THF. The mixture was swirled for 15 minutes and then rapidly diluted by a factor of 15. The dyed particles were transferred into deionized water through repeated sedimentation and resuspension cycles.

The surface potential of each particle system was measured using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS with DTS1070 folded capillary cells. Measurements were performed on highly dilute samples equilibrated in 10 mM NaCl. Zeta potentials were calculated using the Smoluchowski approximation (Henry's function f(κa) = 1.5), with refractive indices of 1.39 for PFPMA particles and 1.59 for PS particles.

Oppositely charged PS particles were separately equilibrated with 0.1 wt% Pluronic F108 and 2–5 mM NaCl for 30 minutes. They were then mixed together while vortexing. The resulting mixture was promptly transferred into hydrophobized borosilicate glass capillaries (VitroCom, model 3520), which were then sealed on both ends with wax (Hampton Research) or epoxy resin (Norland 81). Capillaries were pre-cleaned in a Jelight Model 18 ultraviolet ozone (UVO) cleaner for 20 minutes. Subsequently, they were exposed to methyltrichlorosilane (99%, MilliporeSigma) vapor inside a moisture-free sealed chamber for 1 hour to hydrophobize the surface. After this treatment, the capillaries were washed with water and ethanol for three cycles and finally dried in an oven. This hydrophobization pre-treatment facilitates the formation of a polymer brush on the glass surface when in contact with a Pluronic F108 solution.

Density-matched samples were prepared similarly, using 57% deuterium oxide (D2O) instead of pure water. Refractive index-matched samples were prepared using PFPMA particles suspended in 40% DMSO solutions. These samples were allowed to crystallize either in micro-wells (Thomas Scientific) or micro-channels (Ibidi USA).

To determine the optimal crystallization conditions for each particle system, series of samples with varying NaCl concentrations were prepared, typically ranging from 2 to 5 mM in increments of 0.1 mM. The samples were monitored over several days to identify the ideal crystallization conditions.

CsCl–like crystals (space group \(Pm\overline{3}m\), No. 221) were formed using particle size ratios ranging from 0.8 to 1.0 and a number ratio of 1:1. The Wulff shape of these crystals is a rhombic dodecahedron, bound by {110} planes, reflecting their equilibrium shape as determined by surface energy minimization (Fig. 6).

Th3P4–like crystals (space group \(I\overline{4}3d\), No. 220) were formed using 170 nm (+) PS and 210 nm (−) PS particles (β = 0.81), as well as 255 nm (+) PS and 190 nm (−) PS particles (β = 0.74), both at a number ratio of 1:1. The Wulff shape of these crystals is a triakis tetrahedron, bound by {112} planes (Fig. 7).

NaCl–like crystals (space group \(Fm\overline{3}m\), No. 225) were formed using 300 nm (+) PS and 130 nm (−) PS particles (β = 0.43) at a 1:1 number ratio. A precise size ratio of approximately \(\sqrt{2}-1\) is required to form NaCl crystals; otherwise, K4C60 is typically observed. The Wulff shape of these crystals is a cube, bound by {100} planes (Fig. 10e).

a Bright-field microscopy and SEM images of K4C60–like crystals, along with accompanying schematics, display two orientations of rhombic dodecahedral habits. The green dots indicate the intersections of equivalent (110) planes. The scale bar in the bright field image is 100 μm, and in the SEM image it is 5 μm. Zoomed-in SEM images show these two orientations, exhibiting (110) and (101) top surface planes. Scale bar, 0.5 μm. b MD simulation of the same particle system as in (a) at λD = 5.9 nm with a negatively charged substrate and high density (see “Methods”) produces crystals with these two orientations and characteristic top surface planes within the same simulation box.

The scale bar in the bright field image is 100 μm, and in the SEM image it is 10 μm. The zoomed-in inset shows the surface particle arrangement, consistent with the (100) plane of a NaCl-like structure. Scale bar, 1 μm. f Cs6C60–like crystals displaying rhombic dodecahedral habits bounded by {110} planes. The scale bar in the bright field image is 100 μm, and in the SEM image it is 10 μm. The zoomed-in inset shows the surface particle arrangement, consistent with the (110) plane of a Cs6C60–like structure. Scale bar, 1 μm.

K4C60–like crystals (space group I4/mmm, No. 139) were formed using 350 nm (+) PS and 160 nm (−) PS particles (β = 0.46) at a 1:4 number ratio, as well as 200 nm (+) PS and 400 nm (−) PS particles (β = 0.50) at the same number ratio. The larger particles are positioned at the body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice sites. The small particles filled all the tetrahedral interstitial sites of the (001) plane and only half of the (100) and (010) planes. The Wulff shape of these crystals is a rhombic dodecahedron, bound by distinct {110} and {101} planes, resulting in two types of orientations observed (Fig. 10a).

Cs6C60–like crystals (space group \(Im\overline{3}\), No. 204) were formed using 525 nm (+) PS and 190 nm (−) PS particles (β = 0.36) at a 1:6 number ratio. In the unit cell of this cubic lattice, the larger particles are positioned at the body-centered cubic (bcc) lattice sites, specifically at coordinates (0, 0, 0) and (0.5, 0.5, 0.5). The smaller particles occupy all tetrahedral interstitial sites, located on each face, such as in the (001) plane at coordinates (0.5, 0.25, 0), (0.5, 0.75, 0), (0.25, 0.5, 0), and (0.75, 0.5, 0), displaced by  ±0.25 along the x and y axes from the face center. The Wulff shape of this crystal is a rhombic dodecahedron, bound by {110} planes (Fig. 10f).

To perform experiments at variable interaction potentials, mixtures of oppositely charged PS particles with 4.5 mM NaCl and 0.1 wt% F108 were introduced into 50-mm-long glass capillaries (inner dimensions: 2.0 mm  × 0.2 mm, VitroCom) and sealed at one end. The capillaries were then immersed in 100 mm diameter Petri dishes filled with deionized water (Fig. 4). During crystallization, each capillary was imaged using a Luxonis OAK-D S2 camera, recording a time-lapse with a 10-minute delay between frames (Supplementary Movie 5). The position of the crystallization front was tracked over time using ImageJ, by identifying and tracking the boundary between the opaque area of the capillary (gas phase) and the transparent area (crystalline phase). Simultaneously, we tracked the crystallization front by taking microscopy images at regular intervals using a bright-field microscope equipped with a 10X air objective.

Bright-field images and movies were acquired using a Leica DMI3000 inverted microscope equipped with differential interference contrast optics and high-resolution cameras: a grayscale Jenoptik Gryphax Rigel and a color FLIR Grasshopper3. Crystal nucleation was observed within hours using a 100X oil immersion objective. For continuous imaging of crystal growth over several days, sealed capillary samples were glued to a 100 mm Petri dish (FisherScientific), immersed in water at room temperature, and monitored using a 10X air objective with minimal light intensity to reduce heating.

Time-lapse z-stacks of scanning fluorescent images were acquired using a Leica SP8 confocal microscope equipped with a 100X oil objective, recording the crystallization process of positively charged 375 nm and negatively charged 440 nm PFPMA particles in 40% DMSO at 30-minute intervals. The two BODIPY dyes were excited at 500 nm and 580 nm, with emission signals collected at 510–520 nm and 590–600 nm, respectively. The z-step size was set to 0.07 μm, allowing for 5 scans per particle to achieve precise tracking. To prevent dye bleaching during extended scanning, the lowest possible laser power (typically around 5% of the maximum) was used. The coordinates of oppositely charged particles were estimated from grayscale images of separated channels in the z-stack data using the TrackPy Python package40. These coordinates were imported into Blender, where sizes based on scanning electron microscopy were assigned to recreate the structure in 3D. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Fig. 6 were subsequently generated using Mercury software from the particle coordinates.

Electron Microscopy imaging was performed on fixed samples. Crystals formed in sealed capillaries were fixed by immersing the capillaries in a deionized water bath and carefully removing the sealant (wax or epoxy). The capillaries were then left undisturbed in the deionized water to allow the salt to diffuse into the water bath. After a few days, ion exchange resin (AmberLite MB from MilliporeSigma) was added to the samples to remove all remaining ions from the system. This ion removal process lasted for another 3–4 days, during which the water bath was changed daily. To recover the fixed crystals, the capillaries were scored with a glass cutter and carefully broken underwater. The broken capillaries were taped onto SEM stubs (Ted Pella) using conductive carbon adhesive tabs (Electron Microscopy Science), air-dried, and coated with 3-5 nm of iridium using a Cressington 208HR high-resolution sputter coater. The samples were then imaged using a MERLIN field emission scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss).

We estimated the temporal and spatial variations in salt concentration within the capillary using COMSOL Multiphysics. Based on the physical dimensions of the capillaries used in experiments (50 mm × 2 mm × 0.2 mm), we simulated the diffusion of NaCl ions using Fick's law:

where Jj is the flux of salt, D is the diffusion coefficient of salt (1.61 × 10−9m2/s)41, and cj is the concentration of component j. The initial NaCl concentration throughout the capillary was 4.5 mM, with boundary conditions applied such that the interface at one end was fixed at 0 mM, and there was no flux across any other interfaces. The numerical solutions were calculated for 96 hours at 15-minute intervals. Energies in Fig. 5 were computed by converting the salt concentration at a given position and time to a λD in meters using the formula,

where ϵ is the dielectric constant taken to be 80.1, ϵ0 is the vacuum permittivity, R is the ideal gas constant, F is Faraday's constant, T is the temperature and C is the salt concentration in units of mol/L42. The attractive interaction strength is then found by finding the minimum of the attractive potential between negative and positive particles given in the next section.

To model the assembly of charged colloids, we performed Langevin dynamics simulations of binary mixtures of colloidal particles using the HOOMD-Blue software43, as previously implemented2,3 (see Code Availability Statement for run and analysis scripts). A total 6750 number of charged particles were placed in the simulation boxes in a simple cubic arrangement in a 1:1 ratio at varying ϕp. Unless otherwise indicated, the radii of the positive- and negatively charged particles were taken to be 85 nm and 105 nm, respectively. The temperature was maintained by a Langevin thermostat at 1 kBT. The drag coefficient, γ was set to 0.001. The screened Coulombic interaction between two particles is computed by the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO)42 theory, expressed as \({V}_{{{{\rm{E}}}}}({h}_{ij})=2\pi {k}_{{{{\rm{B}}}}}T\epsilon {a}_{ij}{\psi }_{i}{\psi }_{j}\exp (-{h}_{ij}/{\lambda }_{{{{\rm{D}}}}})\). Here, ϵ is the solvent permittivity which was set to 80, ψi and ψj are the surface potentials for the two particles which unless otherwise indicated were set to +50 mV and −50 mV for positive and negative particles, respectively, and λD is the Debye length. hij is the distance between the surfaces of the particles. aij is the ionic radius coming from the Derjaguin approximation42 which is expressed as aij = 2/(1/ri + 1/rj), where ri and rj are the radii of the two particles. The repulsive interactions generated from the polymer brushes between two particles was computed by the Alexander-de Gennes model44,45,46,47 which is given by-

The repulsion radius, \({a}_{ij}^{R}\), present in the pre-factor is given by \({a}_{ij}^{R}=({r}_{i}+{r}_{j})/2\). L, the polymer brush length, is set to 10 nm for all simulations48. σ is the polymer brush density which is equal to 0.09 nm-249. The simulations were performed at six different values of ϕp, and for each, unless otherwise mentioned, λD was varied from 5.1 to 5.3 nm. We performed 6 simulations in each condition. Repulsive walls, which interact with the particles by a shifted Lennard-Jones potential, were used to produce a simulation box, which is convenient for analysis but is not expected to effect results given we are studying assembly from a dilute gas phase. Simulations were carried out for 4 x 109 number of steps using a dimensionless time step of 0.005 unless otherwise specified.

Simulations in Fig. 3 used sizes and charges set to match experiments performed specifically for that figure. A 1:1 mixture of positive and negative particles was placed in a closed cubic box with ϕp=1.0%, and were simulated for 109 steps. The diameters of the positive and negative particles were 210 nm and 190 nm with surface potentials of +44 mV and −54 mV, respectively. λD was chosen to give attractive well depths from −5.6 kBT to −8.77 kBT, as well as −68.5 kBT, corresponding to λD values between 5.0 and 13.8 nm. All other settings were the same as described above.

To study the effect of a charged substrate on the crystallization, we included a negatively charged wall at position \({{{{\rm{Z}}}}}_{\min }\) in the simulation box. The charged wall is formed of a hexagonal arrangement of spherical particles of radius 30 nm. The interaction between the charged wall and a colloid particle was modeled using the same combined DLVO+brush potential as between the two primary species. The surface potential of the wall particles was varied from  − 45 mV to  −50 mV.

In addition to simulating the size ratio of 0.81, we performed simulations with size ratio of 0.45 (rP = 176.5 nm and rN = 80 nm) and number ratio (positive to negative particles) of 1:2 to produce K4C60 crystals (see Fig. 10). Simulations using experimentally realistic surface potentials of positive and negative particle, +30 mV and −50 mV, formed crystals on a surface with wall particles having a charge of −50 mV. Those shown in Fig. 10b formed with λD=5.9 nm and volume fraction 0.0345. Bulk crystallization in Fig. 10c was observed for λD=5.3 nm with surface charges of +/− 50 mV at volume fraction 0.005. All other parameters were same as described above. Simulation trajectories were visualized using Ovito software50.

There's a somewhat concerning new trend going viral: People are using ChatGPT to figure out the location shown in pictures.

This week, OpenAI released its newest AI models, o3 and o4-mini, both of which can uniquely “reason” through uploaded images. In practice, the models can crop, rotate, and zoom in on photos — even blurry and distorted ones — to thoroughly analyze them.

These image-analyzing capabilities, paired with the models' ability to search the web, make for a potent location-finding tool. Users on X quickly discovered that o3, in particular, is quite good at deducing cities, landmarks, and even restaurants and bars from subtle visual clues.

Wow, nailed it and not even a tree in sight. pic.twitter.com/bVcoe1fQ0Z

In many cases, the models don't appear to be drawing on “memories” of past ChatGPT conversations, or EXIF data, which is the metadata attached to photos that reveal details such as where the photo was taken.

X is filled with examples of users giving ChatGPT restaurant menus, neighborhood snaps, facades, and self-portraits, and instructing o3 to imagine it's playing “GeoGuessr,” an online game that challenges players to guess locations from Google Street View images.

this is a fun ChatGPT o3 feature. geoguessr! pic.twitter.com/HrcMIxS8yD

— Jason Barnes (@vyrotek) April 17, 2025



It's an obvious potential privacy issue. There's nothing preventing a bad actor from screenshotting, say, a person's Instagram Story and using ChatGPT to try to doxx them. 

o3 is insaneI asked a friend of mine to give me a random photoThey gave me a random photo they took in a libraryo3 knows it in 20 seconds and it's right pic.twitter.com/0K8dXiFKOY

— Yumi (@izyuuumi) April 17, 2025

 

Of course, this could be done even before the launch of o3 and o4-mini. TechCrunch ran a number of photos through o3 and an older model without image-reasoning capabilities, GPT-4o, to compare the models' location-guessing skills. Surprisingly, GPT-4o arrived at the same, correct answer as o3 more often than not — and took less time.

There was at least one instance during our brief testing when o3 found a place GPT-4o couldn't. Given a picture of a purple, mounted rhino head in a dimly-lit bar, o3 correctly answered that it was from a Williamsburg speakeasy — not, as GPT-4o guessed, a U.K. pub.

That's not to suggest o3 is flawless in this regard. Several of our tests failed — o3 got stuck in a loop, unable to arrive at an answer it was reasonably confident about, or volunteered a wrong location. Users on X noted, too, that o3 can be pretty far off in its location deductions.

But the trend illustrates some of the emerging risks presented by more capable, so-called reasoning AI models. There appear to be few safeguards in place to prevent this sort of “reverse location lookup” in ChatGPT, and OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, doesn't address the issue in its safety report for o3 and o4-mini.

We've reached out to OpenAI for comment. We'll update our piece if they respond.

Posted:

Chatbot Arena, the crowdsourced benchmarking project major AI labs rely on to test and market their AI models, is forming a company called Arena Intelligence Inc., reports Bloomberg.

In a blog post published Thursday, Chatbot Arena said that the company will “give [it] the resources to improve [its platform] significantly over what it is today.” The team also pledged to continue to provide neutral testing grounds for AI not influenced by outside interests.

Founded in 2023, Chatbot Arena has become something of an AI industry obsession. Primarily run by UC Berkeley-affiliated researchers, Chatbot Arena has partnered with companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to make flagship models available for its community to evaluate.

Chatbot Arena was previously funded through a combination of grants and donations, including from Google's Kaggle data science platform, Andreessen Horowitz, and Together AI. The organization's fledgling company hasn't disclosed any potential new backers yet — nor has it decided on a business model.

For I second I thought this employee was talking about what's healthy for the user. Certainly not though; they mean what's healthy for the ""user-base"". I find very interesting how this sort of language leads to certain employee behaviour. Using the concept of ""health"" to mean retention and engagement, might overcast thinking about health from a user's perspective— it's similar terminology but very different, and sometimes even opposite, goals.

Can someone say the original intent or de-facto use case of Snapchat, and how that's changed over time?Around the time it started, I heard that it was for adult sexting, with people thinking they could use it to send private selfies that quickly self-destruct.  So that (purportedly) the photos can't be retained or spread out of the real-time person-to-person context in which they were shared.  (I guess the ghost logo was for ""ephemeral"".)And then I vaguely recall hearing that Snapchat changed the feature, or got rid of it.

It isn't properly regulated because the CEO's and founders just moan that it isn't possible to regulate so much user generated content. I'm of the opinion that, in that case, their sites shouldn't exist but people seem to have convinced themselves that Facebook et al provide too much value to stand up to.

I just failed to be able to do anything about it.You were a teenager once, I'm sure you can remember how little influence your parents actually had over how you actually spent your time. Or at least saw that in your friends.This is a society wide thing. Parents are pretty much powerless.So yes, regulation. But you'll see how discussion of any proposal for this goes down in this forum. Just imagine across the whole polis.

Like there are parental control systems and all that you could set up but that requires you to be pretty tech savy as a parent.

In my personal experience, kids and young adults particularly those who grew up immersed in social media (born after ~1995–2000), seem to struggle with recognizing appropriate, undistorted social cues and understanding the real-world consequences of their actions.To Snapchat harming kids, I think it is more than just evil people doing ""five key clusters of harms"".Even adults often expect the same instant reactions and flexible social dynamics found online, which blinds them to the more permanent, harsher outcomes that exist outside of digital spaces.Anecdotally, the utter shock that shows on some people's face when they realize this is sad, and very disconcerting.  (At an extreme think ""pranksters"", that get shot or punched in the face, and they are confused why that happened, when ""everyone loves it online"".)How to fix this?  the suggested solutions will not solve this problem, as it does not fit the ""clusters of harms"".

I find all of these ""social media is bad"" articles (for kids or adults) basically boil down to: Let humans communicate freely, some of them will do bad things.This presents a choice: Monitor everyone Orwell-style, or accept that the medium isn't going to be able to solve the problem. Even though we tolerate a lot more monitoring for kids than adults, I'm still pretty uncomfortable with the idea that technology platforms should be policing everyone's messages.So I sleep just fine knowing that some kids (and adults) are going to have bad experiences. I send my kid to the playground knowing he could be hurt. I take him skiing. He just got his first motorcycle. We should not strive for a risk-free world, and I think efforts to make it risk-free are toxic.

Advertising - banned, smoking indoors - banned, and most importantly, taxing the hell out of them (every 10% increase in cigarette prices results in a 4% decrease in adult consumption and a 7% decrease in youth consumption).There isn't really directly comparable policy to taxing these free social media platforms., however, and the whole thing is a bit stickier. Before any policies can stick, the public needs to be aware of the issues. That is tough when most people's 'awareness of issues' comes directly from social media.

Now whether social networks in even these basic forms are harmful (discouraging physical connections, isolation in digital environments, etc), is maybe a different topic.Exposure to echo chambers of harmful, hateful content driven by algorithms seems to be more the focus here. MySpace, early FB, or even AIM/ICQ, and others focused on facilitating connections and communication didn't drive the same level of harm imo.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","NASA has made an air traffic control system for drones","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/17/1114449/nasa-drones-air-traffic-control-airspace-safety/","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

As more drones begin flying, a traffic management system developed at NASA aims to keep the airspace safe.

On Thanksgiving weekend of 2013, Jeff Bezos, then Amazon's CEO, took to 60 Minutes to make a stunning announcement: Amazon was a few years away from deploying drones that would deliver packages to homes in less than 30 minutes. 

It lent urgency to a problem that Parimal Kopardekar, director of the NASA Aeronautics Research Institute, had begun thinking about earlier that year.

“How do you manage and accommodate large-scale drone operations without overloading the air traffic control system?” Kopardekar, who goes by PK, recalls wondering. Busy managing all airplane takeoffs and landings, air traffic controllers clearly wouldn't have the capacity to oversee the fleets of package-delivering drones Amazon was promising. 

Police drones, rapid deliveries of blood, tech-friendly regulations, and autonomous weapons are all signs that drone technology is changing quickly. 

The solution PK devised, which subsequently grew into a collaboration between federal agencies, researchers, and industry, is a system called unmanned-­aircraft-system traffic management, or UTM. Instead of verbally communicating with air traffic controllers, drone operators using UTM share their intended flight paths with each other via a cloud-based network.

This highly scalable approach may finally open the skies to a host of commercial drone applications that have yet to materialize. Amazon Prime Air launched in 2022 but was put on hold after crashes at a testing facility, for example. On any given day, only 8,500 or so unmanned aircraft fly in US airspace, the vast majority of which are used for recreational purposes rather than for services like search and rescue missions, real estate inspections, video surveillance, or farmland surveys. 

One obstacle to wider use has been concern over possible midair drone-to-drone collisions. (Drones are typically restricted to airspace below 400 feet and their access to airports is limited, which significantly lowers the risk of drone-airplane collisions.) Under Federal Aviation Administration regulations, drones generally cannot fly beyond an operator's visual line of sight, limiting flights to about a third of a mile. This prevents most collisions but also most use cases, such as delivering medication to a patient's doorstep or dispatching a police drone to an active crime scene so first responders can better prepare before arriving.

Now, though, drone operators are increasingly incorporating UTM into their flights. The system uses path planning algorithms, like those that run in Google Maps, to chart a course that considers not only weather and obstacles like buildings and trees but the flight paths of nearby drones. It'll automatically reroute a flight before takeoff if another drone has reserved the same volume of airspace at the same time, making the new flight trajectory visible to subsequent pilots. Drones can then fly autonomously to and from their destination, and no air traffic controller is required. 

Some hidden worlds--whether in space, deep in the ocean, or in the form of waves or microbes--remain stubbornly unseen. Here's how technology is being used to reveal them.

Over the past decade, NASA and industry have demonstrated to the FAA through a series of tests that drones can safely maneuver around each other by adhering to UTM. And last summer, the agency gave the go-ahead for multiple drone delivery companies using UTM to begin flying simultaneously in the same airspace above Dallas—a first in US aviation history. Drone operators without in-house UTM capabilities have also begun licensing UTM services from FAA-approved third-party providers.

UTM only works if all participants abide by the same rules and agree to share data, and it's enabled a level of collaboration unusual for companies competing to gain a foothold in a young, hot field, notes Peter Sachs, head of airspace integration strategy at Zipline, a drone delivery company based in South San Francisco that's approved to use UTM. 

“We all agree that we need to collaborate on the practical, behind-the-scenes nuts and bolts to make sure that this preflight deconfliction for drones works really well,” Sachs says. (“Strategic deconfliction” is the technical term for processes that minimize drone-drone collisions.) Zipline and the drone delivery companies Wing, Flytrex, and DroneUp all operate in the Dallas area and are racing to expand to more cities, yet they disclose where they're flying to one another in the interest of keeping the airspace conflict-free.

Greater adoption of UTM may be on the way. The FAA is expected to soon release a new rule called Part 108 that may allow operators to fly beyond visual line of sight if, among other requirements, they have some UTM capability, eliminating the need for the difficult-­to-obtain waiver the agency currently requires for these flights. To safely manage this additional drone traffic, drone companies will have to continue working together to keep their aircraft out of each other's way.

Trump should strive to support innovation in the energy industry, and that'll take more than erecting costly trade barriers.

 President Trump and his appointees have repeatedly stressed the need to establish “American energy dominance.” 

But the White House's profusion of executive orders and aggressive tariffs, along with its determined effort to roll back clean-energy policies, are moving the industry in the wrong direction, creating market chaos and economic uncertainty that are making it harder for both legacy players and emerging companies to invest, grow, and compete.

MIT Technology Review's guest opinion series, offering expert commentary on legal, political and regulatory issues related to climate change and clean energy. You can read the rest of the pieces here.

The current 90-day pause on rolling out most of the administration's so-called “reciprocal” tariffs presents a critical opportunity. Rather than defaulting to broad, blunt tariffs, the administration should use this window to align trade policy with a focused industrial strategy—one aimed at winning the global race to become a manufacturing powerhouse in next-generation energy technologies. 

By tightly aligning tariff design with US strengths in R&D and recent government investments in the energy innovation lifecycle, the administration can turn a regressive trade posture into a proactive plan for economic growth and geopolitical advantage.

The president is right to point out that America is blessed with world-leading energy resources. Over the past decade, the country has grown from being a net importer to a net exporter of oil and the world's largest producer of oil and gas. These resources are undeniably crucial to America's ability to reindustrialize and rebuild a resilient domestic industrial base, while also providing strategic leverage abroad. 

But the world is slowly but surely moving beyond the centuries-old model of extracting and burning fossil fuels, a change driven initially by climate risks but increasingly by economic opportunities. America will achieve true energy dominance only by evolving beyond being a mere exporter of raw, greenhouse-gas-emitting energy commodities—and becoming the world's manufacturing and innovation hub for sophisticated, high-value energy technologies.

Notably, the nation took a lead role in developing essential early components of the cleantech sector, including solar photovoltaics and electric vehicles. Yet too often, the fruits of that innovation—especially manufacturing jobs and export opportunities—have ended up overseas, particularly in China.

China, which is subject to Trump's steepest tariffs and wasn't granted any reprieve in the 90-day pause, has become the world's dominant producer of lithium-ion batteries, EVs, wind turbines, and other key components of the clean-energy transition.

Today, the US is again making exciting strides in next-generation technologies, including fusion energy, clean steel, advanced batteries, industrial heat pumps, and thermal energy storage. These advances can transform industrial processes, cut emissions, improve air quality, and maximize the strategic value of our fossil-fuel resources. That means not simply burning them for their energy content, but instead using them as feedstocks for higher-value materials and chemicals that power the modern economy.

The US's leading role in energy innovation didn't develop by accident. For several decades, legislators on both sides of the political divide supported increasing government investments into energy innovation—from basic research at national labs and universities to applied R&D through ARPA-E and, more recently, to the creation of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, which funds first-of-a-kind technology deployments. These programs have laid the foundation for the technologies we need—not just to meet climate goals, but to achieve global competitiveness.

Early-stage companies in competitive, global industries like energy do need extra support to help them get to the point where they can stand up on their own. This is especially true for cleantech companies whose overseas rivals have much lower labor, land, and environmental compliance costs.

That's why, for starters, the White House shouldn't work to eliminate federal investments made in these sectors under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, as it's reportedly striving to do as part of the federal budget negotiations.

Instead, the administration and its Republican colleagues in Congress should preserve and refine these programs, which have already helped expand America's ability to produce advanced energy products like batteries and EVs. Success should be measured not only in barrels produced or watts generated, but in dollars of goods exported, jobs created, and manufacturing capacity built.

The Trump administration should back this industrial strategy with smarter trade policy as well. Steep, sweeping tariffs won't  build long-term economic strength. 

But there are certain instances where reasonable, modern, targeted tariffs can be a useful tool in supporting domestic industries or countering unfair trade practices elsewhere. That's why we've seen leaders of both parties, including Presidents Biden and Obama, apply them in recent years.

Such levies can be used to protect domestic industries where we're competing directly with geopolitical rivals like China, and where American companies need breathing room to scale and thrive. These aims can be achieved by imposing tariffs on specific strategic technologies, such as EVs and next-generation batteries.

But to be clear, targeted tariffs on a few strategic sectors are starkly different from Trump's tariffs, which now include 145% levies on most Chinese goods, a 10% “universal” tariff on other nations and 25% fees on steel and aluminum. 

Another option is implementing a broader border adjustment policy, like the Foreign Pollution Fee Act recently reintroduced by Senators Cassidy and Graham, which is designed to create a level playing field that would help clean manufacturers in the US compete with heavily polluting businesses overseas.  

Just as important, the nation must avoid counterproductive tariffs on critical raw materials like steel, aluminum, and copper or retaliatory restrictions on critical minerals—all of which are essential inputs for US manufacturing. The nation does not currently produce enough of these materials to meet demand, and it would take years to build up that capacity. Raising input costs through tariffs only slows our ability to keep or bring key industries home.

Finally, we must be strategic in how we deploy the country's greatest asset: our workforce. Americans are among the most educated and capable workers in the world. Their time, talent, and ingenuity shouldn't be spent assembling low-cost, low-margin consumer goods like toasters. Instead, we should focus on building cutting-edge industrial technologies that the world is demanding. These are the high-value products that support strong wages, resilient supply chains, and durable global leadership.

The worldwide demand for clean, efficient energy technologies is rising rapidly, and the US cannot afford to be left behind. The energy transition presents not just an environmental imperative but a generational opportunity for American industrial renewal.

The Trump administration has a chance to define energy dominance not just in terms of extraction, but in terms of production—of technology, of exports, of jobs, and of strategic influence. Let's not let that opportunity slip away.

Addison Killean Stark is the chief executive and cofounder of AtmosZero, an industrial steam heat pump startup based in Loveland, Colorado. He was previously a fellow at the Department of Energy's ARPA-E division, which funds research and development of advanced energy technologies. 

Federal scientists warn that Americans could feel the effects of the new administration's devastating cuts for decades to come.

On Wednesday, the Wikimedia Foundation announced it is partnering with Google-owned Kaggle—a popular data science community platform—to release a version of Wikipedia optimized for training AI models. Starting with English and French, the foundation will offer stripped down versions of raw Wikipedia text, excluding any references or markdown code.

Being a non-profit, volunteer-led platform, Wikipedia monetizes largely through donations and does not own the content it hosts, allowing anyone to use and remix content from the platform. It is fine with other organizations using its vast corpus of knowledge for all sorts of cases—Kiwix, for example, is an offline version of Wikipedia that has been used to smuggle information into North Korea.

But a flood of bots constantly trawling its website for AI training needs has led to a surge in non-human traffic to Wikipedia, something it was interested in addressing as the costs soared. Earlier this month, the foundation said bandwidth consumption has increased 50% since January 2024. Offering a standard, JSON-formatted version of Wikipedia articles should dissuade AI developers from bombarding the website.

“As the place the machine learning community comes for tools and tests, Kaggle is extremely excited to be the host for the Wikimedia Foundation's data,” Kaggle partnerships lead Brenda Flynn told The Verge. “Kaggle is excited to play a role in keeping this data accessible, available, and useful.”

It is no secret that tech companies fundamentally do not respect content creators and place little value on any individual's creative work. There is a rising school of thought in the industry that all content should be free and that taking it from anywhere on the web to train an AI model constitutes fair use due to the transformative nature of language models.

But someone has to create the content in the first place, which is not cheap, and AI startups have been all too willing to ignore previously accepted norms around respecting a site's wishes not to be crawled. Language models that produce human-like text outputs need to be trained on vast amounts of material, and training data has become something akin to oil in the AI boom. It is well known that the leading models are trained using copyrighted works, and several AI companies remain in litigation over the issue. The threat to companies from Chegg to Stack Overflow is that AI companies will ingest their content and return to it users without sending traffic to the companies that made the content in the first place.

Some contributors to Wikipedia may dislike their content being made available for AI training, for these reasons and others. All writing on the website is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license, which allows anyone to freely share, adapt, and build upon a work, even commercially, as long as they credit the original creator and license their derivative works under the same terms.

The Wikimedia Foundation told Gizmodo that Kaggle is paying for the data through Wikimedia Enterprise, a premium offering that allows high-volume users to more easily reuse content. It said that reusers of the content, such as AI model companies, are still expected to respect Wikipedia's attribution and licensing terms.

Look alive: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) may have picked up signs of a potential biosignature on a steamy, ocean-covered exoplanet called K2-18b—a biosignature that, on Earth, is produced by marine life.

The main character here is dimethyl sulfide, a molecule produced by many ocean denizens, but especially plankton. If the molecule is really floating around in the atmosphere of K2-18b, it raises the tantalizing possibility that something on the world might be alive. Or at least emitting suspiciously life-like chemical signals.

K2-18b, located 120 light-years away, has been on scientists' radar since NASA's Kepler space telescope spotted it in 2015. It's about 8.6 times the mass of Earth and orbits within the habitable (or “Goldilocks”) zone of a red dwarf star.

Earlier observations from Hubble hinted that K2-18b had water vapor in its atmosphere, a claim later shown to be in error. But JWST has taken matters several steps further, doubling down on an earlier finding of dimethyl sulfide in the planet's atmosphere. The team behind the discovery, led by Nikku Madhusudhan from the University of Cambridge, includes researchers from five institutions.

The finding suggests that K2-18b may indeed be a Hycean world, or a water-covered planet with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere. But the team's observations—made using JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and earlier data from NIRISS and NIRSpec—revealed methane and carbon dioxide, but very little ammonia, on the planet.

The curious mix suggests K2-18b hosts a watery, potentially habitable environment. Crucially, the team also found more evidence of dimethyl sulfide, along with a related molecule, dimethyl disulfide. The team's work repeats the 2023 detection and adds further credence to the possibility of life on the relatively nearby exoplanet—assuming the findings are sound and that dimethyl sulfide is produced and behaves on exoplanets the same way it does on Earth. The team's findings are published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.

Speaking to the BBC, Madhusudhan said his team detected a surprising amount of gas during the single observation. “The amount we estimate of this gas in the atmosphere is thousands of times higher than what we have on Earth,” he explained, saying that, if the link to life is valid, “then this planet will be teeming with life.” And should scientists confirm the presence of life on K2-18b, “it should basically confirm that life is very common in the galaxy,” Madhusudhan told the British broadcaster.

In its landmark decadal survey on astronomy and astrophysics, the National Academies made one thing clear: finding habitable worlds should be a top scientific priority. The James Webb Space Telescope is front and center in that mission—and while NASA already has plans for its eventual successor, the Habitable Worlds Observatory, that next-gen telescope won't launch for at least another decade. Until then, it's up to Webb—and the ever-reliable Hubble—to carry the torch in our search for life beyond Earth.

The detection isn't a done deal yet—it comes with a statistical confidence of around 3-sigma (about 99.73%), which makes it interesting, but not definitive. A 5-sigma detection (roughly 99.99994% confidence) is typically the gold standard for confirming a discovery. And even at 5-sigma, that would merely confirm the presence of dimethyl sulfide in the planet's atmosphere—not that the dimethyl sulfide has biotic origins. There's still a chance that abiotic (non-biological) processes or instrumental quirks could be responsible. This past Sunday, a separate team posted a paper on the preprint server arXiv suggesting the planet may not be Hycean at all, but instead a rocky world covered in magma, with hydrogen-rich skies—and virtually no chance of life.

Further observations will help to validate the team's findings. But to be clear, if life does exist on K2-18b, it's likely microbial given the apparent evidence, and not a sign of alien intelligence. As an important aside, microbial life—like plankton—existed on Earth for a billion years, a long but crucial chapter that paved the way for more complex organisms to emerge. Regardless, life has never been found beyond Earth, so confirming even a single amoeba on a distant world would be nothing short of revelatory.

At minimum, K2-18b is shaping up to be one of the most promising places to search for life beyond Earth. And at maximum—if further studies validate the recent findings—we may be getting our first chemical whiffs of a living ocean on another world.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Google Is Operating an Ad Tech Monopoly, Judge Rules","https://gizmodo.com/google-is-operating-an-ad-tech-monopoly-judge-rules-2000590754","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 17:55:42 GMT","

Google is starting to have a monopoly on getting called out for having a monopoly. For the second time in under one year, the tech giant has been deemed to be operating an illegal monopoly, this time for its online advertising technology. Judge Leonie Brinkema of the US District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a 115-page ruling on Thursday that found Google violated antitrust laws to establish a firm hold over the online advertising space, allowing the company to charge higher prices and keep a larger portion of ad sales.

In his ruling, Judge Brinkema said that Google was “willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power” over parts of the web advertising business by connecting its ad server business, DoubleClick, used by publishers to sell ads on their platforms, to its ad exchange operations, Google AdX, which sells ad space off auction-style to the highest bidder.

That combination, the judge found, created a “durable and ‘predominant share of the market' that is protected by high barriers both to entry and expansion.” The judge also found that this monopolistic hold over the online ad space “substantially harmed Google's publisher customers, the competitive process, and, ultimately, consumers of information on the open web.”

The findings of the court suggest Google had a vice grip over the online advertising business. As noted by Search Engine Journal, the case showed that from 2018 to 2022, Google controlled about 91% of the worldwide publisher ad server market. It also handled as much as 65% of all ad placement transactions, which was about nine times larger than the next closest competitor. With that control, Google was able to squeeze users for 20% of the transaction cost, which it pocketed, compared to competitors taking about 10%.

Judge Brinkema's ruling found Google “liable under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act” for its monopolistic behaviors in the ad tech tool and exchange businesses, but the judge did dismiss another charge that Google had operated a monopoly in ad networks.

“We won half of this case and we will appeal the other half,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Vice President, Regulatory Affairs said in a statement to Gizmodo. “The Court found that our advertiser tools and our acquisitions, such as DoubleClick, don't harm competition. We disagree with the Court's decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.”

Do what you will with that interpretation, but what comes next is the remedies stage, which could lead to the potential breakup of Google's adtech operations. In fact, that's what the Department of Justice has asked the court to do, forcing the company to sell off some of the ad tech operations that it has amassed during its market-cornering days.

The potential resolution to this case could reshape a significant portion of Google's profit centers. Per the New York Times, Google's Ad Manager generated $31 billion in 2023, about one-tenth of parent company Alphabet's total revenue. It could also represent a redo for the government, which allowed Google to acquire DoubleClick back in 2007 for $3.1 billion without any intervention from agencies that enforce antitrust.

The ruling opens a new front for Google's fight to keep itself together. On top of this latest finding of monopolistic behavior, Google is staring down a hearing that could result in the courts forcing it to break up its search operations, stemming from a ruling last August that the company operates a monopoly in that space, too. The hearings on how to remedy that case will start this coming Monday.

With this latest finding in the adtech space, which Google will challenge, it's increasingly starting to look like Alphabet will be losing some letters soon.

A perfect example of why 8GB VRAM isn't enough for modern games.

Nvidia's launch of its entry-level RTX 5060-series GPUs is, unsurprisingly, off to a messy start. While we reviewed the 16GB version of the RTX 5060 Ti, reports and our own outreach to AIBs (add-in board partners) suggest that Nvidia is restricting access to the 8GB version of the card. Samples for 8GB cards weren't sent out, leaving reviewers scrambling to try to pick one up at retail — which is difficult when the cards all immediately sold out. Despite those difficulties, a review by the Carbon-based Technology Research Institute on Bilibili offers some insight into the kind of performance users can expect from the lower VRAM variant.First spotted by @harukaze5719, the video includes test results of two Asus-branded triple-fan RTX 5060 Ti GPUs — one with 16GB and the other with 8GB of VRAM. Most synthetic benchmark results suggest that the increased VRAM doesn't significantly impact performance. For instance, in the 3DMark Fire Strike suite of tests, the 8GB model delivered results nearly identical to the 16GB version. Notably, both GPUs show a 20–30% performance boost over the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB and are about 5% slower than the RTX 4070.





The trend continues in 3DMark Time Spy, where the 8GB model once again posts figures nearly matching the higher VRAM version. Both RTX 5060 Ti models are around 18% faster than the RTX 4060 Ti and roughly 12–14% slower than the RTX 4070. That's basically in line with our own 16GB testing.The review also features gaming benchmarks at 1080p and 1440p resolutions, where the 8GB variant remained closely competitive with the 16GB model in titles like Cyberpunk 2077, Resident Evil 4, F1 2024, and Final Fantasy XIV. Interestingly, the 8GB card slightly outperformed the 16GB card in Counter-Strike 2, while the 16GB version delivered noticeably better results in Horizon Zero Dawn. Across 14 tested games at 1080p, the review shows the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB being 16% faster than the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB, and the 16GB model 19% faster than its predecessor. At 1440p, the 5060 Ti 8GB came out 17% faster, while the 16GB version pushes ahead by 21%.



With the RTX 50-series, Nvidia's main talking point is DLSS 4 with Multi-Frame Generation (MFG). While this feature shows promise on higher-end cards like the RTX 5090 and 5080, it doesn't translate as well to the 60-class GPUs — particularly the 8GB variant. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB inexplicably performed worse than the RTX 4060 Ti 8GB at native 1440p resolution. While enabling MFG helped improve performance, pushing it to 4x delivered underwhelming results, with the 16GB version providing 22% higher performance than the 8GB card.Overall, while the RTX 5060 Ti 8GB offers decent generational improvements over its predecessor, as well as a theoretically lower price than the 4060 Ti 8GB, the VRAM remains a concern. Performance scaling in several instances, when using DLSS 4 features, proved to be more limiting than on the 16GB card. Real-world pricing will play a big role, and it's difficult to find any of these cards in stock. But even if you can find the 8GB model, it's a tough sell for gamers looking at something for the long term.Follow Tom's Hardware on Google News to get our up-to-date news, analysis and reviews in your feeds.

Data center hub or export control avoidance?


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Malaysia has become a major importer of computing systems and computer parts, such as CPUs and GPUs used for AI, from Taiwan in recent quarters, coinciding with restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on shipments of advanced GPUs for AI and HPC to Chinese entities. The surge in shipments follows increased enforcement of curbs aimed at preventing smuggled AI GPUs from entering China, as evidenced by recent busts of multiple smuggling rings and the country's commitment to further enhance enforcement. The surge is raising questions about whether Malaysia is trying to enter the cloud AI data center market, or if it is serving as a conduit for further smuggling of restricted components to China. 

Exports of computer systems from Taiwan to Malaysia totaled $1873.89 billion in March, up 366% year-over-year from $401.92 million last March and up a humongous 55,117% from $3.4 million in March, 2023, according to Taiwan's International Trade Administration, as noticed by Lennart Heim. 

The accelerating purchases of AI hardware ahead of the AI Diffusion Rule's coming into effect on May 15 are not entirely unexpected. Big companies from Asia, including those from China, may use Malaysia as a hub to stockpile their restricted hardware. 



In fact, exports of computer systems from Taiwan to Malaysia skyrocketed in December 2023, shortly after the U.S. government restricted sales of advanced CPUs and GPUs to China, according to data from Taiwan's ITA. 

However, Malaysian companies are not only importing AI servers. They also accelerated purchases of components from Taiwan, which may include AI accelerators, such as Nvidia's H100. In March, exports of computer parts from Taiwan to Malaysia increased to $60.83 million, up from $27.04 million in March 2023 and $15 million in the same month last year. 



There are things to note, though. Taiwan's ITA tracks exports based on their HS codes. Computer systems, which span from laptops and tablets all the way to AI, HPC, and storage servers, are classified under the heading 8471 with different suffixes. Taiwan's ITA only allows us to track items under headings and without suffixes, so exports of computer systems from Taiwan include both inexpensive notebooks and ultra-expensive Nvidia DGX and HGX AI servers (which Nvidia classifies as 8471.50). AI accelerators and graphics cards are classified as parts of computer systems under the heading 8473 codes, with Nvidia classifying them as 8473.30. 

Taiwan's exports of likely AI chips to Malaysia are surging (h/t @kakashiii111). HS84718 shows patterns consistent with AI chips. With US export controls coming May 15th, this could be a rush before the deadline—or just processing in Malaysia before shipping elsewhere. 1/ pic.twitter.com/fpLRQSOTf7April 15, 2025

Although we cannot distinguish between AI servers and cheap laptops based solely on HS codes, it is evident that exports of computer systems from Taiwan to Malaysia began to accelerate right after the U.S. imposed restrictions on shipments of advanced AI GPUs to China. The U.S. government recently asked the Malaysian government to tighten oversight of the country's high-tech exports to China, which suggests that there are suspicions that Nvidia's high-end GPUs are being funneled to China.

According to media reports, Chinese clients are the primary customers of Malaysian cloud data centers. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect these companies to ship AI servers from Taiwan to Malaysia, now that they cannot obtain them for China. Therefore, at least some of the high-end machines shipped to Malaysia end up in local data centers.

The motor probably only has enough torque for finer tooling and grinding projects.

An enterprising individual has shared a quick step-by-step guide showing how to convert an old Hard Disk Drive (HDD) into a small but useful variable speed disc sander. The project also requires just a modicum of time, a few simple tools, and a handful of extra components.

If you have been a computing enthusiast for more than a few years, you might have a few unwanted or dead HDDs in your possession. You might also reckon that a disc sander is a useful tool to have, but do not feel that shelling out over $100 on a dedicated device, like this one on Amazon, is worth it. If these two planets align for you, then YouTuber ProShorts101's idea might be the perfect project.

The project starts with a WD Caviar Blue WD1600AAJS. This 2009 vintage HDD offered a meager 160GB of noisy spinning rust storage. We aren't sure if this particular WD1600AAJS was still functional as data storage, but would hope not, as that would upset the gods of retro. While the 7,200 rpm motor in this 3.5-inch device might be one of the better choices available for the intended task, here it is souped-up with a 30 Amp Electronic Speed Controller (ESC), among other components.

On the topic of components, according to ProShorts101, the following list of bits and pieces is required to transmogrify your HDD into a disc sander: an old HDD, a 30A Drone ESC, a servo tester, a 12V socket, and some sand paper.



Start by disassembling the HDD, which means taking off the metal lid, removing the platter read heads and supporting assembly, and the drive controller PCB from the other side. Next, solder the ESC to the drive power pads, as shown in the video. You will then thread the ESC's cables to the front of the disc sander project. Wire up the 12V power socket and variable speed-enabling potentiometer circuit as shown.

For a clean build, ProShorts101 drilled cable routing holes, and cut and repurposed the metal lid so that only the spinning disc was exposed. This reworked lid helped secure the power socket and variable speed knob. Last but not least, it was time to cut out and mount the chosen abrasive to the spinning disc surface. ProShorts101 used lots of glue and a rough looking piece of what looked like aluminum oxide paper.

Some video viewers suggested a project-improving tweak where a Velcro surface could be added to the HDD disc, meaning a user could renew or switch sandpaper grades and types more easily.

Finally, this upcycled HDD disc sanding tool will probably not be a serious rival to even the most budget-conscious devices available at retail. Nevertheless, it might be adequate for smaller scale tasks like sharpening nail scissors or reshaping small wooden spatulas.

 April 17, 2025  

CHICAGO — Physicians hear it daily: Internet search results prompting questions. Patients walk in primed with information they've gleaned from ""Dr Google"" and they're looking for the official answer.

Three experts summarized their answers to the top questions that patients have after their scrolling sessions.

Erin D. Michos, MD, MHS, cardiologist and professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, said here at the American College of Cardiology Scientific Session 2025 that she gets a lot of questions about dietary supplements.

Thebottom line: ""Stop wasting money,"" Michos said. ""Half of US adults take a supplement,"" but ""there is no evidence that taking a daily multivitamin helps cardiovascular outcomes.""

In a meta-analysis of 18 studies that she coauthored, which included more than 2 million patients taking multivitamin or mineral supplements, ""it was essentially a wash,"" she reported. ""We didn't see harm, we didn't see benefit.""

As for calcium, several studies have suggested that calcium supplements might actually increase the risk for cardiovascular disease, she said.

In postmenopausal women, calcium supplements were associated with a 15% increase in the risk for cardiovascular disease and a 16% increase in coronary disease, according to a meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials.

And a combination of calcium plus vitamin D supplements ""didn't show a reduction in fractures, cardiovascular disease, or cancer"" in a study that was part of the Women's Health Initiative. ""Almost every outcome was null, except there was a 17% increased risk of kidney stones with calcium plus vitamin D supplements,"" Michos said.

The largest vitamin D trial was the VITAL trial, in which more than 25,000 people got a high dose of vitamin D — 2000 IUs a day — or placebo. The hazard ratio for cardiovascular outcomes and cancer was null.

She suggested pointing patients instead toward moderate sun exposure and foods high in vitamin D, such as salmon, and foods high in calcium, such as leafy green vegetables, beans, and figs.

""You do need to have adequate dietary calcium of around 1000 mg a day, and for women over 50, 1200 mg a day,"" Michos said. ""Try to get as much as you can from food. If you need to take a supplement, take the smallest amount — 500 mg or less —because of the concern of harm.""

Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH, cardiologist and director of the Food is Medicine Institute at Tufts University in Boston, said he hears a lot of questions about new diets.

""For too long, we've demonized and vilified food: too much fat, too much sugar, too much salt,"" said Mozaffarian. ""Really, the fundamental problem of why we have so much disease is that we're not eating enough of the good foods,"" he said. Rather than telling patients to eliminate things from their diet, encourage eating more of the good, protective foods, he said.

Think of food in three buckets, he pointed out: protective foods, foods to eat in moderation, and foods to avoid. Mozaffarian said he helps patients set goals to eat more of the protective foods, which include fruits, nuts, fish, vegetables, plant oils, whole grains, beans, and yogurt.

These foods are minimally processed, rich in fiber, and have nutrients that nurture the microbiome, he said.

""Starch is the single biggest problem in the US food supply,"" he said, pointing to ingredients such as refined flour and rice. The worst things in the food supply are the ultra-processed foods high in starch, sugar, and salt. It's not fat, sugar, and salt; it's starch, sugar, and salt,"" he said.

""Obesity has gone up in the United States over the last 20 years with no change in calorie intake, and physical activity has gone up. Why? It's because of ultra-processed foods,"" Mozaffarian said.

There's hope that a shift in healthcare spending will encourage eating more protective foods. ""We're starting to be able to use healthcare dollars and prescriptions to start prescribing protective foods for patients, particularly those who are low income and have insurance pay for these healthy foods,"" he said.

Steven Nissen, MD, chair of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, said he is also concerned about rising rates of testosterone use outside of medical care.

""Testosterone use in men is out of control,"" Nissen said. He pointed to the proliferation of ""low T"" centers that are contributing to the frenzy.

In 2014, the FDA convened an advisory panel to study the potential connection between testosterone and cardiovascular events after increased reports of stroke and heart attack.

Some of the information from that panel was ""very disturbing,"" Nissen said. ""About 20% of the men taking testosterone — hundreds of thousands — have never had a blood level of testosterone obtained by their physicians.""

After reviewing the literature, the FDA ""called out the use of testosterone to treat normal aging, which is inappropriate,"" Nissen said.

The FDA put out a safety communication about the possible increase in cardiovascular risk, required labeling changes, and, most important, it ""required manufacturers of approved products — 11 manufacturers — to conduct a well-designed clinical outcome trial to address the question, and they came to us to do the trial,"" Nissen reported.

That trial, TRAVERSE, randomized people to testosterone gel or placebo. The primary result is ""that we did not see excess cardiovascular events with the use of testosterone in a carefully titrated environment,"" Nissen said.

""However, we did see some adverse events,"" he said. They included ""nonfatal arrhythmias, mostly atrial fibrillation, and a marginally significant incidence of increased acute kidney injury.""

But a secondary analysis ""was very surprising,"" Nissen reported. ""We expected bone health would be improved by testosterone. That's what the literature had said in multiple studies, but in fact there was a 43% increased risk of fractures in people taking testosterone. And there were studies done that injectable testosterone, in particular, increased blood pressure by about 3.5 mm Hg. You may think that's small, but I can tell you that even 2 mm Hg over a large population will increase the risk of stroke and probably myocardial infarction.""

In February, after reviewing the TRAVERSE findings, the FDA mandated labeling changes that removed the boxed warning on cardiovascular outcomes risk, but added a new warning about increased blood pressure.

The bottom line? ""Yes, it's okay to prescribe testosterone, but if two morning levels are less than 300 ng/dL, if the patient has symptoms of hypogonadism, levels of response therapy must be monitored and should be stopped if their hematocrit is above 54%.""

Exposure to certain food additive mixtures was associated with a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D), with two specific mixtures containing emulsifiers, preservatives, and artificial sweeteners showed significant associations.

""[The study] results suggest that it may be of interest to consider potential interaction/synergistic/antagonist effects when assessing the safety of food additives and call for a reevaluation of regulations governing their use by the food industry, with the aim of enhancing consumer protection. In the meantime, these findings provide support for the public health recommendation to limit exposure to UPF [ultraprocessed foods] and their nonessential food additives,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Marie Payen de la Garanderie, Université Sorbonne Paris Nord and Université Paris Cité, INSERM, INRAE, CNAM, Center of Research in Epidemiology and Statistics, Paris, France. It was published online on April 08, 2025, in PLOS Medicine.

The observational design of the study limited the ability to establish causality. Despite adjustments for various confounders, unmeasured and residual confounding may still exist. The intake of food additives may have varied over time. Demographic characteristics of the cohort, such as a higher proportion of women, may have limited the generalisability of the findings.

The NutriNet-Santé study was supported by various public institutions, including the French Ministry of Health, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale, Institut National de la Recherche pour l'agriculture, I'alimentation et l'environnement, and others. This study received funding from the European Research Council, the French National Cancer Institute, the French Ministry of Health and the IdEx Université de Paris, and a Bettencourt-Schueller Foundation Research Prize 2021.

Simply looking at visual art, visiting a museum, or having art in your hospital room can enhance well-being, particularly repeated engagement, which can increase the meaning we feel in life, according to a new international study led by researchers from the University of Vienna. The systematic review, published in The Journal of Positive Psychology, is the first to comprehensively evaluate how, when, and why art viewing supports mental health. It was conducted by an interdisciplinary team from Vienna, Dublin, Berlin, Cambridge, and Nijmegen.

Over the past decades, the idea that the arts can support mental health has gained momentum. While creating art has long been seen as beneficial for emotional and psychological well-being, the effects of simply viewing art have remained largely underexplored. Findings to date were scattered and inconsistent, with few studies examining the conditions under which art viewing may be effective. The new review synthesized data from 38 studies involving 6,805 participants, aiming to determine not only whether viewing art improves well-being, but also when, under what conditions, and through which psychological processes it does so. These 38 studies, published between 2000 and 2023, were drawn from four major databases.

The researchers found the strongest evidence for benefits in eudemonic well-being - a sense of meaning, purpose, and personal development. ""People often think of art as a luxury, but our findings suggest that participating in viewing art activities - whether as part of one's hobbies or through a targeted intervention - can meaningfully support well-being,"" said MacKenzie Trupp, lead author and researcher at the University of Vienna and Radboud UMC, Donders Institute. ""This opens up exciting possibilities for integrating art into everyday environments and public health strategies.""

Art viewing for well-being can happen in a wide range of contexts - from museums and hospitals to living rooms and online platforms. The reviewed studies included both single exposures and longer programs with multiple sessions. Participants engaged in diverse activities, including individual viewing, guided sessions, and reflective tasks such as journaling, emotional rating, or discussion. Many interventions combined art viewing with so-called ""accessory activities"" like guided reflection or creative exercises. Reflective strategies were among the most frequently used - and may play a central role in achieving positive effects.

While earlier studies hinted at benefits such as mood improvement or stress reduction, the field lacked synthesis and conceptual clarity. The researchers identified five psychological mechanisms that help explain how art viewing supports well-being. Affective mechanisms include emotional regulation and the experience of pleasure, triggered by aesthetic responses. Cognitive mechanisms involve attention, memory, and learning - art can prompt reflection or stimulate curiosity. Social mechanisms describe how shared art experiences foster connection and reduce feelings of isolation. Self-transformative mechanisms allow for personal reflection, identity reinforcement, and a sense of meaning. Finally, resilience-building mechanisms support emotional coping, and restoration, especially in clinical or high-stress environments. Together, these mechanisms offer valuable insights for future research and help inform the design of more effective art-based interventions. To help standardize and improve future studies in this field, the authors developed the Receptive Art Activity Research Reporting Guidelines (RAARR) - a new set of criteria to ensure that future interventions and research can be better compared, evaluated, and replicated.

While the benefits of creating art are well documented, this study highlights the untapped potential of viewing art as a well-being resource. As art is already present in public and private spaces, it could be more intentionally used as a low-cost, accessible mental health tool. Policy-makers, educators, and healthcare providers are encouraged to consider these findings in the design of future spaces and programs. The RAARR guidelines will also support more rigorous and reproducible research moving forward.

The project is funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 ART*IS Project.

A recent study in the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, published by Elsevier, explores the nutrition perspectives and attitudes of Ghanaian pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers. The study sheds light on significant challenges, including food insecurity, economic constraints, and cultural influences, that impact the dietary habits and health of young mothers and their infants.

Researchers conducted a qualitative, community-based cross-sectional study in nine communities across three municipalities and two districts in Ghana's Central Region. Using focus group discussions, they gathered insights from 35 participants, including 13 pregnant adolescents and 22 adolescent mothers aged 12 to 19. The study utilized Braun and Clarke's reflexive thematic analysis framework to identify key themes shaping nutritional choices and challenges.

Lead author Christiana Naa Astreh Nsiah-Asamoah, PhD, University of Cape Coast, Cape Coast, Ghana, explained, ""The findings of this study offer insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers focused on maternal and child health, especially within socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. For professionals in healthcare and community support roles, the study highlights the importance of creating tailored nutrition education programs that address the specific needs and circumstances of pregnant adolescents and adolescent mothers.""

Five central themes emerged: health and well-being, infant nutrition, dietary habits, nutrition information sources, and social support. The findings revealed that adolescent mothers tend to diverge from recommended practices for infant and young child feeding. Economic limitations often led adolescent mothers to rely on less nutritious street foods, while many found exclusive breastfeeding for six months impractical, opting instead for complementary feeding. Limited access to nutrition education and inconsistent social support further compounded these challenges.

The study highlights the importance of strengthening nutrition education programs, improving access to affordable healthy foods, and enhancing community-based support systems to empower young mothers in making informed dietary decisions.

...

Carlo Ancelotti's future at Real Madrid now hangs by a thread following their UEFA Champions League exit at the hands of Arsenal at the quarter-final stage.

In fact, reports today suggested that the Italian could move on as early as the end of the month soon after the Copa del Rey against Barcelona on April 26.

Even if that does not turn out to be the case, there is a big possibility that Ancelotti might not be in charge of the team in the summer when Real Madrid travel to the USA for the FIFA Club World Cup.

As such, SPORT now reports that Santiago Solari could step in as Real Madrid's interim manager should Ancelotti be dismissed ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup, which will be held in mid-June in the United States.

Currently serving as the club's Director of Football, Solari would be tasked with preparing the team for the tournament if Ancelotti's departure is confirmed following the end of the La Liga season, scheduled to conclude between 24 and 25 May.

Real Madrid are set to debut in the Club World Cup on 18 June against Saudi side Al Hilal, meaning Solari would have around 24 to 25 days to work with the squad before their opening match.

However, one complication is the international break immediately after La Liga ends, during which a significant portion of the squad will be away with their national teams.

Still, Solari's familiarity with the squad and the club's structure would ease the transition and allow him to hit the ground running.

This would not be his first experience in the role. In October 2018, Solari stepped in after Julen Lopetegui was sacked, although his time in charge was short-lived.

He was dismissed on 11 March 2019 after a disastrous week: elimination by Barcelona in the Copa del Rey, another El Clasico defeat in La Liga, and a shock Champions League exit against Ajax.

Should he be appointed, Solari would lead the team until a permanent manager is found, although there is still a possibility the club secures a new coach before the Club World Cup begins, meaning he may not even take charge of a match.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

The concept is simple, and the message is clear: a cowboy flipping in the air to kick a soccer ball with the Dallas skyline in the background, featuring the patriotic colors of red, white and blue, with stars marking the ball's trajectory.

The official FIFA World Cup 2026 Dallas Host City Poster was unveiled Thursday at an event at Klyde Warren Park, attended by representatives of the local organizing committee and the illustration creator, Matt Cliff.

“When I was approached about doing this, I realized the importance of getting it right for the world,” said Cliff, a Fort Worth resident. “Knowing that this is going to be viewed in other countries and by soccer fans all over the world is mind-boggling.”

The World Cup will be played next summer in 16 cities in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

AT&T Stadium in Arlington, home to the Dallas Cowboys, will host the most World Cup matches, with nine total.

It will be the first time that 48 teams participate in the tournament.

Cliff said drawing the World Cup poster took him just a day because he knew immediately the concept he wanted to express in his work.

“I told my wife, ‘you're not going to see me for 12 hours.' I went into my dark cave, drew, and here we are,” Cliff said.

Each of the 2026 World Cup host cities created a poster to communicate to the world what their cities most represent.

In Dallas' case, the illustration combines the iconic image of a Texan cowboy in the middle of a modern, vibrant and cosmopolitan city.

“The FIFA World Cup Poster isn't just about design, although it is a wonderful design,” said North Texas FWC Organizing Committee Chief Marketing Officer Noelle LeVeaux. “It's really about storytelling. It's about capturing the heart of a community in a single image that will live on long after the last whistle blows.”

The World Cup draw will be held in December, and according to several reports, FIFA is planning to hold the event in Las Vegas.

So far, seven teams have secured their spots in the 2026 World Cup. Along with the three host nations, Japan, New Zealand, Argentina and Iran have all punched their tickets to the tournament.

At the Dallas Poster unveiling ceremony, Monica Paul, President of the North Texas FIFA World Cup 26 Organizing Committee, was pleased with the artwork that will represent Dallas around the world.

“I'm very excited about the poster. Matt did a fantastic job”, Paul said. “The design really incorporates our entire region from Dallas to Fort Worth and everywhere in between. This is another step closer to the World Cup in 2026.”

It's been a big week for American Airlines.

The Fort Worth-based airline announced Tuesday that members of its AAdvantage loyalty program would have access to free Wi-Fi on flights starting in 2026. Now, American is joining forces with FIFA to become the official North American Airline Supplier of the 2026 World Cup. 

American, which currently offers more than 2,200 daily flights to the tournament's 16 host cities, secured air travel rights across Canada, Mexico and the United States for the World Cup. According to a news release from American, FIFA's current global airline partner Qatar Airways will retain exclusive flight rights for other international flights and the two airlines will collaborate to offer travel experiences for players, fans and other stakeholders throughout the tournament.

“We are proud to partner with FIFA and look forward to connecting fans to all FIFA World Cup 26 matches,” Caroline Clayton, American Airlines' Chief Marketing Officer and Senior Vice President of Communications, said in a Thursday release. “As the home team for this historic event, we look forward to flying fans across North America to experience the passion, energy and diversity of the beautiful game.”

Through this partnership, American will promote various offers and opportunities surrounding the World Cup, including a chance for members of its loyalty program to win World Cup match tickets and redeem their miles for access to tournament matches. 

East Texas native and joint-all-time U.S. men's national team top-scorer Clint Dempsey said partnerships like this one between FIFA and American Airlines are part of the tournament's efforts to grow soccer and connect more people to the World Cup.

“You want this to make the most impact possible,” Dempsey said about the World Cup. “You want this to feel big, and by having official sponsors like American Airlines, you get that feeling.”

The partnership furthers the connection between North Texas and the world's largest sporting event. AT&T Stadium in Arlington, the home of the Dallas Cowboys, is slated to host nine matches during the tournament, the most of any venue. At least five D-FW locations have also been identified as potential sites for team base camps during the tournament.

Beyond the sporting impact, the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in downtown Dallas was recently selected as FIFA's International Broadcast Center for the World Cup. The convention center will host the main broadcast feed for all tournament games and temporarily bring about 2,000 media members covering the World Cup to town.

In the opening round of the ATP Barcelona, he defeated Galan in straight sets easily, not offering any breakpoints. Ruud was dominant from the start until the end. Medjedovic put up a big fight in the second round against Ruud. The Norwegian trailed 2-4 in the opening set but turned it around. In the second set, Medjedovic fumbled a 3-1 lead.

According to the bookies, Ruud is the slight favourite in this matchup, and we agree. He is a clay-court specialist and leads 7-0 in the head-to-head meetings against Rune. Ruud also leads 5-1 on clay against Rune. We expect him to continue that winning streak.

That being said, Ruud winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Casper Ruud winning @1.53 @bet365

The courts in Barcelona are slow. In their last meeting on clay, Ruud won in four sets, and they were not close to reaching the tiebreak in any of the sets. We expect a similar outcome tomorrow as well. Rune and Ruud are not heavy servers; we believe there will be no tiebreaks.

That being said, no tiebreaks in the match is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: under 0.5 tiebreaks @1.50 @bet365

Tsitsipas – Fils: 18.04.2025 Time TBA
H2H: 0-2

Stefanos Tsitsipas has won three of his last five matches. Last week in Monte Carlo, Tsitsipas lost in the quarterfinals against Musetti in three sets. He was the finalist here in 2023 and 2024. In the opening round, Tsitsipas defeated Opelka in straight sets. He was great under pressure, saving all three breakpoints. In the second round, Tsitsipas defeated Korda in straight sets. Tsitsipas served brilliantly, not offering any breakpoints.

Arthur Fils has won four of his last five matches. Last week in Monte Carlo, he lost against Alcaraz in the quarterfinals. In Barcelona, the Frenchman defeated Carreno-Busta in straight sets in the opening round. He saved two set points in the opening set. In the second round, the Frenchman won easily against Martinez in straight sets.

According to the bookies, this will be an almost 50-50 matchup, but we disagree. Fils is in great form and almost won against Alcaraz last week in Monte Carlo. He leads 2-0 in head-to-head meetings against Tsitsipas, and we expect the Frenchman to win against Tsitsipas once again.

That being said, Fils winning is a value bet.

Value bet/ the best odds: Arthur Fils winning @1.73 @bet365

 When Tallon Griekspoor stepped on court to face Alexander Zverev in early March in Indian Wells, he couldn't help but feel the weight of his five-match losing streak against the German. 

 “I have to say with Zverev I felt the momentum in our head-to-head pretty strongly,” said Griekspoor, reflecting on his battles with Zverev to ATPTour.com. “I beat him once in Rotterdam, and then I lost the next five times. In all of them, I was pretty close. In all of them, I had chances, at least in one of the sets. I felt like it was more of a mental barrier there.” 

 It took three hours and eight minutes of topsy-turvy action on the Indian Wells Tennis Garden's Stadium 1 for Griekspoor to snap his losing run against Zverev. He prevailed with a hard-earned 4-6, 7-6(5), 7-6(4) second-round triumph, one that reduced his Lexus ATP Head2Head deficit with the German to 2-6.

 “I don't think it was the best match we played,” said Griekspoor. “I felt like it was a mental match, a physical match. We played over three hours, but I was definitely super proud of myself, how I did it mentally there. He served for the match in the second set, I served for it in the third. I wasted five match points. 

 “So I guess it wasn't easy to do, but mentally that win meant a lot. At the same time, just getting that one out of the way, my first Top 5 win, was something I was looking for, for quite a while. That definitely gave a lot of confidence, and I played some good tennis after [to reach the quarter-finals] as well.” 

 

 Griekspoor was speaking this week in Munich, where on Friday he has the chance to notch another victory against Zverev in the quarter-finals of the BMW Open by Bitpanda. Even after his success against the German in Indian Wells, Griekspoor acknowledged that it is a tough ask for a player to simply put past experiences against an opponent out of their mind. 

 “It's never easy,” said the two-time ATP Tour champion. “I mean, it's nice when the head-to-head is going your way, but it's maybe even tougher when it doesn't go your way. It's a different match every time, but at the same time, of course you know the past, you know the history, you know how it has been before. So especially with Zverev, it was a thing in Indian Wells, and it was such a mental thing.” 

 All this perhaps makes it surprising that Griekspoor lists two rivalries in which he has losing Lexus ATP Head2Head records as his favourites on Tour. 

 “I actually like playing with Zverev, because I have been close every time and he's obviously one of the best players in the world,” he explained. “At the same time, a rivalry that pops up in my mind is actually [Alexander] Bublik, who I lost to four times, and all of them went to two tie-breaks or three sets. It has been so close all the time, but I have just never beaten him yet. So that's one I'm not too happy about, but hopefully I can turn that one around.” 



 Griekspoor's maiden Top 5 win was not the only breakthrough the Dutchman has made in recent weeks. Earlier this month he reached the championship match at the Grand Prix Hassan II in Marrakech. It was his maiden tour-level final on clay, a surprising fact considering his pedigree on the surface. 

 “To be honest, if you look at all the articles from five years ago, I always said it was my favourite surface, which it actually was,” said Griekspoor, who has won nine ATP Challenger Tour titles on the surface, including six in 2021 alone. “Especially when I was playing Challengers, I was playing so many clay matches during the year. I never went to the States. I just stayed on clay in Europe.” 

 Following his victories against Learner Tien and Yannick Hanfmann this week in Munich, Griekspoor is 5-2 for the season on clay, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. With nearly two months left of the European clay-court season, the No. 37 in the PIF ATP Rankings believes he is ready to put together a positive set of results. 

 “I am a guy who I think needs a lot of matches on clay before I find my rhythm. In the last two years, three years on Tour, one I was injured, and I just never found my way. Last year, I was struggling a lot on the clay. That's also why I went to Marrakech this year, trying to put in a lot of hours on the court. 

 “That was actually the perfect first week on clay. Played finals, played well, didn't play amazing, but still played finals, which was a very good achievement there, and I'm just looking forward to building on that. I know that if I play a lot of matches on clay, I do actually enjoy it.”

On May 25th, Roland Garros will witness one of the most emotional moments in its history with a special tribute to the legendary Rafael Nadal. It will take place on the iconic Philippe-Chatrier court, just after the day's play, when the greatest champion of the tournament will be honored. This will be part of the special events scheduled for this edition of the French Open.


A Long-Awaited Tribute


Amélie Mauresmo, the tournament director, confirmed the news: “Rafa Nadal has left his mark on the history of the French Open in many ways, which is why we will hold a tribute ceremony in his honor. We want this tribute to be special, exceptional. We want it to be a surprise for everyone.” She also revealed that they had planned to pay tribute to him last year, but ""he refused at that time. He wasn't sure it would be his last Roland Garros. Now that he is retired, he is happy to receive it.""

The president of the French Tennis Federation, Gilles Moretton, also highlighted the importance of this tribute and the unique connection between the Spaniard and the tournament: ""Rafael Nadal and Roland Garros are inseparable. We have a strong history together,"" he expressed. Both leaders recently met with Nadal to finalize the details of the ceremony, though they prefer to keep some surprises for the big day.


Nadal's Legacy at Roland Garros


Rafa Nadal, who last played Roland Garros in 2024, losing to Alexander Zverev in the first round, won the tournament 14 times between 2005 and 2022. This incredible record makes him the most successful player on clay and a living legend of the event. His dominance has been so strong that he even has a statue at the tournament grounds.

In addition to the on-court tribute, the Spanish tennis player will also be featured in a special exhibition at the tournament's official museum, the Tenniseum, offering an immersive experience for fans. He will also lend his voice to the promotional trailer for this edition, remaining present in the atmosphere of an event that has been synonymous with his career.

“The idea is to have a vision for the future, but also to celebrate those who have thrilled us in the past, and inevitably, there is a place among them for Rafael Nadal,” concluded Mauresmo. Roland Garros 2025 will not only welcome the stars of today but will also pay tribute to the one who forever marked the tournament.

Ricardo Piatti analyzes Jannik Sinner's return to the circuit, predicting great success for the Italian number one.

Jannik Sinner is finalizing details to prepare for that highly anticipated comeback, which is getting closer and closer. After a few weeks in the dark due to circumstances, the Italian number one is starting to make more public appearances by training at the facilities where the Monte Carlo Masters 1000 was recently held or by sharing training sessions with circuit colleagues like Matteo Berrettini.

The Italian player, who has given few interviews during this challenging period, confessed that he accepted those months of suspension to avoid a worse outcome. Just days away from seeing him return at the Rome tournament, excitement is building around Sinner, who will come back in the same role he left, as a strong favorite in everything.

""This whole situation has been very unpleasant for Sinner, but he will surely turn it into something positive. I think during these months Jannik holds a very important card to win Roland Garros, Wimbledon, and the US Open,"" said Ricardo Piatti to SuperTennis TV. Last year he went far in several tournaments such as the French Grand Slam, but it is true that the San Candido native has room to further increase his lead over his pursuers, besides that winning a title immediately upon his return would be quite a statement of intent.

The depth of Italian tennis

""I am sure that during these months of pause, Jannik has not stopped. During the pandemic, for example, it was one of the most crucial development phases for him. He trained physically three times a week and played tennis every day. 10 or 15 years ago, everyone won the Davis Cup and the BJK Cup except Italy, which lagged behind. Now, however, with all the tennis in Italy, we are in the right position: it is evident that having the world number 1 is an advantage, but if he is not number one, there are other players who can enter the top 10 and win tournaments.""

Alexandra Eala has ambitions to win the top titles in professional tennis.

The 19-year-old announced herself on the world stage by reaching the semi-finals of the Miami Open.

Eala defeated three Grand Slam champions in successive matches to reach the last four, and she certainly made a great impression on the fans that watched her play.

The tennis world is eager to see just how far Alexandra Eala can go in the sport, and she has the drive and desire to reach the very top.

Every tennis player dreams of winning at least one Grand Slam title in their career.

Very few have reached the pinnacle of the sport however, and Eala aims to get there, and she wants the biggest title of them all.

During an interview with Talking Tennis, Eala was asked if she would prefer to win a World number one or win a Grand Slam, and the Filipino player chose winning the Wimbledon Championships.

“Grand slam. Wimbledon,” the World number 72 said. “But if I could I would choose both!”

Eala is a left handed player who hit some thunderous forehands throughout the Miami Open, especially off the return of serve.

Her athleticism also made it difficult for her opponents to hit through her, and she is very resilient on court.

Eala's playing style and characteristics on court have seen her compared with fellow leftie Leylah Fernandez, who reached the 2021 US Open final.

When asked about those comparisons, Eala also shared what she thinks about the World number 26, who she has yet to play on the WTA Tour.

“I am not familiar with those comparisons but I think Leylah is a great player. She made the final at the US Open a couple of years back, so she is a girl who plays in her own way,” she said.

“I am not too close with her, we have had a couple of interactions, she seems like a nice girl. So I am not mad about that at all! She is a good player.”","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","Cerundolo delivers another early statement, reaches Munich QFs","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/cerundolo-shevchenko-dedura-bergs-munich-2025-thursday","Thu, 17 Apr 2025 14:14:25 GMT","

 Francisco Cerundolo's debut campaign at the BMW Open by Bitpanda could hardly have started in more dominant fashion. 

 The fifth-seeded Argentine on Thursday eased past Alexander Shevchenko 6-3, 6-2 to book his quarter-final spot in Munich. Having dropped just two games in his first-round victory against 2024 titlist Jan-Lennard Struff, Cerundolo has laid down two significant early statements to the rest of the field at the clay-court ATP 500. 

 Cerundolo and Shevchenko's maiden tour-level meeting on clay began competitively. Both players broke serve in their opening return game of the match, and Shevchenko later carved out five break points at 2-2. Yet the No. 104 in the PIF ATP Rankings was unable to convert, and his opponent won 10 of 13 games from that point to race to victory. 

“Today my hammer wasn't there, I couldn't hit the forehand like I used to hit it and what I like. But I went backwards a little bit, play with more topspin, play some slices from the backhand. I added some variety to my game and I think that was good,” Cerundolo said. “My serve wasn't working well today and I started kicking in first serves because I wanted to make them. You have to find solutions and today I think I did that.”

Captivating consistency 🇦🇷@FranCerundolo is the 1st player to reach 6 quarter-finals this season 👉 6-3 6-2 facing Shevchenko📸 @BMWOpen500 | #BMWOpen pic.twitter.com/omz6OVbkOr

 During his 82-minute triumph, Cerundolo crucially saved nine of 11 break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, while he converted five of eight himself. Now 19-8 for 2025, he is the first player to reach six tour-level quarter-finals this season, although Carlos Alcaraz will equal that tally if he defeats Laslo Djere in Barcelona later on Thursday. 

 Cerundolo will take on David Goffin in Friday's quarter-finals. The former World No. 7 recovered from a nightmare start to defeat Mariano Navone 0-6, 7-5, 6-1. With victory in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash against Navone, Goffin advanced to his first clay-court ATP Tour quarter-final since he lifted the title in Marrakech in 2022.



 In the top half of the draw, Zizou Bergs defeated breakout star Diego Dedura, with a comprehensive 6-1, 6-1 triumph. Dedura, who in his first-round match against Denis Shapovalov became the first player born in 2008 or later to contest an ATP Tour match, was unable to counter the quality of Bergs. 

 With his victory against 17-year-old Dedura, Bergs reached his maiden ATP 500 quarter-final, where he will take on Fabian  Marozsan. 

Marozsan closed the day with a 6-4, 6-4 victory against French fourth seed Ugo Humbert. Following the Hungarian's third Top 30 win of the year, he is into his seventh tour-level quarter-final and second on clay.

 Clive Brunskill/Getty Images
                        

LONDON, UK, LOS ANGELES and NEW YORK, USA - Global sports, music and entertainment company Wasserman has been appointed as the sales agency of record for WTA Ventures, the commercial arm of the WTA, to help supercharge its continued growth. Wasserman's remit will cover all partnership tiers, with specific attention dedicated to securing a new Premier Partner for the WTA.

The appointment of Wasserman comes at a time of strong momentum for the WTA, fresh off the recent launch of a bold new brand identity to elevate its impact as a leader in sports and entertainment. The new brand, along with the introduction of the new Premier Partner sponsorship package, forms part of WTA Ventures' strategy to drive the growth of professional women's tennis, building on the new record set for the WTA's commercial revenue through the 25% increase achieved in 2024.

As the powerhouse of women's professional sports, the WTA is the stage for many of the world's most celebrated athletes to perform in competition across six continents. With a cumulative global audience of more than one billion and social followers up 25% last year, the WTA remains the most watched women's sport in the world with a level of fandom that accentuates its status as an exceptional platform for brands. As well as championing its incredible athletes, the WTA uses its platform to deliver positive impact beyond sport, inspiring the next generation and supporting communities worldwide with advocacy and action for women's health and empowerment.

Wasserman's dedicated Rights Sales division will lead the partnership for the WTA. A trusted partner to the world's most iconic teams, leagues, venues and governing bodies, Wasserman continuously drives high value commercial deals for partners and recent wins within Formula 1, International Rugby and Cricket have established the Rights team as leaders within the industry.  A snapshot of current Wasserman partners includes the Los Angeles Lakers, New York Road Runners, British & Irish Lions, Netflix, Men In Blazers, South Africa Rugby, and the England & Wales Cricket Board, among several others.

Wasserman Rights Sales will work collaboratively with Wasserman's women's impact and advisory practice, The Collective, to identify prospective partners and bring these opportunities to market. The Collective is a partner of Athletes Unlimited and the Netball Super League. The practice has also provided consultancy work for a variety of Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) and National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) clubs, alongside other global rights holders including the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA).

Marina Storti, CEO of WTA Ventures, said: “The WTA is the stage where women's tennis shines and, with the energy of our new brand identity, we are driven by an ambition to elevate our impact across the world. Leaning on Wasserman's expertise, we want to identify and align with partners who share our vision to rally the world around this wonderful game, celebrate our incredible athletes and push the boundaries of what is possible through the power of sport.”

Chris Foy, Wasserman Executive Vice President and Managing Director, Rights Sales, North America, said: “It's a privilege to partner with the WTA, representing the commercial rights of one of the world leaders in sports and entertainment. Entering a bold new era, the WTA has built an incredible platform for partners, and we're excited to take the opportunity to a global market.”

The Hologic WTA Tour, which offered record-breaking prize money of $221m in 2024, is a truly global property spanning six continents. The season culminates with the WTA Finals in November, honoring the season's top singles players and doubles teams.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

The 2025 campaign has marked Russell's strongest start to a season to date, the Silver Arrows driver having scored three podium finishes across the opening four races which included a hard-fought P2 – amid a host of car issues – in last weekend's Bahrain Grand Prix.

This has sparked speculation that a new deal could be in the works for Russell to extend his stay with the team but, when asked about his future on media day ahead of the upcoming Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, the 27-year-old initially played it coy as he joked: “I'll be racing for Mercedes this weekend and next weekend as well.”

However, Russell went on to admit that he is not worried about the situation, adding: “From my side there's literally no stress, no worries whatsoever. I think when it comes to contracts everyone gets so excited about it.

“The fact is, drivers have had contracts and if they don't perform they get booted out. For drivers, performance is our currency – that's what we've got, and if you perform everything is good, so I'm just excited to go racing this weekend, focus on performance and the future sorts itself out.”

Pushed further on whether there was any truth to some of the rumours that are circulating, Russell responded: “A few of them are reasonably close I guess, but at the end of the day we've never discussed a contract prior to May or June in a season.

Russell believes that ""the future sorts itself out"" if he continues to perform well

“I would say the more abnormal point is how many drivers have these long-term deals but everyone has got exit clauses – they've all got performance clauses, so a driver who is on a three-year contract, [it] doesn't really mean anything if they've got an exit clause, or the team has an exit clause if the driver doesn't perform.

“So, as I said, it doesn't really mean a lot and if you've got a contract with a team but the team wants you gone, the team finds a way to get you gone.

The final leg of the first triple header leads us to the Jeddah Corniche Circuit, a track that has already made a mark in its short history on the F1 calendar, known for thrilling action and blistering speed.

It's not too late to join the free-to-play game to compete for the great prizes on offer each week! New players will need to select five drivers and two constructors within the starting cost cap of $100 million.

The Strategist considers five drivers and two teams that can help your F1 Fantasy team pick up the pace in Saudi Arabia.

Remember to lock in your teams before Qualifying on April 19, commencing at 2000 local time (1700 UTC).

Race Highlights: 2025 Bahrain Grand Prix

For the sake of variation in the 2x DRS Boost driver slot, the Strategist opts for an in-form George Russell in Jeddah.

The Mercedes driver has finished outside the top five in a Grand Prix just once in the last 12 races and is the best qualifier this season among non-McLaren drivers.

READ MORE: Wolff hails Russell's ‘unbelievable drive' amid numerous car issues in Bahrain as he assesses whether Mercedes can catch McLaren

Russell averages more than 27 points per race weekend this season, underpinned by three podiums in four Grands Prix.

For a reliable driver who has proven he can outperform the car across the weekend, look no further than the British driver.

Russell has consistently outperformed the W16 so far this season

Oliver Bearman arrives in Saudi Arabia after a P20 to P10 drive in Bahrain that was one of the best drives in his F1 career to date.

The Haas racer banked his second score of 20 or more points in his last three race weekends, contributing to his third consecutive $0.6m price increase.

READ MORE: Haas drivers ‘really proud' of double-points finish in Bahrain as Ocon pleased to atone for Qualifying crash

Bearman led all drivers for positions gained (10) in Bahrain and continues to build on his grid-leading 25 race positions gained this season – a great source of points for the rookie driver in 2025.

Don't forget that Bearman has some F1 experience in Saudi Arabia too, having deputised for Carlos Sainz at Ferrari last season with a stunning performance that saw the young Englishman score six points for seventh place in his first Grand Prix.

Bearman has set the bar high for rookies in F1 Fantasy this season, and isn't likely to stop anytime soon 

Fernando Alonso arrives on the Strategist's watchlist for the first time this season, at a price few expected him to be at through four races.

Although not the start to the season the Spaniard expected, he is slowly building back into form with scores of 4 and 5 after back-to-back retirements in Australia and China.

READ MORE: Stroll calls Bahrain a ‘tough weekend' for Aston Martin as Alonso admits he 'didn't have the pace'

The Aston Martin driver has excellent recent history in Saudi Arabia as well – P3 and P5 finishes in 2023 and 2024 respectively.

The Jeddah Corniche Circuit is a high-powered track that will push drivers to their absolute limits so Alonso's experience and race craft should set him up nicely for fantasy success this weekend.

Alonso has encouraging form in Saudi Arabia in recent years. Can he continue this in 2025?

Isack Hadjar returns to the Strategist's line-up for the second week in a row, after scoring 24 F1 Fantasy points in his last three races.

Most impressively, the Racing Bulls driver has shown rapid single-lap pace through only four races.

READ MORE: Racing Bulls' Hadjar reveals the ‘disaster' that compromised his Bahrain race as Lawson defends himself over brace of penalties

Hadjar has an average Grand Prix Qualifying position of 9.3, only bested by Max Verstappen and the six drivers from McLaren, Mercedes, and Ferrari.

The French driver only needs six points for the maximum price rise in Saudi Arabia, which makes him a fantastic option for points and budget gain at an affordable price.

Hadjar is in a rich vein of form for Racing Bulls

Gabriel Bortoleto is yet to make a meaningful impact in F1 Fantasy this season, but this weekend may well be a turning point for him with potential new owners on the horizon.

His budget-friendly price may provide greater cost cap flexibility to own the likes of higher-priced McLaren and Mercedes assets as many players pivot towards line-ups with these foundations.

READ MORE: Bortoleto keen to move on from ‘challenging' weekend in Bahrain as Hulkenberg reflects on ‘pretty dreadful' race incident

Another clear benefit to running the Brazilian in your F1 Fantasy team is that he cannot fall any lower in price ($4.5m is the price floor for all assets in F1 Fantasy), regardless of how he scores.

Preserving and increasing cost cap value remains as important as ever in F1 Fantasy and having a driver that is currently immune to losing any additional value can help this strategy.

Other drivers to monitor: Oscar Piastri, Pierre Gasly

Bortoleto's friendly price makes him an option for F1 Fantasy strategists this weekend

McLaren have not let up in F1 Fantasy after four races, leading all teams in fantasy production for total points (335), which include individual metrics such as Qualifying teamwork points (40) and fastest lap points (30).

Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris have won three of the first four races to start the year, and they are showing no signs of slowing down.

READ MORE: McLaren bosses hail ‘perfect weekend' from Bahrain winner Piastri – but warn that it's ‘a matter of time' before ‘epic battle' with Norris

McLaren also offer exceptional value this season, despite being the highest priced asset in the game, averaging 2.75 points per $1 million spent – good for second overall in the F1 Fantasy Teams standing.

For a superb foundation of points and continued cost cap growth, the Woking-based outfit remains unmatched.

McLaren continue to provide fantastic production week in, week out

Following a couple of races in the F1 Fantasy wilderness after a double disqualification in the Chinese Grand Prix, Ferrari re-enter the Strategist's thoughts after top-5 finishes from both drivers in Bahrain.

The Scuderia have the second-highest points average over the last two race weekends (64.5), as they build towards their first Grand Prix podium of the season.

READ MORE: Vasseur urges Ferrari to ‘stay calm' after mixed fortunes in Bahrain as he explains why Hamilton's frustration was ‘appreciated'

Ferrari lead all teams for fast pit stop points per race (6.3) including back-to-back 10-pointers in Japan and Bahrain - the only team to manage this feat so far in 2025.

With two experienced drivers equipped to navigate the tight turns and fast straights in Jeddah, Ferrari are an attractive differential team this weekend.

Other constructors to monitor: Mercedes, Haas

As always, be sure to keep a close eye on free practice to help guide your decisions for drivers and teams in the lead up to the team lock deadline!

As the number of projects going into production gets cut, disruptive trade policy will only drive up prices for costumes and sets for U.S. shoots.


							By 

	Katie Kilkenny


Labor & Media Reporter


	Hollywood is bracing as President Trump's promised (and ever-fluctuating) tariffs threaten to balloon the price of materials required for physical production, from lumber to fabric.


	For many in the production space, fears are mounting that the current and threatened tariffs, as well as the unpredictability of the future of global trade, could harm the already-weakened state of domestic film and television set work.




	Creatives who spoke to The Hollywood Reporter largely aren't yet feeling the impacts of the latest developments in import taxes. After Trump announced a baseline tariff on all imported goods with further penalties for about dozens of countries on April 2, he reversed course and now the 10 percent baseline, a 25 percent tariff on certain Canadian and Mexican goods, cars and steel and aluminum imports and a 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods is in effect, for now.

					That U.K. Netflix Tax? Not Going to Happen. But Streamers May Get Dragged Into Trump's Trade War		
			









	But some industry types aren't taking any chances. Construction coordinator Karen Higgins, who has worked on projects like WandaVision and Twin Peaks: The Return, says she and others in her cohort are stockpiling materials. Still, she notes, “You can only store so much lumber.”


	Mike Orth, the senior project manager at North Hollywood's full-service set shop 41 Sets, has been telling customers that if their projects don't happen soon, prices for his company's services could go up based on increased materials costs. “Paint suppliers are saying that the tariffs are going to affect them and that we can expect a 30 percent increase on paint materials,” he notes.


	While no production department would be spared the brunt of an escalated trade war, the art department would be hit particularly hard given its reliance on raw materials. To construct sets, crew members frequently use lumber that might often be sourced from Canada and Southeast Asia, plywood from Southeast Asia and steel from China.


	Tobey Bays, the business agent for property craftspersons' union IATSE Local 44, thinks there could be a “significant increase” in costs for big builds if tariffs escalate. If that is the case, says Bays, who earlier in his career worked asa leadman for ER and Thirteen, “There might be some artistic decisions that will be made” — like projects opting for simpler builds, more on-location work and more visual effects.

	











	The wardrobe department would also see unique impacts. Productions often source fabrics from all over the world and sometimes import rental costumes from well-known houses in Europe. U.S.-based vendors could also face steeper costs and raise prices: Diana Foster, the president and owner of North Hollywood's costume rental and manufacturing service United American Costume Co., buys shoes in Mexico and Guatemala, leather and furs in Canada, fabrics in the U.K. and trims from Pakistan and India to service her shop's specialty of original and reproduction clothing from 1770 to 1970. She also ships costume rentals and purchases across borders to wherever clients' productions are taking place.


	She says any increased costs would have to be passed on to the producers. “You can't have these independent companies in the motion picture industry who have already tried to recover from COVID, from two union strikes, absorb any more in overhead,” she says. “They just can't do it.”


	In a contractionary industry environment, with the state of the business still delicate, several creatives also express concerns that any additional production costs might supercharge the decades-long trend of productions moving overseas for savings. “I think people are really worried as to how to keep the small number of state-based jobs that are here if we can't source things [from other countries] cheaply and quickly,” assistant costume designer Shealyn Biron (Ford v Ferrari, Bombshell) says.

	











	“The industry has been hit hard by a confluence of events — COVID, the strikes, the [L.A.] fires, box office being down, people changing their viewing habits,” says director and former studio exec George Huang (Swimming With Sharks), a professor at UCLA's School of Theater, Film & Television. “I just worry that with everything else taken as a whole, does this become the feather on the hood of a car that's dangling on the edge of a cliff?”


	Which poses the question: Could Trump's tariffs — implemented for the stated purpose of bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. and persuading Americans to invest in more domestically-produced products — ironically have the opposite effect on American film and television, pushing it ever more overseas?


	With Trump adding tariff exemptions on April 11 to iPhones, computers and other electronics, it's clear that any punitive tariffs could be here today and gone tomorrow. But as Huang points out, this period of total unpredictability arrives as studios are more risk-averse than ever. “The uncertainty economically for everyone is definitely causing a slowdown or just a bit of a pause on everything,” he says. “The studios were skittish before. Now they're really skittish.”

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


	Here's an exciting pairing: Rising star Glen Powell (Twisters) is teaming with filmmaker Judd Apatow (Trainwreck) on an untitled original comedy for Universal.


	In a move reminiscent of his work alongside Richard Linklater on Netflix's Hit Man, Powell is writing the script with Apatow, continuing to cement his reputation as the rare A-list skill with this kind of skill set. The project, about a country western star in free fall, is being fast-tracked at Uni, with Powell set to star and Apatow directing.


	Apatow will also produce through his Apatow Productions, which has a longstanding overall deal with the studio, dating back to his 2005 directorial debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin. His tenure there has also spanned films including Knocked Up, Funny People, This Is 40, Trainwreck and The King of Staten Island.

	Powell and Dan Cohen will also produce through their company, Barnstorm's newly minted first-look deal with the studio, along with Kevin Misher through Misher Films, another producer with an expansive history at Universal. Senior Executive Vice President of Production Development Erik Baiers will oversee the project on behalf of the Studio.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The Apatow comedy will mark Powell's second project with the studio on the heels of Twisters, which overperformed last summer with the biggest domestic opening ever for a natural disaster film, grossing over $372 million in total. Upcoming, Barnstorm is also set to produce The Natural Order for the studio, with Powell starring and Barry Jenkins directing, as we were recently first to report.


	Powell has a lot on his plate right now, between Edgar Wright's The Running Man, out November 7, and a slate of upcoming projects including an untitled feature from J.J. Abrams, Hulu comedy Chad Powers, and A24/StudioCanal's Huntington, among others. He is repped by CAA and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole.


	A three-time Emmy-winning comedy icon, Apatow's most recent feature efforts include the Pete Davidson vehicle The King of Staten Island for Universal, Netflix's The Bubble, and the documentary Bob and Don: A Love Story on the lifelong friendship between Bob Newhart and Don Rickles. He is repped by WME, Mosaic, and Ziffren Brittenham.

Film Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Netflix and Jennifer Lopez are building on their strong partnership for the superstar's next project, with plans to team her with an iconic director. Sources tell Deadline that Oscar winner Robert Zemeckis has come on to direct an adaptation of The Last Mrs. Parrish, with Lopez on board to star.


	The film is in development with Oscar-nominee Andrea Berloff and Oscar nominee John Gatins penning the script. This marks a reunion for Zemeckis and Gatins, who worked together on the Oscar-nominated Denzel Washington drama Flight.


	Liza Chasin is producing for 3dot Productions along with Molly Sims for Something Happy Productions, and Lopez, Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas and Benny Medina for Nuyorican Productions. Margaret Chernin of 3dot will exec produce as will Lynne Constantine and Valerie Constantine, Jack Rapke and Derek Hogue.

	











	Based on the Liv Constantine novel, the story follows a con artist (Lopez) who targets a wealthy couple — the Parrishes — as her next victims. She infiltrates the pair by befriending the wife and seducing the husband, with the master plan of becoming the next Mrs. Parrish, only to discover that the wife's life is far more complicated than she could have imagined. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	The 2018 novel was a Reese Witherspoon book club pick, has sold more than 1 million copies and been published in about three dozen countries.


	Lopez and Netflix have had a strong partnership that includes action thriller The Mother and sci-fi epic Atlas, and Last Mrs. Parrish gives her another edgy project to sink her teeth into. Lopez has been working with prolific directors of late including Bill Condon, who directed her Sundance pic Kiss of the Spider Woman. That film will get an awards-season release in theaters in the fall..

	While Zemeckis' long list of blockbusters include the Back to the Future franchise, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Cast Away and the Oscar-winning Forrest Gump, this film brings him back to his adult thrillers like What Lies Beneath and Allied.


	Zemeckis' latest directorial effort was last year's Here for Sony Pictures and Miramax that reunited him with Tom Hanks and Robin Wright. An intimate story taking place in one location over the span of generations, the film premiered at AFI Fest and closed out the Chicago Film Festival, where Zemeckis received the festival's Founder's Award.

	











The Last Mrs. Parrish falls under Chasin's creative partnership with Netflix, which sees her produce feature films via her shingle 3dot. The latest film from the partnership, The Life List starring Sofia Carson, has spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Netflix Global Top 10 Films List (English). It also falls under the creative partnership between Lopez's Nuyorican and Netflix, where Lopez, producing partner Goldsmith-Thomas and longtime manager Benny Medina are producing a slate of films, TV series, scripted and unscripted content, with an emphasis on projects that support diverse female actors, writers and filmmakers.

Vin Diesel has a message for Universal Pictures, urging the studio to provide fans with a release timeframe for the next installment in the Fast & Furious franchise.


	In a new social media post, Diesel pleaded with the film studio to share with “the best fans in the world” when the next movie will be released.


	“Universal… Please tell the best fans in the world, when the next movie is coming out. Please…,” Diesel shared on Instagram.


	Diesel shared a photo of himself as Dominic Toretto and his co-star Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz. The actor also used the hashtag “#LosBandoleros2,” which referenced the short film Los Bandoleros that served as a prequel to 2009's Fast & Furious 4.

	The short film was released as part of the special edition home release of Fast & Furious 4, focused on Diesel's Dominic as he sets up the hijacking of a fuel tanker in the Dominican Republic. Rodriguez, Sun Kang, Tego Calderón and Don Omar also starred.

	Days before, Diesel shared a post where he also alluded to a sequel to Los Bandoleros.


	“As I continue to travel this beautiful world… I ponder which would be the most magical desert for Los Bandoleros 2!” he shared.

A post shared by Vin Diesel (@vindiesel)


	Diesel previously shared the projects he was working on in 2025, which included Fast X: Part 2, set to be the grand finale of the Fast & Furious franchise.


	Diesel also hinted that he was continuing “the fight to bring Fast X2, the finale, back to LA this summer.”


	The actor had previously expressed his desire to film the latest installment of the Fast & Furious franchise in LA to help the local economy following the devastating wildfires.


	“Last week, during the fires that displaced LA… my sister Jordana [Brewster] reached out to me and said… Please have Universal film the rest of Fast X Part 2 in LA,” Diesel said.


	He continued, “Los Angeles needs it now more than ever… Los Angeles is where Fast and Furious started filming 25 years ago… and now Fast will finally return home. All love…”

The 2025 Berlin Film Festival jury, led by Todd Haynes, fell hard for their eventual Golden Bear winner “Dreams (Sex Love),” the third entry in a trilogy from Norwegian director Dag Johan Haugerud. Now, Strand Releasing has announced the acquisition of the film, about the fallout of a young woman's (Ella Øverbye) crush on her female French teacher (Selome Emnetu), for North American release. Strand will also release the prior films in Haugerud's Oslo Trilogy, “Sex” and “Love,” this summer as well. Watch the trailer for “Love” below.

 










Here's the official synopsis of Berlin winner “Dreams,” as a refresh: “In ‘Dreams,' Johanne falls in love for the first time, with her teacher. To preserve her feelings, she documents her emotions and experiences in writing. When her mother and grandmother read what she has written, they are initially shocked by its intimate content but soon see that it has literary potential. As they debate whether to publish it, Johanne navigates the gap between her romantic fantasy and reality, and all three women confront their differing views on love, sexuality, and self-discovery.”

“Sex,” about the complicated friendship between two straight, middle-aged men who muse on desire and shifting sexuality, premiered at the Berlinale in February 2024; “Love,” about two healthcare workers who bond over their own approaches to romance and relationships, premiered at the Venice Film Festival later in 2024.

Back at the Berlinale, “Dreams (Sex Love)” was not to be confused with another film, the similarly titled “Dreams,” in the competition and from director Michel Franco — perhaps why it was necessary to include the parenthetical. “Dreams (Sex Love)” was one of the best films to premiere at this year's Berlinale, with IndieWire's Harrison Richlin writing, “In truth, one of the deep studies Haugerud seems to explore in his work is how dreams aren't just held while one is sleeping, but as a function of our daily lives.”

Jon Gerrans of Strand Releasing negotiated the deal for the trilogy with Maren Kroymann and Cinthya Calderon of m-appeal world film sales.

The Oslo Trilogy, as it's deemed, is set for an exclusive New York City engagement beginning with “Love” on May 16, followed by “Sex” on June 13, and “Dreams” on September 12 at Film Forum. The films will have national rollouts after their respective opening dates in cities around North America.

 










Haugerud's films join a Norwegian tradition alongside another Oslo Trilogy, from Joachim Trier, who directed “Reprise,” “Oslo, August 31st,” and “The Worst Person in the World” as a triad as well.

“We're thrilled to be taking this exciting trilogy through Film Forum and across North America. Mr. Haugerud's thoughtful and beautifully crafted films should resonate well with audiences here as they have in their native country and throughout Europe,” said Gerrans.

Current Strand films in release include “Marcello Mio,” “Meeting with Pol Pot,” and “Viet and Nam,” as well as Lisa Cholodenko's restoration of “High Art” and the restoration of James Bidgood's “Pink Narcissus.”

Watch the trailer for “Love” below.

Glen Powell‘s passion for working with acclaimed directors continues with a buzzy, yet untitled comedy alongside Judd Apatow. 

Powell will star in the next film as directed by Apatow in which Powell will portray “a country western star in free fall,” which is giving real “A Star Is Born” vibes. Powell will also co-write the script alongside Apatow, and the project is being fast-tracked by Universal Pictures. 

Both Apatow and Powell will also produce the comedy, as will former Universal Pictures President of Production Kevin Misher via his Misher Films banner. 

 










Powell, who previously penned “Hit Man” with auteur Richard Linklater and is writing a Broadway musical with Ryan Murphy, will produce alongside Dan Cohen through their Barnstorm banner's newly minted first look deal with Universal. Powell first collaborated with Universal for “Twisters,” and his company Barnstorm is also producing the recently announced “The Natural Order” for the studio, with Powell attached to star and Barry Jenkins directing.

Apatow's relationship with Universal began with his 2005 directorial debut “The 40-Year-Old Virgin,” and he has since directed “Knocked Up,” “Funny People,” “This is 40,” “Trainwreck,” and “The King of Staten Island” for the studio. 

Senior Executive Vice President of Production Development Erik Baiers will oversee this latest project on behalf of Universal.

Jenkins and Apatow are not the only acclaimed filmmakers with whom Powell has projects in the works. Powell recently wrapped production on John Patton Ford's revenge thriller “Huntington” for A24 and Studio Canal, and he'll next be seen in Edgar Wright's “The Running Man” adaptation for Paramount Pictures. He will also lead the Hulu comedy series “Chad Powers” based on an Eli Manning sketch about a quarterback whose college career ends after bad behavior; Powell is executive producing the series under Barnstorm. 

As for Apatow, the untitled Universal Pictures comedy is one of the many features he is developing. He is currently in production on HBO Documentary Films' two-part documentary on the life and career of Mel Brooks for HBO Documentary Films; Apatow is producing and co-directing with Michael Bonfiglio. Apatow was also announced in 2024 to be directing “Cola Wars,” a film about the battle for market share between Coca Cola and Pepsi to become America's favorite soda. Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment is producing that one, with the film being written by “Acapulco” co-creators Ben Queen and Jason Shuman.

 










Powell is represented by CAA and Johnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole. Apatow is represented by WME, Mosaic, ID and Ziffren Brittenham LLP.

The subject of filmmaker Sepideh Farsi's upcoming Cannes documentary “Put Your Soul on Your Hand and Walk,” the Palestinian artist and photojournalist Fatma Hassona, as well as her family, has allegedly been killed during an Israeli missile strike on her building in Gaza. Set to be featured as part of Cannes' parallel section ACID, which is run by France's Association for the Diffusion of Independent Cinema (l'ACID), the film follows Hassona as she captures the atrocities being committed in her homeland via her camera, as well as helping those who are grieving tremendous loss.

 










In a release shared with IndieWire, the filmmakers behind the project, as well as members of the ACID team said of Hassona, “Her smile was as magical as her tenacity: bearing witness, photographing Gaza, distributing food despite the bombs, mourning, and hunger. We heard her story, we rejoiced at each of her appearances to see her alive, we feared for her.”

Farsi shared the unfortunate news of Hassona's death via the French publication Libération, in which she wrote, “She had just turned 25. I got to know her through a Palestinian friend in Cairo, while I was desperately searching for a way to reach Gaza, while hitting blocked roads, seeking the answer to a question both simple and complex. How does one survive in Gaza, under siege for all those years? What is the daily life of Palestinian people under war? What is it that Israel wishes to erase in this handful of square kilometers, with so many bombs and missiles?”

The Iranian filmmaker labeled Israel's action as being in line with “genocide” and put the blame not only on its governing body, but all of the international “accomplices” involved in supporting what she sees as a campaign of terror against the Palestinian people. Farsi also shared an excerpt from one of Hassona's poem, titled “The man who wore his eyes,” which reflects the overwhelming presence of death she faced, as well as the fullness of the life she lived. Please read it below.

Maybe I'm ushering in my death

now

Before the person standing in front of me loads

His elite sniper's rifle

And it ends

And I end. 

Silence.

Chappell Roan is once again asking her fans to keep it more casual. On the latest episode of Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers' Las Culturistas, the pop singer discussed how several fans online mischaracterized the viral Saturday Night Live skit in which Yang compared Roan's massive success with the internet-famous pygmy hippo Moo Deng. “People don't have to get mad on my behalf,” Roan said. “I wasn't even mad!” she exclaimed.


	In fact, Roan found the skit funny. “That is SNL, it's comedy,” Roan stated, adding, “It was so light-hearted. It was, to me, harmless.” 




			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	At the time, Drag Star winner Sasha Colby even confirmed Roan's good sense of humor to Yang. “I was like ‘Is she okay?' Sasha was like, ‘yeah girl, she's laughing, she's loving it.” Meanwhile, co-host Rogers also recalled “getting texts from people asking ‘are Bowen and Chappell okay?'” and being confused by it. “Why are we assuming that people don't have a sense of humor?” he said.

	For Roan, the whole misunderstanding only proved how often fans online cross boundaries. “Even if you didn't think the Moo Deng sketch was funny, you don't have to say anything,” she said. 


	Since her breakout moment in 2024, Roan has been open about her struggles with fame and being a highly visible person in public. In her Rolling Stone cover story, Roan shared how far certain fans have gone to get a picture with her or talk to her, and even revealed that she's had stalkers. “I don't want to be agoraphobic. That's [how] most of my peers [feel],” she said at the time. “Every fucking artist is on this page. Everyone is uncomfortable with fans. Some people just have more patience. I fucking don't.”

	Shortly before midnight on April 15, United States District Court Judge for the District of Columbia, Tanya S. Chutkan dealt Donald Trump's administration another in a series of lower court losses. The court issued a preliminary injunction that blocked Trump's effort to claw back $20 billion in federal funding for vital climate and green energy programs and usurp the power of the U.S. Congress, and required the immediate release of the now frozen funds. 


	Within 24-hours, the Trump administration filed an appeal with the D.C. Circuit Court, winning a partial victory which requires that the funds remain frozen while it examines Judge Chutkan's ruling.


	Two weeks earlier, Judge Chutkan told a chastened Trump administration lawyer, “I've asked you repeatedly, and you've been very candid with me, in saying that you don't know what the evidence is of waste, fraud, and abuse, and violation of the law, and corruption… Here we are, weeks in, and you're still unable to proffer me any information.” 

	











	Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Chutkan is a former public defender and Harvard Law School faculty member. She has served for over a decade on the U.S. District Court for D.C., where she presided over Trump's federal election subversion case and several January 6 insurrection cases. She controls her courtroom through a combination of congenial humor, incisive questioning, and an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. 


	She is rarely rattled, but lost her patience with the administration's lawyer Marcus Sacks as he admitted — yet again — that the government had absolutely no evidence to present supporting its repeated claims of potentially criminal charges. The claims impact dozens of small and large, local and national nonprofit organizations — including some of the most highly-respected and well-known service organizations in the nation — working throughout the country to implement the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the most far-reaching climate and environmental justice law in U.S. history.

	It was the third hearing before the court in the consolidated case of Climate United v. Citibank in which the plaintiffs — including the nonprofits and several state attorneys general — are suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the third time the Trump administration failed to proffer any evidence to support its allegations against them.

	











	Since taking office, the Trump administration has tried to seize and ultimately froze $20 billion in congressionally appropriated and contractually obligated funds held in the nonprofits' bank accounts at Citibank — actions that Georgetown constitutional law professor David Super calls “spectacularly illegal.” The administration has canceled the nonprofits' grants following a visit to the EPA from Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), engaged in a public campaign of harassment and intimidation with the help of a right-wing media smear operation, and launched an FBI investigation into many of the nonprofits' activities. A veteran U.S. prosecutor was forced to resign, and three temporary restraining orders had already been placed on the administration by the court. Despite it all, the administration came up with nothing to show for its very public assault.


	Asked if the government had any new information to offer regarding the reasons for terminating the nonprofits' grants, Sacks replied, “We do not, Your honor.”


	Asked if the government had followed the law when it terminated the grants, Sacks replied, “That's a complicated question.”


	With that astounding admission, I felt the air leave the courtroom as 50 people simultaneously sucked in their breath, stopped moving, and an emotion somewhere between stunned and an angrier, “I told you so!” passed between those gathered before the court.

	Judge Chutkan had already found that the EPA likely violated the law when it terminated these grants. Since the first temporary restraining order issued on March 18, the court has enjoined the administration from canceling the grants and attempting to seize the funds from Citibank. The preliminary injunction requires that those funds be released as Judge Chutkan considers a final ruling on the merits of the case. The D.C. Court of Appeals interjected, rescinding (for now) only that part of the injunction that unfroze the funds, following on the heels of a similar U.S. Supreme Court ruling on April 4.


	“If the current president wants to ask Congress to repeal the IRA and the funding that goes along with it, he is free to do so, but no president or federal agency can single-handedly undo an act of Congress, much less in the improper and disgraceful way this president and EPA have tried to go about it,” said Attorney General of Minnesota Keith Ellison in a statement last month. “We are also holding Citibank accountable for improperly complying with the government's campaign of intimidation and freezing funds that it is required by law to release.”

	











	If Judge Chutkan ultimately rules against the administration, as she seems poised to do, it could be a significant victory in the effort to restrain Trump's increasingly fascist presidency, regularly obstructing the rule of law and usurping unprecedented authority from the U.S. Congress. Trump is defying the Constitution, refusing to implement laws and court orders he dislikes. He refuses to distribute congressionally appropriated funds — which he would rather give away as tax cuts to the world's largest corporations and wealthiest individuals, including his biggest political financial supporter and the world's richest man, Elon Musk. He is yet again acting at the behest of the fossil fuel industry in its best efforts to stay relevant long after its time has passed. 


	This particular scheme involves Trump's effort to claw back the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)'s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The Fund includes billions of dollars to create a national network of lenders, including state and local “green banks,” capable of not only financing projects to reduce climate and air pollution and build the green energy economy, but also ensure that its benefits reach all Americans, including those who have not only borne the brunt of the harms of the fossil fuel industry, but have also been largely shut out the transition away from its products.


	Trump does have more cards up his sleeve — namely a majority in the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump scored his first Supreme Court victory of his second term on April 4 in a ruling that may signal the court's intention to greenlight not only his attacks on federal funding, but also on programs that address racial inequality.


	Michele Goodwin, Professor of Constitutional Law and Global Health Policy at Georgetown Law School, says that the Supreme Court ruling raises critical concerns about the court's willingness to intervene on behalf of the president, “When Donald Trump says, jump, is it that this is a court that will say, ‘How high would you like for us to jump, Mr. President?'”


	Last June, John Legend could be seen casually walking through the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C. He wasn't there for a gig or a social visit. He was on a tour with local nonprofit organization, Jubilee Housing, as part of his HUMANLEVEL Initiative, which aims to raise awareness and encourage public and private stakeholders to invest in solutions to ensure everyone has access to safe, affordable homes.

	











	On March 25, I joined Jubilee Housing on the same tour to learn about its work with the D.C. Green Bank. The D.C. government established the D.C. Green Bank in 2018 to lend money to meet the District's 100 percent renewable energy sustainability goals by using public funds to mobilize private investment, becoming the first U.S. city with its own Green Bank. The D.C. Green Bank is among the dozens of nonprofits that received a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund award whose accounts are frozen at Citibank. It received a $10 million award in January that was frozen in February. So that I could see first-hand what these and other Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds will ultimately support, I visited a project already well-underway and undertaken with its existing funds. (Representatives of the D.C. Green Bank declined to be interviewed for this article.)


	Jubilee Housing is a 50-year-old affordable housing and service organization. “It's pretty incredible when you think about how much it costs to live anywhere, but D.C. in particular,” communications manager Jennifer Shannon tells me. “We provide deeply affordable housing for individuals and families earning just 30 percent or less of the median,” or about $45,000 or less a year for a family of four in D.C., she explains.


	With the help of a $3 million loan from the D.C. Green Bank Jubilee is transforming the King Emmanuel Baptist Church and an adjacent building into deeply affordable and energy-efficient green housing. Speaking at the groundbreaking ceremony a few weeks earlier, King Emmanuel Pastor Daryl Bell said, “for the individuals who are coming to this place, you're putting seeds in their life, seeds of hope.” 


	“Instead of redlining people out, we green-line them in,” Jim Knight, President and CEO of Jubilee shares later by email.


	Carting blue hard hats and fluorescent yellow vests, I join Shannon and several other Jubilee staff to take the short walk from their office over to the church through the heart of Adams Morgan. Inside King Emmanuel, purple velvet pews, a functioning pipe organ, and colorful paintings depicting the life of Jesus are mixed in with piles of insulation recently pulled out of the wall, stacks of color swatches, and the efficient buzz of construction workers. Next-door, the additional 52-unit construction is also well underway, with the smell of fresh paint hitting us as we walk along cement floors passing by drywall, exposed aluminum pipes, and construction plans tapped to the walls. 

	











	“I had a gentleman in here earlier today who was getting ready to move into the new building, and he had himself, his wife, three children, and a grandma — six of them. Right now, they have one bedroom, but he's getting a four-bedroom,” Jordan Shahin, vice president of Jubilee's Real Estate Development, tells me.


	D.C. Green Bank's loan provides the financing for all of the green components of the construction. These high-performance energy efficiency upgrades reduce electricity costs and carbon emissions. They include energy-efficient appliances and lighting, HVAC heating and cooling systems, high-efficiency insulation, a rooftop solar system, and even a working farm.


	Tim Tutt is the Managing Director of Jubilee Farms. He has a warm congeniality and a shock of white hair. Though he doesn't mention it, I'm not surprised to learn that he holds a Doctor of Ministry with a focus on Public Theology and is an ordained clergyperson, having served as the pastor of several churches. 


	Tutt explains that the farm will include two large greenhouses growing some 13,000 plants a month year-round. Residents will grow the food, prepare, and serve it in a communal kitchen. For those residents coming home from incarceration (nearly 60 percent of D.C.'s unhoused population was formerly incarcerated), this will be part of workforce reentry training, earning food handler and food prep certification. They'll eat the food they grow, package some into delivery boxes for other residents of affordable housing, and sell produce at farmers markets and to restaurants to raise income. “When you can feed your neighbor, there's a sense of camaraderie, there's a lot of pride,” Tutt says.


	“What you need to imagine in here are four big fish tanks with koi swimming around, pooping like we hope they do with abandon,” Tutt says, a huge smile overtaking his face as he gestures to the now-empty basement. The water is pumped out of the fish tanks and up to the plants that grow in towers on the roof with the fish poop serving as fertilizer. No pesticides, combined with locally grown and eaten food, means less fossil fuels burned.


	Shahin explains that many banks lack the resources, knowledge, or will to make green investments. “It's challenging because it costs more, and the cost is all upfront,” he tells me. Add rising interest rates and “these extras are the first thing to go,” Shahin says. “So, it's great that there's programs like the D.C. Green Bank and others that are helping us bridge that gap and get over that hump.”

	











	The financing also attracts private investors. “When they see multiple capital sources in the stack — especially the D.C. Green Bank, which is very well known in our area — it makes them more excited to be part of the project,” he adds, and, like any other bank loan, “D.C. Green Bank will get its money back, plus interest,” which it then reinvests into other projects.


	“It's better for our residents, better for the environment, and allows us to recapture some of the savings. The building uses less energy, it's more efficient, we don't have as many issues with stormwater management, so we can really benefit,” Shahin adds.


	They are also fortunate. Unlike most of the nation, D.C. has an established local Green Bank with experienced green lenders, and Jubilee's loan was not reliant on its Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds. 


	The staff are understandably reluctant to enter the fray of the political storm surrounding the fund. But Tutt says, “We certainly are glad for the most possible money to come into the pipeline to do this type of work. It fits with our mission, our ethos, our way of caring for the world and our way of being good neighbors. The more federal money, the better.”


	In April 2024, the EPA awarded three nonprofit coalitions a total of $14 billion from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to support existing and establish new green banks, lenders, and projects across the country. Like all IRA grants, at least 40 percent of these funds must reach environmental justice and other underserved communities.


	Two newly formed coalitions — Climate United Fund and Power Forward Communities — received $7 billion and $2 billion, respectively. The Coalition for Green Capital, a coalition of local green banks and lenders formed in 2009, received a $5 billion award.


	The D.C. Green Bank is a member of the Coalition for Green Capital and, through it, received its Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund award. 


	Andreas Karelas is the executive director of RE-volv, which received a (frozen) $300,000 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund award through the Climate United Fund for pre-development work to help get local solar projects off the ground and finance-ready in traditionally underserved communities, including low-income and communities of color, that have a hard time getting financing for their projects. Karelas has spent the better part of the last 15 years watching a growing divide between those able to benefit from the burgeoning green energy economy and those left out. He sees the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as “a once-in-a-lifetime, historic opportunity” to bridge the gap. 

	











	Fossil fuels are the primary cause of the climate crisis. Nearly seven in ten Americans want the U.S. economy to transition from fossil fuels to 100 percent clean energy by 2050. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund is an important tool to achieve that end.


	Asked why it's now under attack by the Trump administration, Karelas tells me matter-of-factly, “I think the fossil fuel industry is scared.”


	Last year, then-candidate Trump brazenly told 20 fossil fuel company executives that for $1 billion in support for his campaign he'd give them lucrative tax and regulatory favors. High among the industry's priorities is the expansion and continuation of Trump's 2017 tax law, which will cost trillions of dollars. On his first day in office, amid a slew of executive orders, Trump ordered the immediate halt of the disbursement of all IRA funds — part of a broad, government-wide freeze of federal funding issued despite the Constitution explicitly giving Congress the power to appropriate funding. Lawsuits have resulted in several wins, unlocking funds that are now flowing again, including the IRA's Solar for All program. 


	The $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds are unique among EPA programs. Using a model common to the Treasury Department, it designated Citibank as a fiscal agent of the U.S. government and distributed the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds to the bank which holds the money in separate accounts opened by the grantees. Citi is one of the world's leading fossil fuel financiers and, as such, the focus of extensive protest. It is not an IRA awardee and is not a part of the Green Bank effort. 


	In order to claw back the $20 billion, the Trump administration enlisted the FBI to convince Citibank to freeze its clients' accounts, sought a court order to seize the funds, and canceled the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund contracts.


	On February 12, Musk's DOGE team was reportedly granted unprecedented access to the EPA's contracting system, as it sought to identify and terminate contracts that ran counter to Trump's executive orders. 


	On the same day, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin posted a video on Musk's platform, X, announcing that he had found “billions of taxpayer dollars parked at a financial institution by the Biden-Harris Administration.” He cited a sting operation by the conservative misinformation operation Project Veritas, which covertly filmed a former EPA staffer, at what looks like a party, describing the agency's effort to disburse IRA funds at the end of the Biden administration as “throwing gold bars off the Titanic.” 

	











	Zeldin said he was calling for the immediate return of the entire balance and was referring the matter to the Department of Justice. “The days of irresponsibly shoveling boat loads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,” he said. 


	Over the next six weeks, Fox aired at least 56 separate segments discussing the $20 billion climate funding — the vast majority of which “explicitly or implicitly” framed the funding “as fraudulent, wasteful, or abusive,” reports Media Matters.


	What unfolded next is now well-documented in numerous press reports and court submissions.


	On February 18, veteran U.S. prosecutor Denise Cheung resigned as Chief of the Criminal Division in the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C., ending a more than two decade-long career at the DOJ. She refused to follow an order by Trump-appointee, acting U.S. Attorney General for D.C., Ed Martin, to force Citibank to freeze the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund bank accounts, citing insufficient evidence of criminal activity.


	Martin is a MAGA loyalist and ring-wing activist with no previous prosecutorial experience. He delivered a speech at the U.S. Capitol on the eve of the Jan. 6. attack and has since overseen the dismissal of hundreds of Jan. 6 cases, including one of his own clients. He's described his team of prosecutors as “President Trump's lawyers.”


	Martin reportedly instructed Cheung to open a criminal investigation and issue grand jury subpoenas based at least in part of the Project Veritas video. Cheung consulted with the FBI but could not determine that any probable cause existed for securing a warrant that could freeze the nonprofits accounts at Citibank. She determined that a “recommendation” letter from the FBI to Citibank to impose a 30-day freeze was a compromise position. When Martin demanded she send a follow-up letter that required Citibank to institute a freeze and Cheung refused, Martin demanded her resignation. 


	Martin then personally submitted a warrant application to seize the funds from Citibank, but was refused by a U.S. magistrate judge, who cited a lack of evidence. Trump's former personal attorney and then-Acting Deputy Attorney General, Emil Bove, reportedly asked another U.S. Attorney's office to launch a grand-jury investigation and pursue the same investigation and warrant application, which they, too, refused to do. 


	Martin sent letters to at least two awardee organizations ordering the groups to turn over records to the FBI, according to Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

	











	The apparent attorney-shopping finally landed at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, under the leadership of Hayden O'Byrne. At the request of O'Byrne's office, the FBI has questioned current and former EPA employees, and has subpoenaed certain Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund recipients to appear in federal court. A representative of one awardee organization tells me that several of its employees have been questioned by the FBI.


	O'Byrne was appointed on January 27, the same day he signed a motion to dismiss the Palm Beach classified documents case against two of Trump's employees. The Miami Herald describes O'Byrne as a member of the conservative Federalist Society and his office as having “lost a half dozen senior career prosecutors… causing a brain drain and leadership void,” with morale sinking “to a new low.”


	Upon receiving two letters from the FBI on February 17 that listed 36 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund awardees, Citibank promptly froze all of the accounts. Several of the groups then sued. On the eve of the first court hearing, the EPA canceled their grants, claiming “substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the agency's priorities.”


	Democrats in Congress led by Sens. Whitehouse and Edward Markey (D-Mass.) accused the EPA of “lawlessness and a disdain for the Constitution.” They demanded the restoration of all Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (and IRA) funds and investigations into the DOJ's actions. Markey denounced the administration's weaponization of the FBI to carry out “a literal bank heist,” declaring its investigation “McCarthyesque” and an “illegal and unethical witch hunt.” 


	“When the federal government signs on the dotted line that this is a contract, is that something that we and all people globally can rely upon or not?” posits Dale Bryk, Senior Attorney at Harvard Law School Environmental and Energy Law Program. “Which goes to the question of do we operate under the rule of law in this country, or don't we?”


	The administration's attacks have forced Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund recipient groups to shutter planned projects, freeze salaries and benefits, and face imminent staff layoffs and even closure, in addition to the potentially crippling reputational harm both to the organizations and the entire project of green banking and finance. Ensnared in Trump's net are little-known nonprofits; two of the nation's most well-known service organizations, Habitat for Humanity and United Way; and Democrat Stacey Abrams.

	











	Without this money, “projects won't get funded,” Kari Groth Swan tells me. Swan is the executive director of the Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority, also known as Minnesota's Green Bank. The bank received a (frozen) $25 million Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund award from the Coalition for Green Capital, which “constitutes 20 percent of our budget,” she says. 


	Dr. Antony Stately is a member of the Ojibwe and Oneida tribes and CEO of the Native American Community Clinic in south Minneapolis. Stately is awaiting a (frozen) Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund award from Climate United Fund to provide key financing for a new clinic that he plans to build using solar and geothermal energy that will include affordable housing. 


	He tells me about two large freeways and other local polluting environmental conditions that contribute to the poor health and high risk of his clients, including asthma, lung disease, obesity, and diabetes. The ability to “create a zero-carbon footprint was an instrumental game changer for us,” he says. “It means we wouldn't be producing more toxins in the environment by creating a building that relied on other forms of fuel.”


	Trump and Musk chose Stacey Abrams as the focal point of their public vendetta against the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, repeatedly accusing the Georgia Democrat of improperly directing and profiting off its funds. 


	Abrams previously worked for Rewiring America, an electrification nonprofit and one of five organizations that formed Project Forward Communities to apply for and win a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund award focused on affordable single-family and multi-family housing. The coalition included Habitat for Humanity, United Way, and two of the nation's largest Community Development Financial Institutions. 


	Abrams “has not received a penny of this EPA grant,” according to Tim Mayopoulos, the CEO of Power Forward, and did little more than help identify potential partners for the coalition. She left Rewiring America in December.


	Habitat for Humanity and United Way left the coalition in March.


	In separate statements, spokespeople for Habitat for Humanity International and United Way Worldwide (UWW) tell me that the decision to leave the coalition was made in order to avert the impact of an unprecedented legal battle with the federal government on the pursuit of their respective core missions. They express their support for the coalition, with Habitat sharing its confidence that “these issues will be resolved favorably,” and UWW praising the coalition partners for “their nonpartisan focus on putting money back in the pockets of everyday Americans through improving home energy efficiency, lowering home energy costs, and boosting local economies.” 

	











	An official with Power Forward calls the federal government's actions both unprecedented and unfounded, putting all grantees in impossible positions. Habitat for Humanity may revisit its role with the coalition if the litigation is resolved favorably, but United Way Worldwide, which received the smallest sub-award of all the partners, advised that it could no longer be involved due to the impact of the litigation on their broader philanthropic efforts. 


	Sources also confirm that neither Habitat Capital nor Habitat for Humanity International (separate recipients of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund funds) have received direct FBI inquiries related to the fund.


	Like many others interviewed for this article, Phil Aroneanu, Chief Strategy and Partnerships Officer at Climate United Fund, says, “We want to get back to work.” He says the largest costs of inaction will be to job creation, clean air and water, and particularly to communities that have long been underserved and overburdened. 


	Mustafa Santiago Ali spent 24-years at the EPA building and curating the federal government's work on environmental justice begun under the George H.W. Bush administration. Reflecting on the Trump administration's focused assault on environmental justice targeting communities of color and lower wealth white communities, he tells me, “We knew that they were going to go after vulnerable people and vulnerable and marginalized communities. It's short-sighted because we have so many challenges on the environmental and climate front that, if not addressed, will end up costing our country in both dollars and lives. It places a clearer vision on whom they see as sacrificial. They've always been clear about who they are.”


	Despite all of the events that unfolded over the last two and a half months, by the time the Trump administration arrived in Judge Chutkan's courtroom on April 2, it abandoned its claims of wrongdoing against the nonprofits. “This remarkable concession means that the grounds for termination” set out by the EPA when it canceled the contracts “were not only disparaging, but known by EPA to be false,” wrote plaintiffs in their brief to the court.

	Trump has not stopped the FBI and other investigations into the nonprofits, which remain ongoing. But for now, the EPA's claim whittles down largely to just one: The new administration has different priorities.


	“I don't think anybody's going to argue — I certainly wouldn't find that EPA can't change direction and decide that a particular program no longer suited the agency's goals. But you have to comply with the law when you do that, and that's the crux of the issue here,” Judge Chutkan concluded.

It doesn't matter whether you're the Ghostbusters, Mulder and Scully, or the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense — every paranormal operation worth its salt needs a solid headquarters.

Watch new episodes of SurrealEstate Thursdays at 10/9c on SYFY.

The same rule applies to the Roman-Ireland Agency on SYFY's SurrealEstate (now in the midst of its third season), and thanks to star Sarah Levy, fans can take a good look around the office where the team led by Luke Roman (Tim Rozon) and Susan Ireland (Levy) strategizes over how to best tackle haunted properties. Generally speaking, the office is as standard as they come, with a reception area, coffee station, desks, and conference rooms. At first glance, you'd never be able to tell this business specializes in ghosts and demons.

""It feels wonderful to be in this brand-new office,"" Levy says in the video below. ""It's just a different feel, a different vibe. There's just a lot more space to talk and hang out. That's one of the things I love about it the most.""

Sadly, the agency has had some recent trouble finding someone to take over the front desk from Zooey L'Enfant (Savannah Basley). In a recent interview with SYFY WIRE, Levy noted that the scariest thing for the agency personnel is not supernatural threats, but the anxiety of having to acclimate to new co-workers.

""Especially walking up to the desk in the [office] and somebody else is sitting at reception, there's a bit of a record scratch when you see somebody else sitting there,"" she said. ""It does throw off the dynamic that you, as actors, have created with each other, seeing Savannah at the desk and [Maurice] stopping by, and all of our gang hanging in the office. Seeing somebody brand new, you're not as comfortable moving through the set as actors would normally be. So it definitely was a bit of like life imitating art in that sense.""

Samples drilled by the Curiosity rover on Mars have revealed abundant signs of a carbon cycle that remained hidden from orbital scans, alongside clues of how life may have been wiped out on the planet.

NASA's Curiosity rover has found some of the best evidence yet that ancient life may have existed on Mars — and an answer for what could have wiped it out.

When drilling into rocks on Mount Sharp, the central peak of the Red Planet's Gale Crater, the rover found evidence of siderite, an iron carbonate whose presence suggests Mars once had a carbon cycle. This hints that Mars once had potentially habitable conditions, and therefore possibly even life.

The finding, hidden from satellite scans, raises hopes that once samples collected by the Perseverance rover are brought to Earth, scientists may find evidence that ancient life once thrived on our now-desiccated neighbor. The researchers published their findings April 17 in the journal Science.

""When it became apparent that these rocks contained siderite in such high quantities, I was unbelievably excited,"" study lead-author Ben Tutolo, an associate professor with the department of earth, energy and environment at the University of Calgary, told Live Science. ""One of the biggest questions in Mars science is: 'Where are all the carbonates?' So I knew right away how important this discovery was.""

For roughly the last 4 billion years, Earth's carbon cycle has been key to its habitability — cycling carbon between the atmosphere, land and ocean, thus providing the key material for all living things and setting the atmospheric thermostat for them to thrive. The slow carbon cycle makes up half of this system. Spewed out from volcanoes, carbon dioxide is absorbed by calcium-rich oceans to form limestone rock that is subducted back into the mantle, heated and released once more.

Yet despite Mars showing plentiful signs that ancient rivers and lakes once criss-crossed the planet, neither rovers nor satellite scans had found any evidence of carbonate minerals that would imply a carbon cycle there.

Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.

The Curiosity rover's discovery changes all of that. Landing on Mars' Gale Crater in 2012, the rover has traversed 21 miles (34 kilometers) of the 96-mile-wide (154 km) meteor impact crater, dutifully investigating the geology within. In 2022 and 2023, Curiosity drilled four samples from rocks in the crater and analyzed the mineralogy using its onboard X-ray diffractometer before beaming the results back to Earth.

When Tutolo and his colleagues unpacked this analysis, they found that the rocks didn't just contain traces of siderite, they were rich in it — making up between 5 % to 10% of the sample's total weight. Mixed among the carbonate were other minerals, particularly highly water-soluble magnesium sulfate salts, which the researchers believe are acting to ""mask"" the siderite's signal from satellite scans.

""Because similar rocks containing these salts have been identified globally, we infer that they, too, likely contain abundant carbonate minerals,"" Tutolo said. ""Summing the carbonate that all of these deposits likely contain indicates that they may hold a substantial portion of the CO2 that was formerly implicated in warming Mars.""

The researchers believe that if their sample is representative of the whole planet, it likely points to Mars having an ""imbalanced"" carbon cycle. As Mars seemingly lacked Earth-like plate tectonics, toward the tail-end of its habitability Mars likely recycled its carbon into its atmosphere through chemical reactions with acidic water, a hypothesis supported by the presence of sulfate and iron-oxide minerals found within the sample.

But this process was top-heavy, pulling more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and into rocks than it released back. In the long run, this diminished the planet's ability to support an atmosphere, possibly snuffing out Mars' ancient life at the same time it began to flourish on Earth.

""Life may have been forming about that time on Earth. Our oldest fossils are about 3.5 billion years old and life must have formed before then,"" Janice Bishop, a senior research scientist at the Search For Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute and the writer of an accompanying perspective piece on the study, told Live Science. ""As the atmospheric gasses [on Mars] were lost over time to space, the atmosphere became thinner and the planet became colder. Estimates of surface ages indicate that Mars has been cold and dry for at least 2 billion years.""

Further revelations won't come from a direct retrieval of samples collected on Mars' surface any time soon — that mission is significantly over budget and delayed. But Curiosity is set to continue exploring the Martian surface to understand how the rocks there formed, and what it finds can be included in simulations of the planet's ancient climate.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard discusses plans to release assassination files of Robert F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr., during a cabinet meeting.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified a Biden-era plan to counter domestic terrorism that called for greater information-sharing with tech companies and a legislative push to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

Developed in 2021 after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, the plan outlined a government-wide effort to track how foreign actors use disinformation to radicalize Americans and urged coordination with private industry on domestic threats. It also called for measures to curb in-prison radicalization and study extremism within the military.

Among its proposals was a plan to ""develop awareness training for active service military members, DOD employees and contractors, and those service members separating or retiring from the military on the threat posed by domestic terrorism, the potential targeting of those with military training by violent extremist actors, and relevant reporting mechanisms.""

The strategy had a four-part goal: ""Understand and Share Domestic Terrorism-Related Information,"" ""Prevent Domestic Terrorism Recruitment and Mobilization to Violence,"" ""Disrupt and Deter Domestic Terrorism Activity"" and ""Confront Long-Term Contributors to Domestic Terrorism.""

The Biden administration plan encouraged ""teaching and learning of civics education that provides students with the skill to fully participate in civic life,"" and promoted ""literacy education for both children and adult learners and existing proven interventions to foster resiliency to disinformation.""

It also called for advancing ""inclusion"" in the Covid-19 response and addressing ""hate crime reporting barriers faced by disadvantaged communities by promoting law enforcement training and resources to prevent and address bias-motivated crimes; improve federal hate crimes data and analysis to eliminate hate crimes underreporting; mitigate xenophobia and bias.""

Former President Joe Biden's administration launched the first-ever National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism in 2021, identifying domestic terrorism as a major national security threat in the wake of the Capitol riot. 

Gabbard declassified the strategy after prompting from conservative groups like America First Legal.

The group wrote to Gabbard earlier this month, asking her to declassify the strategy amid concerns of ""weaponization"" of power by ""censoring disfavored speech on the Internet by labeling such speech ‘misinformation,' ‘disinformation,' ‘hate speech,' ‘domestic terrorism.'""

Biden's summer 2021 counterterrorism strategy garnered criticism from the American Civil Liberties Union, which said it ""reflects the government's ever-expanding authority to surveil and monitor American communities; law enforcement guidance that permits profiling on the basis of race, religion, or national origin; and the use of abusive tools such as the watchlisting system against people for constitutionally protected speech and association.""

Netflix posted a major earnings beat on Thursday, as revenue grew 13% during the first quarter of 2025.

The streamer attributed its better-than-expected revenue to higher-than-forecasted subscription and advertising dollars.

In late January, the company increased its pricing across the board, raising its standard plan to $17.99 a month, its ad-supported plan to $7.99, and its premium plan to $24.99.

The report marks the first time that the streaming giant did not disclose quarterly subscriber data as it shifts its strategy to focus on revenue and other financial metrics as performance indicators.

Netflix's earnings also come as traditional media stocks have been slammed by a tumultuous market prompted by President Donald Trump's trade policy.

Netflix, however, said it continues to forecast full-year revenue of between $43.5 billion and $44.5 billion.

""There's been no material change to our overall business outlook,"" the company said in a statement Thursday.

As investors worry about the potential impact of tariffs on consumer spending and confidence, Netflix's co-CEO Greg Peters said on the company's earnings call, ""based on what we are seeing by actually operating the business right now, there's nothing really significant to note.""

""We also take some comfort that entertainment historically has been pretty resilient in tougher economic times. Netflix, specifically, also, has been generally quite resilient. We haven't seen any major impacts during those tougher times, albeit over a much shorter history,"" Peters said.

Netflix shares gained about 3% in extended trading Thursday.

Here's how the company performed for the quarter ended March 31, compared with estimates compiled by LSEG:

Net income for the period was $2.89 billion, or $6.61 per share, up from $2.33 billion, or $5.28 per share, during the same quarter a year earlier.

Revenue in the first quarter jumped nearly 13% year over year, reaching $10.54 billion.

Netflix has been leaning on advertising as it seeks to soften slowing subscriber growth and said, ""a key focus in 2025 is enhancing our capabilities for advertisers.""

The company launched its in-house ad tech platform in early April in the U.S., with plans to extend into other markets in the coming months.

""We believe our ad tech platform is foundational to our long term ads strategy,"" the company said. ""Over time, it will enable us to offer better measurement, enhanced targeting, innovative ad formats and expanded programmatic capabilities.""

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., warned Thursday that U.S. markets will ""crash"" if President Donald Trump has the power to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

The comment from Warren, a frequent Powell critic, on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" came hours after Trump wrote in a social media post that the Fed chair's ""termination cannot come fast enough!""

A senior White House official later told CNBC that Trump's broadside should not be seen as a threat to fire Powell, and that there are no plans being made to end his term early.

Powell has previously said the president does not have the power to fire him.

""I have tangled with [Powell] on a regular basis about both regulations and interest rates,"" Warren acknowledged in her remarks at the New York Stock Exchange.

""But understand this: If Chairman Powell can be fired by the president of the United States, it will crash markets in the United States,"" she said.

Warren, the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, said the ""infrastructure"" upholding the stock market — and therefore the global economy — is ""the idea that the big pieces move independent of the politics.""

If key economic levers are ""subject to a president who just wants to wave his magic wand,"" then the U.S. will be indistinguishable ""from any other two-bit dictatorship around the world,"" she said.

Trump has repeatedly singled out Powell by name while urging the U.S. central bank to lower interest rates in hopes of spurring rapid economic growth.

The Fed hiked rates during President Joe Biden's term in order to tamp down the rampant inflation induced by the coronavirus pandemic and started dialing them back in 2024.

However, the Fed has said it is in no hurry to continue those cuts, pointing to the uncertainty created by Trump's shape-shifting tariff policies. Powell reiterated that stance Wednesday in a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, saying the president's import taxes are ""likely to move us further away from our goals.""

In his Truth Social post Thursday morning, Trump, while defending his wide-ranging tariff plans, slammed Powell as being ""always TOO LATE AND WRONG."" 

Powell should have lowered rates ""long ago, but he should certainly lower them now,"" Trump wrote. ""Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!""

In a sea of laptops that make it hard, if not impossible, to upgrade your system post-purchase, Framework has always believed in giving customers more options. That remains the case with the Framework Laptop 13, which is back for 2025 using the AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series platform.

If this latest system looks familiar, it's because it uses the same chassis as the Intel Core Ultra Series 1 system we reviewed in August. However, our review unit came equipped with a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor, 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a 2880 x 1920 display. You can buy a preconfigured system complete with an operating system already installed, or you can go crazy with custom configurations tailored to your personal preferences, right down to display bezel and expansion port colors.

Our review unit is a DIY Edition, meaning some partial assembly is required to get the system up and running. However, with a price tag approaching $2,000, potential buyers must weigh the ease of customization and repairs against the highly competitive (and cheaper) competition in the ultraportable space.

The Framework Laptop 13 chassis has remained consistent over the years to facilitate easy upgrades, which remains the case here. Our review unit even uses the same 13-inch 120Hz 2880 x 1920 IPS panel, and two bezel options were included: black and transparent purple. I opted for the purple because I wanted a system with a bit more visual flair. It attaches to the display panel with friction pins and magnets.

The chassis and lid are aluminum, with a shiny black Framework ""gear"" logo inlaid into the latter. The power button, located in the top right of the keyboard deck, has an LED light that lines its perimeter. The power button also has a fingerprint reader embedded for use with Windows Hello.



However, one of the most interesting parts of the Framework Laptop 13's design remains its modular expansion card bays. The laptop has two bays on either side, accommodating various ports. For example, our review unit came with USB-C, USB-A, and microSD reader expansion cards. Each card locks into place once you slide it into a free bay. A button on the bottom of the chassis for each pair of bays releases the expansion cards.

I opted to configure the review unit with two USB-C ports (at least one USB-C port is required to charge the laptop), one USB-A port, and the microSD reader. However, you can easily tailor the port allotment to suit your needs. Framework offers HDMI, DisplayPort, Ethernet, and SD reader options. If that wasn't enough, you can add storage to the system via 250GB and 1TB expansion cards. These cards are available in the standard aluminum finish or from several color options.

Pricing for the expansion cards ranges from $15 for USB-C to $125 for 1TB of storage.

Two of my gripes about our last review unit still haven't been addressed. The expansion cards are still difficult to remove from their respective bays. And the laptop's aluminum chassis doesn't match the aluminum used on the expansion cards. That makes for an unsightly color mismatch, which is unfortunately in such an expensive device.

The Ryzen AI 9 HX 370-powered Laptop 13 measures 11.68 x 9.01 x 0.62 inches and weighs 2.87 pounds, which is identical to the previous model we reviewed with a Core Ultra processor. We also brought along the Dell XPS 13 (9350), measuring 11.62 x 7.84 x 0.58 inches with a weight of 2.7 pounds, and the 2.78-pound Lenovo Yoga Slim 9i at 12.32 x 8.01 x 0.57 inches for comparison.

The claim to fame for Framework's lineup has always been modularity. The company makes it incredibly easy for the layperson to swap out external ports and most internal components (ranging from the SSD to memory to the battery, to speakers, to the entire motherboard). Even if you get stumped regarding the procedure for upgrading a particular piece of hardware, you can scan the QR code on or beside that component to watch a video guide.

Since we received the DIY Edition of the Laptop 13, I had to assemble numerous components before turning on the device. The laptop ships without the keyboard deck installed, so I first inserted the two 8GB DDR5-5600 SO-DIMMs, and then installed the 1TB SSD. Next, I inserted the ribbon cable from the keyboard deck to the motherboard, and the whole thing magnetically attached to the lower chassis. I next flipped the laptop over and tightened five captive Torx screws.

The next step was to attach the translucent purple bezel to the display and install four expansion ports (two USB-C, one microSD reader, and one USB-A).

If you need to upgrade other components, like the touchpad, motherboard, or display, you can visit the Framework Marketplace to purchase whatever you need. The options are seemingly limitless.

Our review unit has a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor, 16GB of Crucial DDR5-5600 memory, and a 1TB WD_Black SN770 SSD. Since this was the DIY Edition, we had to install Windows 11 onto the test machine.

Beginning with the Geekbench 6 synthetic CPU benchmark, the Laptop 13 with its Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 bested the competition in the single-core (2,894) and multi-core (12,924) tests, including its Intel Core Ultra-powered predecessor, which came in second. The third-place finisher was the Yoga Slim 9i, which managed 2,733 in the single-core benchmark and 11,038 with the multi-core benchmark.

The tables turned, however, when moving to the file transfer test, which involves copying 25GB of mixed media files. The newest Laptop 13 hit 1,546.23 Mbps compared to 1,893.79 Mbps for last year's model. The Yoga Slim 9i was the laggard in this test, delivering just 1,032.87 Mbps.

Moving on to the Handbrake benchmark, during which we transcode a 4K video file to 1080p resolution, the Laptop 13 with Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 finished the task in 4 minutes and 18 seconds – identical to the XPS 13 (9350). The previous Laptop 13 completed the task in 5 minutes and 48 seconds, while the Yoga Slim 9i took just over 6 minutes.

For stress testing, look to Cinebench 2024, where we perform 10 consecutive runs. The first run had the lowest score, coming in at 814.84. However, additional runs saw the numbers climb and stabilize in the 857 to 865 range.

Framework outfitted our test system with its premium 13.5-inch 2880 x 1920 IPS display, which refreshes at 120 Hz. This is the same panel included with the Core Ultra system that we tested last year, and there are some slight variances in the numbers we recorded.

In our color gamut tests, the Laptop 13 performed similarly to last year's model, covering 83.6 percent of DCI-P3 and 118.1 percent of sRGB (compared to 82.7 percent and 117 percent, respectively). The most significant difference came in brightness, where the new Laptop 13 hit 482.6 nits brightness compared to 451 nits for the previous model.



The Yoga Slim 9i with its OLED panel won the numbers game with 146.5 percent coverage of DCI-P3 and 206.9 percent of sRGB. However, those higher figures tend to make for an overly saturated display, which isn't always preferable, depending on your needs.

I had no real complaints with the display as I watched the Tron: Ares trailer. The extensive use of red in the trailer provided a nice contrast to the trailer's overall dark, nighttime themes. The blacks and darkened areas in the trailer didn't look as inky black as you'd get with an OLED panel, but the Laptop 13's IPS panel performed well here.

For better or worse, the keyboard deck on the Laptop 13 is identical to the one on the Core Ultra version. That means that while it has a similar look, feel, and key travel that I have previously likened positively to Apple's MacBook products, the half-height up and down arrow keys remain. While I understand that going with undersized keys saves some space, I would prefer if they were the same size as the left and right arrow keys.



Given my familiarity with the keyboard, my typing tests at keyhero.com were nearly identical to my previous go with this keyboard, as I averaged around 90 words per minute with 97 percent accuracy.

I'm not a fan of the top-hinged touchpad, which does a better job of registering clicks within the bottom half of the mousing surface than the top half. A nice haptic touchpad would be a nice addition to a laptop with a nearly $2,000 MSRP.

The 2025 edition of the Laptop 13 continues to use a pair of 2-watt speakers, mounted towards the front of the chassis. The speakers are average at best, but are perfectly suitable for run-of-the-mill productivity tasks that such a laptop will endure daily.

I primarily used the speakers to listen to music via YouTube Premium, ranging from bass and drum-heavy tracks from Kanye West's Late Registration album to an assortment of woodwinds, brass, and strings in the great Gustav Holst's The Planets. While the dynamic range and bass output weren't awe-inspiring, it was perfectly in line with other ultraportables I've tested, given the space constraints.

Framework outfits the Laptop 13 with a 1080p webcam using the same 9.2MP image sensor and 5-element lens as last year's model. Output from the camera is still a bit of a mixed bag, with an aggressive sharpening algorithm that tends to make facial details overly smooth and unnatural.

The camera is serviceable for videoconferencing duty, but if you need higher-quality hardware for your specific needs, you should consider adding one of the best webcams.

Battery life was a sore point with last year's version of the Laptop 13, and things haven't improved with this year's model. In fact, things have gotten worse. Our laptop endurance test involves browsing the web, streaming videos, and running OpenGL tests with the brightness set to 150 nits.



The Laptop 13 lasted just 9 hours and 11 minutes, less than even the 9 hours and 59 minutes we achieved when equipped with an Intel Core Ultra processor. For comparison, the Yoga Slim 9i went on for 11 hours and 3 minutes, while the XPS 13 (9350) was far and away the endurance champion with a runtime of 17 hours and 29 minutes.

The Laptop 13 has a single cooling fan that works overtime to keep the device cool under load. We performed skin temperature tests on the laptop while running the Cinebench 2024 stress test.

We measured 88.5 degrees Fahrenheit on the touchpad, while the measurement between the G and H keys came in at 115 degrees F. The hottest touch point was the underside of the chassis near the rear-central screw, which was a toasty 133 degrees F.

This section will be short. The Laptop 13 DIY Edition doesn't have an operating system installed, but Framework provided us with a product key for Windows 11 Home, which we installed for testing. Once installed, there's only one item that Framework adds to the Start Menu: the Framework Marketplace (which is nothing more than a web link to purchase accessories/components).

Everything else is just the standard installed apps/shortcuts you get with a default Windows 11 install. As for Linux operating systems on the Ryzen AI 300 Series systems, Framework says that Fedora 41, Bazzite, and Project Bluefin are supported out of the box. You can also install Arch Linux, but a few workarounds are needed to get up and running.

The Framework Laptop 13 comes with a one-year warranty.

The Laptop 13 DIY Edition is priced from $899 with a Ryzen AI 5 340 processor and a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 60 Hz display without RAM or an SSD. Stepping up to the Ryzen AI 7 350 brings the total to $1,029, while the Ryzen AI 9 350 increases your initial outlay to $1,659. The 2.8K display is a separate $130 upgrade.

As configured with a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor, 2.8K display, 16GB RAM, a 1TB SSD, and four expansion cards (2x USB-C, USB-A, and microSD), our review sample is priced at $1,986.

If you go the prebuilt route, the Performance (Ryzen AI 7 350, 2.2K display, 16GB RAM, 512GB RAM, Windows 11 Home. 1-year warranty) costs $1,529, the Extended Productivity (Ryzen AI 5 340, 2.2K display, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Pro, 3-year warranty) costs $1,329, and the Extended Performance option (Ryzen AI 7 350, 2.2K display, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Windows 11 Pro, 3-year warranty) for $1,689. The range-topping Extended Pro with a Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, 2.2K display, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Windows 11 Pro, and a 3-year warranty costs $2,099.

Framework continues to be in a class of its own regarding laptop customization options. Sure, some other laptop manufacturers allow you to easily upgrade memory and SSDs, but Framework goes above and beyond by allowing most components to be replaced or upgraded via the Framework Marketplace.

However, that customization and upgrade prowess comes at a price premium compared to other systems. For example, the Dell XPS 13 (9350) offers similar performance, nearly 8 hours of additional runtime per charge, and costs just $1,599 (or $1,899 for a 1600p display). The Lenovo Yoga 9i is also sub-$1,900, comes with twice the memory, a 3840 x 2400 display, and lasts longer per charge.

If all you're looking for is modularity and ease of upgrades, Framework remains your only option. However, far better options are available for less money if you strictly want a productivity-centered ultraportable with long battery life.

A new second-tier soccer league says it has 15 committed teams and attracted a variety of investors ahead of its inaugural season next year.

A new second-tier U.S. women's soccer league that is launching next year says it has attracted interest from numerous investors, including an Ohio group led by movie executives that will own a founding team and invest in the league itself.

WPSL Pro aims to bridge a “critical player development gap” in the U.S. women's soccer system, according to a Wednesday statement announcing its planned 2026 launch. It will sit just beneath the two Division I U.S. women's soccer leagues, the National Women's Soccer League and USL Super League, which launched last year. 

The new league already has 15 committed teams across markets including Atlanta, Dallas, North Carolina, New Jersey, Southern California, and more. It expects to have up to 20 teams when its inaugural season begins in 2026, and each team will pay a $1 million franchise fee, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to Front Office Sports.

The most recent team to commit is backed by Cleveland Soccer Group, which was founded by executives for independent film distribution company Gravitas Ventures. CSG counts as advisory board members former professional soccer players, including MLS veteran defender Justin Morrow and ex-Paris-Saint German goalkeeper Arianna Criscione.

In addition to backing one of the founding teams, CSG will invest in the league itself, and is also planning a new $50 million, 10,000-seat stadium in downtown Cleveland. That arena is expected to open next year and will be the home stadium for both the new WPSL Pro team and CSG's MLS Next Pro men's team. (MLS Next Pro is a Division III league within the U.S. soccer system that launched in 2022.)

CSG's involvement in WPSL Pro comes after a failed effort to score a NWSL expansion team last year. It ultimately lost out to a Denver-based group that won with a record-breaking expansion fee of $110 million.

WPSL Pro says that “at the heart” of its business model is the idea that “what's good for the athlete is good for business.” With that in mind, it intends to employ a profit-sharing model between clubs and athletes. Further specifics of the profit-sharing model were not disclosed, but WPSL Pro will not be the first organization in the realm of women's sports to try a revenue-sharing model. Athletes Unlimited, which was founded in 2020 and today operates women's softball, volleyball and basketball leagues, shares profits with its athletes. Unrivaled, the upstart 3-on-3 women's basketball league, tried a similarly novel approach, enticing athletes to participate by handing out equity stakes to the players it recruited for its first season.

WPSL Pro says that for early investors, the new league “represents an opportunity to get in at the ground floor of the next major growth engine in women's sports.” 

Committed markets include Austin, Wichita, and Southern California.

A representative for WPSL Pro did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and a representative for CSG declined to comment.

Co-Editor-in-Chief, TV


	As if! had been the response to fans' wishes for a Clueless followup with Alicia Silverstone as Cher — until now. 


	A Clueless TV series with Silverstone attached to star and executive produce has landed at Peacock for development. It is written and executive produced by the Gossip Girl duo of Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage of Fake Empire and Dollface creator Jordan Weiss, with the 1995 movie's writer-director Amy Heckerling and producer Robert Lawrence also executive producing. 


	Silverstone is set to reprise her signature role as Cher in the sequel series, from CBS Studios in association with Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group.

	Six years ago, the studio developed a different Clueless series reboot centered around Dash's Dionne character, which also went to Peacock for development. It ultimately did not move forward.


	CBS Studios remained high on the IP title, eventually taking a brand new stab with a new creative team, Schwartz, Savage and Jordan Weiss, and Silverstein on board as Cher. 


	The project was taken out to the marketplace and landed at Peacock again, which also had maintained its interest in a Clueless series. 


	CBS TV Studios' predecessor, Paramount Network Television, was behind the 1996 half-hour comedy series Clueless, created by Heckerling, which ran for three seasons, one on ABC and two on UPN, with Rachel Blanchard playing Cher since Silverstone was not available, with Dash reprising her role as Dionne.


	The Clueless movie (and 1996 series), loosely adapted from Jane Austen's 1815 novel Emma, chronicled the adventures of Cher Horowitz, a stylish, wealthy and popular California girl who attends Bronson Alcott High.


	This marks the second high-profile series based on classic Paramount/CBS IP that CBS Studios has recently sold to an outside streamer, joining Little House On the Prairie at Netflix. 


The O.C. creator Schwartz and Savage are co-showrunners/EPs on Megan Park's Sterling Point series for Amazon. The duo developed and executive produced the CW's Gossip Girl. Their series credits also include the CW's Nancy Drew, Apple's City On Fire, Hulu's Looking For Alaska and the Gossip Girl reboot on Max. Fake Empire is repped by WME.

	











	Weiss co-wrote and directed the 2024 Max film Sweethearts and is a writer on the upcoming Freakier Friday movie sequel. She is repped by UTA, Mosaic and Felker Toczek Suddleson.


	Silverstone got high marks from fans after reprising her Clueless character in a Super Bowl ad two years ago. She next stars in the Acorn TV series Irish Blood and will also be seen in the indie Pretty Thing, Yorgos Lanthamos' Bugonia and the Netflix holiday movie Merry Little Ex-Mas. Silverstone is repped by UTA, Untitled Entertainment and Gang, Tyre, Ramer, Brown & Passman.

Sometimes, making great art is an exercise in disappointing your heroes. 

“I remember Gene Hackman, one of his advices to me when I worked with him was, ‘Never work with a first-time director,'” Willem Dafoe told IndieWire while discussing his new film “The Legend of Ochi,” which hails from first-time director Isaiah Saxon. “Obviously, I didn't follow his advice, but may he rest in peace.” (Dafoe and the late Hackman starred together in 1988's “Mississippi Burning.”)

Dafoe currently has his pick of coveted roles from elite auteurs — in 2024 alone, he starred in films from Robert Eggers, Yorgos Lanthimos, Tim Burton, and Jason Reitman. So it takes a lot for a new filmmaker to dazzle him. But Saxon and his directorial debut “The Legend of Ochi” were something special. A throwback to fantasy epics like “The NeverEnding Story,” the film immerses viewers in an ocean of matte paintings and puppets to depict the fictional town of Carpathia, where villagers live in fear of an adorable species called Ochi. Nobody loathes the creatures more than Dafoe's Maxim, who blames them for his wife's death and assembles an army of young boys to exterminate the magical beings from the Carpathian forests.

What convinced Dafoe to don World War I armor and chase after a cute Gremlin-like creature with a bunch of kids? The actor said it was a combination of Saxon's animation pedigree — the director has spent decades applying his distinct stop-motion approach to music videos through his studio Encyclopedia Pictura — and the director's visceral passion for the material that proved to be irresistible.

“When they have a certain passion and their approach is very personal, I think this is something that I don't know for a fact, that Isaiah has been living with for a long time,” Dafoe said. “It had a strong impulse behind it; it wasn't just another film. You like to get people when they're trying to make something that they'll die if they don't make it.”

Dafoe has always been an actor who embraces a new challenge, so he delighted in the opportunity to use a puppet as one of his primary scene partners. He explained that the petite Ochi puppets were actually part of a large rig operated by six people — a phenomenon that only accentuated his character's perception that these tiny creatures were actually monsters that deserved to be feared.

 










“Physical is where I live. Acting is all about doing things if you ask me,” Dafoe said. “And because it's kind of this low-tech stuff, like with the puppets, for example, it's interesting when you're doing a scene with the Ochi, you're doing the scene with, basically, six people rolled into one. It's fun when you're playing across to see all that's going behind animating this creature. And of course, you're not concentrating on that, but you get that energy of this very distinct, very concentrated six people or whatever it is, operating this puppet that's reacting to you. So it's a very engaging place to be. It sounds strange. You'd think it would be otherwise that maybe you'd fall out, but in fact, it sucks you in.”

In some ways, acting alongside a team of puppeteers brought Dafoe back to his days doing experimental theater with companies like The Wooster Group, in which he performed in the 1980s. While the actor never worked with puppets on stage in such a large capacity, his background in experimental performance gave him a comfort level with projecting human emotions in response to actions that were not necessarily cued by other human characters.

“Sometimes, we'd be working in very unconventional performance modes. Sometimes, we do our cueing or have some kind of reference offstage that we'd have to follow,” he said. “So that has a similar kind of concentration, where you have an outside reference, and you're going to that, and that kind of gives you a super concentration. That's a very good thing to have when you are performing because the world drops away and you're doing what you're doing. There's no flourish, there's no extra, there's almost no ego. You are really giving up… It's like an athlete. You are concentrating on following that thing, and that's where everything in your body is going. And that way you get a real pure presence.”

 










An A24 release, “The Legend of Ochi” opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday, April 18, before expanding nationwide on April 25.
