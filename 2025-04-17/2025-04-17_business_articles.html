                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While firms raise prices for many reasons, some were blaming hikes on tariffs long before Trump's so-called "Liberation Day." Autos are another area of focus after Trump announced a 25% tariff on all car imports into the US. "April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again," Trump said during his remarks. Some economists have said that Trump's tariffs — and the uncertainty with his overall trade policy — could lead companies to raise prices on the goods they produce. "The tariffs are larger than forecasters expected, certainly larger than we expected in our upside case," Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said April 16 during a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago. "Our role is to make sure this will be a one-time increase in prices and not something that turns into an ongoing inflation process." Beginning at the end of 2024, some companies warned that they would consider raising prices on consumers if Trump implemented his broad tariff proposals. The two Chinese retailers released almost identical notices on April 16, both reading: "Due to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up." "To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025," Shein's statement said. Shein, a fast-fashion retailer, and Temu, a marketplace for everything from home goods to electronics, promised their US customers eight final days of low-price shopping. In addition to hiking tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump also cracked down on the de minimis trade loophole that allowed small parcels under $800 to enter the US tax-free. Shein and Temu were large beneficiaries of this loophole. Bloomberg reported that the automaker plans to raise prices on new gas and electric cars starting next month unless Trump gives the industry some relief from tariffs. Prices won't change for vehicles in inventory now. Conagra Brands CEO Sean Connolly told Reuters on April 3 that the food company may have to hike prices to offset the cost of tariffs on ingredients like cocoa, olive oil, palm oil, and a type of steel used for its canned products. Connolly said that Conagra, which makes products such as Hunt's ketchup and Chef Boyardee, imports tin plate steel for its canned food and tomatoes from Mexico. It was too early to tell how big price hikes on the company's food products would be, he added. During an April 3 earnings call, he stressed that the trade situation remains "volatile" and changes hourly. According to a memo first reported by Automotive News, Volkswagen said it would place an import fee on vehicles made outside of the US in response to Trump's 25% tariff on car imports. Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said during the company's March earnings call that Trump's tariff plans are likely to increase prices. "Trade is critically important to our business and industry. The consumer electronic supply chain is highly global, technical and complex," Barry said. "We expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely." Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in a March interview that Trump's 25% tariff plan on goods from Mexico and Canada would likely result in price increases on produce. "Those are categories where we'll try to protect pricing, but the consumer will likely see price increases over the next couple of days," Cornell said. Donald Allan, the CEO of the manufacturing company Stanley Black & Decker, said during a February earnings call: "Our approach to any tariff scenario will be to offset the impacts with a mix of supply chain and pricing actions, which might lag the formalization of tariffs by two to three months." Allan had previously told analysts in an October earnings call that the company had been evaluating "a variety of different scenarios" to plan for new tariffs under Trump. "And obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we put into the market," Allan said, adding that "there's usually some type of delay given the processes that our customers have around implementing price." Walmart CFO John David Rainey told CNBC on November 19 that the company will likely raise prices if Trump's tariff proposals are implemented. The company's CEO, Doug McMillan, said during a February earnings call that "tariffs are something we've managed for many years, and we'll just continue to manage that." He said that while he considered Columbia adept at managing tariffs, "trade wars are not good and not easy to win." He later said in a February interview with CNBC that "we need some surety about what is going to happen" before making price changes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The housing market saw a pronounced buyer-seller mismatch last month, and it's proving difficult to draw prospective home buyers off of the sidelines, according to Zillow. Buyers holding back from buying a home due to cost concerns could eventually prompt price cuts, and just in time for one of the hottest home-buying seasons of the year. Sellers put more than 375,000 homes on the market last month, a 32% increase from last month and a 9% increase compared to levels recorded the same month last year, according to a report Zillow released on Monday. But buyers haven't been keeping pace with the growth in new listings. That means the housing market added a net 110,000 listings last month, pushing overall inventory up 19% year-over-year to 1.15 million, Zillow estimated. "Home price growth paused and inventory swelled during what is typically one of the most competitive home shopping months of the year. "While sellers leaned on the gas, buyers didn't keep up," she added. Olsen said buyers may have been held back by affordability concerns, with high home prices keeping mortgage payments elevated. with 23% of listings on Zillow seeing a price reduction over March. That's the largest share of homes with a price cut since 2018, and up slightly from last month's share, when 21% of homes on Zillow had a price cut, the firm said. Zillow's Market Heat Index, which shows whether the housing market is more favorable to buyers or sellers, moved from "neutral" territory to "sellers market" territory in March, the first time it's done so since June of last year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Neurotech startup Precision Neuroscience on Thursday announced that a core component of its brain implant system has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a major win for the four-year-old company. The company's BCI will initially be used to help patients with severe paralysis restore functions such as speech and movement, according to its website. Only part of Precision's system was approved by the FDA on Thursday, but it marks the first full regulatory clearance granted to a company developing a wireless BCI, Precision said in a release. Other prominent startups in the space include Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Synchron, which is backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. "This is a foundational moment for Precision," Dr. Benjamin Rapoport, Precision's co-founder and chief science officer, said in a statement. Rapoport also helped co-found Musk's Neuralink in 2017 before departing the following year. The microelectrode array is thinner than a human hair and resembles a piece of yellow scotch tape. Each array is made up of 1,024 electrodes that can record, monitor and stimulate electrical activity on the brain's surface. When it is placed on the brain, Precision says it can conform to the surface without damaging any tissue. The FDA authorized Layer 7 to be implanted in patients for up to 30 days, and Precision will be able to market the technology for use in clinical settings. This means surgeons will be able to use the array during procedures to map brain signals, for instance. Precision has temporarily implanted the Layer 7 in 37 patients so far, and CNBC observed one case at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York last April. Until this point, the implementations have taken place for short periods, often a matter of minutes or hours, on patients who were already undergoing brain surgery for a medical reason. Now, because of the FDA clearance, the company will be able to collect data for much longer periods of time. "This regulatory clearance will exponentially increase our access to diverse, high-quality data, which will help us to build BCI systems that work more effectively," Rapoport said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk's SpaceX and two partners have emerged as frontrunners to win a crucial part of President Donald Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, six people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Musk's rocket and satellite company is partnering with software maker Palantir and drone builder Anduril on a bid to build key parts of Golden Dome, the sources said, which has drawn significant interest from the technology sector's burgeoning base of defense startups. In his January 27 executive order, Trump cited a missile attack as "the most catastrophic threat facing the United States." All three companies were founded by entrepreneurs who have been major political supporters of Trump. Musk has donated more than a quarter of a billion dollars to help elect Trump, and now serves as a special adviser to the president working to cut government spending through his Department of Government Efficiency. Its ultimate structure and who is selected to work on it could change dramatically in the coming months. The three companies met with top officials in the Trump administration and the Pentagon in recent weeks to pitch their plan, which would build and launch 400 to more than 1,000 satellites circling the globe to sense missiles and track their movement, sources said. A separate fleet of 200 attack satellites armed with missiles or lasers would then bring enemy missiles down, three of the sources said. There's an attitude that the national security and defense community has to be sensitive and deferential to Elon Musk because of his role in the government." SpaceX and Musk have declined to comment on whether Musk is involved in any of the discussions or negotiations involving federal contracts with his businesses. The Pentagon did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters, only saying it will deliver "options to the President for his decision in line with the executive order and in alignment with White House guidance and timelines." The White House, SpaceX, Palantir, and Anduril also did not respond to questions. In an unusual twist, SpaceX has proposed setting up its role in Golden Dome as a "subscription service" in which the government would pay for access to the technology, rather than own the system outright. While the approach would not violate any rules, the government may then be locked into a subscription and lose control over its ongoing development and pricing, they added. Some Pentagon officials have expressed concerns internally about relying on the subscription-based model for any part of the Golden Dome, two sources told Reuters. Guetlein did not respond to a request for comment. Retired Air Force General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, a top SpaceX advisor to Musk, has been involved in the company's recent discussions with senior defense and intelligence leaders, the two sources said. O'Shaughnessy did not respond to requests for comment. However, those long-standing contractors, such as Northrop Grumman, Boeing and RTX are expected to be big players in the process as well, people familiar with the companies said. The Pentagon has received interest from more than 180 companies keen to help develop and build the Golden Dome, according to a U.S. official, including defense startups like Epirus, Ursa Major and Armada. Members of the White House's National Security Council were briefed by a handful of companies about their capabilities, four sources said. The Pentagon's number two, former private equity investor Steve Feinberg, will be a key decision-maker for Golden Dome, two U.S. defense officials said. Feinberg co-founded Cerberus Capital Management which has invested in the cutting-edge hypersonic missiles industry but not in SpaceX. Feinberg, who did not respond to a request for comment, has said he would divest of all his interests in Cerberus when he joined the administration. SpaceX is pitching for the part of the Golden Dome initiative called the "custody layer," a constellation of satellites that would detect missiles, track their trajectory, and determine if they are heading toward the U.S., according to two sources familiar with SpaceX's goals. In the last five years, SpaceX has launched hundreds of operational spy satellites and more recently several prototypes, which could be retrofitted to be used for the project, the sources said. Reuters reviewed an internal Pentagon memo from Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth issued shortly before a February 28 deadline to senior Pentagon leadership asking them for initial Golden Dome proposals and calling for the "acceleration of the deployment" of constellations of satellites. Despite these advantages, some of those familiar with the discussions said it was uncertain whether the SpaceX group would be able to efficiently set up a system with new technology in a cost-effective way that can protect the United States from attack. "It remains to be seen whether SpaceX and these tech companies will be able to pull any of this off," said one of the sources. "They've never had to deliver on an entire system that the nation will need to rely on for its defense." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>To learn more about the CNBC CFO Council, visit cnbccouncils.com/cfo By most metrics, employees have never been more disconnected from their work. Employee engagement in the U.S. fell to its lowest level in a decade last year, with roughly 31% of employees engaged, according to Gallup. Pete Stavros, co-head of global private equity at KKR, said that when he meets with CEOs and asks them how their employees are feeling, it often results in vague responses: "There's not a tremendous amount of insight," he said. They're like 'Wow, yeah, I didn't know it was that bad.'" Stavros has been championing a strategy that he believes can solve some of these issues, born out of his own decades of experience across hundreds of private equity deals but also his father's career journey working for a small construction company in Chicago: employee stock ownership. "These programs can really meaningfully move the needle on culture when they're well implemented," he said. "These are outcomes that build wealth for workers, make them happier on the job, more engaged, and less likely to quit, and that's what it's done for companies." Advocates like Stavros say that broadening stock ownership within corporate America can help to address several critical issues for companies but also for workers, which includes worker retention, engagement and happiness, but also wealth inequality, financial illiteracy and the broader fraying of the social fabric of society. For example, KKR acquired CHI Overhead Doors for roughly $600 million in 2015, and in the process created a program where even hourly workers at the company received stock on top of their regular wages and benefits. When KKR sold CHI Overheard Doors to steel producer Nucor for $3 billion in 2022, CHI's employees collectively received more than $360 million as a result, with the vast majority of that going to workers below the C-suite level. However, to date, the growth of ESOPs has been relatively stagnant, with about 250 companies each year forming as one and it largely being contained to smaller industrial companies. Stavros said there are several reasons why, from regulatory complexity and tax issues that don't benefit larger companies, to litigation risk and a structure that appeals to companies with just a few shareholders. However, he's placed his support behind updates to the federal law that governs employee-stock ownership plans. "Without policy, we're not going to reach our aspirations, which are to have a transformational impact on the way companies operate," said Stavros, who added that his Expanding ESOPs coalition not only has the support of more than 50 organizations, foundations and service providers, but also bipartisan support in Washington, D.C. "The government has a lot going on ... when the time is right, we'll make a big bipartisan push to try and get this law modernized." Meanwhile, his efforts to spread the message of employee ownership continue, alongside CEOs and workers alike who praise what it's brought to their companies. Wayne Berson, the CEO of BDO USA, said as his professional services firm was considering a variety of restructuring options in 2023 ranging from a private equity buyout to becoming an M&A buyer, the idea of how to keep workers engaged, motivated and with the firm into its future, especially amid talent shortages in accounting, kept coming up. "We were looking at several business models, and we were looking for a business model that supported continued growth, investment and long-term stability," Berson said. "But while we were doing that analysis on our business model, we were also looking at a second issue of people." Berson said a few numbers kept coming up, one in particular that stuck: at the nearly 6,000 ESOPs across the U.S., average staff turnover then was at 5.9%, while BDO's was at 18% (albeit less than the 39% seen across its industry). How do you create a sustainable business, and one that's profitable at the same time?" The firm has lowered its turnover rate, attracted new workers because of the employee ownership strategy, and anecdotally, engagement among workers is up. "Every firm is unique and has unique considerations, but for us, this was the only choice for our future growth based on how we feel about people," he said. Berson said his leadership team has often used the term 'We before me." When Kevin Sims was in the process of being hired as a technician at Web Industries, a Massachusetts-based aviation and medical product manufacturer, he was told by human resources that the company was 100% owned by its employees through its ESOP structure. At first, Sims said he didn't really understand what that meant but was happy to have a stable position after bouncing between jobs for a stretch of time. However, because of those job changes, he hadn't been able to set himself up well for retirement, something that was looming in his mind as he made his way through his 40s as a single father. But as he started to learn more about what an ESOP was, and he started to receive statements explaining how his ownership in the company was growing, he quickly realized the benefits. But in this role, he said "I come in every day like it's my first day because that's how proud I am of what I do and what this company has offered me." Sims said that sense of ownership is apparent among his fellow workers, who all feel like they share in the successes and challenges that the company faces, whether that's the pride he felt when Sims and his coworkers manufactured blankets that were used in space, to offering suggestions to the company about ways it could save money by being less wasteful with supplies, a strategy that was later implemented. "The fact that I have a voice and faith in this company, it's like I got an opportunity to help us grow," he said. "I think that's really cool, and I really brainstorm on how I can make us better and our team better; the fact that they actually listen and do it and implement it, it just makes me want to do everything 10 times better in my life." Mary Josephs, who previously led Bank of America's ESOP solutions group before founding her own ESOP advisory firm, Verit Advisors, said there have been a number of successes with ESOPs across middle market companies, but too often "it's too complicated for very small businesses and too complicated for the very large and very, very valuable businesses, so the access to ESOP is very limited relative to the economy as a whole." At the same time, Josephs said simply implementing an ESOP doesn't guarantee anything. Both Josephs and Stavros say while the ESOP structure isn't going to work for every company as things stand, there are several lessons that any company can learn from ESOP successes. Stavros said at the core, that starts with trust building, which he said, "is one of the real breakpoints today between management and workers." The most common way to build trust is through sharing information, and that can be accomplished through highlighting financials or just a deeper roadmap into where the company is heading. "We've worked on more programmatic ways of giving people a feeling of control and input," Stavros said, highlighting the example of giving each manufacturing plant a million dollars a year, which workers can then "invest in any way they see fit in improving their workplace." Stavros said there is also the opportunity for companies to embrace efforts around profit sharing and equity grants, things that can bolster retention and create more buy-in. Employee share purchase plans don't always have the same effect, he said, as they can be viewed as a trade of wages or benefits rather than being treated as a business partner. "Conventional wisdom is only CEOs and C-suite people move the needle, they're the only ones who need ownership and we should concentrate that there," he said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter Everyone is trying to assess how President Donald Trump's tariff policies will or could affect their lives and industries. I asked WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert (this week's "On The Record" guest) if market turbulence in recent weeks has affected ticket sales for the upcoming season that begins May 16. "Not this season, for sure, because most of our arenas are already sold out," Engelbert told me. "So I'm not worried this year, but certainly as we go forward, if we were to enter into a deep recession of some sort, then you start to look again at scenario plans and contingency plans around that." As the private equity firm Arctos Partners said last week in a note to clients, sports are fairly well protected from recessions because "the underlying business model of sports benefits from exceptional stability due to long-term, contracted revenues across media rights, sponsorship and ticketing and enjoys sticky, largely domestic demand." Logically, companies such as automakers or toymakers that might see demand fall as tariffs raise prices could pull back on advertising to save money. Still, several big media companies told me that they haven't seen any significant effect on ad spend yet heading into next month's industry-wide upfront presentations. Sports, in particular, will probably be the last events to lose advertising tonnage. Fans watch games live and can't skip ads. Sports and league executives expressed confidence that scripted entertainment would feel more of the pain if companies retrench. Alex Weprin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote a good piece about this yesterday. Some sports may also benefit from decreased travel – a phenomenon United Airlines said this week is already happening. Consumers could attend local sporting events for entertainment instead of going on pricier vacations. Discovery, Paramount Global and Comcast want to change their asset mix. Comcast is moving forward with spinning out most of its cable networks, including CNBC. Paramount Global is trying to merge with Skydance Media. No company's CEO has been more vocal about the need for a light regulatory touch on mergers and acquisitions than Warner Bros. "We just need an opportunity for deregulation, so companies can consolidate and do what we need to be even better," Zaslav told reporters at Allen & Co.'s annual Sun Valley conference last year. Consolidation is a big deal for the sports world. Zaslav hoped a Trump victory would bring the deregulation he wanted. Not only has that not happened yet (Paramount's deal with Skydance is still awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission, prompting the first of potentially two 90-day extensions), but wild market swings have made any type of consolidation virtually impossible. Paramount Global would love to close its agreement with Skydance, fix Paramount Pictures by adding to its movie slate, and then merge with another studio, according to people familiar with the matter. But if Zaslav doesn't want to wait, I'm told he may still pivot and split his company into two – a low-debt entity housing his streaming service Max, the studio, the gaming division and the company's content library, and a second company with WBD's cable networks and free over-the-air European assets, which would house news and sports. No decisions have been made on this front yet, but WBD has hired bankers to work on options which include a potential split, according to people familiar with the matter. Discovery has already internally split its legacy linear assets from the streaming and studio business, making a move far easier. The NBA was concerned WBD might not have the balance sheet heft to pay $2 billion a year (or more) for league rights for the next 11 years when it struck its most recent TV deal last year. If Zaslav were to split the company, the non-streaming entity that owns sports rights – including MLB, NHL, French Open, March Madness, NASCAR, and more – will be even smaller. If that's the direction Zaslav goes, it'll take about ten seconds for pundits to start predicting what types of combinations could come next – likely starting with Comcast's SpinCo and RemainCo (which will still house NBCUniversal and Peacock). Breaking up the company doesn't require regulatory approval or glorified bribes to the Trump administration, as Michael Wolff reported earlier this week. Neither does forming new cross-company streaming bundles – another possibility once Paramount has more clarity on its future. A recession is probably worse news for the fourth or fifth-most popular streaming service (see: Max, Paramount+, Peacock) than it is for a company like Netflix – which, by the way, reports quarterly earnings this afternoon. I'll be listening to the Netflix conference call for any insights into how that company is viewing Trump's policies. Discovery has already paused non-critical business travel, first reported by Oliver Darcy's Status newsletter. I can add a little more detail – I'm also told the company has temporarily frozen non-critical hiring and is being cautious about other expenditures, such as how many employees to send to Cannes Lions, the industry's annual advertising extravaganza in Southern France — a location where Zaslav himself threw a big party just two years ago.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., warned Thursday that U.S. markets will "crash" if President Donald Trump has the power to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The comment from Warren, a frequent Powell critic, on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" came hours after Trump wrote in a social media post that the Fed chair's "termination cannot come fast enough!" A senior White House official later told CNBC that Trump's broadside should not be seen as a threat to fire Powell, and that there are no plans being made to end his term early. "I have tangled with [Powell] on a regular basis about both regulations and interest rates," Warren acknowledged in her remarks at the New York Stock Exchange. "But understand this: If Chairman Powell can be fired by the president of the United States, it will crash markets in the United States," she said. If key economic levers are "subject to a president who just wants to wave his magic wand," then the U.S. will be indistinguishable "from any other two-bit dictatorship around the world," she said. Trump has repeatedly singled out Powell by name while urging the U.S. central bank to lower interest rates in hopes of spurring rapid economic growth. The Fed hiked rates during President Joe Biden's term in order to tamp down the rampant inflation induced by the coronavirus pandemic and started dialing them back in 2024. However, the Fed has said it is in no hurry to continue those cuts, pointing to the uncertainty created by Trump's shape-shifting tariff policies. Powell reiterated that stance Wednesday in a speech at the Economic Club of Chicago, saying the president's import taxes are "likely to move us further away from our goals." In his Truth Social post Thursday morning, Trump, while defending his wide-ranging tariff plans, slammed Powell as being "always TOO LATE AND WRONG."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering the European Central Bank's April 2025 meeting. The European Central Bank made yet another 25-basis-point interest rate cut on Thursday as global tariff turmoil has created widespread uncertainty and spurred fears about the euro zone's economic growth. Tariff developments in recent weeks are widely seen by analysts and economists as a key reason for the ECB to cut interest rates. Even though many of the initial duties imposed by the U.S., as well as retaliation measures, have been put on ice or eased, fears about how they could affect economic growth have been rife. In its policy statement, the ECB said that the "outlook for growth has deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions." It added, "Increased uncertainty is likely to reduce confidence among households and firms, and the adverse and volatile market response to the trade tensions is likely to have a tightening impact on financing conditions." "Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around the Governing Council's 2% medium-term target on a sustained basis." The ECB appears open to further interest rate cuts after announcing a 25 basis point trim, according to Mark Wall, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. This sentiment regarding further cuts was echoed by other economists and analysts, with Capital Economics Chief Europe Economist Andrew Kenningham saying the ECB was likely to cut rates at both its June and July meetings. "We are in the presence of a negative demand shock," ECB President Christine Lagarde said during a press conference as she noted that while some tariffs are in place, "something that could be far more impactful" could be on the horizon. Lagarde said there would likely be some re-routing of goods supplied by markets that are facing higher duties, and other policies that do not necessarily link to trade, but fiscal matters and investments, were also at play. She indicated that tariffs could have a negative impact on economic growth, while the "net impact on inflation is less than clear at this point in time." Some of the factors at play could settle by the ECB's June meeting, but others would take longer to become more certain, she said. Assessing the current level of monetary policy restrictiveness is "meaningless," ECB President Christine Lagarde said during a press conference. Her comments after the ECB Governing Council removed a line characterizing the level of restrictiveness of monetary policy from its statement. Ahead of the ECB's decision, analysts and economists had been considering if, and how, the Governing Council would change its wording around this in its statement. "While that assessment of the restrictiveness was meaningful, or made sense, to the extent that we were very far away from the destination, it is meaningless at this point in time," Lagarde said. "So, that assessment of the restrictiveness is not operative anymore and what we need to do is to determine the appropriate monetary policy stance that will actually take us to our destination," which is the ECB's 2% inflation target, she said. The ECB's decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points was unanimous, the central bank's President Christine Lagarde told CNBC's Annette Weisbach during a press conference. "Options were debated but there was no one to argue in favor of a 50 basis point cut for instance," Lagarde said. ECB President Christine Lagarde said in a press conference that the economic outlook was "clouded by exceptional uncertainty." "Euro area exporters face new barriers to trade although their scope remains unclear. Disruptions to international commerce, financial market tensions and geopolitical uncertainty are weighing on business investment," she said. Consumers meanwhile could also become more cautious regarding spending, Lagarde said. The ECB's 25 basis point interest rate reduction was "an insurance cut Lagarde-style," ING's global head of macro Carsten Brzeski said in a note. "Given the high level of uncertainty currently, 50bp might indeed have been a bridge too far today – but to some extent, today's rate cut decision is also an insurance cut," he said. "Today's cut won't do any harm," he added. Keeping rates unchanged meanwhile could have raised questions about whether the ECB was willing to bolster growth, and would have prompted "a further and unwarranted strengthening of the euro," Brzeski said. The ECB on Thursday said that "especially in current conditions of exceptional uncertainty" the central bank's Governing Council would "follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance." Decisions would be based on the council's expectations for the inflation outlook given economic and financial data, as well as underlying inflation dynamics and the strength of monetary policy transmission. "The Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path." Yield moves were largely muted following their recent spell of volatility spurred by tariffs. France's 2-year yield was nearly one basis point higher, slightly below earlier gains, while its 10-year yield also fell flat. "All else equal, the ECB believes monetary policy will need to be more accommodative than previously expected," Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. "The euro area economy has been building up some resilience against global shocks, but the outlook for growth has deteriorated owing to rising trade tensions," the central bank said in its monetary policy statement. "Increased uncertainty is likely to reduce confidence among households and firms, and the adverse and volatile market response to the trade tensions is likely to have a tightening impact on financing conditions. The ECB on Thursday cut interest rates by 25 basis points, as was widely expected ahead of the decision. Markets had been pricing in an around 94% chance of such a cut, and an around 6% chance of a bigger, 50 basis point reduction. European markets were slightly lower ahead of the ECB's interest rate decision, with the cross-regional Stoxx 600 last trading around 0.5% lower at 11:52 a.m. London time. Regional bourses were also widely in negative territory, with Germany's DAX down 0.6%, the French CAC 40 falling 0.8% and Italy's FTSE MIB trading 0.5% lower. Lower growth expectations have been a key factor in shifting market pricing toward an interest rate cut from the ECB, Jens Eisenschmidt, chief Europe economist at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC on Thursday. An unexpected exchange rate reaction was also a factor, he added. "More tariffs were previously associated with a lower value of the euro, hence inflationary. Eisenschmidt said he does not believe the ECB would make any big changes to the wording of its closely watched policy statement as there are no new projections and a lot of uncertainty. "Right now in that situation probably you're well advised not touching in particular references to policy being still restrictive," he said. An interest rate cut from the ECB is being fully priced in by markets. "More importantly for markets will be the extent to which the central bank decides to communicate what it perceives to be the "neutral rate," and whether monetary policy could turn accommodative – i.e. go below the neutral rate – in the next six to 12 months," Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, said in a note Thursday. But, he added, it may be too soon for the ECB to share a solid stance on that, given the ongoing tariff uncertainty. That could "help" in terms of inflation, he explained, but could be a downside risk for economic growth. A quarter-point cut would take the ECB's deposit facility rate, its key rate, to 2.25% — down from a high of 4% toward the middle of 2023.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The electric car maker has dropped production targets for several Cybertruck lines over the past few months, two workers with knowledge of the targets told Business Insider. Some lines are running at a small fraction of their previous capacity, and the company has thinned out a handful of Cybertruck production teams by more than half, these workers said. "It feels a lot like they're filtering people out," one of the workers said. During the first three months of 2025, Tesla sold 6,406 Cybertrucks, Cox Automotive estimated, half that of the previous quarter. Before the truck's release, Musk said Tesla had more than 1 million reservations for the vehicle. To date, it has delivered fewer than 50,000 Cybertrucks, a March 20 recall filing said. In April, Tesla unveiled its cheapest version of the truck, a $70,000 rear-wheel-drive variant. Tesla sales more broadly have been trending downward. This year's first-quarter delivery results, which are seen as a proxy for sales, showed a 13% drop from the same period in 2024. The most recent Cybertruck production shift follows similar moves made in December, when the carmaker notified workers it would change Cybertruck production schedules and surveyed workers on their preferred roles. Tesla's lower delivery numbers come at a time when the company is facing pressure from all fronts. Competitors are edging in to compete with Tesla's aging lineup, demonstrators are staging protests outside showrooms, and the company's stock is down about 40% year to date. Shares of the carmaker are still up more than 53% from this time last year. In February, during the company's biannual performance reviews, Tesla asked managers to identify which roles on their teams were vital to the company, three current and former workers said. Workers were also ranked on a scale of one to five. Use a personal email address and a nonwork device; here's our guide to sharing information securely.</p>
