                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Barry Silbert, the CEO of Digital Currency Group, said he would have secured higher investment gains by just holding the Bitcoin that he invested in early-stage crypto projects around 2012. During an April 17 appearance on Raoul Pal's Journey Man podcast, Silbert said he discovered Bitcoin (BTC) in 2011, purchasing BTC at $7-$8 per coin. Once the price of BTC surged, Silbert started looking for early-stage crypto companies to invest in. Silbert's comments come at a time when Bitcoin maximalists, including Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor, forecast a seven-figure Bitcoin price in the coming decade, and BTC receives greater attention from governments worldwide. Related: Bitcoin gold copycat move may top $150K as BTC stays 'impressive' “If the United States announces that we are buying a million Bitcoin, that's just a global seismic shock," Shapiro told Bitcoin Magazine in an April 16 podcast appearance. These strategies included revaluing the US Treasury's gold reserves, which are currently priced at $43 per ounce while the market rate is at an all-time high of $3,300 per ounce, and funding Bitcoin acquisition through trade tariffs. BTC has been floated as a way to eliminate or alleviate the growing national debt by President Trump and several market analysts. According to asset management firm VanEck, Bitcoin could help claw back the $36 trillion national debt by $14 trillion if the US Treasury introduces long-term bonds with BTC exposure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The recent Project Eleven bounty for quantum computers cracking cryptographic keys is a joke. The deadline for this challenge is April 5th, 2026, meaning in order to qualify for the prize a team must demonstrate breaking a key pair it must be done before that deadline. This is frankly a completely absurd and meaningless prize for a number of reasons, the first of which is the deadline of just under a year from today. Even highly optimistic projections about the progress of quantum computing put the timeline of practically achieving such a goal at more like 5-10 years. Next is the factor of economic incentives. A single bitcoin is currently worth approximately $80,000. Especially when it comes to the application of a cutting edge technology like quantum computing that can perform an entire class of computation exponentially faster than a classical computer. Imagine how much more valuable things could be done with a working quantum computer. You could eavesdrop on internet connections regardless of TLS, breaking secure connections to banks, equity brokerages, private corporate networks not using post-quantum cryptography. All of these things have immeasurable value beyond just a mere $84,000. Why on Earth would someone with a working quantum computer publicly reveal that fact to claim a single bitcoin when they could take advantage of all these other things they would be capable of doing? Okay, let's sweep all of those possibilities aside and pretend the entire world magically migrates to post-quantum cryptography aside from Bitcoin. It still makes no sense to try to publicly claim this prize if you have a functional quantum computer. How many bare public keys are there securing 50 BTC outputs from the first mining epoch? Why on Earth would you crack one, and then go tell everyone publicly to claim a single bitcoin? You would just try to crack as many of those early coinbase rewards as possible before people detected you. Finally, the timetable on its own is just absurd. Quantum computers currently are not even capable of factoring prime numbers that people can do themselves in their heads mentally. It's utterly meaningless as a serious bounty to function as a canary in the coalmine for us, no matter how concerned or unconcerned you are with the timeframes of quantum computers as a threat.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Richard Kim, the founder of crypto casino Zero Edge, was arrested on Tuesday following allegations that he had gambled away investors' funds. According to an FBI complaint filed on Tuesday in the Southern District of New York, Kim "fraudulently induced investors to invest in Zero Edge, a cryptocurrency technology company he founded, and then misappropriated millions of dollars in those investors' funds." The FBI said Kim lost "nearly all" of the $7 million he raised from investors and charged him with securities fraud and wire fraud. CoinDesk was first to report on the Zero Edge incident in July of last year. In an interview at the time, Kim revealed to CoinDesk that he had gambled away more than $3.67 million of his investors' funds through a series of high-risk leveraged crypto trades. According to Kim, he "started down a negative spiral of leverage trading, raising more capital, and hiding the truth." After losing most of the $7 million he had raised for Zero Edge, Kim told CoinDesk he reported himself to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's public tip line. But I didn't intend to go run away with this money," he told CoinDesk in an interview. Kim did not immediately respond to a request for comment this week. A former executive of Galaxy, the crypto investment firm headed by Michael Novogratz, Kim also led elite trading desks at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. Before that, he was an attorney with the prestigious law firm Cleary Gottlieb. Galaxy was among the investors in Zero Edge who lost money as a result of Kim's activities. "Upon learning of certain actions taken by Mr. Kim in his role at Zero Edge, we, along with other investors, reported his conduct to the authorities." Kim pitched Zero Edge as a first-of-its-kind crypto casino that would level the playing field for gamblers through improved transparency. Zero Edge never launched, but Kim told CoinDesk last year that he was motivated to build it because of his history with gambling addiction and his frustration that the house frequently had an opaque and unfair edge over players.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The crypto market has been under bearish pressure because of President Trump's tariff policy. The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has also sparked concerns after his recent remarks revealed that US inflation may also rise because of these tariffs. According to Powell, the ongoing tariff war will have a negative impact on inflation. Following these remarks, Reuters reported that experts are also expressing concerns about US economic growth. “Powell is confirming what investors have been worried about, and that is the likelihood of slowing economic growth and more stubborn inflation as a result of the tariffs.” In his recent post on Truth Social, Trump noted that other central banks were lowering their rates to stimulate economic growth. This token recently recorded one of the worst crashes in crypto history, and it is now down by 92% from its all-time high recorded only two months ago. Despite this dip, the RSI remains historically low at 27, which highlights a bearish momentum. This technical outlook supports a bearish Mantra price prediction. On-chain data shows that over 10M PI Coin tokens will be added to the circulating supply in the next month. According to an X post by analyst Dr Altcoin, these unlocks are the main reason that the Pi Coin price is falling. These events have led to the Pi Coin market being flooded by more sellers than buyers, which is having a bearish effect on the price. TRUMP is also one of the top altcoins to sell as traders remain concerned about inflation and tariffs. Data from Coinglass shows that TRUMP's funding rates have been predominantly negative in the last month. This indicates that many traders are taking long positions, further showing bearish momentum. The Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned that US inflation may rise again due to tariffs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As the cryptocurrency market navigates through April 2025, participants are closely watching for signs of a potential turnaround following recent volatility. This outlook inevitably sparks interest in identifying the best altcoins to buy now to position advantageously for a possible recovery. Understanding the market dynamics, especially concerning altcoins, provides crucial context when evaluating various opportunities, from innovative presales like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) to established players such as Sei (SEI) and XRP. It acknowledges the significant pressure experienced, noting that the total crypto market capitalization excluding Bitcoin had fallen sharply by 41% from its December 2024 peak of $1.6 trillion to around $950 billion by mid-April. This coincided with a notable decline in venture capital investment in the sector, remaining 50-60% below the previous cycle's highs, indicating reduced risk tolerance from major investors. External factors like global tariff implementations and economic uncertainty were also cited as contributing factors, particularly weighing on the recently more volatile altcoin market. Both Bitcoin and Coinbase's own COIN50 index ,tracking top altcoins. Falling below this key level signaled a potentially more profound market shift requiring caution. This divergence,reflects the heightened volatility in newer crypto sectors like memecoins, DePIN projects, and AI-related tokens. Despite these cautionary signals, Coinbase expressed cautious optimism, forecasting a potential market bottom by mid-to-late Q2 2025 and the possibility of a recovery starting in Q3. Given Coinbase's analysis pointing towards potential stabilization and a Q3 bounce, which specific altcoins might traders be evaluating? The focus often falls on projects with strong fundamentals, innovative technology aligning with current trends,like AI or unique market positioning that could see them benefit disproportionately from a market recovery. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) represents an altcoin operating in the AI and meme coin sectors, highlighted by Coinbase as areas of interest (and volatility). Currently in its presale phase, it offers a unique entry point. <iframe width=”560″ height=”315″ src=”https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2LHM6ObNHY?si=4R1FRAWNUC963OkS” title=”YouTube video player” frameborder=”0″ allow=”accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share” referrerpolicy=”strict-origin-when-cross-origin” allowfullscreen></iframe> XRP stands as one of the largest and longest-standing altcoins, primarily known for its focus on facilitating efficient global payments. While caution is warranted due to ongoing volatility and technical indicators still showing weakness, this outlook encourages strategic positioning. Opportunities are diverse: innovative presales like Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) offer early access to trending sectors like AI with potential price stability, specialized Layer 1s like Sei (SEI) provide infrastructure bets on specific growth areas like decentralized trading and established utility-focused coins like XRP present opportunities tied to real-world adoption and regulatory clarity. As market sentiment potentially shifts, conducting research into these varied altcoin categories will be key for navigating the path towards a potential Q3 recovery. Discovering altcoins involves using data aggregators, crypto exchanges, news sites, and researching presales; always verify project details, check for audits (like Dawgz AI's SolidProof audit), and assess utility before investing. Potential often lies with altcoins innovating in key sectors like AI (e.g., Dawgz AI), specialized Layer 1s (e.g., Sei), or those with strong real-world utility (e.g., XRP), especially if positioned well before market rebounds. Some altcoins with proven utility and strong ecosystems may fit long-term strategies, but many are highly speculative; Coinbase's report highlighting altcoin volatility underscores the need for careful selection and risk management.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Secret Service forensic analysts have collaborated with Canadian authorities to tackle $4.3 million in “approval phishing” attacks targeting Ethereum wallet holders. The joint operation, dubbed Operation Avalanche (no affiliation with the layer-1 network or its AVAX token), searched for compromised wallets on the Ethereum blockchain and reached out to impacted wallet owners who had lost money or were at risk of doing so. An unnamed crypto exchange and a third-party blockchain analyst were also said to be involved. Matt McCool, a special agent in charge at the U.S. Secret Service's Washington Field Office, said his organization “will continue working with Canadian law enforcement and financial partners to identify and seize stolen assets to return to victims.” In March, it took down the website of Russian crypto exchange Garantex as part of another joint operation, claiming it had ties to cybercriminal groups and sanctioned Russian banks, including darknet ransomware groups. Approval phishing has consistently been a popular and damaging type of crypto scam. Blockchain sleuths at Chainalysis estimated that $2.7 billion was lost to approval phishing between May 2021 and July 2024, adding that many cases go under the radar and remain unreported. Though approval phishing attacks can be targeted at organizations—such as in the case of the $120 million Badger DAO hack in December 2021—they are often directed at wealthy private individuals, who are known to be active in crypto or NFT space. In December 2021, a well-known collector in the NFT space lost Bored Ape NFTs worth almost $2 million (at value's of the time) to a variant of 'approval phishing' known as 'ice phishing.'

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stacy Hazinski received one of those annoying text messages that claimed she was about to be charged $114.02 for something she didn't buy. So she called the number, supposedly for her Apple Pay account, to make sure that she didn't get stuck with the bill. One simple phone call set off a scheme that ultimately enabled someone to steal her entire income tax refund and drain her savings account at a local credit union. Filing her taxes early in the year essentially meant little, she told me at her Troy condo, because now she has nothing to show for it. Her story highlights one huge red flag that consumers must watch out for these days — how scammers are convincing you to take cash to a crypto ATM at the local party store, gas station, or grocery. Con artists deceive people with backstories on how they can protect their money or avoid trouble by depositing money in a cryptocurrency ATM. The crooks — who might pretend to be from Apple, Google, an Internet service provider, or even law enforcement — do their research and know where these ATMs are in your neighborhood. They'll tell you to withdraw cash from the bank and give you directions to one of these crypto ATMs. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel issued a consumer alert April 8 to warn residents about scammers using bitcoin ATMs to defraud consumers. “Because money sent through bitcoin ATMs is nearly impossible to recover and these machines lack oversight and regulation, they have become an attractive option for criminals engaged in fraud and money laundering,” Nessel said in a statement. Consumers lost $66 million to crypto ATM fraud in the first six months of 2024, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The actual number is likely much higher as such types of fraud often go unreported, according to the FTC. The FTC said the losses involving these ATMs increased dramatically from $12 million in 2020 to $114 million for all of 2023. People 60 and over were more than three times as likely as younger adults to report a loss using a bitcoin ATM in the first half of 2024, according to FTC data. Once the money is deposited into bitcoin, experts warn, it is transferred quickly, making it often impossible to track. Hazinski, 51, heard slew of scary stories on Feb. 28 — starting with a guy named John from Apple and switching over to a guy named Eric who claimed to be from her credit union — on how scammers were in the process of getting their hands on her federal income tax refund, as well as the rest of her savings. As part of the scam, she was told by the guy who claimed to be an employee at the credit union that she would need to transfer her cash into a "security" account to protect her savings from someone who was about to send her money into an account at www.poker.com. Why was her money going to cover some online poker tournament? She got terribly nervous, especially since her savings was limited after she had been out of work for a few months. She was told to go to the Community Choice Credit Union branch at 1740 Crooks Road in Royal Oak first to take out $12,500 where she remembers that the stack of bills was stuffed into zippered bag. The teller put those bills in a paper envelope. After that, he told her that bitcoin is secure and she needed to deposit her money at a bitcoin ATM to protect it from scammers. "So I believed him," she told me as we talked at her dining room high-top table. Instead of winning big, she ended up losing her money on the spot. The Bitcoin Depot ATM stands near the front register, not far from a refrigerated case that sells BB's Buzzin Brews for $8.99 and up, ready-to-mix drinks that often include minibar size bottles of liquor. When I visited the store April 12, I did not see any signs posted on the machine warning of potential scams. When I called the store April 16, I asked to speak to a manager who apparently hung up on me after I mentioned that a woman had lost $17,500 at the bitcoin machine in the store. No one picked up after I tried to immediately call again. The party store had a decent number of customers in it that February afternoon, Hazinski remembered, but no one said a word as she pulled out the two envelopes stuffed with $17,500 from her purse. "I was standing there at least a half hour putting money in that machine," Hazinski said. She had no idea how to use a bitcoin ATM or set up an account. "He's telling me exactly what to do," Hazinski said. At one point, the ATM asked her for a QR code. And con artist told her: "I'll send you the QR code." "What I find out after the fact, right, is the QR code that he sent me went to his account," Hazinski said. She was still in the store when her 16-year-old son Joshua, who attends Troy Athens High School, called her wondering why she wasn't home yet. When she told him what had happened, her son said "Mom, are you kidding me?" The lights came on, and Hazinski knew her son had to be right. The man impersonating a credit union employee had told her earlier that someone would come to her house the next day to give her a new debit card and a new account number. "All the bills, and you have no money," Hazinski said. Hazinski was laid off in August from a job as a robotics engineer, work she has done for some 25 years. Initially, she used that time off to take care of her father who was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He's now in remission and she's still looking for work. Hazinski has been on interviews but thinks many companies, including auto suppliers, are holding back hiring in light of the Trump tariffs. She voted for Trump and favors his strategy of raising revenue for the federal government by getting countries to pay higher tariffs. But she's hoping that hiring picks up, too. She's far from the first person to be caught in this bitcoin ATM scam. Crypto ATM abuse has gotten so bad that a top Democratic senator introduced a bill in Congress in February that would protect new customers who are most likely to be fraud victims by setting transaction limits of $2,000 per day, and $10,000 total over the first 14 days. The Crypto ATM Fraud Protection Act — introduced by Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee — would require full refunds for fraudulent transactions at crypto ATMs if the new customer makes a report within 30 days. And it would be required that the ATM offer a way for consumers to give live, verbal confirmation for any transaction greater than $500. That scam started when the con artists called and claimed to be a deputy in the Will County Sheriff's Office. Durbin said it was past time to put some "commonsense guardrails in place to stop fraud in this largely unregulated industry." Bitcoin Depot, which operates the ATM at BB's of Troy along with more than 8,400 kiosks in North America, said the company remains focused on "prevention and user safety as we work to make crypto more accessible and secure." "We display multiple scam warnings throughout the entire transaction process and offer live customer support via phone, text, chat, and email to assist users in real-time before they complete a transaction," according to a statement sent to the Detroit Free Press by a spokesperson for Bitcoin Depot. They include warnings to new customers to not use the Bitcoin Depot ATM for payments to any government entities, law enforcement, employers, tech support companies, or anyone saying you've been hacked. Do not buy bitcoin for IRS payments, utility bills, or if someone says you have been hacked or are being investigated. That warning also indicates that "losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable and transactions in virtual currency are irreversible." Hazinski told me she did not see any alerts about scams when the con artist on the phone was telling her what to do next. "I did not receive any of those warnings," she later told me by email after I sent her images of the Bitcoin Depot warnings. I initially wrote about crooks using bitcoin ATMs to steal money roughly three years ago. They sent a phony check to her Oakland Township home for her to buy Apple computer products to work remotely as an administrative assistant for a biopharmaceutical company. But first, she somehow needed to deposit money in a bitcoin ATM at the Star Market in Lake Orion to prove where she lived before they'd send any equipment. Ultimately, the couple ended up withdrawing $350,000 from various banks and then turning that cash into cryptocurrency, according to the Grand Traverse Sheriff's Department. In 2024, consumers reported losing more money to scams where they paid with bank transfers or cryptocurrency than all other payment methods combined. People reported losing $2 billion through a bank transfer and $1.42 billion through cryptocurrency, according to Federal Trade Commission data. These cryptocurrency-related scams also involved phony investments, not just cash lost at a bitcoin ATM. Once it's in someone else's wallet, experts say, there's nothing you can do to recover your crypto. The Community Choice Credit Union said it consistently shares information to alert consumers about fraud, including the use of bitcoin. Warnings about bitcoin ATM scams, according to the credit union, have been posted on its website and social media pages. “We are extremely concerned and saddened to hear that our member was a victim of fraud,” said Jeff Dubey, vice president of Enterprise Risk Management for Community Choice Credit Union. In a statement sent to the Free Press, the credit union said frontline credit union staff will encourage a credit union member to engage with the risk management team, if the staff suspects someone is a potential victim. The credit union stated that fraudsters are increasingly tech savvy and can "spoof" financial institution phone numbers and send text messages to take over accounts. "They also commonly employ scare tactics via phone calls, demanding that consumers purchase gift cards, wire funds, or deposit cash into bitcoin machines," the credit union stated. Lt. Ben Hancock of the Troy Police Department said right now, scams where crooks are demanding payments by bitcoin or outright cash have seen an uptick lately. On March 16, for example, a 61-year-old Troy man told police that he was contacted by someone who falsely claimed to be from the Department of Justice. As part of the scam, the government imposters told him to wire transfer $33,000 to a Coinbase account. Coinbase is an online platform, which promises that you can buy and sell crypto in "less than 3 minutes." After transferring the money, the victim was contacted again and told he needed to transfer any remaining money he had to protect it. The man did not send any more money. It's another reminder, Hancock said, that scammers impersonate government agencies and brand names we trust. But no legitimate federal agency or business, he said, is going to contact you and demand that money be transferred or paid immediately by cryptocurrency, cash or other methods. "We are still seeing some gift card scams," Hancock said, "but currently bitcoin or other electronic payments seem to be happening more than gift card scams." His advice: Do not purchase bitcoin or transfer money via other means to pay a bill or handle a problem. "Please do your research and contact whatever company these people are claiming to be from directly to confirm they are, in fact, employees," Hancock said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>24-hour tracking of blockchain industry news and in-depth article analysis (Related reading: " Trump, an old fan of Monopoly, enters the blockchain game, making another move in the crypto market ") Although Trump has disturbed the world since he took office, we have to admit that, personally, Trump is undoubtedly the most money-making president of all time. In addition to his well-known real estate industry, the growth of his media and technology companies, and the shady stock operations that have made the market extremely suspicious, he has also opened up a new channel for profit-making - cryptocurrency, and has made at least $1 billion in profits from it. A new crypto empire named after Trump seems to be rising. Looking back at Trump's crypto journey, we have to start with digital cards. On December 15, 2022, Trump announced the release of Trump digital trading card NFT through TruthSocial, a social media website he founded. The series was minted on the Polygon blockchain, and a total of 45,000 NFTs were initially created, with a starting price of $99 per piece. Buying 45 digital trading cards will get you a ticket to dinner with Trump. Although it caused ridicule at the time, with the traffic blessing and call of the former president, this series was still sold out in less than a day after its launch. Judging from the trading volume of opensea, the total transaction volume of this series reached 17,115ETH, and there are currently 14,411 holders. In short, Trump made a huge profit of $4.45 million on his first attempt. After tasting the sweetness, on April 18, 2023, Trump quickly released his second series of NFTs - Trump Digital Trading Cards Series 2. Shortly afterwards, Trump released the third series of MugShot Edition NFTs. This time it was even more outrageous, with a total of 100,000 pieces, with no price increase, and introduced special benefits. For $10,000, you can be invited to the reception, and a unique Ordinal digital trading card limited to 200 pieces will be included. It is precisely because of this series that Trump's subsequent "making NFT hot again" came into being. A simple calculation shows that with just three sets of NFT combinations, the Trump team has attracted $19 million, and according to its financial disclosures, the actual profit of NFTs has reached millions of dollars. The total holdings have reached 1 billion US dollars, with a loss of 0.87%. Of the funds raised from the WLFI sale, $30 million has been designated to pay company expenses, compensation and obligations. Project documents also show that Trump and his partners in DT Marks DEFI LLC will receive 75% of the remaining amount, or $390 million, as marketing fees for Trump to promote the project "from time to time" and allow the use of his name and image. On March 25, WLFI announced the launch of a stablecoin called USD1, which is pegged to the US dollar and 100% backed by US government short-term treasury bonds, US dollar deposits and other cash equivalents. USD1 will be minted on the ETH and BSC blockchains, and plans to expand to other protocols in the future. As of now, according to Coingecko data, USD1 transaction volume has exceeded 44.91 million US dollars. Hut 8 injected most of its ASIC mining machines into American Data Centers, which was co-invested by Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., and changed its name to American Bitcoin after the transaction was completed. If mining and stablecoins seem to have just taken shape and there is no big profit to speak of, the one that shocked the world must be Trump MEME. From the perspective of token distribution, the total supply of TRUMP is 1 billion, but only 200 million will be circulated initially, and the remaining 800 million are expected to be unlocked linearly within 3 years. Two subsidiaries of the Trump Group occupy an absolute share. Trump's companies CIC Digital LLC and Fight Fight Fight LLC will own 80% of the TRUMP tokens, with a lock-up period of 3-12 months and unlocking within the next 24 months. The current book value profit is approximately US$6.344 billion. After a small trial of NFT, the mining business is about to take shape, and it also includes profit cash cow stablecoins and Defi, and even MEME provides blood packages. Although it is scattered, the industrial chain has gradually formed, and both infrastructure and applications are involved, and it is expected to continue to expand around "core applications". Just a few days ago, Fortune reported that Trump's latest crypto project will be a real estate video game. People familiar with the matter said that this game is an adaptation of "MONOPOLY GO!". Players earn in-game cash by moving chess pieces on a digital "Monopoly" board and build buildings in a digital city. However, Zanker spokesman Kevin Mercuri denied this, saying only that Zanker is indeed developing a game, but it is not Monopoly. It can be seen that the Trump family's subsequent crypto tentacles are very likely to extend to the field of blockchain games. It has been mentioned before that Trump's business philosophy adheres to the principle of traffic monetization. The currency circle, which has always been traffic-oriented, is obviously very consistent with its business characteristics. With the support of its own controllable policies, Trump can continue to raise the currency market by releasing favorable news, and can also directly use his influence to cut into the most profitable and policy-promising fields. This is undoubtedly an alternative political corruption and insider trading. Not everyone is happy about this, and high-level doubts from the Democratic Party and nonpartisan parties have never stopped. Elizabeth Warren, a well-known crypto opponent, said that the SEC's abandonment of law enforcement activities is part of Trump's use of the crypto business to get rich, which undoubtedly hinders regulatory legislation. Kedrick Payne, general counsel and senior director of ethics at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, also said that Trump is personally advocating laws to promote the development of the crypto industry. After Trump took office, not only did the SEC completely become crypto-friendly, the Department of Justice also promised to reduce crypto lawsuits, and even stopped prosecuting the mixers that were previously deeply involved in anti-money laundering controls, and stakeholders were able to let go. In 2023, he was also sued by the SEC for fraudulent market manipulation and other suspected misconduct, but after investing heavily in WFLI last year, the SEC stopped the lawsuit this year. It seems that the policies under Trump's control are ironclad, but arbitrary regulation can easily trigger political conflicts, especially in the current complex political situation in the United States, where there is a possibility of regulatory backlash. In fact, conflicts of interest and insider information are not limited to the cryptocurrency circle. According to congressional disclosure documents, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia congresswoman who has a close relationship with Trump, successfully made 21 stock purchases the day before and the day Trump suspended tariffs. What's even more ridiculous is that on the same day, Trump's personal account stock holdings soared 22.67%, with a single-day profit of more than $415 million. In addition to this congresswoman, Republican Congressman Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania also coincidentally sold shares of American steel producer Steel Dynamics in advance on the day Trump announced the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum products. At present, the Democratic Party has jointly sent a letter to the new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, asking for an investigation into whether Trump has created trading opportunities for allies through policy changes and whether he is suspected of market manipulation. It is obvious that the Trump family has not stopped making money. Less than half a year after taking office, the Trump family has already made billions of dollars. After four years in office, how much more money will they make?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has stated that Bitcoin (BTC) could continue to exist and thrive for a long time. However, Gensler emphasized that this may not be the case for most altcoins, as they lack solid fundamentals. In a recent interview with CNBC, Gensler mentioned that Bitcoin's enduring presence could be attributed to its strong global interest. “Something like Bitcoin may persist for a long time because there's 7 billion people around the globe, a real keen interest in it,” he stated. While at the SEC, Gensler took a hard stance on cryptocurrency regulation. He launched multiple enforcement actions targeting several exchanges, token issuers, and other crypto entities. While he refrained from commenting directly on the dismissal of these cases, he shifted focus to broader trends within the cryptocurrency market. But this field is almost 99, or maybe one might say 100% sentiment and very little on fundamentals,” said Gensler. The former SEC chair advocated for careful asset risk assessment. Moreover, he warned that many assets are driven predominantly by sentiment. As a result, he suggested that such tokens are generally unsustainable and likely to lose value over time. When pressed on whether Bitcoin should be grouped with other cryptocurrencies, Gensler drew an analogy to precious metals. He implied that Bitcoin holds a unique position in the cryptocurrency world. We humans have a certain fascination with two or three precious metals like gold,” he remarked. Gensler believes that the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, especially those driven by trends, memes, or social sentiment, will not attract lasting interest. He stressed that only a few, like Bitcoin, will stand the test of time. These comments align with Gensler's previous statements on the crypto market. It might be something else in the future as well,” Gensler noted. Despite the optimistic outlook, Gensler disclosed that he did not own any Bitcoin or other crypto assets. Gensler's remarks reflect ongoing debates about the legitimacy and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. This news article aims to provide accurate, timely information.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The cyberpunk-themed MMORPG 77-Bit has concluded its closed Beta phase with metrics that suggest a compelling case for the viability of a fun-first crypto gaming model. The development team has now confirmed the distribution of free Limited Edition NFT skins to Beta participants, alongside introducing a new item drop, Quantum Core, slated to follow soon after. The Beta attracted major attention, with over 1 million BitHub users attempting access. Ultimately, the team onboarded 20,000 players, prioritizing high-intent participants over mass inclusion. Importantly, none of these purchases were speculative or play-to-earn related. Spending centered around non-tokenized upgrades like weapon leveling and battle pass access, reinforcing the developers' “fun-before-financials” approach. The average revenue per paying user (ARPPU) was $45 across 11,000 users. These figures suggest that crypto-native gaming experiences can attract and retain users based on gameplay value, not token incentives. These NFTs represent some of the rarest cosmetics introduced so far in 77-Bit, and may become tradeable in the future, though they are currently Soulbound. Each mint reveals instantly upon claim, with no delay or random reveal mechanics. Players can mint additional skins at 0.005 ETH (~$7.70), with no cap on the number of paid mints. Following the NFT skin mint, 77-Bit will roll out its next initiative—Quantum Core. A supply of 5,000 Quantum Cores is expected, with distribution prioritized to Iconic players and Noob-role holders.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new thread, crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe tells his 783,000 followers on the social media platform X that Sei (SEI) may increase more than 100% its current value if it breaks through a key resistance level. SEI is trading for $0.17 at time of writing, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours. Next up, the analyst says that Bitcoin (BTC) is in a consolidation phase that may lead to an explosive move to the upside. Bitcoin is trading for $83,800 at time of writing, flat on the day. Lastly, the analyst says that Ethereum (ETH) may be kicking off an uptrend if the price of gold peaks, based on ETH's historic inverse correlation with the precious metal. “A good start of the week, as ETH is +4% against Bitcoin. If that's the case, then we'll see more strength on ETH.” The analyst also says that ETH's Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is flashing bullish, having entered oversold territory. A level between 70 and 100 indicates that an asset is overbought. The 0 to 30 level range indicates that an asset is oversold. ETH is trading for $1,589 at time of writing, down 2% in the last 24 hours. Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.
