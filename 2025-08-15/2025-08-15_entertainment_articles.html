                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The contestant on the 2000s MTV reality show claimed Diddy groped her breast and committed a wide range of other legal wrongdoing. Six weeks after the rapper was largely acquitted on federal criminal charges, he's won a ruling dismissing most of a $60 million civil sexual assault lawsuit filed by “Making the Band 2” contestant Sara Rivers. Rivers, who became a member of hip-hop group Da Band, sued Combs in earlier this year – accusing him of sexually harassing and groping her during the filming of the 2000s MTV reality show. But in a ruling issued Thursday, Judge Jed Rakoff dismissed 21 of the 22 counts in her lawsuit, including racketeering, assault and battery, forced labor, and false imprisonment. Those accusations were dismissed with prejudice – meaning they are permanently tossed. The judge declined to permanently dismiss a single count, accusing Combs of violating New York City's Gender Motivated Violence Protection Act. The judge said he would wait to decide that count until a federal appeals court rules on key questions about how that law functions. We are pleased the Court carefully analyzed and swiftly dismissed these baseless claims.” Combs was largely acquitted last month in a blockbuster federal criminal case that accused him of forcing girlfriends to partake in drug-fueled sex marathons with prostitutes called “freak-offs.” Jurors found him not guilty on racketeering (RICO) and sex-trafficking charges, the core of the government's case which could have sent him to prison for life. Jurors did convict Diddy on lesser charges of interstate prostitution, which could still land him in prison for several years when he's sentenced in October. Judge Rakoff did not provide a written ruling explaining his decision; he said he would issue one at some point in the future “in due course.” A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Core Scary Movie actresses Regina Hall and Anna Faris are coming back as Brenda and Cindy, respectively, for the Wayans Brothers' restart of the early millennium comedy franchise. Scary Movie is prepping for an October shoot in time for a June 12, 2026 global theatrical release via Paramount. Miramax has a first-look deal with Paramount. Timing is everything in comedy, and a new Scary Movie couldn't arrive at a better time in theaters when horror movies have hit saturation this year. The genre is screaming for a pie to be thrown in its face. Tiddes is a longtime Wayans collaborator, starting as an assistant on White Chicks. He directed a trio of Wayans films – the satirical horror comedy A Haunted House and the Netflix hit movies Naked and Sextuplets. Tiddes is repped by Artists First and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher. Miramax's Jonathan Glickman, Alexandra Loewy and Thomas Zadra are executive producing. The Independent Artist Group-repped Hall next stars in Paul Thomas Anderson's Warner Bros movie One Battle After Another with Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro, hitting theaters on September 26. She's also starring in Nick Stoller's Judgment Day with Will Ferrell and Zac Efron. She is currently in production on The Five Star Weekend for Peacock, opposite Jennifer Garner, Chloë Sevigny, Gemma Chan and Timothy Olyphant. Additionally, she'll lead her voice to the upcoming The SpongeBob Movie: Search for Squarepants alongside Sherry Cola, Arturo Castro, George Lopez and Ice Spice. Faris is repped by Gersh, Range Media Partners and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. Following her breakout in the Scary Movie series, she went on to star in and produce The House Bunny and Greg Araki's Smiley Face. She will next star in Spa Weekend. Other feature credits include The Dictator with Sasha Baron Cohen, Overboard, Just Friends and Oscar-winning titles Brokeback Mountain and Lost in Translation. Faris starred for eight seasons in the hit CBS sitcom Mom opposite Allison Janney and had memorable arcs on Friends and Entourage. She also penned the New York Times bestselling memoir Unqualified.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two-time Emmy nominated actress, producer, Ford aficionado and booked-and-busy brand partner is revving up for the busiest run of a still rising career. On the heels of a meaty role opposite Oscar winner Julianne Moore in the Apple TV+ movie Echo Valley, Sweeney has two films in theaters on back-to-back weekends in August: Tony Tost's Americana followed a week later by Ron Howard's period thriller Eden opposite Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby and Daniel Brühl. NY Film Festival Adds Bruce Springsteen Biopic 'Deliver Me From Nowhere' as Spotlight Gala Hollywood Flashback: Brooke Shields' Jeans Ad Did Not Sit Well September delivers an anticipated Toronto International Film Festival world premiere for a big swing as a queer boxer in David Michod's biopic Christy, which she also produced, followed by Paul Feig's psychological thriller The Housemaid opposite Amanda Seyfried. But that's what happened after American Eagle dropped its “Sydney Has Great Jeans” campaign July 23. It was designed as an ambitious partnership that included print ads, 3D billboards (including one on the Sphere in Las Vegas), Snapchat lens technology that allowed users to interact with a digital Sweeney, and a limited run of the “Sydney Jean” with 100 percent of the net proceeds donated to a nonprofit of the star's choice. Within days, a handful of TikTok users took offense to a campaign clip that features Sweeney saying (with unique inflection), “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The users claimed it promoted eugenics or was a form of Nazi propaganda because Sweeney is white, blond-haired and blue-eyed. “Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST' ad out there. She still hasn't said a word about the campaign or its backlash — allowing American Eagle's statement to stand on its own as the brand reiterated that it was just a slogan about jeans and nothing more — but she did return to Instagram on Wednesday to promote Americana with a carousel of artistic behind-the-scenes images for her 25.3 million followers. “A few years ago I filmed this little movie with some friends and now you get to meet Penny Jo,” posted Sweeney, seen in many of the images that also feature Paul Walter Hauser and pop star turned actress Halsey. But that night, she only posed for photos before quickly ducking inside without speaking to reporters. “The same brand five years ago would've apologized profusely and tried to move past it quickly. Instead, they stuck to their guns and stood by the campaign. Everyone was speaking about her, and she doesn't have to do anything.” But with a busy fall up ahead, she surely will have to speak at some point about her new films even if the first time she does field questions from the press is during a TIFF press conference. Asked how she should respond to the reveal about her voting record as a Republican, Miller said, again, she doesn't need to engage. It's totally appropriate for her to say, ‘I don't discuss my politics, that's personal. Reaching across the aisle today only helps to widen one's appeal, Miller said. Lucy Robertson, head of brand marketing at Buttermilk, an agency that specializes in creator marketing, said the American Eagle campaign felt like a “misstep” for Sweeney because rather than leveraging her as a creative partner who helped shape the narrative. “It uses her as a convenient ‘hook' to hang the campaign on, in this case, with a tone-deaf ‘good genes' message that quietly reinforces Eurocentric beauty ideals like white skin, blonde hair, blue eyes.” Robertson said that “real influence” in today's market comes from being “embedded in the creative ecosystem for the long-term” rather than just doing one-off endorsement deals. In that 14-month collaboration — set to be the first chapter of a multi-year partnership — she hasn't just starred in ads — she's co-designed the Cloudzone Moon sneaker, helped craft the visual story in the evocative ‘Be Every You' campaign, and shaped how her identity and movement translate into both product and storytelling,” Robertson explained of Sweeney's Euphoria co-star. “That level of integration deepens cultural currency where we've seen Sydney front multiple brand campaigns in a short space of time, the result can feel more transactional than transformative.” A well-placed legal source familiar with negotiating A-list brand deals says it may be too soon to tell whether the social media swirl will affect Sweeney's future partnerships and acting gigs. (Amid the American Eagle backlash, Baskin-Robbins disabled comments on its TikTok videos featuring Sweeney.) At a certain level of fame, too many product endorsements could dull one's A-list image, the source added, while others turn to international markets to keep cash flow coming in while avoiding being “everywhere” on their home turf. Matt Herbert, Chief Commercial Officer of brand tracking platform Tracksuit, tells The Hollywood Reporter that the reaction to AE's campaign “doesn't need to necessarily define AE, but it is about how they react from here on.” He cites Pepsi's controversial 2017 ad with Kendall Jenner that some called tone-deaf for using strikingly similar themes to Black Lives Matter protests. Tracksuit also found that brand awareness for another one of Sweeney's brand partnerships for Dr. Squatch saw that company boosted by three percentage points from August 2024 to July 2025. (Recall that the men's soap brand sold bars made with her actual bathwater due to popular demand.) The company also notes that “trendy” is a common theme associated with Laneige, Dr. Squatch and Miu Miu among survey respondents already familiar with all three brands. As for AE's bottom line, the company's next earnings report is Sept. 4, which could offer insight to how much of an impact, positive or negative, the controversy had on sales. Herbert notes that AE was “facing pretty big challenges over the past 18 months,” with brand awareness down by 6 percentage points from January 2024 to June 2025; and consideration, preference and usage declined by 5 percentage points. … any celebrity [endorsement or] brand activation is an attempt to drive relevance, which we know from looking at all of our tracking data.” That could mean even more eyes on Sweeney and her upcoming projects, which in Hollywood is always a good thing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The After Hours til Dawn Tour has grossed over $600 million and sold more than five million tickets so far. The Weeknd is on the road, playing shows in Nashville on Tuesday (Aug. 12) and Miami Friday and Saturday (Aug. 15-16). But as he nears the end of the ongoing After Hours Til Dawn Tour, he sets a Boxscore record. According to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, the global trek has grossed $635.5 million and sold 5.1 million tickets since launching in 2022, becoming the biggest R&B tour in history. This swap comes just weeks after Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter Tour became the country record holder. In pure ticket sales, he has long passed Bruno Mars' 3.6 million on 2017-18's 24K Magic World Tour. The After Hours Til Dawn Tour is the ninth tour to hit this benchmark, and the only one by an R&B artist or a Black artist. The other eight all trade in pop and rock, from Elton John's Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour to Harry Styles' Love on Tour. The same goes for The Weeknd's R&B attendance record, making him the only genre act and only Black artist to sell more than five million tickets on a single tour. It is one of 11 tours to sell more than five million, and one of just eight to sell more than five million and gross more than $600 million. The initial iteration of this tour may not have hit such hallowed ground. But delayed by COVID-19 and then expanded far beyond, the After Hours Til Dawn Tour supports 2020's After Hours, 2022's Dawn FM and this year's Hurry Up Tomorrow. 1s were alongside Ariana Grande, including “Die for You,” which reached the top seven years after its 2016 release via Starboy. Hurry Up Tomorrow debuted atop the Billboard 200 in February with 490,000 equivalent album units, scoring the biggest week of his career with his third album to surpass 400,000. His jump from arenas to stadiums has nearly quadrupled his per-show ticket sales, compounded with a natural rise in ticket sales. Dating back to his first reported show at Montreal's Metropolis on March 23, 2012, The Weeknd has grossed $734 million and sold 6.3 million tickets from more than 200 reported concerts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It was the biggest pop explosion the world had ever seen, with 56,000 kids screaming for John, Paul, George, and Ringo. It's the most famous show they ever played — the most famous pop concert ever — even though nobody could hear a note of it. “It was the first time that anyone had played any of those stadiums,” Paul McCartney recalled in 2003. “It became kind of normal for people like the Floyd. “I think we just went a bit hysterical that night,” he said. But Shea was more than just the first high-profile stadium concert. It showed everyone how huge, untamable, crazed pop music could be. It shattered all the cliches about how show-biz was supposed to work. Never before had that many humans joined together in one place to celebrate music — and on a deeper level, to celebrate each other. That's why “Shea Stadium” is still the two-word code for the culmination of pop dreams at their loudest, lustiest, scariest, and most deranged. The Shea footage is still a shock to witness, no matter how many stadium shows you've seen in person or onscreen. The boys are dazed, walking, stumbling, weaving, looking around in shock. Big surprise: Paul is walking faster than the others, he can't wait to get there, He starts running, skipping, come on lads, John starts running too, let's go, it's all happening too fast but not fast enough for them. The cops hilariously back away from the band, in terror, never having seen or heard a scene like this before, because nobody ever has. Everybody here tonight — except the cops—has dreamed of this moment for months, yet nobody even came close to picturing how it would actually sound or feel. “It was very big and very strange.” Check out poor Ringo as he walks to the stage; he glances up, and you can see his knees buckle with vertigo. George is grinning so wide you're afraid his jaw might snap off. Two of the screaming fans out there in the crowd would end up as Beatle wives — Linda Eastman McCartney and Barbara Bach. Olivia Arias Harrison did her screaming a few days later, at the Hollywood Bowl. It's the scream that makes the Shea legend, more than anything else — the girls are amplifiers for each other, making their collective yeeeaaaaah louder than a hundred thousand lungs have any right to be. At countless solo shows, Paul has asked the ladies in the house, “Give me a great big Beatles scream!” It's one thing to say that in a stadium — yet I saw him say it earlier this year at NYC's Bowery Ballroom, even though it's a bar that holds only a few hundred people. Wherever strangers gather to scream for music, we are all Shea Stadium. This kind of joyful noise didn't usually happen at Shea, home of the New York Mets, then the most famous terrible team in baseball history. But the Beatles, never sports fans even in their boyhoods, didn't know or care a thing about America's pastime. The first time they played a baseball park, in Kansas City in 1964, they mocked the whole sport at a press conference where Paul snickered, “Great game!” Ringo summed it up: “You throw the ball, and then another ten minutes you have a cigarette and throw another ball.” They'll also have a Beatles tribute band playing before the game. Shea was demolished in 2009, but fittingly, Paul McCartney played the last music ever heard there. He crashed a Billy Joel song for the final two songs, “I Saw Her Standing There” and “Let It Be.” In a very Macca touch, he played the same Hofner bass he played there in 1965. Ed Sullivan introduced them at Shea, looking pitifully out of place, like they dug him up for the occasion. Paul was the only one to acknowledge him or shake his hand. They went on at 9:16 pm, after a surprisingly down-market string of opening acts: Motown soul singer Brenda Holloway, sax legend King Curtis, Cannibal & the Headhunters, Sounds Incorporated, the pre-fame Young Rascals (still six months away from their first hit, “Good Lovin'”). It was the first live show of their brief but eventful U.S. jaunt—over the next couple of weeks, they met their idol Elvis Presley in Beverly Hills, and dropped acid at a pool party with the Byrds and Peter Fonda. They played an eccentric half-hour set, skipping their biggest crowd-pleasers — no “She Loves You,” no “I Want To Hold Your Hand,” no “I Saw Her Standing There.” Bizarrely, yet gloriously, they played “Baby's in Black,” a song John and Paul always loved to sing together, sharing a microphone and dueling eyeball to eyeball. They insisted on keeping it in their live show right up to their final gig, even though it was never a hit, not even a single, just a ditty that nobody loved the way these two boys did, for reasons they never divulged. The full set list: “Twist and Shout,” “She's a Woman,” “I Feel Fine,” “Dizzy Miss Lizzy,” “Ticket to Ride,” the George showcase “Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby,” “Can't Buy Me Love,” “Baby's In Black,”  Ringo's vocal “Act Naturally,” “A Hard Day's Night,” “Help!”, and the B-side screamer “I'm Down.” They played Shea Stadium again a year later, in August 1966, but by then, the fun had fizzled out of touring for them. The Fabs were in their final days as a live band, playing their last-ever show less than a week later. But when we talk about Shea Stadium, we're talking about that day in August 1965, and the way it lives on as a permanent part of pop culture. It still represents the standard every pop star aspires to reach. “Now it's quite commonplace for people to play Shea Stadium or Giants Stadium and all those big places, but this was the first time,” Paul said in the 1995 Anthology. They obviously felt we were popular enough to fill it. One night, at one of these giant U.S. shows, their manager Brian Epstein lived out a secret fantasy he'd always had. You look at Shea Stadium, or listen to the havoc going on, and you get swept up in that orgiastic frenzy. “Half the fun was being involved in this gigantic event ourselves,” McCartney said. “I don't think we were heard much by the audience. The normal baseball-stadium PA was intended for: ‘Ladies and gentlemen, the next player is…' But that was handy in that if we were a bit out of tune or didn't play the right note, nobody noticed. Team Trump Is Actually Drawing Up Attack Plans for Mexico Lights, Camera, Smile: Everything We Know About Taylor Swift's ‘The Life of a Showgirl' Full disclosure: I once had a shrink who went to Shea. She casually mentioned it once during a session, and I couldn't let her change the subject back to my issues, now could I? But she knew one of those four specks was Paul. Maybe it was dumb to waste an entire session on those stories—yet I suspect it was one of the most productive therapy sessions I'd ever had. It's far beyond any success the Beatles used to fantasize about back in Liverpool. It 's far beyond the fan's dreams of how wild and ecstatic a musical gathering could be.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The murder of British student Meredith Kercher in 2007 has a different name unfairly associated with it, that of her former roommate, Amanda Knox, who was arrested along with her Italian boyfriend for allegedly committing the crime. Most recently, Knox's conviction of slander against her boss in Perugia was upheld earlier this year. Knox has been in the spotlight for almost two decades, with her well-known saga now being told in a Hulu limited series (that she produced and was actively involved with). Crucially, it digs into the emotional and mental aftermath on Knox (Grace Van Patten), Sollecito (Giuseppe De Domenico), and their respective families. (In the aforementioned doc, The Daily Mail‘s Nick Pisa talks about why she was an appealing subject, whether guilty or not, as opposed to anyone else.) Hulu's series addresses these problems infrequently but also contributes to them by focusing almost entirely on stuff we've seen, heard, and read about before. Twisted Tale raises the unavoidable question of why it dredges up a story that's already been examined in different ways, especially when there are numerous falsely imprisoned folks (disproportionately people of color) who do not receive a fraction of the consideration this specific case has gotten for 18 years and counting. The project is at least self-aware, with series creator K.J. Steinberg (This Is Us) and writer Sam Rubinek (Daisy Jones & The Six) tackling these issues—albeit not for long enough to make their points feel substantial. Similarly, the miniseries pays tribute to Kercher through a few voiceovers (although her family isn't involved and has questioned the show's purpose), but this is ultimately Knox's story. With that in mind, episodes two, six, and eight are particularly tough to sit through, with Van Patten giving a captivating performance. Several officers, including lead prosecutor Giuliani Mignini (Francesco Aquaroli), surround Amanda and pressure her to “remember” events that never happened for hours without a pause, which leads to a breakdown that derails her life. And on the acting front, Sharon Horgan is equally potent as Amanda's devoted mother, Edda Mellas, striking the fine balance of helplessness and vigor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is flush with cash after the president signed his so-called Big Beautiful Bill, so it should probably come as no surprise that the agency has decided to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on new trucks to showcase in social media posts. The Homeland Security Department's thread directs users to ICE's job recruiting website, as it works toward hiring 10,000 officers. Another post with images of the trucks declares: “We will have our country back.” In the past two weeks, Trump's administration spent $384,000 on new Ford Raptors and GMC Yukons for “recruitment purposes,” according to federal procurement data. The administration also spent $182,000 this week on “graphic wrap design and application for law enforcement vehicles.” ICE has new marked vehicles… and they're sporting the same paint job as Trump's personal jet. The decision to parade new ICE trucks around the nation's capital comes as Trump has troops in the streets and is leading a federal takeover of Washington because a group of teenagers allegedly beat up a Trump administration staffer known as “Big Balls.” Team Trump Is Actually Drawing Up Attack Plans for Mexico Lights, Camera, Smile: Everything We Know About Taylor Swift's ‘The Life of a Showgirl' A $560,000 expense on trucks and wraps the administration can use in social media posts looks downright frugal compared to the $200 million that DHS is spending on ads thanking Trump for deporting immigrants.</p>

Around the globe, access to safe and affordable women's healthcare is becoming a thing of make-believe, but an emerging trend in indie film has sparked short bursts of spectacular pushback. At California's Palm Springs ShortFest and Salute Your Shorts Fest and the Fantasia Fest in Montreal, IndieWire screened several short films this summer that sit at the intersection of women's rights and supernatural ideas. “It almost felt like I had to sell my soul to do it,” said filmmaker Kylie Aoibhean, whose experience traveling to Thailand from Sydney, Australia for gender-affirming surgery inspired “The Dysphoria.” The horror short follows a young woman who makes a ghastly deal with a witch in exchange for her problematic boyfriend. “I knew there was an easier way,” said the director. Related Stories TIFF Accepts Oct. 7 Doc ‘The Road Between Us' After Public ‘Pain and Frustration,' Cameron Bailey Says ‘Night Always Comes' Review: Vanessa Kirby Goes to Hell and Back in a Scuzzy Odyssey Through Impoverished America In “Feed,” a stomach-churning creature short, filmmaker Nancy Urich and her co-writer Stephanie Johns unpacked their difficult experiences as young moms in Canada through some lesser-known Icelandic folklore. “It felt important to have a film with a cathartic and empowering ending that leaves you with some sort of hope,” Shi said. Check out this recent post from Human Rights Watch for International Women's Day, and you'll find that future Shi is warning us about may already be coming. Then, it turns — to tales of abduction, subjugation, and sexual violence. Attacks on women and girls continue to rage everywhere. “Women's access to healthcare and living a life free from violence is good for everyone. Obstacles preventing trans and nonbinary people from getting gender-affirming care vary internationally. “I had to use pretty much all the savings that I had, and that was so daunting,” said Aoibhean. Thailand pioneered many of the techniques used in modern vaginoplasty, and there aren't enough qualified health providers in Australia. “I ended up feeling like I had to put my career on a total halt as a writer and director,” said Aoibhean, whose recovery abroad took just under six weeks. “I had to put projects on pause and turn down opportunities. That was the most difficult thing to do, pushing it all back and putting my life on hold.” In “The Dysphoria,” Alice (Eva Rees) learns that haunting lesson from a literal flesh and blood nightmare. When the desperate heroine accidentally summons a demonic presence named Lilith (Carissa Lee) to her home, the ritual she'd hoped would give her a magical vagina asks for her boyfriend, Tyler (Adam White), as payment. The result is something like a trans femme “Midsommar” — douchebag skull-smashing included. Tyler sucks, but he doesn't misgender Alice or call her names. Instead, “The Dysphoria” snaps his awfulness into focus through a “slightly weirder, more liberal lens.” It's only when Tyler attempts to stop his girlfriend's transaction with the demon by fetishizing her body — calling Alice's transness “special” in the worst way — that Aoibhean seals the boy-toy's grisly fate. Even armed with a great script and strong actors, “The Dysphoria” filmmaker needed the help of special effects company Sharp Effects (also behind Shudder's “Late Night with the Devil”) to pull off its gory crowning moment. Credited cryptically as Lilith's Dog, actor Tim Clarke appears on all fours with a bag over his head. “The actor was basically blind because he had a hood covering his face,” said Aoibhean. She described an elaborate apparatus that pumped fake gore through a tube to Clarke's burlap mask. “When we finally got on set,” Aoibhean said, “Then it felt like, ‘This is some unholy magic. Motherhood requires women to perfect the art of a different kind multitasking. For Nancy Urich, that skillset came in handy again as a director — when the Canadian filmmaker squeezed the two-day shoot for her nauseating creature short, “Feed,” into an unexpected production delay during another feature. “We were all set up and it was basically like a cosmic thing,” said Urich. So, I just said, ‘OK, it's now or never. Urich and her co-writer Stephanie Johns penned the upcoming “Permanent Damage” and a feature-length version of “Feed” at the same time. Still, limited resources demanded the creative duo — who met through an all-mom garage band, shortly after giving birth — pick one concept to champion first. Filming in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the six-minute horror snippet ends with an elegantly disgusting reveal. “That [effect] had been in development with our puppeteer for over a year at that point,” said Urich, who also told IndieWire that she wanted to keep details about her sickening invention under wraps for now. In the short film version of “Feed,” an elderly woman (Clare Coulter) pedals magical nipple cream to her susceptible neighbors as a cure-all for babies who have trouble latching. The monster was designed and puppeteered by Cassie Seaboyer. Work on “Feed” began for Urich and Johns over a decade ago, when the women pivoted from practicing music to writing movies. Women can be discouraged from getting critical healthcare in obstetrics and gynecology by social barriers as much as financial and legal ones. They've also got universal healthcare, but postpartum depression and the anxiety of keeping a kid alive don't take insurance. It's like breaking in new shoes for three months. Like filmmaking, breastfeeding gets easier the longer you do it, said Urich. “Once you get over the unknowingness of it, it doesn't matter as much if this part hurts, or if this happens or that happens,” she said. Making peace with that grueling duality of motherhood anchors “Feed,” but it was Urich and Johns' willingness to incubate their story for several years that suggests it's worth the feature long haul. “The full story is about a mother who is alone, and figuring out breastfeeding, and having a very hard time on so many levels,” Urich said. “Then, she comes against this creature, and like you saw with the short film, she realizes in the end that, yes, it's disgusting and terrible — but maybe it can help her.” Like many Americans, Connie Shi was angry when The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in July 2022. “I wrote the script really quickly, just as a personal therapeutic process. “The Rebirth” is a knock-out action adventure that sees Shi direct herself in a character arc that dares to get creative with the pro-choice platform. Based on an account the director heard when she moved to New York City as a young actor in 2013, the superhero origin story from Shi follows a restaurant employee who feels pressured to push through her shift at work — despite the severe side effects she's experiencing from a pharmaceutical abortion. “My mom is an immigrant from China,” said Shi. I was certainly raised that way, feeling like I always had to ask for permission to exist, and that's exactly where Hana is at the beginning of the film.” Shi's tableside vigilante figure realizes she has super-strength when a creepy customer tries to grope Hana, and she responds by breaking his wrist. Sitting in her car, processing the comedic carnage she just left behind, Hana checks her phone and reads the daily headlines in Shi's dystopian future. Shi doesn't consider herself a genre buff when it comes to comics or superheroes, but the filmmaker says that womanhood in America requires “superhuman strength.” Of course, we're better as a team. “Even with tons of rehearsal, we had to move so fast during the production that I could barely watch playback.” Stuck with 1 a.m. call times (so Stephanie's husband's bar could stay open during the day), “The Rebirth” was a labor of love that continues to fuel Shi's feminism. Some state laws seek to disqualify many of the reasons a patient might seek an abortion, while other legislative efforts have significantly shortened the window of opportunity for patients who might otherwise be eligible to get one. “Trump just passed a bill that's going to kick millions of people off Medicaid. Other laws in the U.S. have gone after medical providers and activists who help Americans in red states travel to locations where abortion is legal. That said, simultaneously, the Kaiser Family Foundation has found “the total number of abortions nationally has slightly increased” since Roe v. Wade was scrapped. Their research suggests “expanded telehealth capacity, the ability to mail medication abortion pills to patients, and lower costs” could be causing the unintended side effect. Asked about the mass deportations now impacting immigrants, Shi was rational but undeterred. “They're coming for all of us,” the filmmaker said. “We can't just lay back and say, ‘Well, it's not us.' No, we all need to be engaged in this today. So, consider who you surround yourself with as we move forward. You feel power flowing from those kinds of people.” Aoibhean is working on a haunted house feature, titled “Dead Name,” that's set to shoot next year. It's a high-concept trans film about a woman haunted by her younger male self and “the lingering fear that part of her will always be a man.” Filmmaker Urich and co-writer Johns are scheduled to shoot “Feed” as a feature film in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia next spring. Shi noted that her short was still early in its festival run but told IndieWire that the feature treatment is already complete. She's currently seeking interest from backers who want to expand “The Rebirth” universe into a full film. More American and European dates will be announced soon. “Feed” is unlikely to stream online as a short, but more festival screenings will be announced soon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today, in “Big-name music beefs that probably won't end up being splashed all over the halftime show at the Super Bowl” news: Lana Del Rey has taken pretty clear aim at fellow musician Ethel Cain, releasing a portion of a new track last night that called out the Willoughby Tucker artist by name. “Ethel Cain hated my Instagram post,” Del Rey's voice croons as the Instagram video shows her looking slightly bored while riding around in a car and lip-syncing. Other lyrics seem to reference Cain taking a picture with Del Rey's former boyfriend, Jack Donoghue, and namecheck a 2022 New York Times profile about her, “Ethel Cain Is The Most Famous Girl At The Waffle House.”  (Del Rey is, herself, a pretty famous Waffle House fan.) All of which feels pretty pointed, especially after Variety recorded for posterity an Instagram comment that Del Rey reportedly made in response to a Popbase posting about the release. The comment has since been deleted, but reportedly saw Del Rey getting a little bit into her motivations for opening fire like this, stating that “I didn't know who Ethel was until a few years ago— when someone brought to my attention the disturbing and graphic side-by-side images she would often put up of me next to unflattering creatures and cartoon characters making constant comments about my weight, I was confused at what she was getting at. Then when I heard what she was saying behind closed doors from mutual friends and started inserting herself into my personal life I was definitely disturbed.” Cain—who just released a new album a few days ago—hasn't commented on the suddenly public beef with the much-more-established Del Rey Speaking of: Del Rey released her last album, Did You Know That There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, back in early 2023.

The optics, for starters, are appalling — both what we see and the context in which we see it. Episode 12 isn't written like a series finale. It's barely written to be a finale. And yet, HBO and showrunner Michael Patrick King would have us believe this was the plan all along. When it was announced two weeks ago that Season 3 of “And Just Like That” would be its last, King framed the decision as a creative choice. “While I was writing the last episode of ‘And Just Like That' Season 3, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop,” King wrote on Instagram. “Along with Sarah Jessica Parker, Casey Bloys, and Sarah Aubrey, we decided to end the popular series this year with a two-part finale and extended the original series order from 10 episodes to 12.” Character by character, “Party of One” does next to nothing to resolve any of our expansive cast's ongoing arcs. Are we supposed to assume, because Seema tells Adam, “I don't miss the gluten,” that she also won't miss getting married? And that these two attractive opposites will get married? And that this is a decision Seema came to wholly on her own, for her own happiness, and not as a way of settling for a guy she's convinced herself she loves? (Sorry, maybe she really does love him, but that whole relationship never quite clicked.) Charlotte and Lisa Todd's shared fears of getting crushed trying to support their husbands' wounded egos aren't given enough breathing room to merit much more than the resolution we get, but is that all we're supposed to learn from Charlotte's brush with widow-dom and Lisa Todd's season-long flirtation with her jacked editor? Eventually your partner will fuck you and/or do the dishes? Miranda, meanwhile, is once again hung out to dry. What about the grandchild she's been fretting over? I mean, that was a terrible Thanksgiving, and Mia's (Ella Stiller) equally awful behavior proved why Brady (Niall Cunningham) should have no interest in spending any more time with her than his mother forces upon him, but is Miranda done trying to salvage their disdainful little family? Before Joy comes over for leftover pie, Miranda takes solace from the soiled holiday in the points she managed to score with her not-daughter-in-law. That can't be where King and his deranged writers' room wanted to leave us, with Mia, Brady, Miranda, and Steve's future together (or apart) very much up in the air. Does that sound like a “clear” artistic choice? And speaking of murky waters, yes, it's time to address the literal turd in the (punch)bowl: In no universe should the ending of “And Just Like That” — a series that's only consistently respectable elements are the beautiful gowns, gorgeous sets, and stunning NYC locations — include multiple shots of a clogged toilet erupting with actual pieces of shit. I would argue such a visual doesn't belong in the show at all (unless, as some suspect, “And Just Like That's” sole purpose in its final seasons was to fuel its own hate-watchers, in which case the finale's poo-pocalypse goes off like a starter pistol, starting a race across social media to see who can concoct the most malicious turdplay). There are less than seven minutes between our last ever glimpse of Carrie Bradshaw, dancing down her palatial hallway in thousands of dollars of head-to-toe pink, and a gurgling geyser of feces spewing straight up into our collectively horrified faces. The dread and rage Victor Garber channels on the viewers' behalf is both perfectly agitated and woefully inadequate, just as none of the images in between his nightmare and Carrie's adieu are memorable enough to make us forget the frightful stool pool. This is what millions of fans will remember from their last moments with “Sex and the City”! (Side note: I've actually enjoyed Mario Cantone as Anthony and his comic-relief romance with Sebastiano Pigazzi's Giuseppe, but they barely register in “And Just Like That's” final half-hour. OK, sure, given the sheer volume of pies in Episode 12, one had to be wielded like a clown's prop. “And Just Like That” started by killing off your ever mine, ever thine, ever ours, then forced an extended, unwieldy reunion with your annoying ex, before stumbling into a non-conclusion where you're single in the city once again. I'm sure the powers that be will spin Carrie's rewritten epilogue as an empowering full-circle moment. Your editor will hate it, but that's OK. What's not OK can't be articulated so succinctly: Regarding her episodic arc, Carrie is humiliated at the start of “Party of One,” so it makes sense for her to refuse to feel humiliated at the end. …except the indelible image of the episode is a swirling hurricane of human waste, and even though it's not her bathroom, not her toilet, not her shit (can you imagine?! ), there's no way to avoid the humiliation, even by association. Worse still is what it means for “And Just Like That” as a whole. While closing out a show best known for its bizarre choices with a slew of increasingly inexplicable “endings” could be seen as fitting, the series reminds us what we missed out on by ending where it should've started: with an ebullient, assured Carrie Bradshaw ready to embrace New York City, her friends, and her life in general, unencumbered by any obligations to the past — no Big and no Aidan, no mourning and no nostalgic clinging. Doesn't that sound like a fun show to watch? Doesn't it confound basic narrative logic to turn the beginning of something we never got to see into the end of something we didn't want? Not a redo or reboot, just doo-doo. “And Just Like That” is available on HBO Max. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“And Just Like That” has taken its final bow, bringing another chapter of the “Sex and the City” legacy to a close. Unlike the original show, which spent a year building up to its farewell, the sequel wrapped up in just two weeks after announcing its end. That quick turnaround left little time for fans to brace themselves for the final walks, talks & cocktails shared by Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, Seema, Lisa Todd Wexley, Anthony, and the rest of the beloved ensemble. Later, she met up with Seema, Lisa & Charlotte at a bridal fashion show, where the champagne flowed and the chatter, as always, circled back to love and relationships. Carrie later shares her vulnerable take on being alone with Charlotte. Carrie navigates the idea of accepting herself without any man validating her. Charlotte, like a true friend, calls her “Fabulous”. Later, after a disastrous Thanksgiving chaos (and overflowing Toilet) at Miranda's, Carrie made a quiet exit and returned home, slipping into heels and singing along to a karaoke version of Barry White's “You're the First, the Last, My Everything.” This time, there was no romantic add-on. She ended her novel with the line, “The woman realises she was not alone, she was on her own.” It was a deep and full-circle end for Carrie! And no, there is nothing wrong with being alone. Charlotte, like a giving friend, sets up a date for Carrie, and no, she's not happy with it. After a season packed with stress and chaos, she finally gets a rare moment to simply enjoy her family. While she wasn't pleased with many things happening in her family, she is blissfully happy with having them around. From the early days of the “Sex and the City” era, Charlotte has been obsessed with the idea of having a family by her side, so this moment feels like a perfect payoff, one that is both well-deserved & genuinely earned. Miranda's confusing storyline began on shaky ground and only found its footing in season 3. Be it her co-parenting with Steve and how they navigate becoming grandparents, or how her relationship with Joy (Dolly Wells) unfolds. Joy finally shows up to Miranda's Thanksgiving dinner after it's over (with a clogged toilet). They hug it out as they finally are on the same page and are okay with each other's baggage. Seema is still skeptical about Adam because he doesn't believe in marriage. She reveals she is fond of Adam but doesn't believe in the idea of someone else choosing her. Later, Seema is seen sharing a pie with Adam and his sister. Dating in the 50s isn't easy, but there's still hope, and Seema's story proves just that. Torn over their age difference and a disapproving future mother-in-law (Patti LuPone), and the baggage of a past failed marriage. Giuseppe, however, seems more than willing to risk it all for love. Anthony calls out Giuseppe for not wanting to marry him, accusing him of just looking for “a mummy.” Giuseppe's answer? They both end up laughing, pie-covered & completely smitten. Married or not, Anthony and Giuseppe know how to make each other happy. Lisa and Charlotte get into a deep conversation about their married lives. Lisa, who is attracted to her colleague, later shares a conversation with Herbert that eventually ends with her. So no, she is not cheating on her husband! She is accepting her marriage with all its imperfections. Despite the ups & downs, Lisa and Herbert have weathered the storms and remain committed to staying together. With the AJLT kids each bringing their own bold personalities, it's hard not to imagine a spinoff: a Next Gen “Sex and the City” following their friendships, drama & every gloriously messy romance in between.
