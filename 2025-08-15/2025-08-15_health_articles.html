                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although the fluorescence timescale is suitable for monitoring numerous biological processes, certain processes often require monitoring over extended durations. To access intrinsic amino acids, such as tryptophan, as probes, the UV excitation wavelengths for pulsed phosphorescence measurements have long been the preserve of low-repetition-rate gas-filled lamps or larger laser systems. Recent advancements have enabled the use of interchangeable semiconductor diodes, known for their simplicity. SpectraLEDs (Figure 1), which offer spectral coverage from the UV to the near-IR, are ideal for such measurements and have been previously applied in studies of lanthanides and singlet oxygen (refer to Application Notes TRFA‐4, ‐6, ‐11, and ‐12). Unlike xenon flashlamps, these sources do not exhibit a “tail” and can run at elevated repetition rates (several kHz). These sources can attach directly to DeltaHub or FluoroHub timing electronics, with repetition rate automatically adjusting to the selected time range via the DataStation measurement software. This software also manages the duty cycle and temporal position of their output as needed to align with sample settings. Measurements were conducted utilizing the DeltaFlex system, equipped with either a SpectraLED S‐295 or DeltaDiode DD‐295 excitation source for phosphorescence (44 ms range) and fluorescence lifetime (100 ns range) measurements, respectively. Data was analyzed using DAS6 as the sum of exponentials, presenting either the relative amplitudes (or fractionals, fi) or normalized pre‐exponentials (αi). The main governing equations are listed below: The contribution of each emitting species can be represented as either a normalized pre‐exponential (α) or relative amplitude (or fractional, f). Here, the average lifetime can be represented: Treated data was plotted utilizing FluorEssence software based on Origin. Potassium iodide and sodium sulfite were added to the HSA solution as deoxygenators to observe RT phosphorescence from tryptophan. Research has demonstrated that HSA experiences multiple reversible structural changes before irreversibly denaturing above ~75 °C. To determine whether the time‐resolved tryptophan decay was affected by this, a temperature study was conducted, tracking its fluorescence. Effect of temperature on the time‐resolved decay of tryptophan in HSA, with exponential analysis showing normalized pre‐exponentials (αi, 1 relates to shortest‐lived, 3 to longest) and average lifetime, <τ>. This analysis method reveals a clear change in fluorescence as temperature increases. Overall lifetime decreases, along with a change in the contribution of individual lifetimes to the emission. In practice, selecting an ideal analysis model depends on the system under study and the process to be monitored. Here, the phosphorescence decays, collected at 450 nm, were measured across a similar temperature range, with outcomes illustrated in Figure 3. These findings provide evidence for the existence of multiple emitting species, with average lifetime and relative contribution varying with temperature. The average lifetime trend reflects other studies showing transitions related to thermally-induced conformational changes. The measurements presented in this article validate the DeltaFlex's capability, equipped with multiple excitation sources, to track both fluorescence and phosphorescence of tryptophan in human serum albumin.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research reveals how common respiratory viruses can flip dormant breast cancer cells back into growth mode, uncovering an immune-driven pathway that heightens relapse risk and pointing to new prevention strategies. Study: Respiratory viral infections awaken metastatic breast cancer cells in lungs. Disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) can remain dormant for years after initial remission before metastatic relapse. The tumor microenvironment and cell-intrinsic factors determine whether metastatic cells progress or remain dormant. Notably, microenvironmental disturbances can be sufficient to increase metastasis. Respiratory viral infections are common, with seasonal flu affecting over one billion people yearly. These infections are usually associated with pulmonary inflammation along with an increase in inflammatory cytokines (interferons [IFNs] and interleukin 6 [IL-6]) and expansion of immune cells, such as macrophages, T cells, and neutrophils. Such inflammatory mechanisms have been reported as regulators of metastatic processes. In the present study, researchers examined the effects of respiratory viral infections on breast cancer dormancy in mice. Mice were infected with a sub-lethal dose of IAV; both MMTV-Her2 and wild-type mice showed comparable inflammatory response and viral clearance kinetics. Lungs were harvested at several time points and assessed for the abundance of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) cells. Nevertheless, metastatic burden increased by up to 1,000-fold between three and 15 days post-infection (dpi). Further, the team observed a significant increase in HER2+ cells expressing Ki67 at 3 dpi. Although Ki67-expressing HER2+ cells decreased by 15 dpi, the number of these cells remained elevated at 60 dpi compared to baseline. Dormant DCCs maintain a mesenchymal-like state (vimentin-positive) and undergo an epithelial shift (epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive [EpCAM+]) during dormancy exit. In contrast, a fraction of HER2+ cells showed EpCAM expression by 3 dpi. Thus, IAV infection induced a transient epithelial shift, creating a unique hybrid and proliferative phenotype that retained some mesenchymal marker expression, allowing dormant DCC awakening. RNA-seq analyses showed activation of inflammatory (IL-6–JAK–STAT3), angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix–remodelling pathways, including collagen crosslinking and metalloproteinase activity, which are known to support tumour growth. The authors also reported shifts in the tumour microenvironment, including extracellular matrix changes and angiogenic signalling, that could help sustain awakened DCCs. Further investigations indicated that infection-triggered IL-6 was key in mediating initial dormant DCC awakening. The researchers identified a two-phase process: first, IL-6 drives the switch from a mesenchymal to a hybrid phenotype and fuels rapid expansion; later, after T-cell recruitment, CD4+ T cells sustain the awakened DCC population. During this second phase, CD4+ cells partly maintain DCCs by suppressing CD8+ immune responses. Gene expression profiling revealed that CD4+ cells in tumour-bearing mice had reduced mitochondrial content, a bias toward a memory phenotype, and lower effector function, further limiting CD8+ cytotoxicity. The study also found that depleting CD4+ cells restored CD8+ cell mitochondrial content and effector activity, leading to more effective elimination of DCCs. Next, the team investigated whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can awaken dormant DCCs. To this end, a mouse-adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain (MA10) was used. Further, the researchers analyzed data from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB) to assess whether a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was associated with a higher risk of mortality among cancer survivors. In a UKB population followed up until December 2022, which included 4,837 individuals with a cancer diagnosis before 2015, 413 deaths were recorded. These included 115 and 298 deaths, those who tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, respectively, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of 4.5. Even after excluding COVID-19-attributed deaths, test-positive individuals still had higher mortality, with an OR of 2.56. The team observed elevated risks for all-cause, non-COVID-19, and cancer mortality among participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to those who tested negative. Finally, the Flatiron Health Database was used to evaluate whether females with breast cancer experienced a higher risk of metastatic progression to the lungs after COVID-19. Females with COVID-19 after breast cancer diagnosis had a hazard ratio of 1.44 for subsequent diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer, adjusted for age, race, and ethnicity. After additional adjustment for breast cancer subtype and comorbidities, the hazard ratio was 1.41 and no longer statistically significant, although the direction of effect was consistent. The results indicate that respiratory viral infections promote awakening and expansion of dormant cancer cells. An IL-6-dependent switch from a mesenchymal state to a hybrid phenotype promotes expansion, followed by the establishment of CD4+ niches that inhibit DCC elimination. These niches also impair CD8+ antitumour activity by altering immune cell metabolism and effector potential. Other immune cell populations, including macrophages, also showed phenotype shifts toward a tumour-supportive state. Overall, these data reveal how pulmonary viral infections elevate cancer recurrence risk, with both mouse and human data showing the greatest risk in the early period after infection, underscoring the need for strategies to alleviate the increased risk of associated metastatic progression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Review findings reveal a dose-dependent relationship wherein consuming over 60 grams (g) of almonds daily was observed to significantly reduce certain markers of cellular damage (notably MDA and 8-OHdG) and, in some analyses, improve the body's antioxidant enzymes (SOD overall, though not significantly in the >60 g/day subgroup). These results support the role of almonds as a potential functional food for managing oxidative stress, though the authors emphasize that more standardized trials are needed before considering public health policy recommendations, particularly given the high variability in results and the influence of factors such as almond preparation, baseline oxidative stress status, and participant characteristics. Cells are under constant attack from reactive oxygen species (ROS), unstable molecules that are known to damage lipids, proteins, and even DNA, resulting in mutations and associated diseases. Over time, this ROS-mediated cellular damage accumulates and has been identified as a leading cause of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, cancers, and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite these surveillance and diagnostic techniques, the global burden of oxidative stress continues to rise. Almonds (specifically, the fruits of the Prunus amygdalus or Prunus dulcis tree) are rich in protective antioxidant compounds, including vitamin E, polyphenols, and healthy monounsaturated fats, making them a promising dietary tool to combat oxidative stress. While previous studies have been encouraging, their limited sample sizes made findings confounding and ungeneralizable, requiring a comprehensive analysis to consolidate their cumulative evidence. Blanching removes key benefits: Crucially, the beneficial polyphenols concentrated in almond skins are virtually eliminated when almonds are blanched before consumption or processing. The present systematic review addresses this knowledge gap by collating and reanalyzing data from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at quantifying the effect of almond consumption on oxidative stress. The comprehensive literature search comprised a custom keyword search of several online scientific repositories, including Scopus, PubMed/Medline, and the Web of Science from database initiation till January 2025. A two-phase screening process was employed to identify only publications examining adults (≥ 18 years), where almond supplementation of any form was the intervention, and outcomes were reported using oxidation status biomarkers. Any RCTs or crossover trials meeting these criteria were included in subsequent analyses. Extracted data included estimates of key biomarkers, and analyses leveraged a random-effects model to pool the results and calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD; overall effect). Crucially, subgroup analysis was conducted to determine if the dose of almonds, specifically, less than or more than 60 grams daily, influenced observed outcomes. Gut connection: Almond fiber doesn't just aid digestion; it promotes gut bacteria like Bifidobacterium, which produce compounds helping reduce overall body-wide oxidative stress. Title, abstract, and full text screening identified eight high-quality trials (five parallel RCTs and three crossover trials) that met inclusion criteria (n = 424 participants). Summary statistics revealed that the included study populations were diverse, including healthy individuals, smokers, and patients with chronic diseases. Meta-analysis outcomes revealed that the antioxidant effects of almonds are partly dose dependent. While lower doses showed minimal impact, supplementation with 60 grams or more daily (~2 large handfuls) produced significant improvements in specific key biomarkers, particularly those indicative of cellular damage (MDA and 8-OHdG). Almond consumption also led to a small but significant reduction in uric acid levels (WMD = -0.64, p = 0.009), which the authors suggest may be related to inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity, a key source of uric acid and reactive oxygen species. Its impact on glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was not statistically significant. Notably, heterogeneity evaluations established a high degree of variability across the studies for some outcomes (I² > 90%), implying that differences in study design, almond preparation (raw vs. roasted, blanched vs. unblanched), loss of polyphenols from skin removal, potential genetic variability in antioxidant enzyme responses, and interactions between almond fiber and polyphenols influencing gut microbiota and systemic oxidative status likely contributed to inconsistent results. This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that almond supplementation can help manage oxidative stress, particularly for some biomarkers, and that benefits for MDA may be more evident at doses higher than 60 grams per day. Not all biomarkers responded in a dose-dependent manner, and SOD improvements were observed overall but not significantly in the high-dose subgroup. These findings support the classification of almonds as a potential functional food. Still, the high variability between studies highlights a critical need for future research.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A long-running study of nearly 80,000 people shows that plant-based eating offers broad cancer protection, with benefits spanning from the digestive tract to hormone-related cancers, without raising risk for any type. Study: Longitudinal associations between vegetarian dietary habits and site-specific cancers in the Adventist Health Study-2 North American cohort. A recent study in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition investigated the associations between different types of vegetarian diets and the risk of cancer at various bodily sites. A vegetarian diet is a dietary pattern that generally focuses on higher intake of vegetables, fruit, nuts, and legumes while limiting or excluding meat. In contrast, the Western diet is characterized by high intake of refined grains, processed food, red meat, and sugary drinks. Furthermore, the exclusion of meat intake in a vegetarian diet decreases the risk of obesity, which has been linked to many cancer types. Although the association between vegetarian dietary habits and cancers at various bodily sites has remained controversial, a few robust links have been established. For instance, both processed and unprocessed red meat consumption has been linked with increased risk of colorectal cancers. Previous publications from the group behind this study indicated a protective association between a vegetarian diet and common cancers, such as colorectal, breast, and prostate. However, more research is needed to link a vegetarian diet with less common cancer types. This study focuses on building on the knowledge regarding the benefits of vegetarian diets across a broader range of cancer types. Out of the 95,863 enrolled participants, approximately 26,000 were Black, which enabled scientists to focus on this minority group as well. Participants were screened based on eligibility criteria and the availability of complete data relevant to this study. All participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire about their dietary patterns, and were divided into different groups based on their answers. Participants were assigned to one of the following groups: vegans, lacto-ovo-vegetarians, pesco-vegetarians, semi-vegetarians, or non-vegetarians. Participants who avoided all animal products were included in the vegan group, while those who avoided all flesh (meat or fish) foods but consumed eggs and dairy were assigned to the lacto-ovo-vegetarian group. Similarly, pesco-vegetarians were defined as lacto-ovo-vegetarians who also consumed fish at least once a month, while semi-vegetarians ate non-fish flesh foods infrequently (at least once a month but less than once a week). The authors matched AHS-2 data to all United States state cancer registries except Maine and three Canadian provincial registries to identify new cancer diagnoses. For each cancer site, participants were stratified for age, gender, education, and past and present cancer screening habits. The marginal standardization method was used to compare vegetarians to non-vegetarian participants, after adjusting for age, sex, and race. The current study indicated differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians were near-null or favored vegetarians for all cancer types, except perhaps myeloma. In comparison to Adventist non-vegetarians, all vegetarian diets were associated with a reduced risk of both total (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.88) and medium-frequency cancers (HR: 0.82). The authors noted that adjusting for Body Mass Index (BMI) slightly weakened these protective associations, suggesting that lower body weight among vegetarians partially mediates these benefits. It is notable that even the non-vegetarian Adventists in the study are a health-conscious group, consuming less meat and alcohol than the general population, which may mean the protective effects of vegetarian diets could be even more pronounced when compared to a typical Western diet. Different vegetarian diets have been shown to independently influence specific types of cancer. For example, a vegan diet was linked to a lower incidence of breast and prostate cancers at younger ages, though the protective association for prostate cancer was not observed in older men. Pesco-vegetarians were at a lower risk of colorectal cancer (a finding also significant for all vegetarians combined, HR: 0.79) and breast cancer at older ages. A significantly lower risk for lymphoproliferative cancers (which include lymphomas) was observed in vegetarians (HR: 0.75), with lacto-ovo-vegetarians and, in some age groups, vegans showing a lower risk. The risk of stomach cancer was significantly lower among all vegetarians combined (HR: 0.55), with the paper noting this was also seen in lacto-ovo-vegetarians. Some of these site-specific findings were based on relatively small case numbers and should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to determine whether a vegetarian diet affects the risk of pancreatic, lung, and ovarian cancers. No evidence has indicated that a vegetarian dietary pattern increases the risk of any cancer. For instance, relatively small numbers of less common cancers could be linked with vegans and pesco-vegetarians.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By measuring subtle changes in voice quality, AI could help doctors detect dangerous vocal fold lesions before symptoms worsen. Study: Voice as a biomarker: exploratory analysis for benign and malignant vocal fold lesions. An exploratory study reveals that subtle changes in voice patterns, especially variability in harmonic-to-noise ratio, could serve as early warning signs of vocal fold lesions, paving the way for future AI-powered screening tools. A new study led by Oregon Health and Science University and Portland State University researchers identified distinct vocal features that may serve as potential biomarkers for early detection of benign and malignant vocal fold lesions. Alterations in voice pitch, loudness, and quality characterize vocal disorders. Various factors can potentially trigger these disorders, including vocal fold pathology, neurologic conditions, or functional voice use patterns. Individuals with voice disorders often experience poor quality of life, low self-esteem, work-related difficulties, and social isolation. These experiences are particularly more pronounced among individuals whose professional roles significantly depend on voice communication. Both benign and malignant vocal fold lesions (laryngeal cancer) are associated with voice disorders. While benign lesions substantially affect voice quality and cause morbidity, malignant lesions are often life-threatening if left untreated. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have facilitated human voice analysis for early detection of a variety of health conditions, including laryngeal pathology, neurological and psychological disorders, head and neck cancers, and diabetes. The use of voice as a digital biomarker provides a promising platform for non-invasive detection and screening of these potentially life-threatening conditions. The Voice to AI project, as part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) consortium, aims to analyze voice as a biomarker of health for use in clinical care. In the current study, researchers analyzed the Bridge2AI-Voice dataset to identify specific acoustic features that effectively distinguish laryngeal cancer and benign vocal fold lesions from other vocal pathologies and healthy voice function. Acoustic features refer to measurable voice properties, including pitch, loudness, and quality. The participants were categorized into two groups based on lesion type and vocal disorder diagnosis. The first group included participants with laryngeal cancer, benign lesions, or no voice disorder, and the second group included participants with laryngeal cancer or benign lesions without other voice disorders, as well as those with other vocal disorders (spasmodic dysphonia or vocal fold paralysis). Transgender participants were excluded from sex-stratified analyses because prior voice-altering care could not be verified. Four acoustic features plus the variability (standard deviation) of HNR, fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR) were extracted from the voice recordings of participants for comparative analysis. The analysis of acoustic features revealed that participants with benign lesions have significantly different mean HNR and fundamental frequency compared to those without any voice disorder, and significantly different HNR variability (SD) compared to laryngeal cancer. HNR variability (SD) was not significantly different between benign lesions and no voice disorder. The gender-related comparison revealed in cisgender men similar differences in mean HNR and HNR variability vs no voice disorder and HNR variability vs laryngeal cancer, but not in female participants, which might be due to the smaller sample size. No significant differences were found for jitter or shimmer in any comparison, and no acoustic feature significantly distinguished lesion groups from other vocal disorders in the second analysis group. The study identifies harmonic-to-noise ratio variability (standard deviation) as a promising voice-related biomarker for early detection and monitoring of vocal fold lesions. The observed differences in standard deviation between benign and malignant lesion groups suggest that this feature may serve as a useful marker for monitoring lesion progression and detecting laryngeal cancer at an early stage. However, the study could not detect significant differences in the harmonic-to-noise ratio and its variability between participants with benign or malignant lesions and those with other vocal disorders. This indicates that distinguishing lesions from other vocal pathologies may be more challenging. Notably, the study could not detect significant differences in the harmonic-to-noise ratio and its variability among female participants. This highlights the need for analyzing additional acoustic features in order to consider voice as a promising early indicator of vocal fold lesions. The authors emphasise that these are exploratory findings and do not constitute a validated screening test. They call for larger, more diverse cohorts and additional acoustic features to be assessed, particularly in women, before integration into clinical tools. Overall, the study findings highlight the future potential of validated AI-based voice screening tools to identify individuals with subtle voice changes who may not otherwise seek care, especially in primary care or telehealth settings. Such tools could prompt earlier referrals to voice specialists, help prioritize urgent cases, and reduce diagnostic delays.
