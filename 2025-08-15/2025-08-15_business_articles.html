                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said Friday that he will investigate Meta following a report that the company approved rules allowing artificial intelligence chatbots to have certain "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with children. Hawley called on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to preserve relevant materials, including emails, and said the probe would target "whether Meta's generative-AI products enable exploitation, deception, or other criminal harms to children, and whether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards." Hawley said in a post on X announcing the investigation. Meta declined to comment on Hawley's letter. Hawley noted a Reuters report published Thursday that cited an internal document detailing acceptable behaviors from Meta AI chatbots that the company's staff and contract workers should permit as part of developing and training the software. The document acquired by Reuters noted that a chatbot would be permitted to hold a romantic conversation with an eight-year-old, telling the child that "every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply." The Meta guidelines said: "It is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (ex: 'your youthful form is a work of art')," according to the Reuters report. The Meta chatbots would not be permitted to engage in more explicit conversations with children under 13 "in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable," the report said. "We intend to learn who approved these policies, how long they were in effect, and what Meta has done to stop this conduct going forward," Hawley wrote. "We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors," the Meta spokesperson told Reuters. Hawley said Meta must produce documents about its Generative AI-related content risks and standards, lists of every product that adheres to those policies, and other safety and incident reports. Meta should also provide various public and regulatory communications involving minor safety and documents about staff members involved with the AI policies to determine "the decision trail for removing or revising any portions of the standard." Hawley is chair of the Senate Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which will carry out the investigation. WATCH: Robby Starbuck on Meta lawsuit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Opendoor shares popped about 10% on Friday after CEO Carrie Wheeler said she's resigning from the online real estate company, which has seen a surge in recent interest from retail investors. Pressure began building on Wheeler, who took over the top job in 2022, after the company's quarterly earnings report earlier this month failed to reassure investors that a turnaround is underway. The stock is up more than sixfold since bottoming out at 51 cents in June, a price that put the company at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq. "The last weeks of intense outside interest in Opendoor have come at a time when the company needs to stay focused and charging ahead," Wheeler wrote in a post on X. "I believe the best thing I can do for Opendoor now is to accelerate my succession plans that I shared with the Board mid-year and make room for new leadership to take the reins." Opendoor's business involves using technology to buy and sell homes, pocketing the gains. Hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, who spearheaded Opendoor's stock jump in July, celebrated the news and told his new band of followers on X, "Let's start THINKING BIG AGAIN." Jackson said last month on X that his firm had taken a stake in the company and was betting it would be a "100-bagger over the next few years." Jackson has been a loud voice on X pushing for Wheeler's departure, and was recently joined by Opendoor co-founder and venture capitalist Keith Rabois, who posted on Aug. 13 that "not a single founder nor executive" who guided the company to its IPO supports Wheeler as CEO. Opendoor on Friday named technology chief Shrisha Radhakrishna as "president and interim leader" and said a CEO search is underway. Opendoor went public through a special purpose acquisition company in 2020, riding a SPAC wave supported by low interest rates and Covid-era market euphoria. The soaring inflation and rising interest rates that followed hit all of technology stocks, but had an outsized impact on Opendoor due it its direct exposure to mortgage rates. With Friday's gains, its market cap stands at about $2.5 billion. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A government intervention in struggling chipmaker Intel is "essential" for the sake of national security, analyst Gil Luria said Friday, following a report that the Trump administration is weighing taking a stake in the company. "We're all capitalists," Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, said in an interview with CNBC's "Squawk Box." "We don't want government to intervene and own private enterprise, but this is national security." Bloomberg reported Thursday that the Trump administration is considering having the U.S. government take a stake in Intel. Shares are on track for the best week in more than 25 years. Intel previously declined to comment on the report. Luria said such a deal is needed to revive Intel and reduce the country's reliance on companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor to manufacture chips. President Donald Trump has called for more chips and high-end technology to be made in the U.S. How the White House could structure such an intervention is still in question. So we need to intervene," Luria said. "The government's going to come in and it's going to give Intel unfair advantages, and if it's going to do that, it wants a piece of the business." Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan met with Trump at the White House on Monday after the president called for his resignation based on allegations that he has ties to China. Luria pointed to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's comments that the rise of superintelligent AI could be "the next wave of nuclear proliferation," as evidence that direct intervention by the government is needed. "We can't rely on somebody else making shell casings for our nuclear arsenal," Luria said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Erin strengthened into a hurricane on Friday as it approached the northeast Caribbean, prompting forecasters to warn of possible flooding and landslides. The storm is expected to remain over open waters, although tropical storm watches were issued for Anguilla and Barbuda, St. Martin and St. Barts, Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Maarten. Up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) are expected, with isolated totals of up to 6 inches (15 centimeters), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. Forecasters also warned of dangerous swells. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 18 mph (30 kph). Hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry said Erin is forecast to eventually take a sharp turn northeast that would put it on a path between the U.S. and Bermuda. Erin, which is the Atlantic season's first hurricane, is forecast to become a major Category 3 storm late this weekend. Dangerous surf and rip currents are expected to affect the U.S. East Coast next week, with waves reaching up to 15 feet (5 meters) along parts of the North Carolina coast that could cause beach erosion, according to Accuweather. "Erin is forecast to explode into a powerful Category 4 hurricane as it moves across very warm waters in the open Atlantic. Water temperatures at the surface and hundreds of feet deep are several degrees higher than the historical average," said Alex DaSilva, Accuweather's lead hurricane expert. Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. This year's season is once again expected to be unusually busy. The forecast calls for six to 10 hurricanes, with three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kph). We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Property Play newsletter with Diana Olick. Property Play covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, from individuals to venture capitalists, private equity funds, family offices, institutional investors and large public companies. The days of landlords knocking on doors for monthly rent checks, or tenants going after landlords to fix a leaky toilet are slowly coming to an end. Technology has been stepping in to address the needs of tenants, landlords and large multifamily operators, and now artificial intelligence is turning that slow progress into a rental revolution. Work orders, lease renewals, tours and even investor due diligence are being taken over by software and AI. The integration of all that technology is a huge opportunity for startups and the venture capitalists backing them. One of the more mature categories for AI in the apartment space is virtual agents talking to prospective residents. This is where agentic AI comes in — meaning AI that can act autonomously and make its own decisions depending on what the consumer asks. For example, investors looking to purchase a large property have to go through all the leases and load those into a rent roll. "If you're buying a property that hasn't been professionally managed, where those aren't all loaded into some market-leading software product, somebody may have to manually go through all those leases and capture all the information. Well, AI is great for that, right?" said John Helm, founder and partner at RET Ventures, a fund focusing on AI in both real estate and rent tech. CNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox. Instead, according to Helm, you can feed leases into an AI model, and it will spit out a summary of all the data the investor needs. They can then load that directly into an underwriting model and value the property. RET Ventures said it doesn't rely on endowments or pension funds for its capital, but instead the consumers of the products of the companies they invest in — so-called strategic limited partners. AI can also help with property development and accounts payable. One of RET's portfolio companies is PredictAP. None of it needs to be manually coded by a human. Tyler Christiansen likens the multifamily industry to car dealerships. Every renter interaction was siloed to an individual property. As CEO of Funnel, which is backed by RET Ventures, his aim is to streamline the apartment marketing and leasing process, "enabling multifamily professionals to generate more profits, efficiency, and insight across their portfolios," according to the company website. He calls that "centralization" in the industry. "And then AI, what makes it unique within Funnel is that rather than automating interactions simply at a community level, we're really opening up automations across the portfolio," said Christiansen. One example would be if a tenant is not renewing a lease at one community because they are moving to a different market, Funnel's AI system would open up the possibility of cross-selling that person into another client community. Apartment operators and investors are in the experimental phase. It remains to be seen how much they will invest. The largest apartment REITs own roughly between 50,000 and 100,000 units each, with a few larger private operators, like Blackstone and Greystar. "I guess the challenge is going to be, probably in the next several years, really sifting through everything and understanding where there are real businesses that could grow into this. You're still seeing a lot of these tools just starting to get deployed," said Helm. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury yields rose on Friday after July's retail sales and consumer sentiment data provided two contrasting looks at the U.S. consumer. The 2-year Treasury yield added 2 basis points to 3.757%. The benchmark 10-year note yield rose 3 basis points to 4.324%. July's retail sales data, released on Friday morning, indicated that consumers are reacting well to tax changes and tariffs. Retail sales rose 0.5% last month, matching expectations from the Dow Jones consensus. Retail sales excluding automobiles gained 0.3%, also meeting estimates. However, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 58.6 in August from 61.7 last month due to worries over inflation. That report threw cold water on another inflation report that came out earlier in the week indicating some softening in consumer prices. The July consumer price index had eased concerns that tariffs may be causing prices to increase rapidly. Despite the higher inflation number, Fed funds futures were still pricing in about 85% odds of an interest rate cut in September, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool, slightly lower than during the previous session. The futures, however, did remove any chance of a half-point cut. Those inflation readings come ahead of the Fed's annual gathering of the world's central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week, sponsored by the Kansas City Fed, which will influence future monetary policy decisions. Until these rate cuts come, Jay Hatfield, CEO and CIO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, believes that the 10-year Treasury yield will continue to trade around its current range. "We think the bond markets can be stalled," he told CNBC. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russian media outlets were in high spirits on Friday as Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin headed to meet U.S. President Donald Trump for an Alaskan summit widely presented as a win for Moscow, its economy and global standing. Articles and commentary were splashed across Russian state news sites on Friday reveling in the global attention that Putin's historic trip to the U.S. was garnering, with positive takes on what the high-stakes talks — centered on ending the war in Ukraine — could mean for Russia, which has been isolated and economically punished by the West since invading Ukraine in 2022. "Russia-U.S. summit will be an attempt to reset relations," state news outlet TASS headlined, with accompanying stories echoing positive sentiment around the one-to-one talks: "The whole world is waiting for the meeting between Putin and Trump" and "Russia and the U.S. have potential to renew partnership in the Arctic," commentators stated, according to Google translations. The mood in Ukraine was positively dour, meanwhile, with news outlets reflecting fears that Kyiv could be sold out during the talks with Putin, a veteran statesman who is seen as likely to pursue as many concessions as he can from Trump in return for a ceasefire. State news outlet RIA Novosti reveled in the absence of Ukrainian and European officials from what it described as "historic" talks. Russia's media landscape is heavily controlled by the state, with little pushback against the Kremlin's messaging and policies. Commentary seen to denigrate or damage Russia's war effort can land authors in jail. In Ukraine, news outlets are decrying what they — and the Kyiv leadership — see as the rehabilitation of Putin. "From 'war criminal' to U.S. guest — Trump invites Putin out of isolation," the front page of the Kyiv Independent's online news site. The International Criminal Court in 2023 issued an arrest warrant for Putin over alleged war crimes, namely, the "unlawful deportation" of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia. Another Kyiv Independent story reflected low morale among Ukrainian troops, who fear Trump could capitulate to Putin by offering up Russian-occupied territory as part of a coveted ceasefire deal, after previously boasting he could end the war in Ukraine shortly into his second mandate. Securing this peace has proved far harder than Trump expected, however. He has so far refused to pull the trigger on further sanctions on Moscow, despite threatening to do so if the Kremlin did not agree to a ceasefire. The lede story on the Kyiv Post, headlined "Trump Holds ‘Enormous Leverage' Over Putin – Will He Use It?" reflected concerns that, while Trump holds some cards that could persuade Russia to enter a peace deal, he, ultimately, won't be prepared to act. Similarly to Russian counterparts, Ukrainian media outlets have championed the country's armed forces and war efforts. There is nonetheless greater media freedom in Ukraine — a prerequisite for Kyiv's aspirations to EU membership. The Trump-Putin talks are expected to kick off at 3.30 p.m. That presser will be one of the most closely watched events of this year, revealing the presidents' takes on the talks and what pledges (or lack thereof) might have been made in order to reach a ceasefire. But Ukraine and its European allies fear those "options" might be bad for Kyiv's territorial integrity, with Trump already mooting the idea of land "swapping" as part of a ceasefire, and wider European security.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates divested from U.S.-listed Chinese stocks in the second quarter, signaling a clear pullback from the market amid rising geopolitical strains and weakening investor confidence in China's economic prospects. According to its latest quarterly update to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission — known as 13F — on Wednesday, the fund closed out stakes in several Chinese companies, including major names like Baidu, Alibaba, JD.com, PDD Holdings, Nio, Trip.com Group, and Yum China. Other names include Qifu Technology and Ke Holdings. The hedge fund also reduced its stake in Apple, but increased its Microsoft and Nvidia holdings. Longtime China bull Ray Dalio, who founded Bridgewater Associates, had previously defended his investments in China. Last April, Dalio flagged Beijing's conflict with the U.S. and depressed prices among key challenges plaguing China's economy, but noted that the problems were "manageable by Chinese leaders if they do their jobs well." In April this year, the billionaire investor called for a rebalancing in U.S.-China relations, arguing that trade imbalances have hollowed out U.S. manufacturing. As of the start of August, Dalio sold his remaining stake in Bridgewater and stepped away from the board, but remains a mentor to the hedge fund's investment team. The developments come as the tariff truce between Washington and Beijing was extended by another 90 days on Monday. Without the pause, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were set to go up to 145%, while Chinese duties were set at 125%. The current levy on Chinese imports to the U.S. stands at 30%, while U.S. exports to China will incur a 10% tariff. Bridgewater did not respond to a request for comment.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is eyeing a stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, according to a Bloomberg report on Thursday. That consideration is primarily attributable to Intel's status as the only born-and-bred American company that can manufacture the fastest chips on U.S. soil. While some firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung, both of which can produce 3-nanometer chips — the most advanced semiconductors so far — have factories in the U.S., they are Taiwanese and South Korean companies, respectively, and probably do not enjoy apple pies on the Fourth of July. In combination with the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% share of their revenue from chip sales in China, as well as Apple committing to make more chips in America, the Trump administration seems to be consolidating a chip empire with the White House as its capital. To modify a song last heard by the Astronomer CEO before he was cast down to Earth: "I used to rule the world / Chips would rise when I gave the word." The Trump administration is reportedly considering a stake in Intel. Intel's shares soared 7.4% after Bloomberg reported the news. A series of data released Friday — retail sales, industrial output and fixed-asset investment — all underperformed economists' estimates. Warren Buffett's conglomerate bought more than 5 million shares in the health care firm for a stake worth about $1.6 billion at the end of June, according to a regulatory filing. The S&P 500's 0.03% gain, however, means it closed at another high on Thursday. Japan's Nikkei 225 added more than 1% on the country's economy expanding more than expected in the second quarter.

Ukraine talks could be a test of statecraft Russian President Vladimir Putin's standing in the West may be pretty low, but he's a skilled and seasoned statesman who shouldn't be underestimated, analysts say — and he's likely to be looking to outmaneuver his less experienced U.S. counterpart when the leaders meet in Alaska on Friday. "Let's be clear, Putin does not take Trump seriously," Tina Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight, told CNBC ahead of the talks.
