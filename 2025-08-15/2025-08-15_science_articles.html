                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wildfires, smog, pollen, pet dander, mold, and dust can all affect air quality. Here's how these appliances can help, plus info on what type is best for your home. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. On average year-round, Americans spending roughly 90 percent of their time indoors, which causes the concentration of some pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels. As we head into colder weather, when windows and doors are closed more often and air stagnates, now is a good time to start thinking about your home's air quality. Your first line of defense should be an air purifier. These appliances cycle air through  filters to remove allergens, harmful particles, and even bacteria. Many of today's models use a range of technology to achieve cleaner air, from UV lights to carbon and activated charcoal. In this guide, we'll dive into how air purifiers work, the different types of filters available, and how to find the right model based on in-depth research provided by expert sources and our own hands-on experience. Smog, pollen, pet dander, mold, cigarette smoke, and good old-fashioned dust all affect indoor quality, regardless of the season. In warmer months, allergens make their way into the house through open windows and your clothing, causing uncomfortable symptoms like itchy eyes or a scratchy throat. Running an air purifier continuously provides consistent protection against certain sensitivities and allergens. The growing impact of climate change is making air purifiers an essential household appliance, too. Rising global temperatures are contributing to more frequent and widespread wildfires, which can affect the air quality even if you're far from the source. Plus, increased pollen count and ozone levels only exacerbate the problem. These environmental conditions can make indoor air hazardous, and since these occurrences are unpredictable, having an air purifier turned on year-round is a proactive way to safeguard your health. But, these furnace and HVAC filters usually only work when the system is operating, and in order to get more filtration, it would have to run for longer periods of time. A dedicated air purifier that you can move from room to room could supplement your current air purification setup, and won't require as much electricity. It's important to note that no air purifier removes every single toxin or pollutant in your home. In order to maximize the efficiency of your air purifier or HVAC system, you'll need to take a close look at the filters. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) developed a testing method to determine the Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values, or MERVs, of different air filters. These values are based on the filter's ability to capture larger particles between 0.3 and 10 microns. It's measured in cubic feet per minute (cfm), and should equate to roughly two-thirds of the square footage of the room. This filterless option works by producing ions that attach to pollutants and fall to the floor or on top of surfaces, which can then be cleaned up. Based on findings by the EPA, they remove small particles but they are not effective at getting rid of pollen and other allergens. This option uses UV light to neutralize viruses, bacteria, and mold spores found in the air. These types of air purifiers are best used in offices or homes where germ control is the focus, but they aren't very effective at trapping allergens, dust, or pollutants. Choose an air purifier that's the right size for your space. Coverage differs from unit to unit, so it's vital that your air purifier is powerful enough to clean the volume of air in the space. If allergens are the main concern, find an air purifier with a HEPA filter. Some air purifiers might use a combination of filters to target irritants ranging in particle size, which might be helpful if you're dealing with different types of allergens, Depending on the type of air purifier you have, replacement filters can cost anywhere from $25 to $50 or more. Consider using an air purifier with washable or reusable filters to extend their lifespan. Like many other household appliances, air purifiers can be noisy. Most air purifiers average 55dB on the highest setting, which is louder than a typical refrigerator and can be disruptive. Some models might offer a "sleep mode,"  which lowers the fan speed and noise level overnight. Find a model that's energy efficient to save cash. Air purifiers with this emblem are Energy Star-certified and use significantly less electricity than their competitors, based on strict standards set by the EPA and DOE. These can make the air purification process more automated and easier to maintain. Amber is a Reviews Editor with bylines on Popular Mechanics, Runner's World, Bicycling, and Best Products sites.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But there's another accolade that they can affix to their already impressive biological resumé—they're the scourge of nuclear reactors. This fact was proven this past Sunday, when three of the six reactors at Gravelines power plant near Calais in northern France shut down unexpectedly because a swarm of jellyfish had entered the plant's cooling system, according to the government-owned utility operator Électricité de France, or EDF. By Monday morning, a fourth reactor also temporarily shut down. Sadly, the jellyfish themselves didn't fare as well. When it comes to nuclear energy, France punches way above its weight. In response to the 1973 Oil Crisis, the country decided to double down on nuclear energy, and France now has 57 reactors in operation. Reactors along the coastline (like Gravelines) often use seawater to cool themselves because it's particularly effective at removing waste heat. The EDF claims that filters prevent marine life from being sucked into these vents, but not from blocking the vents themselves. As The New York Times notes, jellyfish tend to “liquify” upon death, which can allow their bodies to bypass the filters and cause more problems downstream. The outlet also notes that in years past, similar jellyfish disruptions have impacted nuclear reactors around the world, including in Japan, Scotland, and Sweden. So, what's causing all of this recent jellyfish mayhem? Warmer ocean waters cause more favorable conditions for some jellyfish to spawn, and “dead zone” environments caused by the explosive growth of plankton (triggered by agricultural runoff) may impact some marine species, but not so much jellyfish. There, a lack of brain and blood becomes an evolutionary advantage. But the real answers lie in reducing carbon dioxide emissions and limiting agricultural runoff that create these warmer, low-oxygen waters in the first place. For more than 500 million years, jellyfish have served an important ecological function in the world's oceans.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sam Kean's New Book Dinner with King Tut Explores the Wild World of Experimental Archaeology In his new book, Sam Kean reveals how re-creating ancient tools, techniques and traditions can unlock secrets about how our ancestors lived—and what they felt. Experimental archaeology takes a hands-on approach to understanding the past. Instead of just studying ancient objects researchers re-create them. They build 30-foot medieval catapults, perform ancient surgeries with stone tools and prepare authentic Roman banquets using techniques so traditional, not even your nonna would recognize them. The goal is to understand not just what our ancestors made but how they made it—and what it felt like to live in their world. Our guest today is Sam Kean, a science writer who's written seven books. His latest is called Dinner with King Tut, and it explores the world of experimental archaeology. He's tried his hand at everything from ancient brain surgery to mummifying a fish, and he's here to tell us all about it.

Feltman: So what exactly is experimental archaeology, and how did you get interested in it? And I got into it because I'd always had a bit of a gripe with archaeology, traditional dirt archaeology, in that I think it's a fascinating field; you learn so much about humankind and these big, meaty questions about us—you know, who we are, where we came from—these really important questions about deep human history. So I really like that aspect of traditional archaeology. But every time I would go to an archaeological site, I found it so boring [laughs] to be there. It was just a bunch of sunburned people sitting around with brushes and dental picks, picking out little pot shards from the dirt. It just seemed like the most unimaginable tedium possible. But experimental archaeology got me excited because again, they were doing things, they were making things: re-creating lost recipes, making ancient stone tools—everything from that up to, you know, people making giant catapults and boats and sending those off on the ocean. So I felt like it was a lot more immersive and it was more involved and kind of immersed in the past than you get from traditional archaeology. Feltman: Hmm, and for people who aren't familiar with the idea of experimental archaeology, what are some of the projects from recent years that stand out in your mind as particularly exciting, that our listeners might wanna go learn more about? Kean: Well, for the book I got to attend an authentic Roman banquet [laughs], which was pretty cool. I got to try my hand at ancient surgery and tattooing. There's a lot of food stuff out there; that's probably the best entrée for people wanting to get involved, is just try to make some ancient recipes—you know, some heirloom grains, things like that. I made a fish mummy at one point for the book, and that was surprisingly easy to do, so you can mummify a fish or, you know, another small animal, something like that. Feltman: Yeah, well, and I think even some folks who, you know, have maybe come across some of these projects, like people making perfume that smells like a mummy, might be surprised at how hands-on you were able to get in the book. Kean: Yeah, so, like, the catapult I got to see was pretty amazing. And we spent a day out—he built this in Utah—we spent a day out there in the mountains, throwing these giant garden stones around at this wall that he had built that was 250 yards away, and it was pretty magical being out there and getting to see this thing fire—being able to fire it myself, actually. And it's startling to think about, but this is one of the most ancient surgeries ... And the stone tools worked really well at first. The problem with stone tools is that they wear down quickly ... But that was a good learning experience in and of itself, just to show you what something basic like medicine was like back then. Learning things like that, you know, you get frustrated, but it really stuck with me, and it made me appreciate just how difficult things were for our ancestors and made me appreciate the fact that they did all this work and we wouldn't be here if they hadn't. Feltman: Yeah, did those hands-on experiences change your perspective of the past in any other ways, beyond just appreciating how difficult things were? Kean: It made me appreciate how good some of the technology was. We think about electronic gizmos as technology; they're sort of synonymous, almost, in our minds. And I think we've lost some of that nowadays. So it did open my mind up and helped me appreciate the really nice technologies that people had in the past. Feltman: And you mentioned in the book that experimental archaeology is sometimes dismissed as kind of, like, a showy form of theater more than a science. Kean: There are some cases where we just don't have information about how people did things. We just don't know how they did things, especially with the pyramids [laughs]; we have no idea how they did that, which is kind of embarrassing for archaeologists, that they don't know this, but we just don't have any information. And I think by doing certain things, even something basic like making bread or beer or something like that, you start to ask more questions and different questions, and it teaches you aspects of the process that you would not have thought to ask about otherwise. And there were some cases in the book as well where—there was one instance with a chef and one instance with a, a hairdresser who got interested in Roman archaeology, and they read these papers by classicists, by historians, by archaeologists, and they, even within a few paragraphs, realized that [the authors] had no idea what they were talking about [laughs]: they didn't know how to cook properly; they didn't know how to style hair properly. These people who didn't have the expertise were just theorizing without any real evidence or basis ... So it can help you avoid going down wrong paths, and in some cases it can answer questions or evoke questions that we just wouldn't ask otherwise. Feltman: Yeah, very cool, and I mean, I'm sure this really runs the gamut, but in your experience who are the people who are creating these experiments? You know, how are they getting interested in these questions? Kean: Yeah, it really does run the gamut. And in some cases, I think, they wanted to connect with their area of study a little bit more. And again, it's such a sensory-rich field—you feel more immersed in the past when you do these kind of things—so it helped them have a deeper connection with their field. Then there are amateurs, people who just got obsessed [laughs] with some topic—and amateurs in the best sense of the word, in that they just loved the topic and wanted to learn all they could about it. So they are a part of the field as well. And then another really important aspect is there's a lot of native and Indigenous communities who have either kept traditions alive or they're trying to revive traditions that got stamped out by colonialism, missionaries, whatever the case was. And in a lot of cases they're the ones going to the archaeologists and teaching them how things were based on either things they have kept alive or lore they might know. So it was fun to meet all of 'em. Like, I don't know, for example, have you picked up some Roman culinary techniques [laughs] or anything of that nature? Kean: One thing it did do: I sort of view the world itself a little differently in that ... Kean: Before I would walk down the street where I live in D.C., and there were a lot of trees in this neighborhood, but before to me it was just sort of this green canopy overhead; it was almost like decoration. This is this type of tree.” And I also look at the trees differently because I can see them as, you know, a resource: the wood that they have—the acorns that they have are a food source. So I look at things like that differently, and—even, like, rocks on the ground, I can look at those and say, “Oh, that'd be a good hammerstone for making tools,” or “That's a good type of rock to make a tool with.” Kean: I did get to do, in Micronesia, a little bit with navigation there. I would really love, at some point, to get way out into Polynesia, maybe, even and be on an authentic ship like they used thousands of years ago and just sort of set sail and, you know, head out for an island you can't see over the horizon and just navigate with all of the amazing tricks they knew about, you know, the stars but also looking at wave patterns, wind patterns, migration patterns of birds. So at some point I'd love to take a long ocean trip on one of those authentic ships. Well, thank you so much for coming on to talk about the book. I'm sure our listeners will love it, so this has been great. Don't forget to check out Dinner with King Tut for more on the wild world of experimental archaeology.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Visible in the mosaic, which was stitched together from 96 images taken at a location the science team calls "Falbreen," are a rock that appears to lie on top of a sand ripple, a boundary line between two geologic units, and hills as distant as 40 miles (65 kilometers) away. "Our bold push for human space exploration will send astronauts back to the Moon," said Sean Duffy, acting NASA administrator. "Stunning vistas like that of Falbreen, captured by our Perseverance rover, are just a glimpse of what we'll soon witness with our own eyes. NASA's groundbreaking missions, starting with Artemis, will propel our unstoppable journey to take human space exploration to the Martian surface. "The relatively dust-free skies provide a clear view of the surrounding terrain," said Jim Bell, Mastcam-Z's principal investigator at Arizona State University in Tempe. Geologists call this type of rock a "float rock" because it was more than likely formed someplace else and transported to its current location. Whether this one arrived by a landslide, water, or wind is unknown, but the science team suspects it got here before the sand ripple formed. This is the 43rd rock Perseverance has abraded since it landed on Mars. The rover made this abrasion on May 22 and performed proximity science (a detailed analysis of Martian rocks and soil) with its arm-mounted instruments two days later. The science team wanted to learn about Falbreen because it's situated within what may be some of the oldest terrain Perseverance has ever explored -- perhaps even older than Jezero Crater. About 300 feet (90 meters) away, they veer to the left, disappearing from sight at a previous geologic stop the science team calls "Kenmore." This is the boundary line, or contact, between two geologic units. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed for the agency by Caltech, built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover on behalf of NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, as part of NASA's Mars Exploration Program portfolio.

The effectiveness of an LNP is determined by its lipid components and their ratios; however, experimental optimization is laborious and does not explore the full design space. Computational approaches such as deep learning can be greatly beneficial, but the composite nature of LNPs limits the effectiveness of existing single molecule-based algorithms to LNPs. Addressing this, our approach integrates the multi-component and multimodal features of composite formulations such as LNPs to predict their performance in an end-to-end manner. Here we generate one of the largest LNP datasets (LANCE) by varying LNP formulations to train our deep learning model, COMET. This transformer-based neural network not only accurately predicts the efficacy of LNPs but is adaptable to non-canonical LNP formulations such as those with two ionizable lipids and polymeric materials. Furthermore, COMET can predict LNP performance in a cell line outside of LANCE and predict LNP stability during lyophilization using only small training datasets. Experimental validation showed that our approach can identify LNPs that exhibit strong protein expression in vitro and in vivo, promising accelerated development of nucleic acid therapies with extensive potential across therapeutic and manufacturing applications. For clinical1, logistical2 and translational3 success, most drug substances are formulated into drug products with multiple ingredients. Our analysis shows that, on average, eight excipients are present in commercial products4. Given choices of ingredients and their ratios, formulation design presents a vast search space. While high-throughput approaches exist5,6,7,8, they become intractable with increasing formulation complexity. Deep learning, a branch of machine learning suited for multifactorial data, can help address this challenge. Although widely used in drug discovery and materials science9,10,11, its application to multi-component drug products is limited. We apply deep learning to RNA-based lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), a promising class of drug products12,13,14, underscored by the success of SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccines15,16,17,18. LNPs comprise four lipid classes, each crucial for cytosolic RNA delivery12,14,19. Their function depends on lipid structures and ratios20,21,22, with composition requiring re-optimization per application1,23. Given these challenges, early efforts applying machine learning to drug delivery have emerged, including recent work from our group24 and others25. As lipid chemical structure has a major impact on transfection, a line of modelling approaches focus primarily on individual molecules25,26. These approaches have been remarkably successful in identifying new lipids and chemical substructures, which would otherwise not be expected to produce high transfection efficacy26. Some models rely on manually selected features such as physicochemical properties26,27,28,29. These face limitations: restricted LNP scope, underuse of raw data, synthetic feasibility constraints and lack of formulation composition insights. To unlock deep learning's full utility for LNP design, a model must represent complete formulations and generalize across predictive scenarios. We introduce the Composite Material Transformer (COMET), which encodes molecular structures, molar percentages and synthesis parameters in a transformer-based architecture. COMET is trained on the Lipid–RNA Nanoparticle Composition and Efficacy (LANCE) dataset of over 3,000 LNPs, including those with dual-ionizable lipids. COMET accurately predicted excluded samples and, via in silico screening of 50 million virtual LNPs, identified top candidates with high in vitro and in vivo expression. Unlike lipid-focused models, COMET showed versatility with polymeric materials, predicting efficacy from limited data. Using two smaller datasets (~10% of LANCE)—one in a gastrointestinal cell line, another post-lyophilization—we demonstrate COMET's robust adaptability. With its flexibility and broad utility, COMET promises to accelerate complex drug product development. Composite materials such as LNPs comprise multiple components defined by the identity of constituent compounds, their relative ratios and formulation parameters such as nitrogen-to-phosphate (N/P) and mixing ratio (Fig. Previous studies often focused on a single component (for example, ionizable lipid)25; by contrast, we developed COMET to holistically represent LNPs and predict their efficacy via a flexible neural architecture (Fig. Lipid structures are encoded into molecular embeddings, while molar percentages are transformed into composition embeddings. These are concatenated to represent each lipid. Formulation-wide features, such as N/P and phase mixing ratios, are also embedded and fed into the model (Methods). a, LNPs are synthesized by mixing nucleic acid (for example, mRNA) with a lipid solution typically composed of four lipid classes. Key properties, such as efficacy, depend not only on the lipids' structure but also on their relative ratios and other mixing parameters (for example, N/P and aqueous/organic ratio). b, COMET can predict properties of composite materials such as LNPs from their components, compositions and other parameters. c, With high-throughput screening, COMET's training data are made up of four parts, each spanning a complementary LNP formulation space. d, Thirteen lipid molar ratios used in the majority of the LNP training dataset. COMET adopts a transformer design similar to language models such as ChatGPT30,31, where chemical components and formulation features act as discrete tokens. It accommodates arbitrary numbers of components, including dual-ionizable lipid formulations. An LNP-level Classify ([CLS]) token attends to component and formulation vectors via self-attention32, with the final prediction made through a task-specific prediction head. For multitask learning, distinct CLS tokens and heads are used per task to capture differences across cell types while sharing model knowledge. To train COMET, we use a pairwise ranking objective that learns to rank LNPs by efficacy (Methods). Noise augmentation improves robustness against experimental noise, and a label margin captures efficacy differences. In multitask settings, CAGrad helps align gradients across tasks33. We further enhance performance with an ensemble of COMET models, especially beneficial in low-data regimes34,35. To train COMET, we developed a high-throughput pipeline to generate the LANCE dataset. Each LNP in this dataset encapsulated a firefly luciferase (FLuc) messenger RNA (mRNA), and transfection efficacy was quantified by bioluminescence readouts. The LNPs were synthesized using automated fluid handling and tested in vitro. The LANCE dataset spans a wide design space structured in four parts: lipid identities (parts 1 and 2), synthesis parameters such as N/P and aqueous/organic mixing ratio (part 3), and lipid molar percentages (part 4) (Fig. Thirteen distinct molar ratios were used (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 13), generating over 6,000 labelled data points, including 3,028 LNPs evaluated in mouse DC2.4 and B16-F10 cells. Full methodological details are in Methods. Helper lipids (for example, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE)), sterols (cholesterol/beta-sitosterol) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids (C14-PEG) also had substantial effects on efficacy. Hence, the LANCE dataset successfully captured these previous observations12,20,36,37. Molar ratios had notable but formulation-specific effects on efficacy; no single ratio consistently outperformed across all lipid combinations. This highlights the need for context-specific optimization. Altering aqueous/organic phase ratios from 3:1 to 1:1 affected efficacy in helper-lipid-rich LNPs (Fig. 2b), although the effect diminished at lower helper lipid content (Fig. 2c) and was negligible for 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-based formulations. The N/P ratio, by contrast, showed no clear efficacy association (Fig. We further evaluated five-component formulations by adding a second ionizable lipid (3:2 ratio) alongside DOPE, cholesterol and C14-PEG. Potent ionizable lipids such as CKK-E12 and C12-200 enhanced weak lipids such as L319 or DLin-MC3-DMA (Fig. Notably, CKK-E12/L319 combinations outperformed both CKK-E12-only and dual-strong-lipid pairings, particularly at 25% total ionizable lipid content. a, Effect of lipid choice and ratio on LNP transfection efficacy in DC2.4 cells. b,c, Effect of aqueous/organic volumetric ratio on the transfection efficacy of LNPs containing high percentage of helper lipid (b) and low percentage of helper lipid (c) in DC2.4 cells. d, Effect of ionizable lipid/mRNA weight ratios on transfection efficacy in DC2.4 cells. e, Effect of using two ionizable lipids on transfection efficacy in DC2.4 cells. f, Comparison of formulation performance in DC2.4 and B16-F10 cells. Statistics in b–d were determined using unpaired two-tailed t-test. Cross-cell line comparison of DC2.4 and B16-F10 results revealed 772 formulations that were in the top 30th percentile in both (Fig. Formulations with selective activity were also identified: SM102 appeared frequently in DC2.4-high but B16-F10-low cases, while DC-cholesterol was enriched in the opposite group. In summary, transfection efficacy is governed not only by lipid identities but also by molar ratios and synthesis conditions—motivating the need for models such as COMET that can integrate and learn from multifactorial design spaces. We evaluated COMET on a random 20% test split of LNPs, with 10% used for validation and the remaining 70% for training. When trained to predict DC2.4 efficacy, COMET accurately ranked the test samples, achieving a Spearman coefficient of 0.873 and a Pearson coefficient of 0.866 (Fig. To simulate a more realistic drug discovery scenario, we curated a ‘hits-test' split where the top 10% of DC2.4 LNPs were withheld as ‘hits', alongside a random 10% of ‘non-hits'. COMET retained strong predictive power, yielding a Spearman coefficient of 0.725 and a Pearson coefficient of 0.820 (Fig. Its ability to classify ‘hits' into the top half of ranked predictions reached 79.6% accuracy. a, Performance of COMET on different DC2.4 test data splits after training on DC2.4 LNP efficacy data. b,c, Ablation results showing how different modules contribute to COMET's ranking performance (b) and accuracy (c) on DC2.4 ‘hits-test' test set. d, Schematic of in silico hit selection that begins with a large virtual LNP library, in silico screening with COMET and filtering based on LNPs' properties such as efficacy and diversity. g–i, Lead optimization around three top-performing LANCE LNPs in DC2.4 cells, namely LA-388 (g), LA-580 (h) and LA-2791 (i), was performed with COMET, each of which yielded three new formulations (denoted with the prefix DO) and evaluated experimentally. j–l, Lead optimization around three top-performing LNPs in B16-F10, namely LA-4 (j), LA-2638 (k) and LA-3062 (l), was performed with COMET, each of which yielded three new formulations (denoted with the prefix BO) and evaluated experimentally. Twenty replicates of training run with different random seeds were used for evaluation in a–c. Four technical replicates were used for e–l. Statistical significances in e–l were determined using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Tukey test. MT, multitask; RO, regression objective; PO, pairwise ranking objective; CG, CAGrad; NA, noise augmentation; LM, label margin. In a multitask learning set-up using both DC2.4 and B16-F10 labels, COMET's performance improved on the DC2.4 test set, achieving a Spearman of 0.762 and a Pearson of 0.860 (pairwise ranking objective + multitask) model; Supplementary Fig. 2), highlighting the benefit of shared representation learning across related tasks38. We performed ablation studies to understand the contribution of each modelling component. Replacing the pairwise ranking objective with a regression objective slightly reduced performance (Fig. Model enhancements—ensemble learning, noise augmentation, label margin and CAGrad regularization—each contributed to performance gains, with ensembling having the greatest effect (Fig. Gains from ensembling plateaued beyond five models (Supplementary Fig. 3), and so we used an ensemble of five COMETs for all in silico screening. To probe whether COMET learns meaningful structure–activity relationships, we performed adversarial perturbations. When lipid identities in training samples were partially shuffled, model performance degraded monotonically (Supplementary Fig. More aggressive shuffling across lipid classes led to a further drop, and corrupting additional formulation parameters (for example, N/P ratio, molar % and phase ratios) impaired performance even more (Supplementary Fig. COMET's generalizability was tested by excluding LNPs containing selected ionizable lipids (MC3, SM-102 and CKK-E12) and a sterol (beta-sitosterol) from training. The model maintained good performance on this chemically distinct test set, with Pearson/Spearman correlations of 0.779/0.776 for DC2.4 and 0.502/0.509 for B16-F10 efficacy prediction (Supplementary Fig. Lastly, we compared COMET against simpler baselines. Both random forest and COMET outperformed k-nearest neighbours, with COMET's single-model performance comparable to random forest (Supplementary Fig. An ensemble of COMETs offered improved correlation metrics for both cell lines, although top 50% classification accuracy remained similar to that of random forest. To determine whether COMET learns transfection efficacy rather than proxying classic LNP properties, we analysed correlations between COMET predictions and nanoparticle characteristics such as encapsulation efficiency, size, polydispersity and zeta potential. COMET's predictions were only weakly correlated with these properties—except for particle size (correlation 0.6530)—but were highly correlated with actual transfection data (>0.95; Supplementary Figs. This confirms that COMET predicts efficacy itself, not just physical proxies. To evaluate COMET's ability to discover effective formulations beyond LANCE, we screened a virtual library of nearly 50 million LNPs and validated selected in silico ‘hits' experimentally (Fig. Exploratory hits were chosen by excluding LNPs similar to top-performing LANCE formulations and then selecting chemically diverse candidates predicted by COMET to be highly efficacious (Methods, Fig. All exploratory hits outperformed clinically approved LNPs39 (SM-102 (ref. The top DC2.4 exploratory hit matched two of three top LANCE hits (Supplementary Fig. 11), while the best B16-F10 exploratory hit exceeded all three LANCE hits tested (Supplementary Fig. We next evaluated COMET's ability to refine existing leads. Around selected LANCE hits, virtual candidates were generated by modifying lipid ratios, substituting components or changing N/P ratios (Methods and Fig. In DC2.4, COMET identified optimized formulations outperforming their parent in two of three cases (Fig. 3g–i); in B16-F10, all three optimized LNPs outperformed their respective parents (Fig. To assess COMET's adaptability beyond lipids, we extended it to branched poly(beta-amino esters) (PBAEs)3,41 (Fig. A dataset of 454 polymer–LNPs (13 unique PBAEs) was added to LANCE. Each PBAE was represented by its diacrylate–amine unit and branching agent (Methods and Fig. In the ‘hits-test' setting, COMET achieved Spearman coefficients of 0.767 (DC2.4) and 0.756 (B16-F10) (Fig. Notably, PBAE LNPs represented only 13% of the training data. b, Incorporation of PBAE along with LNP features in COMET's inference. c,d, Evaluation of COMET's performance on PBAE LANCE test set and its subset containing only PBAE LNPs, in predicting DC2.4 efficacy (c) and B16-F10 efficacy (d). e, Effect of PBAE LNP training data size on predictive performance, averaged over both cell lines. f–i, In vitro validation of lead optimization in silico PBAE LNP candidates compared with the original LANCE PBAE hit and baseline LNPs for DC2.4 (f,g) and B16-F10 (h,i) cells. j,k, Evaluation of COMET's performance on predicting LNPs' efficacy in Caco-2, with Spearman (j) and Pearson (k) correlation. l,m, Evaluation of COMET's performance on predicting LNPs' efficacy in delivering IL-15 mRNA payload to HepG2, when evaluated as ensembles of five models, with Spearman (l) and Pearson (m) correlation. n,o, Evaluation of COMET's performance on predicting degradation of LNPs' efficacy after lyophilization, with Spearman (n) and Pearson (o) correlation.

Statistical significances in j, k, n and o were determined using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett test. Statistics in l and m were determined using unpaired two-tailed t-test. Panels a and b created with BioRender.com. Even when trained on just 17 PBAE LNPs plus LANCE data, COMET achieved a mean Spearman of 0.660 across both cell types, improving to 0.824 with the full 352-sample PBAE set (Fig. We selected top-performing PBAE LNPs for further optimization using COMET (Methods). Optimized candidates showed higher efficacy than their parent formulations in both DC2.4 cases (Fig. 4f,g) and in one B16-F10 case (Fig. To evaluate its capability to adapt to a new cell type, COMET was tested on a dataset of 295 LNPs screened in human Caco-2 cells. Activity poorly correlated with mouse cells (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicating a need for learning-based formulation strategies to quickly identify new formulations that are optimal for new settings. COMET trained on Caco-2 data achieved a Spearman coefficient of 0.639, which improved to 0.713 with LANCE multitask training, and to 0.794 (Pearson 0.806) using a five-model ensemble (Fig. We further tested COMET on HepG2 cells transfected with interleukin (IL)-15 mRNA using 98 LNPs. With multitask ensemble training, we observed strong predictions (Pearson 0.709 and Spearman 0.775; Fig. Additional LANCE data did not improve single-model accuracy (Supplementary Fig. 4l,m), likely owing to increased diversity among the COMET models when trained with additional LANCE data. To address the instability of LNPs at ambient temperatures, we trained COMET to predict efficacy loss post-lyophilization (Methods). We synthesized 168 LNPs with variable lipids and 20% (w/v) sucrose as the stabilizer. 17a) revealed that top performers included CKK-E12 and C12-200 as ionizable lipids, and DOPE as the helper lipid. Interestingly, these were not always top performers pre-lyophilization. With LANCE multitask data, this increased to 0.705, and to 0.788 with five-model ensembles (Fig. We selected one hit from each virtual LNP group (‘Experimental validation of COMET in silico hits' section) for in vivo validation in mice. 5a,b), with faster transfection kinetics (Fig. Top-performing COMET hits (DE-4, DO-388-1 and BE-1) also had higher encapsulation efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 19a) and lower cytotoxicity than SM-102 (Supplementary Fig. a, Bioluminescence image of clinical formulations and 4 COMET in silico hits 6 h after subcutaneous administration of 3 μg FLuc mRNA. c,d, Bioluminescence quantification of in silico hits that were optimized for efficacy in DC2.4 (c) and B16-F10 (d) and the SM-102 clinical baseline LNP at the same three timepoints. Four biological replicates were used for MC3 formulation, while seven to eight biological replicates were used to evaluate the other formulations in b. Statistical significances in b were determined using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett test. In 1:1 in vivo comparisons with LANCE top hits, COMET-optimized LNPs matched DC2.4 benchmarks (Supplementary Fig. 18a,b), but underperformed slightly in B16-F10 (not significant), possibly owing to poor correlation between in vitro B16-F10 data and subcutaneous in vivo response (Supplementary Fig. We used t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) to visualize how COMET encodes LNP compositional features to predict efficacy. 6a,b (for virtual LNPs) and Supplementary Fig. Although ionizable lipid choices vary within each group, the DC2.4-specific cluster has a higher prevalence of SM-102 (Fig. 6c), and the B16-F10-specific cluster contains more LNPs with DC-cholesterol (Fig. The green cluster is enriched in high N/P ratio (25–30) formulations (Fig. Some of these patterns were observed in the LANCE data (Fig. 2), but others emerged only through COMET's predictions. a–g, t-SNE visualization of COMET representations of 10K virtual LNPs, each sample coloured by its predicted efficacy or feature value, that is, predicted DC2.4 (a) and B16-F10 (b) efficacy, ionizable lipid choice (c), cholesterol choice (d), N/P ratio (e), ionizable lipid molar percentage (f) and cholesterol molar percentage (g). h, COMET's feature importance of LNP's lipid molecule choice, N/P ratio and molar composition in the prediction of DC2.4 efficacy. i,j, Feature importance, broken down into lipid component types, for the choice of molecule (i) and molar percentage (j). k, COMET's feature importance of LNP's lipid molecule choice, N/P ratio and molar composition in the prediction of DC2.4 efficacy. l,m, Feature importance, broken down into lipid component types, for the choice of molecule (l) and molar percentage (m). In general, DOPE and C14-PEG are dominant among highly scored LNPs, suggesting that they are more optimal than DSPC and C18-PEG. Beta-sitosterol is overrepresented in high-scoring LNPs (Fig. Two composition trends stood out: ionizable lipid % above 50% (Fig. Additional LNP feature visualizations are shown in Supplementary Fig. Using integrated gradients45, we identified features most influential to COMET's predictions (Methods). For DC2.4, lipid identity was the most important factor, followed by N/P ratio and molar percentages (Fig. 6i), indicating that switching from C18-PEG to C14-PEG improves efficacy predictions. Ionizable lipid choice was the next most critical, consistent with previous work12,46,47,48. For molar composition, ionizable and helper lipid percentages were most impactful (Fig. We also analysed interactions between PBAE (Supplementary Section A.1) and synergistic ionizable lipid combinations (Supplementary Section A.2) with other formulation features. These interactions revealed that optimal material choices and molar percentages depend not only on the target cell type but also on the broader compositional context of the formulation. The design of COMET is motivated by the importance of not only the molecular structure of individual ingredients (for example, lipids) in drug products but also the interactions among compounds and their relative ratios. Its transformer-based architecture integrates multimodal features—including molecular structures, molar percentages and synthesis parameters—into a unified artificial intelligence framework. This enables COMET to learn LNP formulation features in a data-driven manner, without relying on manually selected physicochemical descriptors27,28. COMET accurately predicts LNP efficacy after training on LANCE, one of the largest LNP datasets so far49,50,51,52, and can distinguish top formulations from less efficacious ones. While COMET consistently outperforms k-nearest neighbours, its advantage over random forest depends on dataset size and complexity. As larger, more diverse datasets emerge—especially with broader lipid chemistries—COMET's deep learning architecture will likely offer increasing benefits. High-throughput methods are poised to accelerate this growth. COMET's flexible input format enables exploration of non-canonical formulations, such as dual-ionizable lipid LNPs or polymer–lipid hybrids (for example, branched PBAEs). It can screen massive virtual libraries to find formulations that differ substantially from known hits yet yield high performance—such as the L319-based BE-1 LNP. As LNP designs grow in complexity, COMET makes discovery more tractable. In lead optimization, COMET identified stronger formulations in two out of three cases. This highlights that while COMET distinguishes top from mediocre LNPs well (‘Performance of COMET' section), optimizing within a high-performing region requires even greater discriminative power. Adding more data from high-performing LNPs—especially through active learning—could improve this. Since COMET is trained on in vitro data, and in vitro–in vivo correlation is known to be weak for LNPs22,49, not all predicted hits will succeed in vivo. Future integration with in vivo screening data5,8 may improve performance. Beyond efficacy, COMET also predicts formulation stability post-lyophilization, despite limited data. This accuracy improves with multitask training using LANCE. Similar gains were observed in adapting COMET to new cell types (for example, Caco-2), underscoring the broad applicability of our approach. This is especially useful in contexts where assays are low throughput and datasets are small. The flexibility of COMET to handle multi-component inputs also allows for its extension beyond conventional LNPs. We demonstrated the model's adaptability to formulations with non-lipid materials (for example, branched PBAEs) and its utility across multiple cell types. COMET's architecture may also support links to other areas of nanotechnology where multi-component formulations are critical, such as co-delivery of multiple cargos, immunomodulatory nanoparticle design or materials for tissue engineering. In such contexts, COMET's compositional encoding and multitask learning structure could be adapted to jointly predict multiple endpoints, including efficacy, toxicity or stability. Coupled with advances in high-throughput science, we hope that COMET will become an essential tool for formulation development and discovery of knowledge in this field. This section describes the model architecture and training algorithms of COMET. Pseudocode for inference is provided in Algorithm S1. Lipid molecular structures are encoded into high-dimensional vectors (molecular embeddings), while scalar compositional features are encoded using a Gaussian-based encoder53. Continuous formulation-wide parameters (for example, N/P ratio and volumetric mix ratio) are encoded with Gaussian layers; categorical inputs use one-hot embeddings. The transformer uses a [CLS] token to aggregate input features across multiple attention layers. For multitask learning, each cell type is assigned a separate [CLS] token and prediction head, enabling task-specific outputs while sharing LNP-level representation learning. COMET is compatible with various molecular encoders; here we use Uni-Mol11, pretrained to recover masked atom types and corrupted three-dimensional coordinates. It offers strong property prediction performance and is used with default hyperparameters (from https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol/tree/main/unimol). Pretrained weights are frozen during COMET training. Each compound is encoded into a 512-dimensional vector using atom types and coordinates. Lipid molar percentages are encoded into 128-dimensional vectors using a shared Gaussian layer. Each component is further assigned a 128-dimensional one-hot embedding (\({z}_{k}^{{\rm{type}}}\)) to distinguish lipid classes. These are concatenated and projected through a two-layer MLP into a 256-dimensional component representation. N/P ratio is encoded using a separate 256-dimensional Gaussian layer (zN/P). Aqueous/organic ratios, treated as categorical variables, are one-hot encoded (zphase) with 256 dimensions. Each cell type uses a learned [CLS] token (zCLS) of dimension 256. These aggregate component and formulation-wide token representations across Nblock transformer layers via attention54. Final predictions are made by passing the [CLS] token through a two-layer MLP (MLPpredict). Each block follows a Pre-LayerNorm structure55 composed of layernorm → self-attention → MLP with residual connections. The model is trained with a binary ranking objective56 where, given a pair of LNP samples, the model learns to predict a larger efficacy score for the LNP that has a higher efficacy label value from the other LNP: Conflict-averse gradient descent (CAGrad)33 mitigates conflicting gradients in multitask settings. We apply CAGrad with a coefficient of 0.2 to stabilize training across tasks. To address noise in the experimental data, especially in the fluid handling process, we augment the molar percentage with Gaussian noise proportionate to its value where the standard deviation of the noise is 10% of actual molar percentage. From the label values, we can tell not only which LNP is better than another but also by how much. To train the model to learn this additional knowledge, we include a margin term57 in the binary ranking objective: where yh and yl are the (efficacy) label values of the more efficacious and less efficacious LNP, respectively, and λmargin controls how much this objective dominates the training. We use λmargin = 0.01 in our experiments. 3e–l), the ensemble is formed by Nmodel models trained with the same hyperparameters and dataset (train/valid/test split) but weights initialized with different random seeds. For the ensemble deployed to infer virtual LNPs, 5 different train (80%)/valid (20%) splits are made in a fivefold manner and each model in the ensemble is trained on a different fold. To ensure that ensembled scores are not biased towards models with high variance, the predicted scores from each model are normalized by making their scores for the LANCE LNPs fit a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 before ensembling. More specifically, for each model, this is done by inferring the predicted scores on all the LANCE LNPs and using the mean (meani) and standard deviation (stdi) of LANCE LNPs' scores to compute the normalized scores \({y}_{i}^{{\prime} \mathrm{normalized}}\) through COMET is implemented in PyTorch and trained with NVIDIA V100 GPUs. The k-nearest neighbours and random forest models are implemented with the scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/) package, with default hyperparameters. More specifically, the k-nearest neighbours model uses n = 5 nearest neighbours while the random forest model uses n = 100 estimators (trees). LANCE comprises four parts spanning orthogonal LNP design dimensions: lipid component identities, molar percentages, synthesis parameters (for example, N/P and aqueous/organic volumetric ratios) and high-resolution molar sweeps. Seven ionizable lipids, three sterols, two helper lipids and two PEG lipids were used (Supplementary Table 14), reflecting the focus of current research12,42. To study molar % effects, we designed 13 lipid ratios by varying one lipid class at a time from a reference BASE ratio (Fig. For instance, ratios I1–I4 modify ionizable lipid %, C1–C3 adjust cholesterol (compensated by helper lipid), and P1–P3 alter PEG lipid %, while the remaining modify multiple components (Supplementary Table 13). Paired with 13 molar ratios, this results in 1,092 possible LNPs; 1,066 were tested. Following studies suggesting synergy from dual-ionizable lipid formulations58, we created LNPs with 60:40 molar splits across all ionizable lipid pairs, distributed across 13 lipid ratios. These parameters were later converted to N/P ratios for model input. To study finer-grained molar % effects, we created 24 evenly spaced intervals from 10% to 80% for ionizable lipid, cholesterol and helper lipid, generating 492 LNPs across 3 focused sweeps. Single-ionizable LNPs span 18 unique N/P ratios, derived from 3 ionizable lipid/RNA weight ratios and 7 ionizable lipids. Dual-ionizable formulations add 63 more, totalling 81 N/P ratios. In molar terms, 13 base lipid ratios and 72 sweep ratios (24 per lipid class) result in 85 total molar compositions. LNPs were synthesized by mixing lipid–ethanol and mRNA–citrate buffer phases, incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Automated handling was performed on the Tecan Fluent platform. For animal studies, LNPs were mixed, incubated on ice for 10 min and dialysed overnight at 4 °C in PBS (Slide-A-Lyzer, ThermoFisher). FLuc mRNA (L-7202, Trilink); lipids (Cayman Chemicals, Avanti); luciferase assay (Steady-Glo, E2550) and Agilent BioTek plate reader for readout. alamarBlue was used for viability assays. Each 96-well plate included a ‘standard' LNP. Raw luminescence values were normalized to the standard and averaged across four replicates (two biological, two technical). Mean values were log-transformed and min–max normalized to [0, 1]. We have represented several key features of the LANCE dataset in Fig. Below, we explain how these key features were extracted from LANCE. 2b,c, part 3 formulations containing one ionizable lipid, cholesterol and C14-PEG were selected. Two molar ratios of the lipid components (which are shown in the figure) were studied. The ionizable lipid to mRNA molar ratio was 10,162. The aqueous to organic volume ratio was varied. 2d, part 3 formulations containing one ionizable lipid, DOPE, cholesterol and C14-PEG were selected. Two molar ratios of the lipid components (which are shown in the figure) were studied. The organic to aqueous volume ratio was held at 1:3. Figure 2e was generated from part 2 data. Only formulations containing DOPE, cholesterol and C14-PEG were used for the graph. The molar ratio of ionizable lipid/mRNA was 10,162. The entire library was used to construct Fig. We calculated the normalized transfection efficacy for the 30th and 70th percentile formulations in B16-F10 and DC2.4 cells. Formulations above and below these values in the respective cell lines were selected and are plotted in Fig. A summary of the prefixes used here is given in Supplementary Table 16. The recipes for the 3 clinical LNP baselines are based on the literature39 and synthesized in an aqueous/organic volumetric of 3:1 following what is typically used in previous work. To find strong and reliable LNP baselines from LANCE, we randomly select 10 LNP formulations from the 90th percentile for each cell line to again screen them with the respective cell line to check for reproducibility. Among these ten formulations, three LNPs with their normalized efficacy value closest to their original LANCE efficacy label values were selected as LANCE baseline LNPs. To span a vast formulation space, the virtual library was generated by enumerating through possible LNP features such as lipid choices, their molar percentages and key synthesis parameters such as N/P ratios and aqueous/organic volumetric ratios, according to Supplementary Table 15. To find LNPs that are different from the hits in the LANCE dataset, formulations within a 10% L1 distance lipid molar percentage neighbourhood of any top 10% most efficacious LANCE hits were excluded. An ensemble of five COMET models predicted efficacy in both cell lines. The top 0.1% highest-scoring LNPs were selected (34,529 B16-F10 and 27,354 DC2.4). The next step removes formulations based on uncertainty in COMET prediction. We then scale the standard deviation by division with a non-negative predicted efficacy term to get a relative uncertainty value (urel): where \({y}^{{\prime} \mathrm{ensemble,min,LANCE}}\) is the minimum ensemble score among the LANCE LNPs. Any formulations with negative \({\hat{y}}^{\mathrm{ensemble}}\) term were dropped. 13 shows the distribution of this relative uncertainty value. To promote chemical diversity, K-means clustering (on 14-dimensional vectors encoding lipid molar percentages) grouped these candidates into 10 clusters. Clustering was repeated 1,000 times to stabilize assignments. For each cell type, three top LANCE hits (from ‘Top LANCE LNP hits baselines' section) were used as starting points. Around each, virtual candidates were generated by (1) exploring within a 20% L1 molar percentage distance, (2) substituting at least one lipid (6 ionizable lipids, 2 cholesterols, 1 helper and 1 PEG) and (3) altering the N/P ratio. To generate three diverse candidates per lead, we segmented the neighbourhood into three zones: (1) molar % segment (within 20% L1, no lipid changes), (2) substitute-lipid segment (within 20% L1, but with at least one different lipid) and (3) N/P ratio segment (differing N/P ratio). From each zone, the top predicted LNP was selected (Fig. This yielded three optimized LNPs per lead. The virtual library size ranged from 1.5 million (single-ionizable lipid) to 9 million (dual-ionizable lipid) candidates. The sixfold increase in dual-ionizable lipid cases arises from combinatorial enumeration: each minor ionizable lipid was paired with six major ones. By contrast, single-ionizable lipid compositions require no pairing. The final selected formulations for validation are listed in Supplementary Tables 19 and 20. The compositions and molar ratios of amines, diacrylates and branching agents are listed in Supplementary Table 21. To synthesize PBAE polymers, the combination of the amines, diacrylates and branching agents were used. In brief, in a 20 ml glass vial, the entire weight of diacrylate and branching agent was added. Later, the reaction vials were placed on a hotplate at 90 °C. After 24 h, the vials were removed from the hotplate and cooled to room temperature. Then, the reaction mixture was added (drop-by-drop) into a beaker containing ~150 ml ice-cold diethyl ether (~10× excess volume). The collected samples were transferred to 50 ml tubes and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min to pellet the polymer. Later, the supernatant was removed and dissolved in the minimal possible volume of dimethylformamide. This purification step was repeated three times. Final polymers were dried under vacuum and solubility tested in ethanol. PBAEs were represented as a combination of their diacrylate–amine repeating unit and branching agent, each with unique component-type embeddings. The repeating unit was treated as a fifth molar component type alongside lipids, with its molar concentration estimated from polymer weight and molecular weight. Total molar percentages of PBAE and lipids sum to 100%. Inference proceeds as in lipid-only LNPs (‘COMET details' section). Two top-performing PBAE LNPs per cell type were used as starting points. Around each, virtual candidates were generated by (1) exploring within a 20% L1 molar percentage neighbourhood, (2) substituting lipids (6 ionizable lipids, 2 sterols, 1 helper and 1 PEG) and (3) converting to dual-ionizable compositions. To select three diverse candidates, we defined three non-overlapping segments: one within the 20% L1 distance but must have the same lipid choices, one with at least one different lipid compound and one with a dual-ionizable lipid configuration. The top predicted LNP from each segment was chosen (Fig. Final hits are detailed in Supplementary Tables 22 and 23. The IL-15 mRNA is synthesized via in vitro transcription with a HiScribe T7 mRNA kit with CleanCap Reagent AG (E2080S) from New England Biolabs, with 5-methoxy-UTP (N-1093) from Trilink. The LNP transfection is done at an mRNA concentration of 0.25 µg ml−1 in the 96-well plate format. The Human IL-15 expression level is measured with Human IL-15 Uncoated ELISA (88-7620) procured from Invitrogen, after 16 h of incubation of HepG2 cells with LNP. Raw efficacy data are normalized, similar to bioluminescence data mentioned above, before used as dataset for machine learning experiments. This dataset (20%) is randomly split into test set, while the rest is used as the train and validation sets. After synthesis, the LNP formulations are frozen at −80 °C for 2 h before undergoing the following lyophilization process: equilibrate at −40 °C for 2 h, in atmosphere → −40 °C for 21 h, in vacuum → 25 °C for 2 h, in vacuum. Labconco FreeZone 6 l with a Stoppering Tray Dryer was used for lyophilization. Post-lyophilization efficacy values were computed and normalized similarly to the LANCE label values (‘Data processing' section). Animal experiments for this study were approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were consistent with local, state and federal regulations as applicable. For imagining, d-luciferin (LUCK-1G, Gold Biotechnology) solubilized in PBS was administered via intraperitoneal injection and the mice were imaged using an IVIS imaging system (PerkinElmer). We selected the COMET model most correlated (Spearman) with ensemble scores across a random virtual LNP subset. LNP features for t-SNE were the final [CLS] token representations. To ensure even distribution across ionizable types, dual-ionizable lipid LNPs were treated as a distinct class, and 1,250 LNPs per class (8 total) were randomly sampled (10,000 total). To execute integrated gradients (IG) with COMET's multimodal inputs, we adapted the Captum library. IG computes attribution by integrating gradients along a path from reference to input. Feature attributions were computed per LNP, baseline-subtracted and averaged across each group. Non-PBAE LANCE LNPs were used as the baseline. Attribution scores were normalized (max = 1) and averaged across ensemble models. Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article. Should any raw data files be needed in another format, they are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request. Source code for the COMET model, trained weights and inference scripts will be available on GitHub upon publication.

Hello Nature readers, would you like to get this Briefing in your inbox free every day? Researchers have developed a team of robots that can autonomously explore underground tunnels. The rappelling robots are “a significant step toward enabling future lunar or Martian cave missions”, says geochemist Jennifer Blank. A surprising number of birds are ‘sex reversed', in which their appearance and reproductive organs don't align with the genetic sex determined by chromosomes. In a study of nearly 500 birds belonging to five common species that were brought into an animal hospital in Australia, researchers found that up to 6% of individuals were sex-reversed. Most examples were genetically female birds with male reproductive organs, but the group included a genetically male bird who appeared to have recently laid an egg. Gas molecules moving from the cold transparent layer to the hot bottom layer creates a lift that is similar to that created by a helicopter's whirring rotor, says engineer Igor Bargatin, who has pioneered work on similar devices. From mid-June to early July, Western Europe experienced its highest average temperatures for this period in decades, and the hottest June on record. Research suggests that heatwaves in the region are becoming much more frequent — one estimate found that London can now expect events like this every 6 years instead of every 60. Source: Grantham Institute report Climate change tripled heat-related deaths in early summer European heatwave Some tests plan to use advanced lasers still being invented. Others require ambitious techniques to manipulate matter that might never be achievable. Still, after years of stagnation, some physicists are welcoming “a new era in quantum-gravity research”, says theorist Jonathan Oppenheim. “Whether the future is closer to an inconvenience or an existential catastrophe, one thing is clear: don't cut funding for basic climate research,” Palmer writes. Harsh lighting, shiny surfaces and cluttered spaces are among the challenges for scientists wanting to photograph their experiments, whether for public engagement, teaching, or so that a setup can be repeated by others. Alongside a plethora of tips — mostly aimed at physicists — photographer and researcher David Penny notes that the benefits of slowing down to take a few shots go beyond the images captured.

Nature Reviews Endocrinology (2025)Cite this article Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global health concern. Medical nutrition therapy has a key role in T2DM management, with dietary interventions being central to improving glycaemic control and overall metabolic health. Growing evidence suggests that certain dietary strategies can exert direct metabolic benefits independent of weight reduction. The Mediterranean diet has consistently demonstrated metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, along with improved glycaemic control, even in the absence of substantial weight reduction. Low-energy and very-low-energy diets, characterized by moderate to severe caloric restriction, respectively, have also been associated with improvements in cardiometabolic markers and glycaemic regulation. Ketogenic diets promote nutritional ketosis and have shown benefits on glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity and other metabolic outcomes, often preceding substantial weight loss. Intermittent fasting strategies, such as alternate-day fasting or the 5:2 model, and time-restricted eating, have likewise been linked to enhanced glycaemic control and favourable metabolic and cardiovascular effects, although their long-term efficacy and safety require further investigation. This Review aims to provide an evidence-based synthesis of the main nutritional strategies used in the treatment of T2DM, with a focus on their underlying mechanisms, clinical efficacy and potential for sustainable long-term implementation. Personalized medical nutrition therapy is a cornerstone of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management, with evidence supporting its role in improving glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity and in reducing diabetes mellitus-related complications in individuals both with and without obesity. The Mediterranean diet exerts beneficial effects on glycaemic control, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress via several bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids as well as by promoting gut microbiota health and diversity. Low-energy and very-low-energy diets can induce substantial weight loss and lead to T2DM remission, particularly when implemented early in the disease course. Ketogenic diets, including very-low-energy ketogenic therapies, improve glycaemic outcomes and reduce insulin resistance by inducing nutritional ketosis; however, they vary in composition and require individualized use due to potential safety concerns. Intermittent fasting approaches, such as 5:2 fasting and alternate-day fasting, and time-restricted eating, show promising results for weight loss, glycaemic control and medication reduction in T2DM. Their effectiveness can be enhanced when aligned with circadian rhythms. Research on integrating medical nutrition therapy with pharmacological treatments such as incretin-based therapies could provide comprehensive solutions for T2DM management.
