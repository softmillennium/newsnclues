                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the latest episode of the "Pulisic" series on Paramount+, Christian Pulisic (along with Tim Weah and Christian's father, Mark Pulisic) talked about criticism and comments made by former USMNT players-turned-pundits. "I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me, the biggest cop-out of all time, is when all the pundits want to say: 'They didn't want it. "I think those guys are chasing clicks, and for me, I just feel like they're really evil, honestly, because they've been players, and they know what it's like when you're getting bashed. Don't get me wrong, I respect all of them. They were players I looked up to, but quite frankly, the guys before didn't win anything either." "These guys want clicks on social media and subscribe to [their] channels, listen to [their] podcasts or whatever. I think they should look in the mirror and look at their last performances for the national team before they start talking s---." First and foremost, if you're going to accuse people of doing things for clicks and for attention or to watch a show, well played. I don't think that I am, and I don't think that any of the other guys that you may have been referring to are evil in our criticism. But if they were, I sure as hell wouldn't respect them. The "Pulisic" clip showed Landon Donovan, a USMNT legend who has shared his thoughts about the current team. Well, Donovan was part of the best U.S. World Cup team in history – they were a possible handball away from going to a semifinal in 2002. He also has a statue outside the LA Galaxy's stadium. So, Donovan surely has done a lot more than any of these players have ever done with the team. Also, don't bring your dad to a fight. I get that Mark Pulisic, like other dads out there, has been involved directly in bringing up, in this case, Christian. But who brings their dad to a fight? If you're angry at me or Landon or anybody else that is being critical of you, that's fine. You have a platform, you have a microphone – some would say bigger than anybody else out there – to get that off your chest, but you don't need to bring your dad. Never once has it even occurred to have my father defend me from the slings and arrows that are inevitable but well done. In less than a year, Christian Pulisic and USMNT will be at center stage of the world's biggest sporting event. For a team that has produced so much angst and concern over what's happening on and off the field, you should be doing anything to get into the good graces of an American public that is dying to love you and support you. That's where your legacy, whatever it ends up being. You should be so lucky that it is even close to Landon Donovan – and that's where it's going to happen next summer at the World Cup.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Both the Lions and Argos will play home games away from their respective venues during FIFA's World Cup. Soccer's men's world championship will be held from June 11 to July 19 with contests in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Vancouver and Toronto will combine to host 13 matches. Toronto's BMO Field will stage six, including Canada's first-ever World Cup game on home soil June 12. Seven games will be played at Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium, including Canada's group matches June 18 and 24. The Lions will relocate for two home games, with the club planning to announce those details at a later time. “As Toronto and Vancouver welcome the world, we're grateful to other cities and their tremendous fans for so generously making a home away from home for the Argonauts and the Lions.” As well, a new temporary playing surface has been installed, with another planned specifically for the World Cup in 2026. BMO Field's seating capacity will be increased to 45,736 for the World Cup from 28,180. There will also be enhancements made to the audio systems, an expansion of the wifi throughout and a new north-end pavilion that's currently under construction. “To our incredible fans in Toronto: your passion and loyalty mean the world to us," said Argos GM Mike (Pinball) Clemons. Last season, Toronto had an average attendance of 15,127 as it marched to a second Grey Cup title in three seasons. That figure has dipped to 13,838 as the Argos (2-7) have struggled thus far and there's history to suggest the prospect of having to play home games out of town next year won't help the franchise's fortunes. In 2015, the Pan American Games and Toronto Blue Jays' playoff run forced Toronto to play three home games on the road (one in Ottawa, two in Hamilton). That was after opening that season in Fort McMurray, Alta., as the home team versus the then Edmonton Eskimos. A total of 4,900 spectators watched Toronto defeat Edmonton 26-11 in Fort McMurray on June 27. Despite only playing five times at Rogers Centre — Toronto's home venue at the time — the Argos finished third in the East with a 10-8 record before suffering a 25-22 setback to Hamilton in the division semifinal before a Tim Hortons Field gathering of 24,029. The big difference in 2026, though, will be Toronto playing its road home games against the local teams, which should be a more attractive draw for fans in those cities. This will mark the first time the World Cup will be hosted by three countries as 48 teams from six confederations are slated to participate in the global event. Vancouver will be in the West Region along with Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area and Seattle. Toronto is in the East Region along with Atlanta, Boston, Miami, Philadelphia and New York/New Jersey. The World Cup begins June 11 in Mexico City and will conclude with the tournament final July 19 in New York/New Jersey.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If, like all of my social circle, you did not follow this summer's expanded Club World Cup, you missed some decent games, a few upsets, a lot of Donald Trump and a surprise win for Chelsea. It was fine, but fine was good enough to ensure it will happen again in four years' time — perhaps sooner — and that means you also possibly missed the beginning of the end of football as most of us know it. When the new Premier League season starts tomorrow evening, many of the world's best players will embark on an 11-month season that will finish at next summer's World Cup, the old-fashioned one but with 48 teams and 104 games, not 32 and 64, as per recent editions. This will be less than five weeks after Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain in New York, but only two weeks after Manchester United drew with Everton to clinch the Premier League's very own American showcase event, the Summer Series. It is not just the world's best players who are now locked into an endless content-creation cycle. The lower leagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and elsewhere in northern Europe are always early starters, but England's Leagues One and Two began their new campaigns on August 1. In fact, League Two's Barnet and Newport County had already played each other in an EFL Cup preliminary round on July 29 — in other words, before most of their fans had gone on their summer holidays, let alone taken some time off to enjoy the cricket season, the Lions tour, a music festival, a summer fete, anything other than football, basically. What else can the EFL do when UEFA adds a third European competition, the Conference League, in 2021, and then expands all three of its club competitions in 2024, adding extra games and teams? The Champions League leapt from 125 to 189 games last season — once that happened, every new edition of the EFL Cup is a minor miracle. The EFL could just stop scheduling it, I suppose, but Premier League clubs appear to like winning it, as do their fans. Take that away and Premier League boss Richard Masters is going to have an even harder time trying to convince his shareholders to send more money down the pipe before the new independent football regulator makes them. He was at it again earlier this month, when the BBC asked him why the Premier League does not just shrink to 18 teams. “I don't think we should be forced into that decision,” said Masters. FIFA and UEFA have been dropping not-so-subtle hints that 18-team leagues, with a maximum of 306 games, is where everyone should have arrived by now. Germany's Bundesliga has had 18 teams since 1965, but France's Ligue 1 got the memo in 2023, having scrapped its second domestic cup competition three years earlier. This means only England, Italy and Spain still have 20-team leagues in Europe. Italy's Serie A actually voted on whether to go to 18 teams last year, but the clubs backed the status quo by a 16-4 margin. If La Liga put it to their clubs in Spain, we can be fairly sure of how Barcelona and Real Madrid would vote. For what it is worth, that French decision looks worse with every passing season, as their domestic television deal has cratered and PSG, insulated by Qatari sovereign wealth and their overseas earnings, have disappeared into the distance. Everyone apart from them could use the extra matchday revenue and broadcast inventory now. But big clubs have broad horizons, with foreign fans and global sponsors. UEFA and now FIFA have shown them the value of international competition and they want more of it, which means less time for domestic chores. Would England's aristocrats vote to cut the Premier League? Unlike their European peers, they can still see the benefit of domestic football in their profit and loss accounts, as the Premier League, for a variety of reasons, has become the closest thing to a European Super League since the Big Six briefly conspired with Barca, Juve, Real and Co to create a more regular and lucrative place to get together than the Champions League. A combination of crass planning, fan power and opportunistic populism on the part of the British government saw that abomination collapse inside 72 hours, but instead of being punished for their treachery, the ESL's 12 founding clubs were rewarded with an expanded Champions League and revamped Club World Cup. With the Premier League's overseas media rights still rising in value, its stadiums full (and growing) and almost half of its clubs playing in Europe this season, the status quo looks pretty good right now. By bringing European Union competition law into football's fixture squabbles, the leagues and players are telling FIFA they believe the game has reached saturation point, the players are knackered, and there are no more cup replays to scrap. The Premier League also knows it cannot get too stroppy with an organisation that provides at least a third of its shareholders with large cheques each season, not to mention the fact that the race for European berths is a vital component of the Premier League's annual narrative. FIFA, on the other hand, consults via press release and photo opportunity, as FIFPro, the global players' union, has been pointing out of late. Which brings us back to the Club World Cup that may have completely passed you by. Perhaps you did not watch any of the games, but you read about some poor attendances, extreme weather and a couple of mismatches. For the record, I did not properly watch a single moment of it live, although I did read about it and watch the best clips on social media, which is not that dissimilar to how my children follow most football. FIFA and its Saudi-backed streaming partner DAZN may even have counted me and thousands of other passers-by that night in their viewing statistics, which is fine, as I did notice the score and got slightly interested when PSG's players and manager Luis Enrique lost their tempers at the end. And Chelsea's players looked very happy afterwards, albeit a little confused as to why the U.S. president had decided to photobomb their celebrations. He knew that if I had more friends in Africa, Asia or South America, my social circle would certainly have watched the tournament. And he also knew that the inaugural event's host, the aforementioned commander in chief, was so pleased with how it had gone that he joked at half-time that maybe he should scribble one of his presidential decrees to replace “soccer” as the game's name in America. “It is my job to assess whether these new competitions have an impact on the domestic calendar and domestic competitions, of which the Premier League is one. Now we are starting to redesign our domestic calendar at the altar of European and global expansion. “We are asking the players to play in more matches. Yep, and now the only dialogue is going to be a row about whether the Club World Cup should go to 48 teams in 2029, with more spots for Masters' shareholders, or maybe we should just let FIFA do it every two years, floating from summer to winter as it crosses the globe. If that happens, and there is no question that FIFA wants that to happen — ideally in rotation with a biennial men's World Cup — we can forget 18-team domestic top flights, with deep professional pyramids and historic national cup competitions.

It had been in discussions with streaming platform Coupang for the rights to sub-licence the tournament in South Korea, but while DAZN claimed it had not reached a binding deal and could therefore accept a higher offer, the Commercial Court found that  the nature of its discussions with senior figures at the South Korean firm – including WhatsApp messaging – had constituted a binding agreement. Trevor Watkins, head of sport at Pinsent Masons, explained the ruling would have wider implications beyond sports rights in terms of how contractual discussions would be measured. “In deciding this case the court went back to basic principles of contract law and found that parties can conclude a legally binding contract if there is sufficient evidence of intention and the core essential terms are agreed, even when it is likely that additional elements were still to be finalised,” he said. “Rights are invariably the bedrock of value within a sport.

Soccer's men's world championship will be held from June 11 to July 19 with contests in Canada, Mexico and the United States. Vancouver and Toronto will combine to host 13 matches. Toronto's BMO Field will stage six, including Canada's first-ever World Cup game on home soil June 12. Place Stadium, including Canada's group matches June 18 and 24. 2026 FIFA World Cup organizers begin search for some 65,000 tournament volunteers How record heat could force FIFA to rethink the World Cup calendar The Lions will relocate for two home games, with the club planning to announce those details at a later time. “As Toronto and Vancouver welcome the world, we're grateful to other cities and their tremendous fans for so generously making a home away from home for the Argonauts and the Lions.” As well, a new temporary playing surface has been installed with another planned specifically for the World Cup in 2026. BMO Field's seating capacity will be increased to 45,736 for the World Cup from 28,180. There will also be enhancements made to the audio systems, an expansion of the WiFi throughout and a new north-end pavilion that's currently under construction. “To our incredible fans in Toronto: your passion and loyalty mean the world to us,” said Argos GM Mike (Pinball) Clemons. Last season, Toronto had an average attendance of 15,127 as it marched to a second Grey Cup title in three seasons. That figure has dipped to 13,838 as the Argos (2-7) have struggled thus far and there's history to suggest the prospect of having to play home games out of town next year won't help the franchise's fortunes. That was after opening that season in Fort McMurray, Alta., as the home team versus the then Edmonton Eskimos. A total of 4,900 spectators watched Toronto defeat Edmonton 26-11 in Fort McMurray on June 27. Despite only playing five times at Rogers Centre – Toronto's home venue at the time – the Argos finished third in the East with a 10-8 record before suffering a 25-22 setback to Hamilton in the division semifinal before a Tim Hortons Field gathering of 24,029. The big difference in 2026, though, will be Toronto playing its road home games against the local teams, which should be a more attractive draw for fans in those cities. Vancouver will be in the West Region along with Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area and Seattle. Toronto is in the East Region along with Atlanta, Boston, Miami, Philadelphia and New York/New Jersey. The World Cup begins June 11 in Mexico City and will conclude with the tournament final July 19 in New York/New Jersey.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mauricio Pedroza and Janusz Michallik discuss Ricardo Pepi's future at PSV. This past weekend, the English Championship and 2. Bundesliga got underway, with the Premier League, LaLiga and Ligue 1 kicking off this weekend. Serie A and the Bundesliga will begin the week after that. That means the U.S. men's national team diaspora will begin getting games under their belt with their respective club teams, if they haven't already, while their brethren in MLS are in the thick of their respective 2025 campaigns. As such, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of those players throughout the season, and every week, delivering insights into the players whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing, as well as providing updates on the USMNT player pool at large. We call it the USMNT's Countdown to the men's World Cup. Our Big Board, updates of which will publish every other month. ESPN will count down to June 11 every week, so that way when the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise. So, without further ado, welcome to the USMNT's Countdown to the World Cup. Dest has started the season on fire at PSV, scoring the game winner against Go Ahead Eagles in the Dutch Super Cup, and then finding the net again in this past weekend's 6-1 rout of Sparta Rotterdam. His return to form is fantastic news for U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino, too. Pochettino has yet to see the right back up close after Dest had an ACL injury a year ago, and the player's absence has been keenly felt. Dest's ability to create the unexpected from right back had been a key part of the national team's attack, and his injury meant opponents could clamp down on other attacking threats such as Christian Pulisic. Dest's likely return for the USMNT in September should provide a significant boost. The chasm that exists between Sargent's club form and his play with the USMNT was illustrated again this past weekend. In Norwich City's 2-1 defeat against Millwall to open the Championship season, Sargent scored the Canaries' only goal with his butt, blocking an attempted clearance from Millwall keeper Steven Benda and watching it loop into the net. With the USMNT, Sargent can't beg, borrow or steal a goal, having gone more than five years since his last national team tally. If he's going to find a way back into the good graces of Pochettino, he's going to have to continue delivering for Norwich. That's if he doesn't move to a new club in what is left of the summer transfer window. Turner has already achieved his primary goal for this window, and that was finding a club where he's guaranteed a chance to play. This past season while on loan at Crystal Palace he made just four appearances, and none in league play. But in making his return to New England -- he played there previously between 2016 and 2022 -- Turner got off to a perfect start, making three saves in a 2-0 win over D.C. United. This is not to say that Turner has the starting spot with the USMNT all sewn up. Colorado's Zack Steffen is having an excellent season, as is New York City FC's Matt Freese, who gained some critical national team experience in the recently concluded Gold Cup. But Turner's World Cup experience gives him an edge if everything else is equal. The next nine months will make for a fascinating three-player race ahead of the World Cup. If the World Cup started tomorrow, who would make up Pochettino's starting XI? Each week we take our best attempt to name a starting lineup based on form and fitness, which means there's no room for injured players like Pulisic (ankle, although he could yet be available for Sunday's Coppa Italia tilt against Bari), Malik Tillman (muscle strain) or Antonee Robinson (resumed training, but not yet match fit). Injuries are a constant factor when it comes to national team lineups, and this attempt at coming up with a USMNT XI is no different. In this iteration, left back is a sore spot. Fulham manager Marco Silva said last weekend that Robinson isn't fit to start the Premier League season following minor offseason knee surgery. One of Robinson's possible replacements, Watford's Caleb Wiley, is dealing with a back injury, so he's not available either. That leaves Columbus Crew's Max Arfsten. The attacking midfield positions -- both central and out wide -- are also a bit injury hit, with the aforementioned ailments for Pulisic and Tillman meaning that more digging into the USMNT's depth is required. The inclusion of América's Alejandro Zendejas might raise an eyebrow or two, especially considering he was on the outside looking in in ESPN's USMNT Big Board 1.0. But based purely on current form, Zendejas is the pick, as he has been lights out for América during the entire calendar year. The big question is: Does Pochettino actually rate him? The September window will be revealing. Diego Luna is the pick for a central role. Yes, he was sent off in this past weekend's 2-1 defeat to the New York Red Bulls for two bookable offenses, although he looked more like a victim than perpetrator in the sequence that earned him a second caution. He also delivered a defense-splitting pass to set up RSL's lone goal. With some other U.S. players nicked up, Luna gets the nod, although he'll need to keep his composure as he's bound to be on the receiving end of more physical challenges. The rest of the side is stocked with familiar names this week, but the weekend should provoke plenty of movement. Herculez Gomez and Cristina Alexander debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. ESPN's USMNT Big Board 1.0 went live this past week, and each Big Board will provide the foundation for weekly player updates. Below are the minutes and player ratings for each of those 35 players. Matt Freese, goalkeeper, New York City FC: 2,160 minutes in 2025; 7.1 FotMob rating in 2025. Tim Ream, center back, Charlotte FC: 1,712 minutes in 2025; 6.6 FotMob rating in 2025. Chris Richards speaks after Crystal Palace's penalty shootout win over Liverpool in the Community Shield. Alex Freeman, fullback, Orlando City SC: 2,275 minutes in 2025; 7.5 FotMob rating in 2025. Luca de la Torre, midfielder, San Diego FC: 1,950 minutes in 2025; 6.9 FotMob rating in 2025. Diego Luna, attacker, Real Salt Lake: 2,005 minutes in 2025; 7.2 FotMob rating in 2025.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pulisic, entering his third year at AC Milan in Italy's Serie A, has been the focus of criticism from USMNT alums for not participating in the Gold Cup this summer, which led to a very public spat that involved Landon Donovan and Pulisic's father. But the pride of Hershey, Pa., has become a sensation in Italy, scoring 32 goals in his first two seasons with AC Milan, and the club will need that as it hopes to improve from an eighth-place finish last season. Pulisic had been dealing with a minor ankle injury, but he returned to full practice, and AC Milan doesn't open the Serie A season until Aug. 23. It appears for now as if Reyna will start the year with German Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund, though the writing on the wall seems to suggest his time there could be coming to an end. While any potential transfer from Dortmund has moved at a crawl — Reyna had been linked to Serie A side Parma over the summer — the son of USMNT alum Claudio Reyna needs to get off to a fast start to help his World Cup chances. 7 that Reyna had worn since 2021 to another player, it seems like playing time could be tough for him to see until a move is made. Here are some other USMNT players to keep an eye on during the European season: You can stream Friday's Premier League opener between Bournemouth and Liverpool and other select matches during the 2025-26 season live on Peacock — click here to sign up today. Last season, he helped Leeds finish first in the EFL Championship — England's second division — to earn a promotion back to the Premier League. Malik Tillman, Bayer Leverkusen (Bundesliga): Tillman made the jump to Bayer Leverkusen this summer from PSV in the Netherlands. In two years with PSV, he had 25 goals and 17 assists while helping the club win back-to-back league titles. The move will give Weah some all-important playing time heading into 2026 after making 78 appearances and scoring 14 goals for Juventus. Johnny Cardoso, Atlético Madrid (LaLiga): The 23-year-old midfielder completed a transfer to Atlético Madrid last month from rival Real Betis and hopes to put a disappointing summer at the Gold Cup — injury hindered him from making much of an impact with the USMNT — behind him.</p>
