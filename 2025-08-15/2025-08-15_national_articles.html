                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a high-stakes summit that could determine not only the trajectory of the war in Ukraine but also the fate of European security. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have begun face-to-face talks in Alaska for a high-stakes summit that could determine the trajectory of the war in Ukraine and the fate of European security. For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia's territorial gains, block Kyiv's bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit. There are significant risks for Trump: By bringing Putin onto U.S. soil, the president is giving Russia's leader the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. The Kremlin shared two clips of Putin and Trump smiling and talking before the two world leaders began their sit-down meeting in Alaska, alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov. Russian media outlets also shared images that appeared to show a bemused Putin raising his eyebrows in response to shouted questions from assembled reporters. While Trump was meeting privately with his top aides and Putin, his political team sent out a fundraising email that said, “I'm meeting with Putin in Alaska!” “THIS MEETING IS VERY HIGH STAKES for the world.” It also said, “No one in the world knows how to make deals like me!” and encouraged people to donate, suggesting they start with $10. It's because the former secretary of state said she'd nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize herself if he negotiates an end to Russia's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to give up territory. “Well, that was very nice,” Trump said when asked about Clinton's comment during an in-flight interview with Fox News Channel. Trump has also been angling to be awarded the prestigious peace prize. The full Fox News interview is set to air later Friday. Interviewed by Bret Baier of Fox News Channel aboard Air Force One as he flew to Alaska, Trump said he'd like to walk away from the meeting with a ceasefire. “I wouldn't be thrilled if I didn't get it,” Trump said of a halt to hostilities between the countries. The two leaders were seated in a room with their aides in front of a blue backdrop that had the words “Pursuing Peace” printed on it. Trump and Putin were seated in the middle of the chair arranged in a horseshoe, with a small table between them with drinking glasses and paper. They didn't take any questions but Trump said, “Thank you” to reporters who were briefly in the room. Both leaders got into the backseat of Trump's armored presidential limousine, chatting with each other and smiling as they got situated. Trump and Putin are riding together in the U.S. president's official limousine. President Donald Trump greeted Russian leader Vladimir Putin at an air base in Alaska on Friday as a squadron of U.S. stealth military planes designed during the Cold War in part for use in a possible conflict with the Soviet Union flew overhead. Both leaders stood alongside each other, shaking hands again, appearing to exchange words and ignoring shouted questions from reporters on site. Russian state news agencies Tass and RIA Novosti reported Friday that President Vladimir Putin will use Aurus, a high-end Russian-made limousine, in Alaska. Putin brought Aurus on foreign trips before, and even gifted one to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov will join the Russian leader during his “three-on-three” meeting with Trump, Rubio and Witkoff. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant on war crimes accusations for Putin in 2023. But the U.S. isn't a member of that global body, so officials are under no obligation to arrest him. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed, during a video address on Friday, his hope for a “strong position from the U.S.” ahead of talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to end the war, and we hope for a strong position from the U.S.,” Zelenskyy said. “The war continues and it continues precisely because there is no order, nor any signals from Moscow that it is preparing to end this war,” he added. Mike Dunleavy, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Russian state news agencies RIA Novosti and Tass report that a motorcade with top Russian officials who are part of the delegation has departed to the summit venue. Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said earlier that those joining the Russian president in Alaska will include himself, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Putin's envoy for investment and economic cooperation Kirill Dmitriev. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters aboard Air Force One that Trump won't be meeting Putin alone, as she had previewed earlier in the week, but instead will be joined the secretary of state and his special envoy. His planned lunch meeting with Putin was to include Rubio and Witkoff, along with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Alaska was colonized by Russia starting from the 18th century until Czar Alexander II sold it to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million. When it was found to contain vast resources, it was seen by Russians as a naïve deal that generated remorse. After the USSR's collapse, Alaska was a subject of nostalgia and jokes for Russians. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to meet with Russia's President Vladimir Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025. Trump made those comments during a gaggle aboard Air Force One, noting that the Russian delegation includes businesspeople. Trump also suggested that Russia's latest strikes on Ukraine represent Putin “trying to negotiate,” adding that any consequences for Russia would be “economically severe.” President Donald Trump arrived in Alaska on Friday for a pivotal summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin that could reshape the war in Ukraine and relations between Moscow and Washington. Trump was scheduled to meet Russia's president at his plane shortly. A large “Alaska 2025” sign, flanked by four parked fighter jets and red carpets, was placed on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage for the leaders' arrival. Trump and Putin have shared closely watched handshakes before— but the one they are expected to have Friday will be as scrutinized as any, as will any body language or hints about how each is feeling. He and his allies have cast him as a heavyweight negotiator who can find a way to bring the slaughter to a close — something he used to boast he could do quickly. The red carpet is cleaned before President Donald Trump steps from Air Force One,Friday, Aug. 15, 2025, at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, before meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin. Minutes after Trump's plane landed, Air Force One moved by the scene as final preparations were being made. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin will lay flowers at the tomb of Soviet pilots in Alaska after his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump. The carpeting is lined on either side with fighter jets, parked at an angle, White House staff stand on the stage where President Donald Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin will participate in a joint press conference at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025. Doan's responsibilities include working with the Metropolitan Police Department and other federal agencies working on law enforcement in the district. But the decision is being held for seven days while CFPB employees and their legal team file an appeal. Since President Donald Trump was sworn into office, the CFPB has effectively been inoperable, and its employees have been banned from doing any work with plans to cut the bureau's employment to a skeleton crew of staff. Voting in favor of the 2-1 decision was Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both Trump appointees during his first term. In a snippet from an interview aboard Air Force One with Fox News Channel's Bret Baier posted on X, Trump predicted that his meeting with the Russian president would “work out very well — and if it doesn't, I'm going to head back home real fast.” I don't know if it's going to be today but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today,” Trump told reporters, as he stood in an aisle of the plane. Putin has rejected these accusations, even though Moscow has sought to maintain or increase its influence on some of the former Soviet states. General Alexus Grynkewich, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe is in Alaska to provide “military advice” to President Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, a senior NATO military official told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Grynkewich, who is the commander of U.S and NATO forces in Europe, is a supporter of Ukraine and views Russia as a clear threat to European security. He has previously spoken of the need to get military aid into Kyiv quickly, including after President Trump said in July that NATO would be coordinating deliveries of U.S weapons. Immigrant advocates in Washington held a call Friday to share information about what people are reporting. Edith Hinson, an attorney for the Washington-based Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, said they are advising immigrants to measure risks if they must get behind the wheel or get a ride with a relative or friend who is a U.S. citizen and not to answer any questions as passengers. “It's very unsettling, very troubling that, now moving forward, MPD is free and able to share information regarding everyone they encounter in a traffic stop with ICE,” Hinson said. Sanai says they have already seen increased police presence in Mount Pleasant, a Salvadoran enclave. “We are triaging how to advise clients and the community at large. FILE - People walk on the Stanford University campus beneath Hoover Tower, March 14, 2019, in Stanford, Calif. Stanford University said in July it will continue considering legacy status, even after a California law barred it at institutions that receive state financial aid. Trump has promised a new emphasis on merit with his efforts to keep colleges from considering an applicant's race. But he's been silent on legacy admissions — the policies that give applicants a boost because of family ties. Trump's complaints about systems he describes as “rigged” overlook this glaring instance in higher education — the edge given to children of alumni — said Richard Kahlenberg, a researcher at the Progressive Policy Institute think tank. “It's hard to think of a more flagrant way in which the system is rigged than legacy preferences,” Kahlenberg said. Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Friday quoted Kremlin spokesman Peskov as saying that the Putin-Trump talks could take at least 6-7 hours. Peskov also said that the two leaders will be accompanied by their aides during their one-on-one meeting, and that Russia hopes for the summit to bring about results. The consequence of this failure leaves no clear path for nations to collectively address the mountains of plastic filling landfills, clogging oceans and showing up in chunks on beaches and other public places. More than 400 million tons of new plastic is produced each year around the planet, and that could grow by about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. About 100 countries want to limit production, but the United States and other oil-producing countries opposed any limits on making plastics from fossil fuels. Police Chief Pamela Smith's statement came in a court filing Friday as the city seeks to block the federal takeover of its police department in court. Smith said the Trump administration's order installing a federal official as “emergency police chief,” if allowed to stand, would upend command structure and be ‘dangerous' threat to law and order. Washington's top legal official is seeking an emergency restraining order. District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.” “If Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I'll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself,” the former U.S. secretary of State wrote on X. Trump has already said he believes a peace deal would likely require the swapping of Ukrainian territories by both sides. Clinton, Trump's 2016 Democratic opponent, linked to her appearance on the “Raging Moderates” podcast, where she offered Trump some advice: “He is not meeting with a friend. But Clinton said that if Trump can negotiate a ceasefire, have Russia withdraw from the territory it seized and bring an end to the war without making Ukraine concede territory, she would join the Nobel lobbying. Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to Magadan Region Governor Sergei Nosov during their meeting at the Prezidentsky sports and recreation complex, in Magadan, about 6,000 kilometers (3,700 miles) east of Moscow, Russia's Far East, on Friday, Aug. 15, 2025, on the way to Alaska. Putin is scheduled to arrive at 11:00 a.m. local time Friday in Anchorage, where he will be met at the plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV, an excerpt of which was published on reporter Pavel Zarubin's Telegram channel on Friday. According to Peskov, during the four-hour flight from Magadan, Putin will review materials on Ukraine, bilateral tensions, economic cooperation, and global affairs. FILE - Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko speaks during his interview with the Russian magazine of the Natsionalnaya Oborona (National Defense) in Minsk, Belarus, Tuesday, Nov. 9, 2021. The president posted on his social media network that he had “a wonderful talk” with the president of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko. He said their “good” conversation included a discussion of Putin's visit. Trump said they also spoke about the release of some prisoners earlier this year and the future release of prisoners. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to meet with Russia's President Vladimir Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, Alaska, Friday, Aug. 15, 2025. Trump said Russian drone attacks on civilian areas of Ukraine are a misguided effort to improve Putin's negotiating position. “But he thinks that gives him strength in negotiating. Trump also talked on Air Force One about economic benefits for Russia, while warning of more severe sanctions if the talks aren't fruitful. “I noticed he's bringing a lot of business people from Russia, and that's good,” Trump said. “I like that because they want to do business, but they're not doing business until we get to war settled.” Attorney General Pam Bondi's directive putting the DEA administrator in charge of D.C. police came after Police Chief Pam Smith updated guidance on arresting immigrants. Smith had told Metropolitan Police Department officers to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. But she said other MPD policies remain in effect, limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it,” Schwalb said.</p>

This photo provided by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources shows a deceased Eastern cottontail rabbit infected with Shope papillomavirus in October 2021. (Dr. Rachel Ruden/Iowa Department of Natural Resources via AP) DENVER (AP) — A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked — the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus. The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns. Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including “Frankenstein bunnies,” “demon rabbits” and “zombie rabbits.” But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago. The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures. Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said. The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don't harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits' immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.</p>

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem temporarily relocated her personal residence as she's facing an increase in threats against her and "vicious doxxing," a department spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Friday. "Following the media's publishing of the location of Secretary Noem's Washington D.C. apartment, she has faced vicious doxxing on the dark web and a surge in death threats, including from the terrorist organizations, cartels, and criminal gangs that DHS targets. Due to threats and security concerns, she has been forced to temporarily stay in secure military housing," Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. "Secretary Noem continues to pay rent for her Navy Yard residence. "It's a shame that the media chooses sensationalism over the safety of people enforcing America's laws to keep Americans safe," McLaughlin added. Noem said last week that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents "are now facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them as they risk their lives to arrest the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens."

Erin was upgraded Friday morning from a tropical storm to a hurricane, a storm with sustained winds above 74 miles per hour, making it the first hurricane of the 2025 season. Despite a relatively calm storm season until now, forecasters are still anticipating higher-than-normal levels of activity, and the peak of the hurricane season lies ahead. The storm is projected to curve away from the US mainland, but parts of the East Coast are facing “significant risk of dangerous surf and rip currents along western Atlantic beaches next week.” The hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30 and typically has 14 storms strong enough to be named, meaning with wind speeds above 39 mph. That's due in part to the El Niño cycle, which is currently in its neutral phase, creating atmospheric conditions more favorable to tropical storms. “As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued,” acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a news release. The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry last month stalled over Texas, where they converged with another weather system and caused a massive downpour that led to deadly flooding in the state's hill country. A key step to saving lives from tropical storms and hurricanes is to anticipate where they might go and get people out of the way. On this front, scientists have made tremendous strides in building longer lead times ahead of a storm's landfall, and new tools are continuing to extend that lead. But the Trump administration's recent cuts to departments that study and forecast weather are undermining this progress, while cuts to emergency agencies are slowing disaster responses. Meteorologists often describe hurricanes as heat engines, meaning that they use a temperature difference to generate wind and rain. This is why the apex of hurricane activity tends to be in September, after the Atlantic Ocean has had all summer to heat up. With global average temperatures rising due to climate change, the potential for more powerful hurricanes is increasing. A warmer planet also means rising sea levels as ice caps melt, adding more liquid to the seas. The ocean itself also expands as it gets hotter. Warmer air can also hold onto more moisture, increasing the rainfall during a hurricane. The combined effects of storm surge and more intense rainfall can lead to more flooding, often the deadliest and most destructive aspect of a hurricane. And as the floods in Texas this year showed, even areas that are far inland can suffer severely from hurricane storm systems. So when a hurricane makes landfall, it threatens more lives and takes a bigger bite out of the economy. The good news is that scientists have made huge strides in anticipating hurricanes and can now predict where they are going days in advance. Last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed a new prediction model called the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System. It proved to be better than previous models at predicting a storm's path and intensity. It makes storms harder to predict, and makes evacuating people in their path more hasty and chaotic, as hurricanes surge in strength. Scientists are still trying to tease out the mechanisms behind rapid intensification, but the new model was able to see the rapid intensification coming in Hurricanes Helene and Milton from their earliest advisories, days before landfall. But while NOAA has made improvements in its forecasts, the agency itself has faced big cuts from the Trump administration, including staff who work on hurricane modeling. The White House has proposed cutting its budget by a quarter, eliminating research divisions like the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which studies hurricanes. Several field offices for the National Weather Service under NOAA currently lack lead meteorologists, and key forecasting tools like weather balloon launches have seen a decline. The National Weather Service is now scrambling to hire back hundreds of employees. The true scope of these vulnerabilities won't be revealed until after a major hurricane. Update, August 15, 2025, 1:40 pm ET: This story has been updated to include news of Erin's upgrade to hurricane status. Herds in North America will likely be hit the hardest. Rising temperatures are rewriting the earliest stages of life. It probably has nothing to do with saving birds. America's wildfire strategy is falling apart when it's needed most. A growing number of thinkers say factory farming can help save the planet.</p>

For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia's gains, block Kyiv's bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit. Despite having so much at stake, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders aren't invited. Members of the media stand outside Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025, ahead of a meeting between President Donald Trump and Russia's President Vladimir Putin. By bringing Putin onto U.S. soil — America bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 for 2 cents per acre — the president is giving him the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump and Putin's first meeting is a heavy blow to the West's policy of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine's mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies. !” Trump posted shortly before he boarded Air Force One for Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. On his way to the meeting, Putin stopped in Magadan, in Russia's Far East, where he visited a factory producing omega-3 fish oil capsules, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Putin was reviewing materials on Ukraine, tensions with the U.S., economic cooperation and global affairs during his four-hour flight to Alaska, where he will be greeted at his plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV. Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting — a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to. When asked after arriving in Alaska about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia “never plans ahead.” AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports President Trump has left for his Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin. We will state it,” he said in footage posted to the Russian Foreign Ministry's Telegram channel. Trump said in a Fox News radio interview Thursday that he didn't know if they would get “an immediate ceasefire” but he wanted a broad peace deal done quickly. That seemingly echoes Putin's longtime argument that Russia favors a comprehensive deal to end the fighting, reflecting its demands, not a temporary halt to hostilities. The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over “a working breakfast.” They are then expected to hold a joint press conference. In the days leading up to the summit, Trump described it as “ really a feel-out meeting.” But he's also warned of “very severe consequences” for Russia if Putin doesn't agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, “He's not going to mess around with me.” Trump said Friday that his talks with Putin will include Russian demands that Ukraine cede territory as part of a peace deal. And I think they'll make a proper decision,” Trump told reporters traveling with him to Alaska. Zelenskyy has time and again cast doubts on Putin's willingness to negotiate in good faith. His European allies, who've held increasingly urgent meetings with U.S. leaders over the past week, have stressed the need for Ukraine to be involved in any peace talks. Dmitry Suslov, a pro-Kremlin voice, expressed hope that the summit will “deepen a trans-Atlantic rift and weaken Europe's position as the toughest enemy of Russia.” Foreign governments will be watching closely to see how Trump reacts to Putin, likely gauging what the interaction might mean for their own dealings with the U.S. president, who has eschewed traditional diplomacy for his own transactional approach to relationships. Ukraine has held on far longer than some initially expected since the February 2022 invasion, but it is straining to hold off Russia's much larger army, grappling with bombardments of its cities and fighting for every inch on the over 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line. Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow and director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said U.S. antagonists like China, Iran and North Korea will be paying attention to Trump's posture to see “whether or not the threats that he continues to make against Putin are indeed credible.” “Or, if has been the past track record, he continues to back down and look for ways to wiggle out of the kind of threats and pressure he has promised to apply,” said Kendall-Taylor, who is a former senior intelligence officer. Being on a military base allows the leaders to avoid protests and meet more securely, but the location carries its own significance because of its history and location. Alaska is separated from Russia at its closest point by just 3 miles (less than 5 kilometers) and the international date line. It continues to play a role today, as planes from the base still intercept Russian aircraft that regularly fly into U.S. airspace.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump has pushed out career experts and aides who challenged him. During Donald Trump's first term, his top advisers attempted to run a traditional process for shaping foreign policy, tapping experts from the White House's National Security Council, debating recommendations from across the government, and steering the president away from decisions that they feared would damage America's interests. “And those that are there need to run the play he calls, no questions asked.” The more centralized setup allows Trump's impulses—his disregard for historic alliances, his love of dealmaking, and his focus on perceived abuses of American largesse—to drive U.S. policy. “On the one hand, this arrangement is much more nimble. The president is the decision maker,” said Victoria Coates, who served as deputy national security adviser during Trump's first term and continues to support Trump's foreign-policy moves. The risks of the new approach will be fully on display in Anchorage, Alaska, today, as Trump holds talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, giving an adversary a win without extracting much in return. Trump's first-term advisers would have counseled against the hastily arranged summit. The consolidated setup has also led to policy whiplash—as was the case with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's on-again, off-again suspension of military aid to Ukraine in July, which confused officials at a moment when Trump was trying to dial up pressure on Moscow. Allied nations often struggle to navigate a system in which even high-ranking officials cannot provide clarity, because a wider array of decisions must be taken to the Oval Office, where Trump remains inscrutable and often erratic. Trump returned to the White House in January with a sense of vindication. He and his advisers also brought a scathing assessment of Joe Biden's foreign-policy record, blaming him for the humiliating end to the war in Afghanistan, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and other crises they vowed to put right. And they came armed with lessons about what had gone wrong the first time around, when Trump cycled through four national security advisers. Trump remained regretful about the departure of the one he trusted most: Michael Flynn, who stepped down less than a month into Trump's first term over his undisclosed ties to Russia. In the years that followed, Trump felt stage-managed by H. R. McMaster and then John Bolton. (He was mostly fine with his final national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, who was more in sync with Trump's preference for a limited role for the NSC.) McMaster grew exasperated with what he called the “adhocracy” of disjointed deliberations that yielded rushed executive orders or other chaotic steps. Bolton later wrote that discussions of consequential trade issues, which occurred in weekly gab sessions rather than orderly meetings, “more closely resembled college food fights than careful decision-making.” Throughout, both men enlisted senior administration figures like James Mattis, John Kelly, and Mike Pence to redirect Trump or talk him out of what they saw as particularly counterproductive moves, such as reneging on America's commitment to stand by NATO allies. Some of Trump's long-serving aides viewed the former Green Beret, who once was an aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, with suspicion, pegging him as a hard-liner on Russia and Iran and overly beholden to traditional foreign partners. By May, even senior subject-matter experts were sometimes left out of the loop on visits by senior officials from regions within their portfolios, one former official said. And then nothing further would be heard; NSC staff would have no idea if their policy advice was being adopted or even read in the West Wing. “It needed to be tabled until you could get a decision or opinion from the president.” Vivian Salama, Michael Scherer, & Jonathan Lemire: Trump invites Putin to set foot in America Waltz's departure may have been inevitable, but it was hastened when the national security adviser accidentally added The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a text chat on Signal in which Waltz and other officials shared sensitive plans for bombing Yemen on March 15. The security breach and Waltz's response—he claimed on Fox News that Goldberg's number had somehow been “sucked” onto his phone—provided further ammunition for his West Wing rivals. (Waltz, who gave up his congressional seat to serve in the White House, has not yet been confirmed. To the surprise of those who expected friction between Trump and his 2016 Republican-primary rival, whom the president once derided as “Little Marco,” Rubio's style as interim national security adviser has gained purchase with the president and those around him. White House officials defended using the secretary of state in this role, saying it made for quicker decisions and better operational security, pointing to Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in June. Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the State Department, said that Rubio and the department back Trump's “America First” agenda and are “proud to support him as he leads our country in a golden era of American diplomacy.” Jeffrey Goldberg: The Trump administration accidentally texted me its war plans Rubio quickly restructured the NSC, which had grown to more than 300 people in recent years. Vance's aide Andy Baker and Wiles's aide Robert Gabriel, both of whom were named deputy national security advisers in May, are now key figures in managing the smaller, more streamlined NSC. In addition to the core decision team of Trump, Vance, Rubio, and Wiles, Stephen Miller plays a key role on issues related to homeland security. On decisions involving Russia and Israel, envoy Steve Witkoff is included. One of the former officials said that Trump would have likely retained a more robust NSC and a less centralized setup if Waltz had survived. “It was an opportunity that they seized,” the former official said. “‘Let's do it, and go after the ghost of Vindman. Trump's new setup is a stark contrast to Barack Obama's “team of rivals,” which encouraged debate and sometimes sparring between different agencies as the chief executive sought to tease out the best approach. That sort of process might have helped Trump avoid some of the legal challenges his administration has faced to its rapid-fire executive orders and its rushed efforts to dismantle federal agencies, and helped minimize the commercial disruption that has resulted from his tariff pronouncements. Mark Montgomery, a retired Navy rear admiral and former NSC official now at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us the centralized setup discourages contrarian viewpoints. Nick Miroff and Jonathan Lemire: Stephen Miller has a plan Another former official noted that as Trump sought to intensify competition with China during his first term, a more diffuse system and more empowered agencies allowed a host of military, commercial, and diplomatic initiatives to bubble up. “None of that is happening” now, the former official said. Some current and former officials fear the setup may also mean inadequate vetting of questionable ideas, such as Trump's announcement earlier this month that he had repositioned two nuclear submarines in response to bellicose remarks by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin ally. To achieve strategic deterrence, the Navy's ballistic-missile fleet relies on stealth. You don't know where they are,” one defense official explained.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US military is deploying more than 4,000 Marines and sailors to the waters around Latin America and the Caribbean as part of a ramped-up effort to combat drug cartels, two US defense officials told CNN — a dramatic show of force that will give the president a broad range of military options should he want to target drug cartels. A nuclear-powered attack submarine, additional P8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, several destroyers and a guided-missile cruiser are also being allocated to US Southern Command as part of the mission, the officials said. A third person familiar with the matter said the additional assets are “aimed at addressing threats to US national security from specially designated narco-terrorist organizations in the region.” But it also gives US military commanders — and the president — a broad range of options should Trump order military action. The ARG/MEU, for example, also features an aviation combat element. The deployment of the Marine Expeditionary Unit, however, has raised concerns among some defense officials who worry that the Marines are not trained to conduct drug interdictions and counter drug-trafficking. If that is part of their mission set, they will have to lean heavily on the Coast Guard, officials said. MEUs have been instrumental in the past in supporting large-scale evacuation operations; a MEU was stationed for months in the eastern Mediterranean, for example, amid tensions between Israel, Hamas and Iran. The additional assets being moved now, however, will fall under US Southern Command, and are set to support SOUTHCOM for at least the next several months, one of the officials said. CNN previously reported that a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier this year stated that the US military's “foremost priority” is to defend the homeland, and instructed the Pentagon to “seal our borders, repel forms of invasion including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities, and deport illegal aliens in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security.” CNN's Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.</p>

Taylor Swift breaks the internet on her boyfriend's podcast, and Will Cain still doesn't get how she became this generation's Elvis. Plus, Julian Epstein joins to unpack why Democrats keep leaning left, even as voters pull away from their agenda. Taylor Swift on Wednesday opened up about how Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, and others, influenced her to eventually date superstar tight end Travis Kelce. Reid said in 2023 that he was the one who had set the two up and admitted on OutKick that while he had been joking about it at the time, he slyly suggested it was kind of true. Swift talked more about how Reid and others close to Kelce had been in her ear about the potential romance. Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid yells during the first half of an NFL football game against the Las Vegas Raiders on Monday, Dec. 25, 2023, in Kansas City, Mo. "When you guys did the full send on the podcast, and he was like, ‘You wanna date me?' And everybody heard it, it was the ‘shooting your shot heard ‘round the world.' Basically, everyone who likes you (Travis), which is a lot of people, started reaching out to everyone who knows me," she said on "New Heights." "I think it was like Andy was vouching, I think it was my relatives, my cousins, they were like, ‘Please, please, please, he's amazing.' ‘You don't understand this guy's incredible.'" Swift grew up in Pennsylvania and a relationship was struck between Reid and Scott Swift when the head coach was at the helm of the Philadelphia Eagles. Taylor Swift appeared on the "New Heights" podcast. "He's been friends with my dad," she said of Reid. "My dad is the most social man who's ever been born. He would make a friend in an airport in 1971, have a five-minute conversation and still be talking to that dude twice a week, now. "So, he knows Andy, and Andy's been coming to shows for years and stuff like that. So, I've always had a really positive vibe about Andy Reid. I didn't really know what the sports thing he was doing but I knew that was my dad's friend Andy Reid. I now know he's the most iconic, legendary coach of all time." Swift had very kind words to say about the longtime head coach and his leadership skills. Oct. 12, 2023, Kansas City, Missouri: Recording artist Taylor Swift watches play against the Los Angeles Chargers during the game at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium. "And like from the way that you (Travis) talk about him, his leadership style, I respect it so much, because I feel like it's done without aggression, raising your voice or losing your composure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ron DeSantis (R-FL) was among Republicans who accused Democrats of hypocrisy with their reaction, saying that leaders in the party, among them Obama, have spearheaded their own gerrymandering efforts to benefit the Left. DeSantis has particularly gone after former Attorney General Eric Holder, who launched the Obama-backed National Democratic Redistricting Committee in 2016, seeking to give Democrats an opportunity to create more favorable district maps across 12 states after the 2020 census. However, Obama this week framed his stance as necessary to prevent “a systematic assault on democracy,” during a roughly 30-minute video call with Texas House Democrats and Holder, now the chairman of the NDRC. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) into a corner where they are forced to respond with similar plans, an argument echoed by allies such as Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and the California governor. “We can't let a systematic assault on democracy just happen and stand by, and so because of your actions, because of your courage, what you've seen is California responding, other states looking at what they can do to offset this mid-decade gerrymandering,” Obama said, according to CNN. “The problem that we've been seeing, not just recently, but this goes back a while, is that the Republicans increasingly recognize their ideas won't sell, so we've got to fix the game a little bit, and by drawing maps that splinter Democratic voting blocs, by packing in Democrats into one district so that they don't have influence in other districts,” Obama added. Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu thanked Obama for meeting with lawmakers in a post on X. ​​“We are encouraged by your words and remain committed to fighting for democracy, in Texas & across the country,” Wu said. In states such as Maryland, Illinois, and California, lawmakers have drawn up districts composed of voters more likely to vote for Democrats. North Carolina, Texas, and Florida are among the states where Republicans have gained more dominance through partisan redistricting efforts.</p>

The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee, who in turn ordered both parties to appear in court Friday afternoon at 2 p.m. to weigh the emergency request. The position is likely to land Reyes, who also presided over a lawsuit involving Trump's ban on transgender service members, back in Trump's crosshairs for the second time in less than eight months. Reyes issued a preliminary injunction blocking Trump's ban on transgender service members from taking force, prompting Trump allies to label her as an "activist" judge, even after the injunction was overturned by a higher court. The Justice Department also filed a misconduct complaint against Reyes earlier this year, citing her remarks towards government lawyers. Reyes has something of a reputation for her sharp, fast-paced style of questioning, however, and employed it readily as she grilled lawyers for the plaintiffs as well. Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing Friday that Trump's order is "endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers." "In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive," she said in the court filing seeking emergency intervention. The lawsuit comes five days after Trump issued an executive order to temporarily federalize D.C., which he described as an effort to "reestablish law order and public safety" and temporarily federalize the city, which he described Monday as "one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world." That order included deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops into the city, and temporarily taking federal control of D.C.'s police force. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller speaks to reporters outside the West Wing of the White House on Apr. "By declaring a hostile takeover of MPD, the Administration is abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the District's right to self-governance and putting the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk," Schwalb said in a statement Friday. "This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it." The lawsuit caps a heated week in the nation's capital, as President Donald Trump and White House officials have assailed what they describe as a "ridiculous" amount of crime in D.C. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told NewsNation in an interview earlier this week that Washington, D.C., "is more violent than Baghdad." They have alleged recent data — which found a 26% decline in violent crime between 2023 and 2024 — has been "manipulated" or underreported. Just hours earlier, the Trump-linked America First Legal Foundation (AFL) filed a FOIA request seeking all crime records and data compiled by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, as part of an effort to scrutinize information and crime statistics at issue. Meanwhile, critics have excoriated Trump's executive order, which they argue is not based on an uptick in crime or an "emergency" — but rather, serves as justification for the administration to push through its sweeping executive action outside the normal policymaking process. Norm Eisen, the former White House ethics czar under President Barack Obama, told reporters Thursday that Trump's order in D.C. is the latest in a "pattern of assaults on the rule of law" in his second term as president. Trump "has declared a fake emergency" in D.C., Eisen said. "There is no ‘emergency' upon which this action with MPD or the federal military is predicated" in D.C., Eisen said. The E. Barrett Prettyman United States Court House is seen early morning on Dec. 10, 2024, in Washington, DC. Trump in March signed an executive order, "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force," designed to address issues with a city he has long derided as "filthy," "horribly run" and "crime-ridden," among other things. "We want to have a great, safe capital," he told reporters earlier this year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Leading authorities in the District of Columbia on Thursday rebuffed attempts by the Trump administration to further federalize its law enforcement by appointing an “emergency police commissioner.” Amid President Donald Trump's push to reduce crime in the district by sidelining its prized home rule status, Attorney General Pam Bondi stripped power from its Metropolitan Police Department, tapping Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole to assume all responsibilities carried by MPD Chief Pamela Smith. The move prompted swift backlash from Mayor Muriel Bowser and D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who argued there is no legal basis for Bondi's order. Their rhetoric marks an escalation in tensions between the White House and district officials, who had been largely amicable to President Donald Trump's effort to target violence and crime in the capital. “In reference to the U.S. Attorney General's order, there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.” In addition to stripping Smith of police authorities, Bondi's order, titled “Restoring Safety and Security to the District of Columbia,” targeted the district's leaders and the MPD for policies viewed as sanctuary city protections shielding illegal immigrants. “What's most important for our community to know is that MPD remains committed to delivering high-quality police service and ensuring the safety of everyone in our city.” The battle over control of Washington launched in earnest on Monday, when Trump invoked Section 740 of the 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act, allowing federal control for 30 days, with congressional approval required for extensions. Trump and his allies have argued that said federal intervention is warranted to resolve the crime problems that have dogged the district for years. Problems surged in 2020 when D.C. Councilman Charles Allen, who represents Ward 6, which includes Capitol Hill, spearheaded measures responding to George Floyd's death that instituted sweeping criminal justice reforms and significantly softened penalties for crimes, critics contend. Some of the laws have since been rolled back, with crime metrics showing improvement in recent months. “The City's Homicide Rate is higher than places notorious for their violence, such as Mexico City, Bogota, Islamabad, and Addis Ababa — Almost ten times higher than Fallujah, Iraq,” he continued. … Now, D.C. is back under Federal Control where it belongs.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In March, Kroger's CEO resigned from his corner-office role after nearly five decades at the company — an abrupt exit that left questions and $11 million on the table. Now, a lawsuit involving '90s folk sensation Jewel could bring some answers. Rodney McMullen, who joined Kroger in 1978, left after an internal investigation into “his personal conduct,” the grocer said in a statement at the time. A lawsuit from 2023 might push Kroger or McMullen himself to reveal those details. In legal filings, the plaintiffs — which include a company co-owned by singer-songwriter Jewel Kilcher — accused Kroger of breach of contract over a wellness festival partnership. McMullen and his lawyer refused to answer questions about his resignation during deposition this year and requested a protective order to bar questioning on the “embarrassing” topic, as described by his lawyer in court documents. But an Ohio judge had ordered McMullen to submit a written response by August 8 about his resignation, including the names of people involved. There will be “incredible consequences… if this ever gets out,” McMullen's lawyer, Jeffrey Hinebaugh, said in front of the judge in May. Hinebaugh added that “having to sit there and explain to people something that's completely unrelated and personal is the embarrassment.” Kroger's CEO abruptly resigns after probe into personal conduct “We respect the court's thoughtful ruling, and we're pleased that the court is not giving Mr. McMullen a free pass to avoid testifying just because the former CEO's lawyer says that answering questions would be embarrassing,” Brian O'Connor, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement to CNN. CNN has reached out to Hinebaugh for comment. However, the public will not get its eyes on McMullen's written response. Jewel had come up with an idea for a wellness festival alongside Trevor Drinkwater, CEO of Inclusion Companies. Drinkwater's company already had experience creating other retail-sponsored, celebrity-backed festivals like Bentonville Film Festival. Jewel and Drinkwater then decided to partner with Kroger on the “Wellness Your Way” festivals for five years, according to the lawsuit. There was no formal agreement, but rather an agreement over email in June 2018 since Drinkwater's company would take the financial risk, the lawsuit said. But after the festivals became profitable, Kroger replaced Drinkwater and Jewel's company with one run by Kroger executive Colleen Lindholz's sister, legal filings allege. The plaintiffs argue this violated Kroger's business ethics policy. “(Lindholz) also informed (Drinkwater) that the festival had become Kroger's premiere annual corporate event, the CEO Rodney McMullen wanted to make it a part of his legacy, and Kroger needed to have ownership and control of it,” the lawsuit said. McMullen told Jewel over email, “I'm not involved in planning of the Festival this year. Please communicate with her on this,” according to the lawsuit. McMullen resigned in March after a company investigation found his personal conduct was “inconsistent” with Kroger's ethics policies. The company said it did not involve Kroger's finances and no associates were involved. His resignation came a few months after Kroger rival Albertsons called off its $25 million merger with Kroger amid regulatory pressure. Albertsons subsequently sued Kroger for breach of contract agreement. Albertsons' lawyers, too, are curious about the circumstances leading to McMullen's departure. “McMullen's conduct and business ethics are central to this litigation,” Albertsons said in a motion filed late July. “Yet Kroger refuses to produce any documents regarding significant lapses of ‘business ethics' so serious they cost McMullen his job weeks after the Merger was blocked.” McMullen earned roughly $15.7 million in 2023, according to an SEC file.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we're committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it's hard. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? This deal has everything: semiconductors, DeepSeek, constitutional violations. Whatever else can be said about the second Trump administration, it is always teaching me about parts of the Constitution I had forgotten were even in there. Case in point: Article I, Section 9, Clause 5 states that “No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.” This is known as the export clause, not to be confused with the import-export clause (Article I, Section 10, Clause 2). The Supreme Court has repeatedly held, most recently in 1996's US v. IBM, that this clause bans Congress and the states from imposing taxes on goods exported from one state to another or from the US to foreign countries. I found myself reading US v. IBM after President Donald Trump announced an innovative new deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD. Now, I'm not a lawyer, but several people who are lawyers, like former National Security Council official Peter Harrell, immediately interpreted this as a clearly unconstitutional export tax (and as illegal under the 2018 Export Control Reform Act, to boot). At this point, there's something kind of sad and impotent about complaining that something Trump is doing is illegal and unconstitutional. It feels like yelling at the refs that the Harlem Globetrotters aren't playing fair; of course they aren't, no one cares. The refs are unlikely to step in here, either. Maybe the best we can do is understand why this happened and what it means for the future of AI. As I explained last month, the H20 is entirely the product of US export controls meant to limit export of excessively powerful chips to China. Nvidia took its flagship H100 chip, widely used for AI training, and dialed its processing power (as measured in floating point operations per second) way down, thus satisfying rules restricting advanced chips that the Biden administration put in place and Trump has maintained. That makes the H20 better than the H100 at answering queries to AI models in action, even if it's worse at training those models to start with. Critics saw this all as an attempt to obey the letter of the export controls while violating their spirit. It still meant Nvidia was exporting very useful, powerful chips to Chinese AI firms, which could use those to catch up with or leap ahead of US firms — precisely what the Biden administration was trying to prevent. Then, in July, reportedly after both some bargaining with China over rare earth metals and a personal entreaty from Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang, Trump flip-flopped; the chips could go to China after all. That, of course, is an important new element, not least because it seems bad that the president is asserting the power to unilaterally impose new taxes without Congress. (At least with tariffs, Trump has some laws Congress passed he can cite theoretically granting the authority.) But the big question about H20s remains the same: Does this help Chinese companies like DeepSeek catch up with US companies like OpenAI? And how bad is that, if it happens? The concerns here are such that maybe the best way to understand them is to imagine a debate between a pro-export and anti-export advocate. I'm taking some poetic license here, in part because people in the sector are often averse to plainly saying what they mean on the record. Anti-Export Guy: Trump says he wants the US to have “global dominance” in AI, and here he is, just letting China have very powerful chips. DeepSeek could even rent time on an H100 that way. So, why are we freaking out about exporting a weaker chip? That way, they're dependent on US servers and companies. If Chinese AI firms ever start making dangerous systems, the US can shut off their access, and they'll be out of luck. Pro-Export: Again, will they be out of luck? There's a third option after Nvidia exports and US servers. Chinese firms don't want to depend on foreign servers forever, and if we deny them Nvidia chips, they'll run right over to Huawei chips. Anti-Export: Saying you don't need Nvidia chips when you have Huawei chips is like if you told someone 20 years ago that they don't need an iPod because they have a Zune. Yes, Huawei chips exist, but they're so much worse. They're lower bandwidth than H20s, Huawei's software libraries are full of bugs, and the chips sometimes dangerously overheat. By some metrics, Huawei's latest systems (not just the chips, but the surrounding servers) outperform Nvidia's top-end model — even though that model uses B200s that are faster than H100s and lightyears faster than you'd ever be allowed to export to China. Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI have all recently moved away from Nvidia chips toward things like Google's own TPUs or Amazon's Trainiums. Anti-Export: Sure, but those companies still use Nvidia's too. OpenAI wants 100,000 chips in one Norwegian facility alone. DeepSeek reportedly had to delay its latest model because it tried to train it on Huawei chips but couldn't. It relies on smuggled components to make its top-end chips and can make at most 200,000 this year, compared to the roughly 10 million Nvidia chips shipped annually. China is reportedly discouraging firms from using Nvidia chips in the wake of the export tax deal, largely to encourage them to use domestic chips like Huawei, though they are clearly not banning the firms from using Nvidias if they prove necessary. It's also investigating whether the US is including spyware in them. The bigger question this debate raises for me, and one I certainly can't answer adequately here, is: To what degree is “beating China” on AI important for making the future of AI go well? The answer for most US policymakers, and most people I know in the AI safety world, has been “very.” The Financial Times reports that some Trump officials are considering resigning in protest over allowing China to get H20s. As Leopold Aschenbrenner, the AI analyst turned hedge funder, put it bluntly in his influential 2024 essay “Situational Awareness”: “Superintelligence will give those who wield it the power to crush opposition, dissent, and lock in their grand plan for humanity.” If China “wins,” then, the result for humanity is permanent authoritarian repression. I'm very confident they'll wield it to oppress Chinese citizens. But it feels as though “staying ahead of China” has become the sine qua non of US AI policy. The bigger danger is that no one can control these systems, rather than that China can, and that the focus on staying ahead of China will cause the US to speed deployment of automated weapons systems that could prove deeply destabilizing and dangerous. I think offering China H20s probably hurts AI safety a bit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would not willingly give up territory, which also would not be allowed under the country's constitution. Russian forces are making incremental gains on the battlefield toward the Ukrainian city of Dobropillya, but at exorbitantly high costs. “These are small-scale penetrations, and it's at the tactical level,” George Barros, an expert with ISW, told the Washington Examiner. “For now, the Russians certainly will seek to try to mature these tactical successes into a larger breakthrough and a larger penetration and seize more territory, but it remains unclear if they would be successful in that endeavor.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that Russia likely suffered around 60,000 soldiers killed or wounded in battle last month alone. This year, it's taken a similar amount of territory for a further 200,000 killed and wounded,” Adm. Sir Tony Radakin, the U.K. chief of defence staff, said in an interview with the Center for Strategic and International Studies this week. Ahead of the summit, “Putin is left with a dilemma: Agree to a ceasefire with his stated aims incomplete and little to show his people in return for the lost blood and treasure,” he added, “or continue the war indefinitely and watch his country become even weaker and poorer chasing the false dream of subjugating Ukraine.” The Russian military's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 2022, and the prevailing belief among Western officials was that it would only take a matter of days or weeks before it captured Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. “We had limited confidence in Ukraine's defensive strategy. The prevailing view was that Russia would take Kyiv within weeks, if not days. The choice was whether to back Ukraine or not.” The war has led to more than 1 million “lives sacrificed” since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, he said. With allies unsure of whether to back Ukraine in a fight for its survival, Ukrainian troops and volunteers alike not only prevented the capture of its capital but also forced Putin to fundamentally shift his short-term war objectives to focus on regions in southeastern Ukraine, close to Russia's borders. They were widely disregarded internationally as sham referendums conducted under duress. Russia still does not entirely control the territory it annexed and wants to get it through the ceasefire negotiations. Russia and Ukrainian forces have been fighting in the Donbas region since 2014. Ukrainian leaders and their European allies have stressed the importance of security guarantees in any agreement to prevent Russia from trying to restart its war when the military has had a chance to resupply and refit. And they also know that if there is a ceasefire, it's not a full peace, as you're not changing Putin's ambitions.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The case has been assigned to federal district Judge Ana Reyes, an appointee of former President Joe Biden. Bowser quickly rejected the order, writing on social media, “There is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.” In a filing as part of the lawsuit, MPD Chief Pamela Smith said the takeover places officers and residents at “grave risk.” “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Smith said It is, Smith wrote, “placing the lives of MPD officers and District residents at grave risk.” Smith confirmed that she was “unaware of President Trump's plans to assume control of the local police force until he announced it at a press conference” on Monday. Friday's lawsuit marks a forceful response from city leaders after days of public statements largely appeasing Trump. Bowser has repeatedly said she wants to make sure the federal law enforcement surge is useful to the city, though she struck a more adversarial tone during an event this week, calling Trump's police department takeover an “authoritarian push.” “It is my opinion that the Bondi order is unlawful, and that you are not legally obligated to follow it,” Schwalb said in a letter to Smith. “Congress also limited the President's authority to requesting services for ‘federal purposes,' such as protecting federal property or personnel — not dictating local enforcement of local laws.” Bondi's order had further directed MPD to abandon a directive Smith signed earlier in the day giving officers limited ability to share information with federal immigration officials. And, the order said, MPD leaders “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole before issuing any further directives.” In addition to ordering that the directive be rescinded, Bondi instructed Bowser to get rid of two additional police policies aimed at protecting undocumented migrants, including one that prevents MPD from arresting an individual solely for federal immigration warrants. This comes after Trump earlier this week declared a crime emergency and federalized DC's police, tapping Cole as interim federal commissioner of MPD. Schwalb wrote in his letter to Smith that Trump and Bondi are now overstepping their legal authority. “Therefore, members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor.” “DC will not remain a sanctuary city actively shielding criminal aliens,” Bondi said in an interview on Fox News Thursday. Earlier Thursday, Smith signed an executive order allowing DC police officers to share information about people not in their custody with federal immigration enforcement agencies, as well as allowing local police to assist with transporting the agencies' personnel and detainees. However, the earlier order — citing DC law and police code of conduct — continues to prohibit officers from looking through police databases solely for a person's immigration status, from making inquiries about a person's immigration status “for the purpose of determining whether they have violated the civil immigration laws or for the purpose of enforcing civil immigration laws” and from arresting anyone based only on federal immigration warrants.

And just like that, Carrie Bradshaw is single again. For the last three seasons, fans have watched TV's greatest anti-heroine begin an entire new set of adventures. After HBO original Sex and the City ended in 2004 (followed by the fun 2008 film of the same name and its not-so-fun 2010 sequel), And Just Like That picked up in 2021 with Carrie's happily ever after. The most fabulous woman in Manhattan seemed to have everything she's ever wanted: a loving marriage to her Mr. Big (Chris Noth), a condo on Fifth Avenue, financial security beyond her wildest dreams, and a truly gigantic closet. But no one is immune to late life's indignities, apparently not even Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker). In the show's often-clunky style, Carrie faced a series of dismal realities. She wasted a bunch of her (and the audience's) time on an ill-fated attempt at rekindling her romance with the country Lurch known as Aidan Shaw (John Corbett). Money remained a non-issue for Carrie, but the show often reminded us that not even immense amounts of wealth could insulate you from life's dishonors. The original show wrapped with true love for all of its heroines, but something felt off. While And Just Like That has been criticized for its tone and poor writing (one secondary character was seemingly killed off twice), it managed to give Carrie Bradshaw an ending that captured the daring admission of the original: that being lucky in love is good, but being lucky in friendship is everything. From urinating on themselves, to getting roasted on stage by their nonbinary comedian ex, to dying on a Peloton, the characters of And Just Like That seemingly exist only to be humiliated. In King's world, life after 40 is nothing but a gauntlet of perverse embarrassments. The continued indignities of aging — so imaginatively bleak that death starts to seem like a sweet release — have turned And Just Like That into a show that people resent, criticize, and demand 17 more seasons of. One cannot fathom the horrors Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda will face each week, usually centered on their bodies betraying them or being left behind by a world that deems them too old. Each new mortification feels shocking, sacrilegious to the show's glamorous predecessor. At the same time, there's kind of a perverse glee in watching how deranged it all can get. What do you mean Carrie had hip replacement surgery and, in a temporary state of medicated paralysis, was left to listen helplessly as her coworker passionately throttled Miranda's lower half like a rotary phone in the other room? Charlotte battling a bout of vertigo and falling into an art installation with fake ejaculate cannot be real, can it? Miranda had sex with a virgin nun played by Rosie O'Donnell? Unfortunately for Carrie, she endures one final degradation in the series finale: Miranda's Thanksgiving. In the world of AJLT, a beloved American holiday about remembering the things we're grateful for unfurls into a nightmare. Everyone but Carrie has bailed on Miranda's get-together, staying with their own husbands and families. Since Carrie possesses neither, she has to witness a trainwreck that includes raw turkey, a clogged toilet and brown fecal water, an Italian greyhound emergency at the vet, the future mother of Miranda's grandchild and her obnoxious friends, and a failed, surprise set-up attempt. In this era of her life, Carrie Bradshaw is single, and if she doesn't want to spend Thanksgiving alone, she might have to endure a few lousy ones at the hands of her friends. It all comes around to the bigger question: What if Carrie's future does not include one more love? Having survived a holiday radiating such dark, melancholic energy, Carrie taps out. Going home alone isn't such a hardship, though. After all, this is the woman who professed to find true joy in tearing open a sleeve of saltines and smearing a sliver of grape jelly on each one, while reading an entire issue of Vogue standing up. What Carrie has is actually the furthest thing from tragic, rather, something much more thrilling — something that the original show should have considered. For six seasons, the show touted the revolutionary concept that its heroines — Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha — just needed each other. “Don't laugh at me,” Charlotte tells her best friends in season four. The idea of soulmates has largely been framed as romantic good fortune, the notion that the universe has picked out lives meant to be lived together, if only these hopeful lovers can find one another. SATC offered a more optimistic reimagining, a theory that our best friends are the true matches we should be so lucky to find in this world. Men were often terrible, rarely lasting more than an episode. Sex was rarely sexy, more often skewered than celebrated. It's sort of a shame then, at the end of the series, that these four soulmates all end up married to or are exclusively committed to men nowhere near as magical as they are. Miranda marries Steve (David Eigenberg), and opens up their home to his mother. Charlotte converts to Judaism, marries Harry (Evan Handler), and they adopt a baby from China. Samantha beats cancer and asks for a monogamous relationship with Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis). Carrie leaves her callous Russian boyfriend (Mikhail Baryshnikov) for Big, and returns to New York with the man she's been chasing all these years. We're meant to see these as happy, fulfilled endings — even though our main characters were all essentially separated from one another. The relationships they nurtured through some of their worst moments — Carrie's heartbreaks, Miranda's mother dying, Samantha's cancer, Charlotte's divorce — were pushed aside to accommodate men. The show told us over and over that these friends could have a fulfilled life with just each other, but it didn't seem to truly believe its own revolutionary message. Carrie finally stumbled upon the realization that her life never needed marriage, romantic love, or maybe even sex, to be fabulously beautiful. Decades later, but never too late, Carrie finally got the ending she and her friends told us to believe in. This quietly subversive book has been captivating kids for generations.</p>
