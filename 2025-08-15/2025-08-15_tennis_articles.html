                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Play was curtailed early with the main court flooded as torrential rain lashed down, but thankfully, there was no such disruption on Wednesday or Thursday. The two top seeds, Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, are both on track while Carlos Alcaraz faces Andrey Rublev later today. Elsewhere, Coco Gauff and Jasmine Paolini both also progressed. Coco Gauff recently revealed that she had been forced to delete X (formerly known as Twitter) because she became obsessed with following Love Island USA on the app. Now, two years have passed, and I've never read anything on that social network again," the recent Canadian Open champion told Tennis Channel. "I prefer to watch the highlights of certain matches. At the moment, I watch a lot of the tennis matches I used to watch, whether it's from the tournament I'm playing in or even from a Challenger tournament that's happening that week. I have a team that helps me keep my feet on the ground." Andrey Rublev is currently trailing Carlos Alcaraz by a break in the opening set of their quarter-final. 9 seed isn't happy with some of the automated technology - even if he doesn't realise some of it is automated. Rublev confronted chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani and claimed the shot clock was being started too soon, only to be told that it automatically started three seconds after the last point was called. Then, he was shown a replay of an electronic line call he didn't agree with, and thought the wrong ball may have been shown. 1 was drinking from a plastic San Pellegrino bottle when the official said: "Aryna can I just ask you to take [the label] off that bottle? It comes just a couple of days after Carlos Alcaraz became frustrated when an umpire told him off for drinking from reusable branded Evian bottles. "It's not my fault," the Spaniard repeatedly stated. Last year's Cincinnati Open champion, Aryna Sabalenka, has been ousted in the quarter-final. Elena Rybakina has taken out the top seed 6-1 6-4, ending Sabalenka's title defence. British doubles stars Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash have extended their incredible winning streak in Cincinnati. They've now won 22 matches and counting after beating No. 6 seed Andrea Vavassori and Simone Bolelli in the quarter-finals. Dubbed 'Cashpool', they have not lost a match since the Libema Open final in June. Elena Rybakina is off to a flying start in her Cincinnati Open quarter-final against world No. Rybakina suffered a brutal defeat to Sabalenka in Berlin a few weeks ago, blowing four match points to go out in the quarter-finals. But she's keen to get revenge - she's taken the first set 6-1 in Cincinnati in under half an hour. “There's no secret, I just drink,” she said, before eyeing the camera and adding: “But water!” Iga Swiatek is through to her third straight semi-final at the Cincinnati Open after beating Anna Kalinskaya 6-3 6-4. Their match is up next on the centre court. Terence Atmane has enjoyed a breakthrough week in Cincinnati, coming through qualifying and making it all the way to tomorrow's semi-final, where he takes on Jannik Sinner. The French qualifier has already beaten 15th seed Flavio Cobolli, teenage sensation Joao Fonseca, and top-10 stars Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune on his way to the last four. 136 in the world, Atmane is set to bank at least £245k in prize money and will make his top 100 debut when the tournament is over. But he still has no clothing or shoe sponsor after being dropped by Asics last year. I buy my clothes and shoes like everyone else. Anna Kalinskaya sparked concerns when she called the physio and received a medical time-out minutes into her Cincinnati Open quarter-final clash with Iga Swiatek. She has decided to play on and got broken. Terence Atmane is on the run of his life in Cincinnati. 136 qualifier is into the semi-finals after beating two top-10 players, including Holger Rune. "I have known you Terence since juniors, tennis is a tough journey and I am happy for your run here at @CincyTennis and what it will mean in the future for you . Play is getting underway at the Cincinnati Open, with No. 3 seed and recent Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek facing Anna Kalinskaya for a spot in the semi-finals. Kalinskaya hit out at the WTA when their quarter-final was scheduled first on Friday at 11am local time, after her last match started on Wednesdan night and finished in the early hours on Thursday, and she didn't get to bed until 4am. “How can the WTA and tournament expect athletes to perform their best when the scheduling is unfair?” she wrote in an Instagram story. “After my match against Alexandrova, I got home from the site at 2:40 am and didn't go to bed until 4 am. “Then I get scheduled at 11 am for tomorrow's match—how does the tournament and WTA expect me to recover and continuously adjust my sleep pattern, which is one of the most important aspects of recovery? Emma Raducanu made a statement at Wimbledon last month, where she put up an impressive fight during a tight loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the third round. But her private life was also under the spotlight at SW19, as Raducanu was asked whether there was any truth to rumours that she was dating Carlos Alcaraz, whom she'll team up with in the US Open mixed doubles event next week. After she said they were just friends, fellow British player Cameron Norrie - who is in a long-term relationship - was asked whether he was seeing Raducanu. The International Tennis Integrity Agency have confirmed that Japanese star Kaili Demi Teso has been suspended for 10 months following a doping violation.The 19-year-old Teso tested positive for the prohibited substance methylephedrine, atributed to a bottle of cough medicine. Wimbledon commentator Andrew Castle has claimed the 'Royal Box' jibe from Andre Agassi live on air this summer was blown out of proportion. "We had a laugh, and they took it out of context," he told Betway. "Afterwards, Andre sent me a text, saying what an unbelievable time he'd had, how he enjoyed it, and we were going to have him for the final but then he went into the Royal Box instead. "But then you read that he was saying, oh, ‘just concentrate on the tennis'." Andre Agassi pretty much annoyed by Andrew Castle and his obsession with celebrities in the Royal Box. Andre is right, it's tennis that they came to concentrate on. Lindsey Davenport has backed Ben Shelton to win the US Open. Davenport, who won three Slam crowns in an illustrious career, said on the Tennis Channel: "Ben Shelton has that type of game where he can take the racket out of his opponent's hand. If you get on a roll in New York, if he can play that high level tennis and have the crowd behind him, we could have an American male Grand Slam champion here pretty soon." Andrey Rublev had received a significant boost ahead of the US Open this month. Safin won't be able to join him in Ohio, but will be in New York to guide him for Flushing Meadows this month. Having sacked Ferrer following his doping controversy, Sinner said:"It was a different situation. "We worked together for about two years before this break. His work has brought me a lot of benefits. Roger Federer has learnt who he will share a court with for his celebrity doubles match in Shanghai on October 10. It's been confirmed that he'll partner with one of two actors, Hong Kong film star Donnie Yen or Chinese TV personality Wu Lei, to play against ex-professional female Zheng Jie. The US Open mixed doubles partnership between Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz appears in doubt due to the Cincinnati Open schedule. Alcaraz is into the last eight, and if he makes Monday's final, he will play just 20 hours before the revamped tournament gets underway. Having taken a break after Wimbledon, citing fatigue, former British player Barry Fulcher has speculated Alcaraz could now follow Coco Gauff in skipping the team event. French qualifier Terence Atmane continued his sensational run at the ATP Cincinnati Masters last night by stunning seventh-seeded Holger Rune 6-2, 6-3. The world No.136 now in his Masters 1000 semi-final where he'll face defending champion Jannik Sinner. "I was just trying to be myself on the court." Alexander Zverev has admitted he got professional help following his first round exit at Wimbledon this summer. "I took a longer period of time off after Wimbledon, which I haven't done in a very long time," he said. I didn't train, I didn't do any physical work, I didn't play tennis for a longer time as well which was the best thing for me to do. I enjoyed my time, mentally freed up, got also some professional help as well there. Anna Kalinskaya has accused the WTA of being 'biased' against her due to the scheduling of her upcoming match against Iga Swiatek. On her Instagram story, she wrote: "How does the WTA and the tournament expect their players to play well with these unfair schedules? "After my match against Alexandrova, I went home at 2:40am and didn't go to bed until 4:00am. "I slept a little and came back to train today. Then they scheduled my match tomorrow [against Swiatek] at 11:00am. Jannik Sinner is through to the semi-finals in Cincinnati after securing a dominant win over Felix Auger-Aliassime. She has booked her place in the last eight with a thumping win over former Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova. Paolini was in full control throughout and sailed to a comprehensive 6-1 6-2 victory. Emma Raducanu will not be seeded for the US Open, it has been confirmed. It means Raducanu could face a top player in the very first round at Flushing Meadows. Coco Gauff is safely through to the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open after beating Lucia Bronzetti in straight sets. She will face either seventh seed Jasmine Paolini or former Wimbledon winner Barbora Krejcikova in the next round. Patrick Mouratoglou is convinced that Victoria Mboko will win Grand Slam titles over the course of her career. Reflecting on her incredible Canadian Open triumph, he said: "She plays to win no matter who is on the other side of the court. "Great physicality, the way she moves on the court and she's very offensive, both sides forehand and backhand." It will be distributed to players based on their performance at the nine ATP 1000 tournaments. ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: "This is exactly what profit sharing was designed to do, ensure that players and tournaments share equally in the sport's financial upside. For us, it's proof that strengthening the premium product and aligning interests creates value. "We're proud to be strengthening our partnership and building a stronger, more sustainable ATP Tour." Matteo Berrettini has pulled out of the US Open due to an injury. However, he remains unable to compete and has withdrawn from the event. Aryna Sabalenka has admitted to regularly cheating on her diet. It can be a lot of different things in one day because you know, like if it's a cheat meal, you got to go full. Top seeds Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka are odds-on to win the US Open. According to AceOdds, in the men's draw, Sinner is the favourite at evens ahead of Carlos Alcaraz at 2/1. AceOdds: 2025 US Open men's winner: Jannik Sinner Evens; Carlos Alcaraz 2/1; Novak Djokovic 16/1; Taylor Fritz, Alexander Zverev 25/1; Jack Draper 28/1; Ben Shelton 33/1; Daniil Medvedev 50/1. Women's winner: Aryna Sabalenka 5/2; Iga Swiatek 7/2; Coco Gauff 7/1; Mirra Andreeva 12/1; Elena Rybakina 14/1 Naomi Osaka 20/1; Madison Keys 22/1; Amanda Anisimova 25/1; Jessica Pegula, Emma Raducanu, Victoria Mboko 33/1; Jasmine Paolini, Clara Tauson 50/1. Jannik Sinner has learnt he won't be eligible to receive money from the ATP Masters Bonus Pool this season. Last month he opted to withdraw from the Toronto Masters, citing fatigue and regardless of his final position, won't be eligible for any additional money. Emma Raducanu has sent a warning to rivals ahead of the US Open this month. After struggling since her remarkable 2021 win, she's said: "I went home and came back and it was a really difficult time in New York. "Since I won the tournament, it's not been easy for me there. The world No.1 has opted not to look for a replacement after her original partner, Grigor Dimitrov, pulled out. It follows him injuring his pectoral muscle at Wimbledon when leading against Jannik Sinner. There have been contrasting reactions to Venus Williams being handed a wildcard for the US Open at 45. On social media, many fans have argued it is a 'waste' of an entry. Anna Kalinskaya complained about 'drunk' fans during her fourth-round match against Ekaterina Alexandrova at the Cincinnati Open. Anna Kalinskaya on some disruptive people in the crowd during her match against Alexandrova in CincinnatiAnna: \u201cI think maybe they\u2019re drunk or something\u2026\u201dUmpire: \u201cThey probably are\u201d \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/tFut5VIfWw It feels like we're in an oven, even for the fans," said Auger-Aliassime. "We're always on the move and focused on trying to win, but the crowd is sitting for a long time, and so are our coaches. A friendly reminder to everyone: drink plenty of water, bring hats, and cool off as much as possible." Carlos Alcaraz is at risk of being fined after ignoring the umpire's instructions to cover the logo on his water bottle. During his win over Luca Nardi, the Spaniard reacted angrily after official Greg Allensworth gave the order, arguing it went against tournament sponsor deals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Open has announced its singles wild cards for 2025, led by two-time champion Venus Williams, who will make her 25th main-draw appearance at the age of 45. Williams, who made her return to tennis after 16 months out at July's Citi Open in Washington, D.C., won the tournament in 2000 and 2001. 35 Peyton Stearns in her first match back, before losing to Magdalena Fręch of Poland. Fellow Americans Clervie Ngounoue, Julieta Pareja and Alyssa Ahn also received direct wild cards. 1, while Ngounoue, 19 and a former junior world No. 1 herself, posted her first WTA Tour main-draw win at this month's Cincinnati Open. On the men's side Nishesh Basavareddy and Tristan Boyer received direct wild cards, along with Darwin Blanch. Basavareddy, 20, played in the Australian Open main draw earlier this year, taking a set off Novak Djokovic before losing in the opening round. Brandon Holt, who initially received a wild card, now has a place in the main draw after the withdrawal of Italy's Matteo Berrettini. Eliot Spizzirri, who beat João Fonseca in last year's qualifying event to make the main draw, takes Holt's wild card. McNally, 23 who had elbow surgery in 2024, will make her first main-draw appearance since 2021; Nava, 23, last made the main draw in 2023. Valerie Glozman of Stanford and Stefan Dostanic of Wake Forest won the college tennis wild card playoffs earlier this year, and also enter the main draw. Of the home hopes, Blanch's selection stands out. Widely regarded as one of the most promising rising talents in American men's junior tennis, the 17-year-old did not receive a wild card last year. He did get into two ATP main draws through his links to IMG at the Madrid and Miami Opens, both of which are one rung below a Grand Slam. Tennis wild card announcements are always fairly contentious, especially at the Grand Slams. Ordinarily, giving one to a 45-year-old who has barely played over the last year would fit squarely in that category. Winning seven major titles also affords certain privileges, even if some will feel wildcards should be reserved for promising youngsters. There are plenty of those on the list, and Darwin Blanch is particularly exciting, having long been spoken about as the next big thing in American men's tennis. These reciprocal arrangements feel the opposite of wild, giving players from the most powerful tennis nations even more of a leg-up, instead of platforming a player from a comparatively underfunded country or region in the tennis world.</p>

Grand Slam tournaments are Novak Djokovic's main goals at this stage of his career, and the former world No.1 is doing everything he can to make tennis history once again, becoming the oldest player ever to triumph in a Major (a record currently held by Ken Rosewall).

The Serbian legend – who has not lifted a title of this importance since the 2023 US Open – has had the ability to raise his level in the most important events of 2025 and has reached the semifinals at the Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon Championships, but has failed to go further on any of these three occasions.

His decision to skip the Canadian Open in Toronto and the Cincinnati Masters 1000 has left everyone quite perplexed, considering that the 38-year-old from Belgrade will show up in New York without having played any official match on the hard courts since the Miami Open final against Jakub Mensik in the spring.

Over the past month, the 24-time Grand Slam champion has been having fun with his family and friends between Croatia and Greece before returning to practice in Montenegro. In addition, Nole ended up at the center of attention because his family - which owns the Belgrade ATP 250 - decided to move the tournament from the Serbian capital to Athens (Greece), generating discontent among his compatriots who criticized him for this choice.

In a recent interview with 'Sportklub', Serbian veteran Dusan Lajovic was asked if his compatriot Djokovic still has a chance to win a Grand Slam: "The truth is that for most other players not playing any tournament before a Major would have a negative effect, but Novak is special.

The first three rounds of a Major are almost a warm-up for a player like him, if you consider his results and statistics. It will be interesting to see what happens in New York."

Nole will also play the mixed doubles tournament together with Olga Danilovic and test his current level.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Wimbledon commentator Andrew Castle has claimed his spat with pundit Andre Agassi was taken "out of context" this summer. Agassi, 55, grew increasingly exasperated as he tried to make an analytical point about Fritz's play. After Castle began talking about former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, Agassi lost patience and snapped: "People watching are watching for the tennis, not for this." However, Castle, 61, has now hit back by claiming the row was taken out of proportion. "We had a laugh, and they took it out of context," he told Betway. Former professional player Castle has covered tennis for the BBC since 2003, and explained how he felt media coverage of the exchange was inaccurate and led to further criticism. He added: "He (Agassi) was saying that tongue in cheek whilst smiling at me, and in the final, I didn't mention any celebrities at all. It's not the case, people hear a commentator's voice sometimes in their own head." Agassi wasn't assigned the final, but fans have called for him to be back on air at SW19 next year. Prior to Wimbledon, he joined TNT Sports as a studio analyst for their inaugural coverage of the French Open. Last month, he also made a popular appearance on Andy Roddick's Served Media YouTube show.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Emma Raducanu is one of tennis' most scrutinised figures, plagued by her own success. After all, having won the US Open back in 2021, she received a level of fame completely beyond her experience at the time. Even as recently as Wimbledon came a stark flashpoint, where Cam Norrie was asked a question during his press conference that took the tennis world aback. It was a brazen, borderline embarrassing line of questioning that deservedly drew scrutiny. As her US Open partnership with Carlos Alcaraz had been announced, speculation over the nature of their relationship was rife. However, Norrie was inexplicably dragged into this saga when asked: “We're trying to find out who is dating Emma Raducanu. It seems to be going round all the men's singles. I was just wondering if you are dating her, please?” Now, speaking to The Guardian, Raducanu admitted: “Yeah, and Cam's questions, too. It's always funny when people try to find something out, but I try not to read into it so much.” It is an unforgiving position, the one Raducanu finds herself in. Instantly, the world expected so much from her, and she simply did not have it to give. We are therefore starting to see consistent performances from the British number one, and in turn, consistent improvements in her ranking. It has now been 12 tournaments since she suffered a first-round exit. Raducanu has been scrutinised ever since her 2021 US Open triumph, almost exclusively undeservedly so. Now is the time to start focusing fairly on her career, as it has only really just properly begun after years of being stuck finding her feet under the enormous weight of pressure.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ten seeded players will be in action Aug. 15, all on Center Court, beginning with WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka will follow on Center Court in a top 10 matchup against Elena Rybakina. 2 Carlos Alcaraz puts his 14-match ATP 1000 winning streak against No. 9 seed Andrey Rublev to conclude the day session. Elena Rybakina just dominated the first set against Aryna Sabalenka, 6-1. 1 twice and kept a 100%-win rate on the first serve. Top-ranked WTA star and reigning Cincinnati Open champion Aryna Sabalenka is down 4-1 in the first set to No. Rybakina has won 100% of points on the first serve thus far and tallied three aces. Iga Swiatek is through to the Cincinnati Open semifinals for the third consecutive year after beating Anna Kalinskaya 6-3, 6-4. Swiatek will face either WTA No. 9 seed Elena Rybakina for a spot in the final. Swiatek leads 5-4 and will serve for the match. 3 Iga Swiatek has yet to lose a set at the Cincinnati Open and just took the opening set from Anna Kalinskaya, 6-3. Swiatek dished out a pair of aces and won 86% of points on the first serve. Each player held serve through three games on Center Court, though Anna Kalinskaya just needed a medical timeout before serving in the fourth game due to a calf injury. Kalinskaya got her calf wrapped and is back on the court to serve to Swiatek, who leads 2-1. 3, opened her quarterfinals match with a powerful ace against Anna Kalinskaya and Day 11 of the Cincinnati Open is underway. Swiatek is looking to reach the Cincinnati Open semifinals for the third consecutive year while Kalinskaya is bidding for her fifth career victory over a top 5 opponent. The night session features two Cincinnati quarterfinal rematches, beginning with a top 5 ATP showdown with No. 3 seed and former Cincinnati Open champion Alexander Zverev meets No. Zverev beat Shelton in last year's Cincinnati quarterfinals. The two have split four career meetings, though Gauff cruised in straight sets against Paolini in the 2023 Cincinnati Open quarterfinals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A lot has been made of the hectic ATP schedule recently, as players continue to campaign for change. Earlier this month, world number two Carlos Alcaraz said he wanted the ATP to remove events from the schedule, so players can have more time to rest and recover. Unfortunately, Alcaraz may have been right, as Russia's Karen Khachanov suffered a back injury recently, a problem that may well have been caused by the 29-year-old's quick turnaround from Toronto to Cincinnati. Khachanov and Alcaraz aren't the only players complaining, as it's clear to see that something needs to be done about the schedule. Weighing in with his thoughts, Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley has proposed some radical changes to the tennis schedule. Governed as one, you have the four Slams, another 11, 12 events, one team event, so you're maybe playing 16, 17 events. “Then you have a feed-in system, where there are several times in the year, like in golf, where you compete to get your card, you compete to get yourself in the top 32, top 16, 56, whatever that number is going to be, then the fan kind of understands where you're going, what it means. There's too much sideshow stuff going on right now, and we've got to deal with the core.” Tiley proceeded to outline what the ‘core' issues are, comparing how tennis and golf differ in that regard. There are probably too many people involved in making decisions,” he said. The four masters [majors] in golf, every golfer, it's absolutely history and tradition that they compete in the four masters. Similar to tennis, you have the four majors. They're only about 10% of the economic value. There's a lot of good work that's been done by the tours over the years, but probably not enough.” The 63-year-old believes player welfare has been ‘forgotten' over the years as the schedule became more packed, which is partly why he is suggesting reform. “What gets forgotten in the player voice is player welfare, what gets forgotten in the player voice is the time to regroup, there's not a proper off-season. “Yes, there are commercial reasons for doing this. We have seven governing bodies, each fighting for their own territory and their own position in the calendar. “The coordination amongst those governing bodies is not at the level that it needs to be to be successful from a player's perspective. “When a player goes into a longer Masters 1000 event and you're adding 21 days to the calendar, players want to play exhibitions in December, then they turn around a week later and start the year again, it's not right.” Tiley certainly has some big plans, but what would his new schedule look like? The South African didn't go into too much detail about how his ideal schedule would look, but with what he mentioned, it could be something like this. Only time will tell if Tiley's ideas are ever put into practice, but it will certainly be something to look out for in the future.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Goran Ivanisevic's opinion on how many Wimbledon titles Elena Rybakina should win has come to light following the pair's split. The day after Rybakina's announcement, it emerged that Vukov had been suspended by the WTA Tour amid an investigation into a breach of their code of conduct. Ivanisevic, who previously coached Novak Djokovic, confirmed he would not continue working with Rybakina after their collaboration in Melbourne. “After our trial period that finished with Australian Open, I wish Elena and her team best of luck moving forward,” the 2001 Wimbledon champion wrote on Instagram. Elena Rybakina's banned coach Stefano Vukov gets key verdict after appeal to WTA Goran Ivanisevic issues ‘best player in the world' verdict after ‘sad and strange story' of Elena Rybakina split Former world No 5 Anna Chakvetadze revealed what Ivanisevic recently said to her about Rybakina when she was interviewing the Croatian. “When we interviewed Goran Ivanisevic, he said off-camera, ‘I don't understand, she (Rybakina) has such an amazing game, she should be winning more tournaments on grass, not one Wimbledon but three to four at least,” Chakvetadze said on a podcast with fellow former Russian WTA star Dinara Safina. Rybakina won her only Grand Slam title to date at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, where she came from a set down to beat Ons Jabeur in the final. At Wimbledon this year, the 26-year-old suffered a surprise third round loss to Clara Tauson.

On court, he's been more willing to step in and finish points at the net, while off of it he's been focused on mental health.“Well, for sure I did huge improvements, but in the end it's daily work, daily routine, daily challenge,” Rublev said in Cincinnati earlier this week. “(You need) to be aware (of yourself), and it's very challenging because it's easy to do everything automatic.”👉 Read More: "Both of us deserved to win": Andrey Rublev outlasts Alexei Popyrin in Cincinnati nailbiterThere's been staffing turnover too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Players such as Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, and Iga Swiatek have all been drafted to play — but a scheduling wrinkle might force this revamped doubles tournament to be short of its star names. With the US Open set to begin on August 25, that means there will be minimal period of rest for any players who reach the Cincinnati final, are tasked to compete in the doubles tournament, and will have aspirations of going deep in the US Open. This includes both Sinner and Alcaraz, currently in the latter stages of that tournament, with Sinner already through to the semifinal and Alcaraz set to play his quarterfinal today. Sinner was set to be paired with American star Emma Navarro, while Alcaraz has a high-profile partnership with Emma Raducanu on the cards. The two best players in men's tennis could be set for a titanic clash on Monday night, which means they will have a sharp turnaround to reach New York for the doubles. With the singles tournament starting a week after, and both players favourites to lift that title as well, the doubles might well go on the backburner. The same could be true for Iga Swiatek, who is in the latter rounds of the Cincinnati event as well, and is set to play alongside Casper Ruud in New York next week. Swiatek's greatest rivals, Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff, will not be playing the doubles events: Sabalenka refused a different partner after he original teammate Grigor Dimitrov has to withdraw due to injury, while Gauff cited prior commitments in the lead up to her home slam as the reason for her own withdrawal. With Swiatek's opponents earning an extra week's rest ahead of the singles tournament, it wouldn't be a surprise to see her request some extra time off to prepare, and the same could be true for either or both of Sinner and Alcaraz. The much-hyped mixed doubles tournament has some uncertain days ahead.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One day after toppling Taylor Fritz, the French qualifier upset another Top 10 star, Holger Rune, to extend his dream run at the Cincinnati Open. The lefty earned a 6-2, 6-3 victory Thursday evening to reach his maiden ATP Masters 1000 semi-final and set a showdown with World No. Being here in the semi-finals of a Masters 1000, breaking into the Top 100 and even more with the win tonight — it's also a lot of money for me, so it's going to be very helpful for my career. Atmane punished the ball with his forehand, firing 14 winners from that wing, and showcased his all-court athleticism, gliding effortlessly across the court en route to a convincing one-hour, 13-minute win. 69 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, setting him up for a new career high. “I couldn't really sleep last night with the win against Taylor,” Atmane said. “I was just trying to be myself on court, trying to enjoy it as much as I can because I have nothing to lose, that's the advantage I have of being the underdog here coming from the qualies. I think this is going to give me a lot of confidence for the rest of the year and in my career in general.” By reaching the last four, Atmane has earned $332,160 in prize money. Atmane rarely allowed the seventh-seed Rune any chances on return, dropping just five points behind his first serve (28/33), according to Infosys ATP Stats. He created 11 break chances of his own, converting seven, to become the first Frenchman to reach the Cincinnati semi-finals since Richard Gasquet in 2019. Atmane is the eighth lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 semi-finalist in series history.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Italian ace, who hasn't competed since his Wimbledon appearance, has been battling abdominal problems throughout the entire season. Berrettini has faced a torturous period in recent years due to persistent injuries, causing his world ranking to nosedive dramatically. Dimitrov's absence also caused Aryna Sabalenka, his doubles partner, to withdraw from the mixed event. Brandon Holt will take Berrettini's spot in the main draw, while the American's wild-card position has been awarded to Eliot Spizzirri. Venus Williams also secured a wild card in the women's competition. Following that setback, Berrettini has battled through difficulties, with injuries completely disrupting his performance. He hasn't taken the court since Wimbledon, where Poland's Kamil Majchrzak knocked him out in the opening round across five grueling sets. "I have to see exactly what happened in the match before saying anything incorrect or what I am thinking right now," the 29-year-old commented after his SW19 departure. "Tennis has been very tough for me these past few months. I am very sorry for the people who helped me get to this tournament; they did everything possible. I need to take some time and think about my future. Berrettini was absent from Roland Garros earlier this year due to a right oblique injury, marking his seventh Grand Slam absence in the past four years. 59 globally, he's had a challenging season, with his best performance being in Miami where he made it to the quarterfinals. The U.S. Open singles matches kick off in New York on Aug. 24.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One is a battle between two explosive shot-makers who know each other's games well. With both matches featuring players in varying shades of form and confidence, the margins could be razor-thin. Who do you back to book their place in the final four? Ben Shelton's run has been powered by booming serves, quick-strike forehands, and the boost of a home crowd that has been firmly behind him. He's been unafraid to go after his shots, even when matches have tightened up, which has kept opponents under constant strain. Alexander Zverev, meanwhile, has cruised through his matches with a combination of precise serving and controlled aggression from the baseline. The two have already faced each other twice this season, both times producing long, physical battles with little to separate them. With the stakes higher and both playing well, another tense, momentum-shifting contest feels almost inevitable. Their sole hard court meeting came here at this stage last year, with Zverev narrowly winning in three sets. Andrey Rublev, by contrast, came into the tournament after a stretch of mixed results, but his ball-striking in Cincinnati has been much cleaner. He's been stepping into the court more, taking time away from opponents and serving well enough to protect his lead when ahead in sets. Alcaraz leads their head-to-head 3–2, with their latest meetings being decided by narrow margins, so this one could come down to who manages the big points better under pressure and I fully expect the Spaniard to do so.

Born in Minsk, when it was still part of the Soviet Union, Zvereva became a standout both on and off the court, speaking out against her government long before the fall of the Berlin Wall and standing up for what she believed was fair. On the court, Zvereva had a remarkable singles career—including a historic match against Steffi Graf—but it was in doubles where she truly cemented her legacy. She formed a legendary partnership with Gigi Fernandez and also won titles alongside other iconic players like Pam Shriver and Martina Hingis. Turning pro in 1988, she made an immediate impact by reaching the Roland Garros final that same year, where she faced one of the greatest players of all time, Steffi Graf. Despite that historic loss, Zvereva went on to build an impressive singles career that spanned from 1988 to 2002. She reached her career-high ranking in June 1989, climbing to No. Roland Garros champion and Davis Cup record-holder opens up about daily pain struggles Interestingly, she never won a clay-court tournament—the very surface where she first rose to prominence with her Roland Garros final appearance at just 17 years old. Alongside her singles success, Zvereva left an even bigger mark in doubles. 1 ranking in doubles and claimed a total of 20 Grand Slam titles: 18 in women's doubles—mostly alongside Gigi Fernandez, but also with Martina Hingis, Larisa Neiland, and Pam Shriver—and two in mixed doubles, one with Jim Pugh at the 1990 Australian Open and another with Rick Leach at the 1995 Australian Open.

In 1989, after losing the Hilton Head final to Steffi Graf, legendary journalist Bud Collins handed Zvereva her runner-up check. Her response was blunt: “This is just a piece of paper,” a pointed remark highlighting that she would never see that money. In 2010, Zvereva and longtime doubles partner Gigi Fernandez were inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame. I never imagined we could achieve something like this—I was just playing tennis”.
