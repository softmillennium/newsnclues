“The State's delay appears to be deliberate, weighing heavily against it,” the judge wrote in his ruling.

A Georgia judge has dismissed a state domestic terrorism charge against Cop City protestor Jamie Marsicano, but they and dozens of others still face racketeering charges. 

Superior Court Judge Gregory A. Adams ruled that the prosecution's delays violated Marsicano's due process rights and their right to a speedy trial. In March 2023, law enforcement officers arrested close to two dozen protesters, including Marsicano, at a Stop Cop City music festival. The festival was held in Weelaunee Forest, in the area where the City of Atlanta was building the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, known as Cop City, a police training base. 

Marsicano spent more than two weeks in jail and was then released on a $25,000 bond. All of the protesters were charged with domestic terrorism, but, more than two years later, none have been indicted. 

“Since Defendant's bond hearing, there has been no further progression or prosecution of this individual case other than bond modifications made at Defendant's request,” the judge wrote in his ruling. 

The attorney general “appears to have delayed this matter in order to gain tactical advantage over the defense,” Adams wrote.

“The State is solely responsible for the lack of an indictment in this matter, let alone trial,” the judge continued. “Furthermore, as explained above, the State's delay appears to be deliberate, weighing heavily against it.”

The Atlanta Press Collective reports that after Marsicano was charged with domestic terrorism, “they were banned from their law school campus at the University of North Carolina,” and “struggled to find work and housing.” Although Marsicano passed the North Carolina bar in 2025, the state's Board of Law Examiners told them “it would not consider Defendant's eligibility for bar license while this charge is pending,” the judge wrote. 

The judge found that, the “personal and professional consequences that Defendant has faced as result of this indefinite charge, without legal forum in which it may be timely challenged, are forms of actual prejudice to Defendant.”

The construction of Cop City drew protests for years — and a brutal crackdown from authorities, including the 2023 killing of activist Manuel Paez Terán, known as Tortuguita, during a raid on the forest. The Guardian revealed that a planning document for the raid called the protesters “domestic terrorists.” 

Despite overwhelming opposition, construction on the facility was completed and many protesters still face criminal charges. 

“My team's aggressive, participatory, and political defense got us this huge win,” Marsicano said in a statement. “No one is free until all of us are free, so we all need to keep supporting all Cop City defendants, especially the most vulnerable.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are heading to Alaska for pivotal talks that could unlock a long-sought peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.
    


            A peace deal, or a simple thawing of relations between Moscow and Washington, could also pave the way for what, until recently, seemed fanciful to most American companies – doing business with Russia.
    


            “I noticed (Putin's) bringing a lot of business people from Russia, and that's good,” Trump said aboard Air Force One on Friday. “I like that, because they want to do business, but they're not doing business until we get the war solved.”
    


            Anton Siluanov, Russia's finance minister, and Kirill Dmitriev, a senior economic negotiator and head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, are among those attending the talks with Putin.
    


            “If we make progress, I would discuss (business opportunities), because that's one of the things that they would like; they'd like to get a piece of what I built in terms of the economy,” the US president told reporters.
    


            But restarting business with a country that the West has largely turned into a diplomatic and economic pariah via sanctions will be no easy feat. Here's why:
    


            After Putin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Western companies left Russia en masse in protest.
    


            Since then, more than 1,000 global companies have either voluntarily exited or curtailed operations in Russia, according to a list compiled by the Yale School of Management.
    


            Household US names like Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Mastercard (MA) were among those who left, yet there have been some holdouts continuing to do some business in the country.
    


            The scale of the corporate exodus means there are simply fewer American companies in Russia to generate new business opportunities than before the war.
    


            Meanwhile, Chinese firms including automakers and tech companies have filled the gap left by their Western counterparts. Russians have also turned to copy-cat versions of American brands. For example, Stars Coffee emerged after Starbucks (SBUX) exited in 2022, adopting an audaciously familiar logo of a woman with a star above her head.
    


            So, if Western companies did return en masse, would Russian consumers welcome them?
    


            Western sanctions have focused on hitting Moscow where it hurts: limiting the revenues it can collect from its massive exports of oil and natural gas.
    


            Last year, those revenues accounted for 30% of Russia's federal government budget, according to an analysis by The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
    


            Oil and gas revenues remain “the single most important source of finance for the state coffers,” wrote Vitaly Yermakov, a senior research fellow at the Institute, in the February report.
    


            The European Union, once a top Kremlin customer, has banned all seaborne imports of Russian crude oil, and whittled Moscow's share of its natural gas imports delivered via pipeline to about 11% last year, from more than 40% in 2021. The bloc still imports Russian liquefied natural gas via sea tankers.
    


            But Russia has adapted, re-routing its barrels of oil to alternate customers, like India and China. According to Vortexa, an energy data firm, Russia now accounts for 36% of India's crude oil imports and is the country's top supplier.
    


            Trump has recently threatened to impose punishing tariffs on countries that continue to buy Moscow's barrels to discourage the trade and force Putin – by economic necessity – to the negotiating table. But New Delhi has been defiant, saying that Russian oil is necessary for the energy security of its 1.4 billion-strong population.
    


            One key sanction – a price cap on Russian oil imposed by the Group of Seven nations in 2022 – may be difficult for America to fully unwind without international support.
    


            The cap is designed to dent Moscow's revenues while still allowing its oil to flow to the global market. Companies located in the G7 are prevented from providing shipping, insurance and other services needed to export Russian seaborne oil unless it is priced below the threshold.
    


            Simply doing business in Russia has become harder since the war.
    


            Crucially, it has become more difficult for Russian banks to send and receive money from abroad. Shortly after the invasion, the United States, the EU, Britain and Canada jointly banned some Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging service — a high-security network connecting thousands of financial institutions around the world.
    


            Janis Kluge, a researcher at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, told CNN in February that the United States wouldn't be able to re-admit banned banks to the network without cooperation from the EU because SWIFT is based in Belgium.
    


            Corruption has also worsened from already high levels. In 2021, nonprofit organization Transparency International put Russia in 136th place, tied with Liberia, in its ranking of 180 countries and territories for their perceived levels of public sector corruption. (A lower ranking indicates a higher level of corruption.)
    


            But, by 2024, Russia had slid further down the Corruption Perceptions Index to 154th place, tied with Azerbaijan, Honduras and Lebanon.
    


            American businesses contemplating a return to, or reinvestment in, Russia may then ask themselves: Would it be worth it?

Donald Trump said he is “not going to be happy” unless a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine is agreed today. 

Speaking from Air Force One en route to Alaska for a summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, the US president said: “I want certain things. I want to see a ceasefire.

“This is not to do with Europe. Europe's not telling me what to do, but they're going to be involved in the process, obviously, as well Zelensky, but I want to see a ceasefire rapidly.

”I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today. Everyone said it can't be today, but I'm just saying I want the killing to stop.”

Mr Trump has also warned that he would “walk” if his meeting with Putin doesn't go well. 

“I think it's going to work out very well and if it doesn't, I'm going to head back home real fast,” he told Fox News on board Air Force One.

Mr Trump left Washington for Anchorage on Friday. His summit with Putin is scheduled to take place at 11.30am local time (8.30pm BST) at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

Putin has stopped over in the city of Magadan in Russia's far east, where he is expected to meet the local governor and visit an industrial facility.

Donald Trump has posted a video on Truth Social of his conversation with reporters on board Air Force One.

In the video, the US President called for a ceasefire but said that “nothing is set in stone” ahead of talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.

“This is not to do with Europe. Europe's not telling me what to do, but they're going to be involved in the process, obviously, as well Zelensky, but I want to see a ceasefire rapidly.

“I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today. Everyone said it can't be today, but I'm just saying I want the killing to stop.

“I'm in this to stop the killing. You know, we're not putting up any money. We're making money. They're buying our weapons, and we're sending them to Nato, and Nato is sending us big, beautiful checks.

“But that I don't care about. … But what I do care about is they lost last week 7,011 people, almost all soldiers; 36 people in a town which got hit by a missile.

“Over 7,000 soldiers. It's crazy.”

Donald Trump has said he does not know what would make his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin a success.

Asked what would make the meeting a success, he told reporters aboard Air Force One: “I can't tell you that. I don't know. There's nothing set in stone. I want certain things. I want a ceasefire.”

“I want to see a ceasefire rapidly... I'm not going to be happy if it's not today,” he said, adding that Europe and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would also be involved. “I want the killing to stop.”

General Alexus Grynkewich, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, is in Alaska to provide “military advice” to Donald Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, a source has told AP.

“Gen. Grynkewich, as the commander of both NATO and U.S. forces in Europe, is in Alaska to provide military advice to President Trump and Secretary Hegseth as President Trump tries to bring this war to a peaceful close,” a senior NATO military official told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Gen Grynkewich is a supporter of Ukraine and views Russia as a clear threat to European security. He has previously spoken of the need to get military aid into Kyiv quickly, including after President Trump said in July that NATO would be coordinating deliveries of U.S weapons.

His presence in Alaska is likely to be welcomed by European leaders who have spent recent days trying to convince President Trump to be robust with President Putin and not to do a deal over Kyiv's head.

Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin appear to be on friendly terms, but their representative lobby hacks are not so amenable.

The long security delay is causing frustration amongst some American journalists concerned their Russian counterparts will get a better seat at the summit.

One disgruntled journalist asks: “Can we make sure Americans are seated before the Russians?”

“This is America after all,” another adds.

American and Russia media have been kept apart on separate buses. Probably for good reason.

Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was still killing people on Friday and not showing that it wanted to end the war.

Ukraine's President said on the Telegram messenger: “On the day of the negotiations, they also kill people. And that says a lot.”

“The war continues. It continues precisely because there is no order, nor any indication that Moscow is preparing to end this war,” he added.

Russia has been racing to seize as much Ukrainian territory as possible ahead of peace talks with Donald Trump.

Russian sabotage and reconnaissance units punched through exposed defences in eastern Ukraine, slipping as far as six miles behind the front line in just 48 hours, according to battlefield reports.

Kyiv has since diverted special forces units to confront the insurgents on the ground in an attempt to prevent any more of Ukraine falling under Russia's control before the summit in Alaska.

Ukrainian forces have also evacuated Druzhkivka, a town near the front line in Donetsk, as intense fighting continues.

Hillary Clinton has posted on X: “If Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I'll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself.”

Mrs Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state and Mr Trump's 2016 Democratic opponent, added: “Trump should know by now that he's not meeting with a friend of the United States today. 

He is meeting with an adversary who wants America's destruction and the end of the entire western alliance.”

It has long been thought that Mr Trump is desperate for a Nobel Peace Prize and has a particular grudge against Barack Obama for being decorated only eight months into his first term.

It was an early start for the world's media hoping to get a view of today's summit.

Tired-eyed hacks, including your two Telegraph reporters Connor Stringer and Dominic Nicholls, began the journey to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, where Donald Trump will meet Vladimir Putin at 11am.

It's 11 degrees on the ground and cloudy overhead.

After being herded onto awaiting school buses, we were shuttled to a holding area on the camp, where we now wait to be screened by the secret service.

The intense security is a sign of the scale of this meeting and the nervousness amongst officials tasked with making proceedings run as smoothly as possible.

Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev said ahead of the meeting on Ukraine between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump that the mood is “combative”, Russia's RIA news agency reported.

The leaders will discuss the full spectrum of US-Russia relations, not only Ukraine, and their talks will be aimed at restoring ties, said Dmitriev, who is responsible for investments and economic cooperation

The Kremlin has confirmed the talks are expected to last a minimum of six to seven hours, and that Trump will meet Putin at the steps of the Russian president's aircraft upon his arrival in Alaska.

“You can expect that it will take up a minimum of six to seven hours,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia's Channel One state TV ahead of the summit, adding that Moscow anticipated a “productive” meeting.

Former US Vice President Mike Pence says he is “praying” for Donald Trump to “stand strong” during his meeting with Vladimir Putin. 

He added in a post on X: “A Ceasefire followed by a Just and Lasting Peace will only come through American Strength.”

Mr Pence served as Vice President from 2017 to 2021 during President Trump's first term but the pair fell out after the January 6 Capitol riots.

The unit aims to give the military leeway “so countries like America wouldn't stop supplying weapons,” one source said.

The Israeli military operates a special unit known as the “Legitimization Cell” that exists to create propaganda justifying the military's targeting of civilian infrastructure and civilians, particularly journalists, in order to ensure that Israel maintains its legitimacy on the world stage, an investigation finds.

According to a +972 Magazine and Local Call investigation published Thursday, the Legitimization Cell is a public relations unit that is tasked with finding a narrative to create cover for some of the most highly criticized actions by Israel's military.

“If the global media is talking about Israel killing innocent journalists, then immediately there's a push to find one journalist who might not be so innocent — as if that somehow makes killing the other 20 acceptable,” an Israeli intelligence source told journalist Yuval Abraham.

“The idea was to [allow the military to] operate without pressure, so countries like America wouldn't stop supplying weapons,” another Israeli source said.

Observers have seen this pattern play out numerous times, including in the recent assassination of famous Gaza journalist Anas Al-Sharif, who Israel killed along with five other Al Jazeera journalists earlier this week. Israel has long smeared Al-Sharif as a member of Hamas — claims that he always denied and for which Israel has not provided any evidence that can  be independently verified. 

Israel does this regularly. Last year, after killing Al Jazeera journalist Ismail al-Ghoul, Israeli officials claimed that he was given a Hamas military ranking in 2007 — when al-Ghoul was only 10 years old.

“[T]hree intelligence sources said the army treated the media as an extension of the battlefield, allowing it to declassify sensitive intelligence for public release,” said the investigation.

+972 and Local Call report that the Legitimization Cell is responsible for narratives like its denial of responsibility for the strike on Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City in October 2023 — a high-profile strike that killed hundreds of Palestinians. The bombing gained widespread media attention as one of Israel's first strikes on Gaza's health care system that it has now destroyed, with Al-Ahli put out of service by Israeli attacks. 

A flood of disinformation sourced from the military — much of which was later debunked by numerous investigations — followed the attack. The day after, the Legitimization Unit put out a recording of a phone call that it claimed was between two Hamas operatives saying that the hospital was struck by a misfired Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket. 

But this claim was roundly debunked by analysts and multiple news outlets. And the phone call, too, was fake — a Palestinian human rights activist told +972 and Local Call that it was actually a benign phone call between him and his civilian friend that had been intercepted by the military. Israel keeps a huge database of Palestinians' phone calls as part of its vast surveillance network.

In response to the report, the Israeli military outright admitted that Israeli military intelligence maintains “research teams” that have the goal of “discredit[ing]” journalists reporting from Gaza who are supposedly “Hamas members.”

But, despite supposedly being responsible for finding journalists' ties to Hamas, the “research teams do not play a role in the selection of individual targets to be attacked,” the report finds — meaning that they are looking for justification after the fact.

“There was this phrase, ‘That's good for legitimacy,'” one source told +972 and Local Call. “The goal was simply to find as much material as possible to serve hasbara efforts.”

Sources recalled a case where the Legitimization Unit falsely represented a journalist as a member of Hamas's military wing, saying that the propaganda research cell was “eager” and “excited” about the narrative. “In the end, they realized he really was a journalist,” and he wasn't targeted, one source claimed.

Israel has long had a robust propaganda operation — so robust, in fact, that Israel has exported some of its intelligence and surveillance technologies. Members of one of its well-known intelligence units, Unit 8200, are trained in Israel but go on to work across numerous sectors, including as journalists in the U.S. at outlets key to shaping American opinion.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

A new report found higher levels of fine particulate matter in areas near cattle and hog farms across the US.

New research out this week underscores what many environmental justice advocates in the U.S. have long argued: Animal feeding operations — another term for factory farming — pollute the air, and these environmental impacts are disproportionately felt by nearby communities, who are often people of color.

The report, published Tuesday and led by researchers at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the University of Michigan, maps cattle and hog farms across the United States at the county level — and finds that these animal feeding operations tend to be sited in communities with higher percentages of Latino residents and uninsured residents. Fine particulate matter — or PM2.5 — levels in census tracts with cattle operations are 28 percent higher than similar census tracts without, according to the report. In census tracts with hog farms, PM2.5 levels were found to be 11 percent higher than those without. 

In their report, the authors caution that the air pollution burden in these areas could lead to more emergency room visits and hospitalizations — which itself poses significant financial problems for residents lacking adequate health insurance coverage. Environmental experts say that lack of governmental oversight into industrial animal agriculture, combined with rising temperatures caused by climate change, put these vulnerable communities at risk of various health problems.

It's the study authors' hope that their data could aid campaigns to better regulate cattle and hog production and lessen their environmental impact, especially at the local level. The study found that roughly a quarter of animal feeding operations, or AFOs, are located in just 30 counties across the U.S. 

“That's a huge spatial concentration,” said Joshua Newell, a professor of environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan and one of the study's authors. Knowing where cattle and hog operations are clustered “allows us to really, if we're concerned about AFOs, develop targeted policies” aimed at the county level, said Newell.

The environmental impacts of livestock production have been well-documented. Not only does raising cattle, for example, require a lot of water, but the animal waste produced by farmed animals can also contaminate nearby waterways. Air pollution on AFOs stems from livestock kicking up dust, as well as how manure is stored; in the case of cattle and hogs, it's open-air lagoons. 

While research has clearly illuminated the connection between animal agriculture and environmental degradation, the federal government has done little to regulate this part of the U.S. food system. Just this week, the Environmental Protection Agency ruled that animal farms do not have to disclose toxic air emissions. 

Still, researchers interested in studying the public health impacts of AFOs — also sometimes called concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs — face hurdles: To start, nationwide data on these facilities is scarce. As part of their research, the study authors pulled state and regional data on AFOs from the EPA. But they found that these sources were incomplete and often outdated, said Newell. 

In order to fill in these gaps, the researchers used EPA data as well as two other existing datasets on animal agriculture. Stitching together the three datasets, they identified AFOs and removed duplicates, and then verified their results with high-resolution satellite imagery from Google Earth. Then, using U.S. Department of Agriculture reports on cattle and hog production, they also zoomed in on other meat-producing regions and added in AFOs that were left out of the initial three datasets. 

With that map in hand, the team compared the dispersal of AFOs across the country to nationwide PM2.5 levels. They also attempted to capture the makeup of communities nearby, looking at the percentage of Latino residents, uninsured residents, and residents without a high school diploma. 

The resulting map is a telling, if incomplete, picture of how the heavily industrialized food system in the U.S. impacts vulnerable communities. The new data has limitations: For example, the team did not include poultry farms in their research. They also did not look into the relationship between AFOs and Latinos — such as whether these residents choose to live close to these facilities in order  to pursue jobs in animal agriculture, or whether these communities were already in place when industry moved in. Newell said he hopes their work will be a jumping off point for additional research that benefits this crucial environmental justice question.

A truly comprehensive, nationwide look at where meat producers operate in the U.S. is hard to come by, said Valerie Baron, a national policy director and senior attorney at the National Resource Defense Council. That's partly because of “a systemic effort by the industry to escape transparency and liability,” she continued.

“These facilities emit massive amounts of really, really noxious stuff,” said Baron. Air pollution on AFOs stems from the way manure is stored; on cattle and hog operations, which produce tremendous amounts of manure, the animal waste is kept in large anaerobic lagoons. These can be as large as football fields, says Baron, and emit ammonia and hydrogen sulfide as the manure decomposes. These compounds in and of themselves are dangerous — exposure to hydrogen sulfide can be fatal and even small amounts of the gas can lead to myriad health problems — but they can also mix together in the air and form PM2.5. 

Academic and crowd-sourced efforts to document the animal agriculture industry's impact on both the environment and the people who work at or live next door to such facilities are useful in building public awareness of the harms of meat production. “It is incredibly important that the public have access to basic information about dangerous facilities, including industrial animal agriculture,” said Baron. But it doesn't automatically translate into action. Data is “cold comfort to someone whose child has asthma or someone who's struggling to breathe living next door to one.”

For Rania Masri, the co-director of the North Carolina Environmental Justice Network, the University of Michigan study felt like something her team could use as part of their advocacy campaigns. But she wasn't surprised by the findings, particularly with the prevalence of hog farms in North Carolina. While national data on AFOs may be hard to come by, research on the impact of hog farming on Black and brown residents in North Carolina is widely available; its roots go back to slavery.

“I would argue, in North Carolina and across the country, we have enough research. We really do,” said Masri. “We have enough research to prove that this is systemic. This is by design. This is targeted in Black and brown communities.”

Of the 10 counties with the highest number of hog farms, four — including the two top — are in North Carolina. “That is quite significant,” said Masri. She sees this as an opportunity for environmental justice advocates to push for specific, county-level solutions that can address community members' needs. 

Baron worries that, as global temperatures rise, the communities already dealing with poor air quality will be hit hard by extreme heat. In a state like California with a lot of animal agriculture, PM2.5 can be a precursor to smog. “The impact of climate change in areas where water is more scarce, plus extreme heat, really put extra stress on the air quality in that area,” said Baron. Workers in these industries may have a harder time dealing with respiratory problems caused by air pollution if they're also dealing with a heat wave, for example. “I'm very concerned about the impact that increased heat will have,” she added.

Newell says that even before this report came out, community organizations and Indigenous groups he was in touch with were eager to see their data. Making it open-source and public was always part of the goal of this research. Whether or not it helps change the power dynamic in the animal agriculture industry is another question. “I think that is powerful, you know,” said Masri. But in North Carolina, “we do have a Republican-majority general assembly. And the agricultural industry has bipartisan clout.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

The lawsuit also sought to block Trump's DEA administrator from becoming the police force's “interim commissioner.”

Washington, DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb on Friday filed a lawsuit to block United States Attorney General Pam Bondi from taking over the US capital city's police department.

The lawsuit accused the Trump administration of violating the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, a 1973 law that delegated certain powers over the city once held by the federal government to local government officials.

Schwalb argued in the lawsuit that the Home Rule Act gives the president of the United States a very limited set of powers over the governance of the city's police force, as it states that the president may commandeer the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) if he “determines that special conditions of an emergency nature exist” that require the MPD to help fulfill “federal purposes.”

Schwalb further noted that the timeframe for this authority is extremely limited. In all, the president can take command of MPD for just 48 hours unless he sends proper notice to the US Congress, after which he will have command over it for a maximum of 30 days.

“For the president to obtain MPD's services for longer than 30 days — even in the face of an ongoing emergency — Congress must pass a joint resolution permitting the extension,” Schwalb argued.

The DC attorney general then poked holes in Trump's claims that a federal takeover of MPD was necessary due to a crime emergency.

“The president did not identify any new or unusual exigency that justified the invocation of [emergency powers],” Schwalb alleged. “Instead, he claimed that violent crime in the district is ‘increasing,' when, in fact, it has fallen 26% since 2024. The president also did not limit the scope of his order to specific ‘federal purposes,' instead directing the mayor to provide any services the attorney general deemed necessary to ‘maintain law and order in the Nation's seat of Government.'”

Schwalb also claimed that the Trump administration flatly broke the law when it appointed Terrance Cole, the current administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to serve as MPD's “interim commissioner.” He said that this action would greatly harm MPD's ability to enforce the law and maintain public safety.

“Imposing a new command structure ‘effective immediately' will wreak operational havoc within MPD,” he wrote. “The new command structure will create confusion for MPD personnel, who are required under district law to respect and obey the chief of police as the head and chief of the police force.”

He emphasized that “this will also inevitably lead to delays and confusion as MPD personnel… are forced to run their directives by an ‘Emergency Commissioner' who is unfamiliar with MPD procedures and the local communities MPD serves,” before warning that “there is no greater risk to public safety in a large, professional police force like MPD than to not know who is in command.”

Schwalb concluded his complaint by asking the court to vacate Bondi's order of the federal takeover of MPD, and also to permanently block DEA Administrator Cole from assuming “any position of command” within the department.

In a statement separate from the lawsuit itself, Schwalb charged that “the administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call DC home” and “this is the gravest threat to home rule that the district has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it.”

“By declaring a hostile takeover of MPD,” said Schwalb, “the administration is abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the district's right to self-governance and putting the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk.”

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

            It stands to reason that a 95 million-year-old tooth shipped to my home would have a rich past. But what ensued after I bought it online for about $100 revealed how, for such relics and those who covet them, the present is in some ways much more complicated.
    


            I always wanted to own a fossil, and once the algorithm picked up on that desire, ads flooded my Instagram feed. It then became impossible to resist the thrill of purchasing a piece of one of the largest predators that ever existed: Spinosaurus, a semiaquatic meat-eater that could reach almost 60 feet (about 18 meters) in length — longer and heavier than Tyrannosaurus rex.
    


            When the package arrived, in a pretty glass dome and with a preprinted certificate of authenticity that stated it came from North Africa, the long pointy tooth looked the part to my untrained eyes: yellowish brown, with varying textures and a stonelike appearance. But some obvious cracks that suggested the specimen had perhaps been patched together from multiple fragments left me wondering: Was it real?
    


Stone tool discovery could offer new clue in mystery of ancient ‘hobbit' humans



            To find out, I took it to London's Natural History Museum, where Susannah Maidment, a senior researcher and fossil expert, examined it.
    


            “Yeah, it's a fossil, for sure,” she said. “It's got a rounded cross section with ridges down the front and back, so it's probably a Spinosaurus tooth.”
    


            To my relief, I hadn't been duped. But it turns out my fossil wasn't as rare as I thought.
    


            “This is almost certainly from Morocco, because almost all Spinosaurus fossils that we know of are from the Kem Kem formation of Morocco, and they're intensively excavated there,” Maidment added, referring to a fossil bed in southeastern Morocco that has yielded an abundance of predatory dinosaur specimens. “The thing about teeth is that dinosaurs and other reptiles shed them continuously, so one dinosaur will have many, many teeth over its lifetime. And so they're very common.”
    


            As a result, according to Maidment, I probably paid too much for it. However, her next observation quickly replaced that concern with another: “This … has almost certainly been illegally exported and illegally excavated,” she said.
    


            “This specimen — you have it illegally.”
    


            Last year, a Stegosaurus skeleton nicknamed “Apex,” measuring nearly 27 feet long (about 8 meters), sold for $44.6 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York City, becoming the most valuable fossil ever sold at auction.
    


Hedge fund manager Ken Griffin reportedly scooped up the specimen, which was discovered in 2022 on private land in Colorado, and it is currently on loan at New York's American Museum of Natural History.
    


            The sale was just one in a series of recent high-profile auctions that sent near-complete dinosaur skeletons into private ownership. But the trend can be traced back to the sale of Sue, one of the most complete and largest T. rex fossils ever found. It was unearthed in 1990 and sold at auction in 1997 for $8.36 million after a long legal battle over its ownership.
    


            Even though Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History purchased Sue and still has it on display, the pooling together of private funds led to its acquisition and kick-started the era of big-ticket fossil auctions. Seventy-one T. rex specimens are now in private hands, versus 61 held by public trusts, according to a recent study.
    


Dinosaur fossil found underneath a Denver museum's parking lot



            Peter Lovisek, a fossil broker and curator at Fossil Realm, a gallery in Ottawa, said a key turning point for the market — “where these pieces began to be seen as cultural icons, artworks, investment assets” — was the auction of a 40-foot-long T. rex named “Stan,” which sold for $31.8 million in 2020.
    


            The media frenzy surrounding Stan, which is part of a planned exhibition at the upcoming Natural History Museum Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, brought fossils into the mainstream, Lovisek added.
    


            “Since then, Instagram has become a hub for the fossil industry,” he said. “A major part of our strategy is to focus on Instagram storytelling, and Instagram is connecting curators, dealers, diggers.”
    


            CNN reached out to Instagram for comment but has not received a response.
    


            You are now spoiled for choice if you want to buy fossils online. Most online shops offer a range of price points starting at a few dollars and going up into the low thousands, whereas Lovisek said he takes a more upmarket approach, from a few thousand dollars to the six-figure range.
    


            And things are just getting started, according to Salomon Aaron, director of David Aaron, a London gallery dealing in ancient art and fossils. “I think the dinosaur trade is actually still incredibly undervalued,” Aaron said. “Relative to the art market, we are very much at the beginning, at the start of the dinosaur fossil trade.”
    


            On the other hand, it's been over 200 years since the first dinosaur fossil was given a name, Megalosaurus, in 1824. Specimens have now been found on every continent, and more than 50 countries have contributed named species to science, with the United States, China, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Mongolia, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom topping the rankings.
    


Puzzling fossils unearthed in China may rewrite the human story



            One enduring misconception, perhaps fueled by the multimillion-dollar auctions, is that fossils are rare. “Across the world, people assume that everything's going to be unmanageably expensive, but that's not the case,” said Matt Dale, who owns Mr Wood's Fossils, a fossil shop in Edinburgh, Scotland, which also sells online. His cheapest dinosaur fossils are priced under 10 pounds (about $13.50), and include bone fragments, teeth and eggshells.
    


            “I get a lot of questions that I hear again and again. One, where do you get all this stuff? Two, is it real? And three, why is it so cheap?” Dale said. “The bulk of the stuff in my shop comes from unusually rich sites, where there's an awful lot of material, which makes it much more practical and feasible to collect it and sell it on a commercial basis. There's an artificial impression of how rare fossils are, and that's just — that's not the case for some things.”
    


            Most fossil shops in the world will have some of these affordable items, Dale said, including ammonites, or shelled mollusks, from Madagascar; fish from Wyoming's Green River Formation; shark teeth from South Carolina and Florida; and trilobites from the Erfoud area in Morocco's northern Kem Kem region — the same place from where my Spinosaurus tooth likely comes.
    


            After telling me that she thought my fossil was illegal, Maidment explained that “the Moroccan fossil law states that you must have a permit for excavation and that you must have a permit for export, and you can only get a permit for export if you have an excavation license. Unless your seller is able to show you both, they have certainly excavated it illegally and exported it illegally.”
    


            The online shop I bought the Spinosaurus tooth from is based in the UK and has a page on its website that asserts its commitment to ethical sourcing of artifacts. The company didn't respond to requests for an interview or comment on the origin of my fossil. Other online retailers offering similar merchandise that I contacted also didn't respond to my interview requests.
    


            However, the shop could have legally purchased the fossils from a third party, or at one of many fossil trade shows such as Arizona's Tucson Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase. Held annually in January and February, the Arizona event bills itself as the largest gem and mineral show in the world. CNN reached out to the Tucson Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase for comment but has not received a response.
    


            Morocco is not the only country imposing restrictions on fossil exports with the goal of preserving its cultural heritage. Export bans are also in place in Argentina, Brazil, China and Mongolia.
    


            “All around the world, different countries have different laws. In the UK and the US, if you find something on your land, you can do whatever you want with it,” while in some parts of South America, for example, the person who discovers an artifact has a weaker claim, Maidment said.
    


            Brazilian fossils in particular, according to a law established in 1942, don't belong to the finder, noted Taissa Rodrigues, a professor of paleontology at the Federal University of Espirito Santo in Brazil. “It belongs to the country,” Rodrigues said. “That means, if you find a fossil, you're not its owner, so that's why you're not allowed to sell it, because it's not up for you to decide.”
    


            But Morocco seems to fall into a sort of legal gray area when it comes to fossil exports, said Maidment and David Martill, emeritus professor from the UK's University of Portsmouth. Despite laws in place intended to regulate export of these artifacts, almost all fossils excavated in Morocco end up on the commercial market, according to Martill. A small portion fuel the local souvenir market, and the rest go to fossil dealers who sell them to shops and online retailers throughout the world, he said.
    


            “I am very familiar with the fossil black market in Morocco, because I work there, and we have huge problems at our (excavation) sites, where commercial fossil dealers who are black market smugglers come and excavate illegally from our sites, probably from the specimens that we're digging up,” Maidment said, speaking of those who operated without a proper permit. “Sometimes we find the fossils, and then they take them, and then they sell them on European websites for up to 30,000 euros. So it's a huge, huge problem.”
    


            Morocco's Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, which regulates “the fields of geology, minerals, hydrocarbons and energies,” has not responded to CNN's requests for comment.
    


            The full extent of the questionable movement of fossils across borders is hard to pin down, but it has included important specimens such as Ubirajara jubatus, a feathered dinosaur species first described in a now-retracted 2020 paper from a one-of-a-kind skeleton that had allegedly been illegally exported to Germany from Brazil.
    


            Germany's State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe returned the rare remains to Brazil in 2023 among a wave of similar high-profile repatriations, including a 56 million-year-old crocodile fossil that Morocco recovered from the United States. A few years earlier, in 2015, actor Nicolas Cage returned a T. rex skull he bought for $276,000 at auction in 2007 to the Mongolian government.
    


            It's more difficult for smaller, less expensive fossils that have been illegally exported to make it back to their country of origin, although in 2022 French customs returned nearly 1,000 fossils from the Araripe Basin in Brazil that had been stolen  to be sold online.
    


            Neither Martill nor John Nudds, an honorary lecturer in the department of Earth and environmental sciences at the UK's University of Manchester, would go as far as calling my fossil illegal.
    


            “There's a bit of a gray area,” Martill said. “I can't technically go there and dig fossils without the permission of the ministry in Rabat.” But he added that locals “can dig fossils, they can cut fossils, they can polish fossils, and tourists can buy the fossils. And if you go to any fossil fair, you'll find Moroccan fossils for sale, and that will include Spinosaurus teeth.”
    


            Nudds said he knows of at least one reputable wholesaler based outside Morocco that sells “an awful lot” of Spinosaurus teeth exactly like mine. “That's why I'm pretty confident that these are OK to come out of Morocco,” he said.
    


            Part of the reason why fossils may occupy a legal gray area, Nudds added, is some ambiguous wording in UNESCO's 1970 Convention, which was designed to prevent the illegal export of items of cultural importance across many categories. The category that includes fossils is described as “Rare collections and specimens of fauna, flora, minerals and anatomy, and objects of palaeontological interest.”
    


            According to Nudds, the wording makes it unclear whether the objects of paleontological interest are in their own category, which would include all fossils, or if they are part of the “rare collections,” which would not.
    


            But when it comes to my tooth, he said he believes that unless the shop I bought it from has smuggled the item out of Morocco, then it is selling it legally, even if it bought it from a smuggler. “There may be an ethical issue,” Nudds said, “and there may be a moral or even a scientific issue, but not a legal issue.”
    


            Elmahdi Lassale, CEO of M2 Rocks & Minerals, a Moroccan wholesaler and exporter of minerals and fossils that sells directly to retailers in the US, UK and Europe, confirmed that under Moroccan law, since 2020, fossils are classified as geological heritage. Excavating and exporting them isn't strictly off-limits, according to Lassale, but to do so commercially, a license must be obtained from the Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development as well as a validated customs certificate.
    


            In practice, it means that before each export, Lassale sends the ministry a list of the individual items he wants to sell. “Normally we just send the descriptions and the names of the items,” he added, “but sometimes they ask to send a real specimen, to see it in person.”
    


            When I asked if he deals in Spinosaurus teeth, he said he doesn't, because it's unlikely that the ministry would approve their export. “If we talk about dinosaur bones or teeth, it's (almost) impossible to export from Morocco (even) with a license,” Lassale said.
    


            Among the items he gets permission to export are trilobites, ammonites, shark teeth, and Mosasaur and Plesiosaur teeth and vertebrae. However, he said he is aware that other fossils do get out of the country via “illegal suppliers” as well as “through informal shipments via tourist luggage and small couriers, creating a mixed online market of documented and undocumented specimens abroad.”
    


            He estimated the total trade of fossils in Morocco to be worth $30 million to $40 million annually, including official and unofficial exports, and that about 80% of fossils are exported. In a large trade show such as the one in Tucson, he said, there will be on average around 200 Moroccan fossil dealers.
    


            Martill and Nudds viewed my fossil during separate video calls.
    


            “You've got a genuine fossil, but I think it's a repair,” Martill said. “There's a possibility that the tip belongs to a different specimen. You can see some glue — they often find broken examples, and they will just do sympathetic repairs.”
    


            However, the human cost of obtaining even an imperfect specimen can be serious, he said. “Let me tell you now that the man who dug that out of the ground risked not only his life but his lungs as well,” Martill said, adding that he has gone into fossil mines in Morocco and spent time with miners.
    


            The fossil trade in Morocco is the main source of income for more than 50,000 people, including diggers, miners, artisans, middlemen and wholesalers who go on to export the fossils, according to a 2018 study.
    


            Martill said he believed my tooth came from Hassi el Begaa, a village in the Kem Kem region.
    


            “This is a place where the mines go in from the side of the hill,” Martill said. “They go in horizontally, for maybe 50 to 100 meters (164 to 328 feet). They then turn to the left or the right, and that's when you lose any hint of sunlight. You're well underground, and the place is incredibly dusty. The miners are often working without masks. They have little head torches, and they dig with tiny crowbars fashioned out of the steel that you use to reinforce concrete. They're not sophisticated tools.
    


            “They do this all day long and then shovel out all of the sand in a wheelbarrow, tip it down the side of the hill and look for the fossils. They're working extremely hard — they're hand-digging a mine,” Martill added. Taking all that into account, he said, what I paid for my tooth fossil “is probably pretty cheap.”
    


            Lassale agreed the fossil diggers in Morocco often work in challenging conditions, including temperatures as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), and with minimal protective equipment, while earning about 120 to 180 Moroccan dirhams (about $13 to $20) daily. He added that his company only partners with artisans and cooperatives that provide safety measures such as shade tents, water and protective goggles to workers, though he said such practices are not common industrywide.
    


            “It's very easy to make a lot of money with this, but it's not easy to dig out minerals or fossils — small artisans, they put their health at risk” to support their families, Lassale said.
    


            He noted that mines and shafts dug to reach fossil deposits have been known to collapse sometimes, causing fatalities. “Unfortunately, we hear about that every year — not just fossil but also mineral mines,” he said.
    


            Would I be in trouble if my fossil tooth turned out to be illegal? Experts told me I likely wouldn't, even if the specimen had been illegally exported — the responsibility would likely be on the wholesaler.
    


            But things could be different for fossils from  countries that have strong restrictions on fossil exports. That's why experts recommend prospective buyers avoid anything advertised from countries such as Brazil, Argentina, China or Mongolia.
    


            “I guess the best advice would be to only buy something if you can see it and hold it in your hand,” Nudds said. “If you're going to buy online, then maybe avoid those countries which do ban exports, because that's where you're more likely to find forgeries.”
    


            Fakes don't seem to be widespread, but they're more common on the cheaper end of the market, according to Lovisek of the Fossil Realms gallery in Canada. “There's so much scrutiny with the higher end, that the real problem is not forgery, but misrepresentation — claiming there's less restoration than there is, or claiming it's more real bone than there is,” he said.
    


            Other than such deceptions or distortions, when it comes to how to purchase a fossil properly, experts offered guidance that would apply to buying pretty much anything online: Do your research, look for a reputable seller, and ask for paperwork or proof that the item is sold legally and ethically.
    


            Perhaps the more important question is should you buy a fossil at all?
    


            I still look at the Spinosaurus tooth on my bookshelf and marvel that it's the oldest thing in my house by at least 94 million years.
    


            But given the complexities around fossils' cultural status and scientific relevance, the dangerous working conditions in some excavation areas, and the fact that many countries are now recovering fossils exported illegally, it's no surprise that the answer to that question has stirred disagreement, even within my small cohort of paleontologists.
    


The ‘Great Dying' wiped out 90% of life, then came 5 million years of lethal heat. New fossils explain why



            “Do not buy your fossils online,” said Maidment of London's Natural History Museum. “Unless you can absolutely verify that they are being sold legally, and that they're in your country legally, it's best to just not to do it at all. My view of fossils — it's something that belongs to all of us. It's part of our heritage. It shouldn't be something that one person owns.”
    


            Martill has a different view, particularly for smaller, less rare specimens that don't hold as much value for researchers. “There are billions of fossils in the ground. There's no point in them staying in the ground. And scientists like me, there's only so much that you can do with one isolated dinosaur tooth. It's a common fossil; it's scientifically uninteresting,” he said.
    


            “I think it's great that you can have a fossil. You got something there which is 90 to 100 million years old,” Martill added. “There is a possibility that you could buy a tooth and actually own a piece of the fantastic history of the life on Earth.”

            The Pentagon clarified on Thursday that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth thinks women should have the right to vote, despite his sharing of CNN reporting which featured religious leaders he supports saying they would back the repealing of the 19th Amendment.
    


            “Of course, the secretary thinks that women should have the right to vote,” Pentagon Press Secretary Kingsley Wilson told reporters on Thursday.
    


            Hegseth reposted video of a CNN segment with Douglas Wilson, a self-described Christian nationalist pastor, who supports repealing the 19th Amendment, which gives women the right to vote. Wilson's fellow pastors told CNN's Pamela Brown they also support the idea, saying votes should be made as households and that the men of the household would be the ones actually casting the vote.
    


            “I would support that,” Jared Longshore, executive pastor of Christ Church, told CNN of repealing the 19th Amendment. “And I'd support it on the basis that the atomization that comes from our current system is not good for humans.”
    


            Hegseth shared the video on social media with the message, “All of Christ for All of Life.”
    


            “The secretary is a proud member of a church that is affiliated with the congregation of reformed evangelical churches, which was founded by Pastor Doug Wilson,” Kingsley Wilson told reporters on Thursday. “The secretary very much appreciates many of Mr. Wilson's writings and teachings.”
    


            Hegseth — a member of a church in Tennessee which is part of Wilson's Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches — is the most high-profile of Wilson's followers in the Trump administration. Among the assertions in the governing documents for the CREC is that is “neither lawful nor honorable for women to be mustered for combat service,” and that is “the duty of men—not women—to protect their homelands and nations.”
    


            While Hegseth has made multiple comments in the past saying women should not serve in combat roles in the military, he has since backtracked on those claims, saying he respects all women who serve and is primarily concerned with standards.
    


            Hegseth has also begun holding Christian prayer services at the Pentagon, the first of which featured his pastor from Tennessee from the Pilgrim Hill Reformed Fellowship, Brooks Potteiger.
    


            In his opening prayer at the service, Potteiger thanked God for President Donald Trump and other leaders who have been “sovereignly appointed,” and “the way that you have used him to bring stability and moral clarity to our lands.”
    


            Pastor Douglas Wilson told CNN it was “very encouraging” to see Hegseth own “what he believes,” including purging diversity, equity and inclusion programs and so-called “woke” policies from the Defense Department.
    


            “It's not organizationally tied to us, but it's the kind of thing we love to see,” he told CNN of Hegseth's prayer services.
    


            Kingsley Wilson, the Pentagon press secretary, declined to say on Thursday what other specific ideas in the video — which included Douglas Wilson's desire to make the United States “a Christian nation,” his support for making gay sex a crime, and his doubling down on claims that there was “genuine affection” between slaves and their owners — Hegseth did or did not support.
    


            “He (Hegseth) appreciates many of (Wilson's) writings and teachings. I'm not going to litigate every single aspect of what he may or may not believe in a certain video,” Wilson told reporters.

Donald Trump has greeted Vladimir Putin with a warm handshake and a smile as the two leaders begin peace negotiations in Alaska.

The US President landed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage ahead of Putin and posed for photos on the runway.

The leaders walked down their respective red carpets and Mr Trump clapped as the Russian president approached, before greeting him with a handshake.

The two leaders then got into Trump's presidential car, known as The Beast, together and smiled for the cameras.

Mr Trump has warned that he would “walk” if the meeting doesn't go well and that he will not be happy if a ceasefire is not agreed today.

He said of Putin: “He is a smart guy, been doing it for a long time, but so have I... We get along, there's a good respect level on both sides.”

The first picture showing Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin sitting down together has emerged.

Margo Martin, Special Assistant to the US President and Communications Advisor, posted a photo on X showing the two leaders sitting on wooden chairs surrounded by their advisors.

Vladimir Putin wasn't just given the red carpet treatment as he stepped out of his plane in Alaska - capped off by applause and a warm handshake from Donald Trump.

The US Air Force also performed a flyover in honour of the meeting between the two leaders, as the Russian president took his first steps on US soil in a decade.

In the centre of the five aircraft flying in formation was a B-2 stealth bomber - the aircraft that was used to drop “bunker-busting bombs” on Iranian nuclear sites in June in a stunning display of American military might.

The noise of the flyover appeared to drown out the shouted questions from reporters as Mr Trump and Putin posed for cameras together on a stage. The Russian leader could be seen pointing at his ear.

A media briefing between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin descended into chaos as the two leaders were seen for the first time since their joint car ride.

The two leaders, flanked by the American and Russian delegations, stayed largely silent as they found themselves facing a media scrum full of shouting reporters ahead of talks which will take place behind closed doors..

One reporter could be heard shouting: “Mr Putin, will you commit to a ceasefire?” and “Mr Putin, will you commit to not killing any more civilians?”

The Russian president appeared to say something but his voice could not be heard amid the chaos.

Seated alongside Mr Trump was Steve Witkoff, the US' Middle East envoy who has previously negotiated with Putin, and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. Both men will join talks with Putin and the Russian delegation.

The press was subsequently ushered out after one minute.

In scenes of absolute chaos, a voice could be heard repeatedly saying “thank you press, thank you press” before another man shouted: “Everybody get out of the room.”

US media was quick to criticise Donald Trump after the US president applauded and shook hands with Vladimir Putin as they met in Alaska.

Contributors on CNN noted the Russian leader is wanted for war crimes and warned the moment would legitimise Putin in the eyes of the world, while proving a propaganda coup for Kremlin media outlets.

Several Russian news agencies noted the warm reception from the US president as the two leaders met at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage ahead of peace negotiations.

“Trump greeted Putin with applause, then the leaders shook hands on the airfield,” Tass reported

Donald Trump has just departed Air Force One, walking down the boarding stairs onto the tarmac of Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska.

Just a few seconds later, Vladimir Putin also departed from his plane in a co-ordinated move.

The pair walked down their respective red carpets and Mr Trump clapped as the Russian President approached before greeting him with a handshake.

They then walked side-by-side in conversation before both entered into Trump's presidential armoured car, known as ‘The Beast', where they sat together in the back seat.

Vladimir Putin and his entourage have landed in Alaska in the last few moments.

He will be joined by foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and aide Yuri Ushakov at a three-on-three meeting with Donald Trump and his team, according to Reuters.

Shortly before Air Force One hit the tarmac, the White House briefed reporters that Donald Trump would be meeting Vladimir Putin for a three-on-three meeting, rather than the one-on-one engagement the US President had previously floated.

Mr Trump will be joined by Steve Witkoff, his special envoy who has met with Putin five times in recent months, as well as Marco Rubio, the secretary of state.

The decision to avoid one-on-one talks with Putin followed warnings from Mr Trump's former top Russia adviser that doing so risked the president being manipulated by the former KGB operative.

“Putin will lure you in in a moment,” Fiona Hill, who served on Mr Trump's security council during his first term, told The Telegraph. “He likes to do the two guys chatting routine, but what he's really doing is making you complicit in all kinds of things he wants.”

            Latest Market News 





            Hot Stocks 





            Wednesday evening on the MAGA cable channel OAN, as Defense Department spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson gushed to host Matt Gaetz about an alleged year-over-year increase in female military recruits, four images of women soldiers in combat fatigues were displayed on-screen.
    


            All four images were AI fakes.
    


            The images appear to have been generated using Elon Musk's Grok﻿, as small watermarks in the bottom corners indicate.
    


            “These numbers are fantastic,” Wilson told Gaetz as the AI images scrolled on-screen. “Under the previous administration, we had about 16,000 female recruits last year; now we've got upwards of 24,000,” she continued. “It is a testament to Secretary Hegseth and President Trump's leadership.” (The Pentagon has not officially released detailed data on female recruitment, but it told Fox News those same figures.)
    


            A DOD spokesperson said the images were not provided by them, so CNN on Thursday asked OAN whether its staff generated the photos and if the network has any policy regarding AI-generated content.
    


            “The images violated company policies, which have been re-enforced with all staff,” an OAN spokesperson told CNN. “An on-air correction has been put in place. Management has taken additional actions to ensure the issue is appropriately addressed.”
    


            During Thursday evening's broadcast, Gaetz apologized for using the AI-generated images.
    


            “We made a mistake,” Gaetz said. “We used AI-generated images of female service members as part of our B-roll package, and we shouldn't have. The DOD didn't give us these images; Grok did. And we'll use better judgment going forward.”
    


            OAN, short for One America News, launched in 2013, and during Trump's first administration, it quickly morphed into a conspiracy-heavy, MAGA-boosting outlet.
    


            The little-watched cable channel has become best-known for promoting Trump's 2020 election lies, and it has settled multiple defamation lawsuits resulting from those on-air claims. Last year, the network settled a lawsuit from voting technology company Smartmatic alleging the channel boosted the election lies in order to “increase viewership and revenue.”
    


            The network also settled a defamation suit from a Dominion Voting Systems executive, but it still faces a separate defamation lawsuit from the company.
    


            OAN's viewership and revenue have dwindled since DirecTV dropped it in 2022. However, earlier this year, it received a PR boost when Kari Lake, Trump's pick to run a hollowed-out Voice of America, claimed that OAN will provide “newsfeed services” to VOA and other US-funded international broadcasters.
    


This story has been updated with comments from OAN and Gaetz.

Increasingly targeted in immigration raids, Mixteco and Triqui communities hold festivals of resistance.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

In many agricultural fields of the West Coast of the United States, you're more likely to hear Mixtec or Triqui languages spoken than Spanish. Both are common among the Indigenous people of southern Mexico, some of whom now pick grapes for Napa and Sonoma County's prestige wineries, or apples in century-old orchards. Without their labor, rural economies in California would collapse.

Yet Mixteco and Triqui migrants are being increasingly targeted in immigration raids terrorizing California's rural communities. In farmworker families, mothers and fathers now give their children phone numbers to call if parents are abducted on the way to or from work. It can be an act of bravery simply to walk to the store, or to drive a car at night.

That made it an act of resistance when Triquis and Mixtecos in the Sonoma County town of Healdsburg came out in late July to celebrate the unique culture they've brought with them over the course of their 2,000-mile journey from Oaxaca and Guerrero. They call their festival the Guelaguetza — a celebration featuring a fabulous display of dancers in elaborate masks and tall headdresses, performing to music from home. Indigenous towns in Mexico often have their own dance; the Guelaguetza brings them together in all their vivid variety.

The main Guelaguetza is held in Oaxaca itself, but over the last four decades, the number of Mixtecos, Triquis, Chatinos, and other Indigenous peoples in the U.S. has grown so large that there are now several Guelaguetzas held each year north of the border. Indigenous communities organize dance troupes partly to show off their culture, and partly to give young people growing up in the U.S. a chance to learn the language and dances, and to imagine a home they may have never seen.

When Healdsburg's Triquis decided to do a Guelaguetza, it would be, as one organizer told Truthout, a Guelaguetza de Resistencia, or a Resistance Guelaguetza. The act of simply dancing in public on a Sunday in the town plaza was a way of saying, “Aqui Estamos, y no nos vamos” — “We're here, and we're not leaving.” And even Healdsburg's mayor and one of its council members attended, offering their welcome. 

The late Mixteco community leader Rufino Dominguez-Santos explained that dances and language are not just a way to celebrate identity, but are an essential glue that keeps communities together, helping them survive in a hostile environment. “Beyond organizing and teaching our rights,” he told Truthout back in 2006, “we try to save our language. Even though 500 years have passed since the Spanish conquest, we still speak it. We are preserving our way of dancing, and rescuing our lost beliefs — that nature is something sacred for us, just as it was for our ancestors.”

In these photographs, Healdsburg's Indigenous community activists showcase their deep roots. In spite of fear and racism, the culture of their hometowns in Mexico have been reproduced and they now celebrate thousands of miles further north in California.

As Trump tightens his authoritarian grip on free speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Member states back Correct the Map campaign that urges governments and organisations to use more accurate map

The African Union has backed a campaign to end the use by governments and international organisations of the 16th-century Mercator map of the world in favour of one that more accurately displays Africa's size.

Created by the cartographer Gerardus Mercator for navigation, the projection distorts continent sizes, enlarging areas near the poles like North America and Greenland while shrinking Africa and South America. “It might seem to be just a map, but in reality, it is not,” the African Union Commission deputy chair, Selma Malika Haddadi, told Reuters, saying the Mercator fostered a false impression that Africa was “marginal”, despite being the world's second-largest continent by area, with more than 1 billion people. The union has 55 member states.

Such stereotypes influence media, education and policy, she said.

Criticism of the Mercator map is not new, but the Correct the Map campaign led by the advocacy groups Africa No Filter and Speak Up Africa has revived the debate, urging organisations to adopt the 2018 Equal Earth projection, which tries to reflect countries' true sizes.

“The current size of the map of Africa is wrong,” said Moky Makura, the executive director of Africa No Filter. “It's the world's longest misinformation and disinformation campaign, and it just simply has to stop.”

Fara Ndiaye, a co-founder of Speak Up Africa, said the Mercator affected Africans' identity and pride, especially children who might encounter it early in school.

“We're actively working on promoting a curriculum where the Equal Earth projection will be the main standard across all [African] classrooms,” Ndiaye said, adding she hoped it would also be the one used by global institutions, including Africa-based ones. Haddadi said the AU endorsed the campaign, adding it aligned with its goal of “reclaiming Africa's rightful place on the global stage” amid growing calls for reparations for colonialism and slavery.

The AU will advocate for wider map adoption and discuss collective actions with member states, Haddadi added.

The Mercator projection is still widely used, including by schools and tech companies. Google Maps switched from Mercator on desktop to a 3D globe view in 2018, though users can still switch back to the Mercator if they prefer.

On the mobile app, however, the Mercator projection remains the default.

Correct the Map wants organisations such as the World Bank and the UN to adopt the Equal Earth map. A World Bank spokesperson said it already used the Winkel tripel projection or Equal Earth for static maps and was phasing out Mercator on web maps.

The campaign said it had sent a request to the UN geospatial body, UN-GGIM. A UN spokesperson said that once received it must be reviewed and approved by a committee of experts.

Other regions are backing the AU's efforts. Dorbrene O'Marde, the vice-chair of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) Reparations Commission, endorsed Equal Earth as a rejection of the Mercator map's “ideology of power and dominance”.

Findings help decipher mechanisms through which ‘forever chemicals' cause disease, aiding in treating health problems

New research suggests exposure to some common Pfas or “forever chemical” compounds causes changes to gene activity, and those changes are linked to health problems including multiple cancers, neurological disorders and autoimmune disease.

The findings are a major step toward determining the mechanism by which the chemicals cause disease and could help doctors identify, detect and treat health problems for those exposed to Pfas before the issues advance. The research may also point toward other diseases potentially caused by Pfas that have not yet been identified, the authors said.

The study is among the first to examine how Pfas chemicals impact gene activity, called epigenetics.

“This gives us a hint as to which genes and which Pfas might be important,” said Melissa Furlong, a University of Arizona College of Public Health Pfas researcher and study lead author.

Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment

The study checked the blood of about 300 firefighters from four departments across the country who were exposed to high levels of Pfas. The chemicals are the main ingredient in most firefighting foam, and are frequently used in “turnout gear” worn by firefighters because of their heat repelling properties

Furlong said she was surprised to find the number of genes and biological pathways that were impacted by Pfas, which suggests the chemicals may cause or contribute to a broad range of health problems. The study did not prove the chemicals cause certain diseases, but findings point to biological changes that might precede disease.

Genes play a range of roles in developing or preventing disease, and Pfas essentially change the way the genes are supposed to act, Furlong said. A gene may act as tumor suppressor, but the Pfas interferes with how it expresses, which affects whether cancer develops, or the type of cancer.

For example, PFOS, among the most common and dangerous Pfas compounds, reduces levels of miR-128-1-5p, a gene tied to cancer development. Branched forms of PFOS were linked to changes in five other genes, including some that regulate cancer development.

Different Pfas and chemical structures were found to affect different genes, and were associated with different health outcomes. Not all compounds impacted gene expressions.

The research found connections among Pfas-related gene changes and biological pathways involved in leukemia, as well as bladder, liver, thyroid and breast cancers. Other genes and biological pathways were involved in Alzheimer's disease, and autoimmune and infectious diseases such as lupus, asthma and tuberculosis.

Furlong said it remains unclear at which step in the biological processes disease is triggered, but the picture is clear enough to point to possible treatments. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop drugs that could alter gene activity and potentially prevent Pfas-linked disease from developing.

Walking's accessibility make it an easier choice for a healthy lifestyle, but for many, its simplicity isn't enough for a great exercise session.YANA PASKOVA/The New York Times News Service

Over the past decade, walking has become a popular tool for fitness. The reasons are simple. It's free, it doesn't require any equipment and you can do it almost anywhere. And with some augmentations, it can make you break a serious sweat. 

Walking also has all sorts of positive impacts on your health. The Heart Foundation in Australia noted that walking a half-hour or more each day can lower the risk of stroke, heart disease and type two diabetes. A recent study out of Britain found that brisk walking was associated with lower rates of cancer. The research pool was substantial, consisting of more than 400,000 participants with a mean age of 56 years old. 

Try these three daily exercises to keep your hips happy and healthy

The activity's accessibility makes it an easy choice for a healthier lifestyle, especially when starting out. 

“You can walk pretty much anywhere, but also the idea that if you're getting out of bed in the morning, you're already doing it,” says nutrition coach and personal trainer Jeremy Fernandes. 

Fernandes studied kinesiology at Western University and devoted his career to working with clients across various levels of fitness. He credits the rise of fitness trackers with people's interest in getting their steps in. “The difference is now we're intentionally capturing the data and giving ourselves credit for our efforts.” 

For a lot of people, the simplicity of walking isn't enough for a great exercise session: Speed, resistance and distance matter when walking for fitness. On social media and gyms across the country, people have been augmenting the exercise with the hope of optimizing their workouts. Three popular variations include the incline treadmill, using weighted vests or backpacks and walking at interval speeds, known as “Japanese walking.” 

Most treadmills have a feature that positions the machine on an incline, mimicking walking uphill outside. 

Walking on an incline takes more energy than walking on a flat surface. That's great if you're short on time. 

“The logic is that increasing the incline on your treadmill will result in a greater metabolic cost, meaning your body has to work harder,” said Fernandes. 

The trainer estimates that people would see an approximate 50-per-cent increase in calories burned when walking on a 10-per-cent incline, compared with walking on a zero-per-cent incline. That can lead to weight loss. It can also be easier on the joints than running or jogging. 

Why you should try walking backward

“It will reduce overall impact forces, which is maybe more of a concern for folks with pre-existing joint issues or those training hard to build muscle and strength,” said Fernandes. 

The increased calorie burn, combined with the relative ease of the workout compared with other forms of cardio, are some of the reasons incline treadmill walks have trended across TikTok and Instagram. 

Dozens of videos about the 12-3-30 workout – treadmill walking with an incline at 12 per cent and speed at three miles an hour for 30 minutes – can be found across the platforms, anecdotally praising the workouts for fat loss. 

Fernandes notes that incline treadmill walks are safe to try for anyone who isn't dealing with a chronic lower-leg injury. 

Companies such as GORUCK and Rogue sell weighted vests as an expression of extreme masculinity with military associations. Weighted vests have also been marketed for women to help combat osteoporosis and increase bone density while aging. 

For those looking to try out a weighted vest for exercise, it's best to start out small – 5 per cent to 10 per cent of your bodyweight – and work up from there, according to Fernandes.

Weighted vests and backpacks are good for adding some extra intensity to cardio exercises. They can also be useful for anyone preparing for long hikes where carrying equipment is necessary. But along with the benefits there's a lot of hype. 

How to prevent tweaks, strains and tears caused by tennis, running and other popular workouts

While there have been small studies showing positive relationships between walking and bone destiny in postmenopausal women, there hasn't been enough research to definitively say that it works. Similarly, for anyone with pre-existing strains or injuries, the added weight of a vest could exacerbate the conditions. 

“Folks with neck and back issues should be extra cautious with adding in rucking or weighted vests to their routine, as the added stress on these areas may cause issues,” said Fernandes. 

For anyone keen to step up their daily stroll, consider “Japanese walking.” The exercise consists of three minutes of normal walking followed by three minutes of walking at a faster pace, repeated for five rounds. 

Also referred to as 3-3 walking or interval walking, the technique was created by professors at Shinshu University in Matsumoto, Japan. Explainers about the trend and personal stories touting the health benefits of the low-impact exercise have been spreading across social media. For some, it's changed their routine for the positive. 

There's data to back up the anecdotes. A 2007 study by Shinshu University showed that middle-aged and older adults participating in interval walking had lower blood pressure and better aerobic capacity than those who walked 8,000 steps a day at a moderate pace. 

Quick, intense exercise may put the brakes on aging, research shows

“Increasing intensity in accessible ways tends to lead to beneficial outcomes for folks,” said Fernandes. The fitness expert notes that interval training in many different forms has always been popular for exercise. Japanese walking fits into those larger trends. “It may have benefits in terms of aerobic health. There's also small strength benefits as well.” 

Switching up your pace and walking for brisk intervals can be a great entry point into exercising. It's also something we can incorporate into daily activities we're already doing such as grocery shopping or strolling into work. 

Still, if you're thinking about augmentations that make walking more challenging, first make sure you're actually willing to walk without them. Getting started and doing something consistently is always going to be better than going hard right away. 

Walking 10,000 steps... But better 😯 I know I can't be the only one who looks at my step count at the end of the day and feel like a failure. Some days, I get around 2,000 steps. I still aim for at least 8,000 a day - but sometimes, life just gets in the way. But even if it's only an extra ~3000 steps, this simple 30 minute protocol on my walking pad can make a huge difference.

It's a fact little known around the world: Some of the biggest names in tech were founded by Ukrainian-born entrepreneurs, including PayPal, WhatsApp, and Grammarly.

These companies, now headquartered across the U.S. and Europe, owe part of their success to Ukrainian-born entrepreneurs whose innovations have shaped how millions communicate, pay, and work online.

Here are 10 of the world's most recognizable tech companies founded or co-founded by Ukrainians.

Co-founder Max Levchin was born in Kyiv, Ukraine

PayPal revolutionized digital payments when it was launched in the late 1990s, eventually being acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002. The platform became the backbone of online commerce, processing billions in transactions globally.

One of the founding members is Max Levchin, a Ukrainian-born entrepreneur who left Kyiv with his family in 1991 as a teenager. He became PayPal's anti-fraud architect and co-created one of the first commercial Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA).

In 2012, in San Francisco, Levchin founded Affirm, which now dominates the buy-now-pay-later market. The company went public in 2021 with a $12 billion valuation and has a current market capitalization of $25 billion. Levchin's current net worth, according to Forbes, is estimated at $2.1 billion.

Co-founder Jan Koum was born in Kyiv, Ukraine

With almost 3 billion users sending over 150 million messages daily, WhatsApp is one of the world's most popular ways to stay in touch. When Facebook bought it for $22 billion in 2014, it was the biggest startup acquisition at the time.

Behind the global messenger stands Jan Koum, who was born in Kyiv and immigrated to the U.S. as a teenager in 1992. From humble beginnings on welfare, the self-taught programmer co-founded WhatsApp and built a $16.9 billion fortune, making him the wealthiest Ukrainian immigrant in the U.S., according to Forbes.

Founded in Kyiv, Ukraine by three Ukrainians

Three Ukrainians — Alex Shevchenko, Max Lytvyn, and Dmytro Lider — launched their English writing helper Grammarly in 2009 in Kyiv. A decade later, more than 40 million users rely on Grammarly daily to help them proofread and spell check their texts. 

The company puts its annual revenue at $700 million, and it was last valued at $13 billion in 2021.

After Shevchenko and Lytvyn's net worths hit $4 billion in 2021, they became the first tech founders to top Ukraine's wealth rankings ahead of traditional oligarchs. Their net worths have since fallen to $1.9 billion, according to Forbes.

Founded in Kyiv, Ukraine, where it maintains its headquarters today

Reface, founded in 2018 by a group of Ukrainian developers, is an artificial intelligence product company best known for its face-swapping application for videos and photos. In the five years since it was founded, it has been downloaded over 250 million times and in 2020, was number one in the entertainment category in the Apple App Store in the U.S., surpassing TikTok and Netflix for a time. 

The app has been used by billionaire Elon Musk, and celebrities Snoop Dogg and Britney Spears, and in 2021, Reface partnered with Warner Bros. to promote "The Matrix 4." In 2020, Reface raised $5.5 million for product development from Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and investors including "South Park" creators and music managers of stars Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Britney Spears, and Miley Cyrus.

Following the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, the company sent 13 million push notifications to tell Russian users the truth about their country's aggression against Ukraine.

The first Ukrainian unicorn, founded by Dmytro Zaporozhets from Kharkiv, Ukraine

When developer Dmytro Zaporozhets from eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv got frustrated with existing code management tools, he decided to build his own in 2011. Since then, Zaporozhets' initial side project, GitLab, has grown into a comprehensive coding platform used by over 50 million registered users worldwide.

GitLab became Ukraine's first unicorn — a startup with a valuation of more than $1 billion — in September 2018. In October 2021, the company went public on NASDAQ, valued at $11 billion, with shares jumping 35% on the first day of trading to reach a market cap of $14.9 billion. After the company listing, Zaporozhets became Ukraine's then-richest software engineer with a fortune of nearly $460 million.

Co-founded by Ukrainian developer Vlad Yatsenko 

Behind the U.K.-based global payment platform, which lets users manage finances through a single platform, stands Ukrainian developer Vlad Yatsenko. In 2015, he co-founded Revolut with Nikolai Storonsky, who was born in Russia but later renounced his Russian citizenship following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The app's success has earned Yatsenko a $1.2 billion fortune. 

The application now serves over 60 million customers worldwide and is currently valued at $45 billion. The company is reportedly in talks to raise new funding that could boost its valuation to $65 billion.

CleanMyMac was developed in Kyiv by Oleksandr Kosovan

As of 2023, every fifth Mac on Earth had at least one MacPaw application — a testament to how big this bootstrapped software company has become. Founded by Oleksandr Kosovan while studying at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in 2008, he created CleanMyMac, an optimization tool for Mac users to clean and speed up their computers.

This success evolved into other products like Setapp, a subscription service for Mac apps, and AI assistant Eney. The company now serves 30 million users worldwide, with MacPaw's software downloaded in over 180 countries, all without external investment.

Founded by Dmitry Sergeev in Kyiv

With over 300 million files and 44 million customers worldwide, Depositphotos is one of the world's largest stock photo marketplaces. Founded in 2009 by Dmitry Sergeev in Kyiv, it grew into a global content empire, competing with industry giants like Getty Images and Adobe.

The U.S. firm VistaPrint acquired Depositphotos in October 2021 for $85 million, with Sergeev reportedly receiving nearly $50 million from the deal. Depositphotos today employs nearly 450 people in six countries, including Ukraine.

Founded by three Ukrainians in Kyiv

Petcube was the first company in the pet-tech sector to create smart cameras that let owners watch and play with their pets remotely. When the Kyiv-based trio — Alex Neskin, Andrey Klen, and Yaroslav Azhnyuk — launched their Kickstarter campaign in 2012, they raised a record-breaking $251,000, the most ever for a pet product on the platform at the time. Since then, Petcube has sold more than 1 million products worldwide.

Petcube is headquartered in the U.S., but most of the company's 60 employees remain in Ukraine. The U.S. market, which consists of 85 million pet owners, was the first target and still makes up 80% of sales, typically through online retailers like Amazon. The company also donates to the Armed Forces and UA Animals, an NGO that helps animals during the war.

Founded in the U.S. by three Ukrainians

Preply, an online marketplace connecting language learners with tutors, was founded in 2012 by Ukrainian entrepreneurs Kirill Bigai, Serge Lukyanov, and Dmytro Voloshyn. Today, over 100,000 tutors teach hundreds of thousands of students worldwide in more than 90 languages, the company told the Kyiv Independent in a statement.  

While the company's value isn't publicly known, various estimates from 2022 and 2023 put it somewhere around $430 million. The company raised $70 million in funding in 2023, bringing its total funding to $170 million.

Trump police takeover will create ‘immediate, devastating, and irreparable harm' for DC, federal lawsuit says

DC sues Trump administration over ‘hostile takeover' of city police

According to the federal lawsuit filed by the DC government today, the Trump administration has engaged in “a brazen usurpation of the District's authority over its own government”.

The suit says that the president's move to federalise the DC police, and attorney general Pam Bondi's order to install DEA administrator Terry Cole as “emergency police commissioner”, both “exceed the narrow delegation that Congress granted the President in Section 740”.

A reminder, earlier this week the president invoked Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act, which grants him a 30-day period to control the district's local law enforcement if he declares a safety emergency. To get an extension, the president would need Congress's approval.

The president has said that violent crime in DC – which the justice department says experienced a 30-year low in 2024 – is “the worst it's ever been”.

The lawsuit also states that Section 740 only requires that the DC mayor “provide services” of the Metropolitan police department (MPD) to federal government, but “does not permit the President to seize control of MPD. Nor does it authorize the President to direct MPD in the policing of local crime.”

House and Senate Democrats introduced a joint resolution today to terminate Trump's federalization of the DC Metropolitan Police Department.

Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting delegate from the District of Columbia, and representative Robert Garcia of California are leading the effort in the House, while senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland introduced the legislation in the Senate.

The resolution, which has little chance of advancing under the Republican-controlled Congress, says the president “has failed to identify special conditions of an emergency nature that compel the use of the Metropolitan Police Department for Federal purposes in the District of Columbia”.

Under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, a president can order DC's mayor to give him temporary control of the police, but Congress can terminate that authority.

In their resolutions, the lawmakers cite statistics showing that violent crime is at a 30-year low in DC as evidence that there is no emergency to justify the president's actions.

“The only emergency here is a lawless president experiencing a growing public relations emergency because of his close friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and his stubborn refusal to release the Epstein file despite his promise to do so,” said Raskin, the top Democrat on the judiciary committee. 

“Trump was AWOL when the District of Columbia actually needed support from the National Guard to protect it from an insurrectionist mob on January 6,” Van Hollen said.

He called Trump's moves “an abuse of power” and a “raw power grab”. “It is a direct attack on the ability of the people of the District of Columbia to govern their own affairs,” he said.

Greetings from Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a cold war-era military installation on the outskirts of Anchorage, Alaska, that will play host to Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin today.

I am among an estimated 700 journalists from all over the world. We were greeted at the Anchorage international airport by the sight of a majestic brown bear slain by Governor Mike Dunleavy and displayed as a trophy in a glass case.

The media gathered downtown at 5.30am local time today and were bused to the air force base under a big sky with picturesque mountains. The airbase is like a small city with housing, children's playgrounds, nondescript three-storey lodgings, a church with stained glass windows and great grassy expanses. The temperature is a crisp 50F.

Earlier, Reuters reported: “The Kremlin press pool was housed in an Alaska Airlines Center, where a semi-open-plan room was subdivided by partitions and some reporters were seen making their own camp-style beds. They were fed for free at a nearby university campus, Russian reporters said.”

Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was crucial to countering the Soviet Union during the cold war. It continues to play a role today, as planes from the base still intercept Russian aircraft that regularly fly into US airspace. Putin's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, arrived in a sweatshirt with “CCCP” – the Russian letters for USSR – across the front.

Today's meeting could prove a win-win for the two leaders. Putin, an alleged war criminal who had been an international pariah, gets to meet the US president on American soil. Trump, for his part, gets to play global statesman in a massive media spectacle where no one is talking about Jeffrey Epstein (well, almost no one).

Donald Trump was asked earlier what would make his summit with Vladimir Putin a success. He told reporters aboard Air Force One:

I can't tell you that.

I don't know it's there's nothing set in stone. I want certain things. I want to see a ceasefire.

This is not to do with Europe. Europe's not telling me what to do, but they're going to be involved in the process, obviously, as well Zelenskyy, but I want to see a ceasefire rapidly.

I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today. Everyone said it can't be today, but I'm just saying I want the killing to stop.

I'm in this to stop the killing. You know, we're not putting up any money. We're making money. They're buying our weapons, and we're sending them to Nato, and Nato is sending us big, beautiful checks.

But that I don't care about … But what I do care about is they lost last week 7011 people, almost all soldiers; 36 people in a town which got hit by a missile.

Over 7,000 soldiers. It's crazy.

You can watch the clip here.

Donald Trump has told Fox News's Bret Baier that if his meeting with Vladimir Putin doesn't go well today, he would walk.

“We're going for a meeting with President Putin in Alaska. And I think it's going to work out very well, and if it doesn't I'm going to head back home real fast,” Trump said.

Asked by Baier if that means he would walk if it doesn't go well, the president replied: “I would walk, yeah.”

Trump earlier confirmed his threat of “severe” consequences for Russia if it fails to show willingness to seriously talk about the end of war in Ukraine.

He told reporters on Air Force One:

Economically severe. It will be very severe. I'm not doing this for my health, okay, I don't need it. I'd like to focus on our country, but I'm doing this to save a lot of lives. Yeah, very severe.

USAID is concerned that the Trump administration's cancellation of independent aid monitoring contracts for Ukraine has increased the risk of waste, fraud and abuse, according to three US watchdog agencies.

“The termination of third-party monitoring contracts has further limited USAID's ability to oversee programs,” the state department, Pentagon and USAID inspectors general said in a report issued today.

The US Agency for International Development was the main American agency that administered civilian foreign aid for more than 60 years. It is being dismantled by the Trump administration – which claims to be tackling waste, fraud and abuse in federal spending – and is scheduled to be closed on 2 September.

The three inspectors general submit quarterly reports to Congress on their oversight of US civilian support for Ukraine in its fight against Russia's full-scale invasion launched in February 2022.

In January, Donald Trump froze all US foreign assistance programs pending a review of their alignment with his “America first” policies, and ordered the dismantling of USAID, which stopped disbursing funds in July.

As part of this decision, Elon Musk's so-called “department of government efficiency” oversaw the termination of 83% of USAID programs, including some that supported Ukraine.

The watchdogs' report said that USAID managed $30.2bn in direct support for the Ukrainian government's budget, and provided a guarantee that secured a $20bn loan for Kyiv.

It said that in the three months ending 31 June, 25 civilian aid programs for Ukraine were terminated, while 29 active programs, five under stop-work orders and four of unknown status were transferred to the state department.

The terminated programs included contracts with third parties that provided independent tracking of USAID funds to ensure that they were spent as intended and that helped “inform both current and future decision-making”, it said.

“USAID said that without independent monitoring, it cannot verify that programs are being implemented in line with award terms, increasing the risk of waste, fraud and abuse,” the report said.

This is especially true in conflict-affected areas “where there is a heightened potential for diversion of funds”, it warned.

A federal judge will hold a hearing today on the lawsuit filed by the DC government – challenging the Trump administration's federal takeover of the DC, including Pam Bondi's move to install the DEA chief Terry Cole as “emergency police commissioner”. Judge Ana Reyes will hold today's hearing at 2pm ET.

In response to the lawsuit, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said the following in a statement to the Guardian:

The Trump Administration has the lawful authority to assert control over the D.C. Police, which is necessary due to the emergency that has arisen in our Nation's Capital as a result of failed leadership. The Democrats' efforts to stifle this tremendous progress are par for the course for the Defund the Police, Criminals-First Democrat Party.

A White House official tells the Guardian that 33 people were arrested on Thursday night by federal law enforcement. Almost half of these arrests were undocumented immigrants, according to the official.

The White House also said that 1,750 officers took part in Thursday's operations.

Yesterday, the Pentagon said that all 800 national guard troops had been mobilized, with about 200 soldiers at a time taking turns to assist federal agents and the Metropolitan police department (MPD). The national guard troops are not making arrests at this time, but protecting federal property and aiding law enforcement.

The MPD has not yet provided the number of arrests made by local police on Thursday.

As the president prepares for his pivotal meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, he's received an unlikely vote of confidence from a longstanding rival.

Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton – also the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee – said in a podcast interview released today that she would consider nominating Donald Trump for the Nobel peace prize if he could successfully broker a peace deal with the Kremlin leader that doesn't put Ukraine “in a position where it had to concede its territory to the aggressor”.

Clinton added some crucial caveats while speaking on the Raging Moderates podcast. She said that any potential award endorsement would require Trump to do the following:

Make it clear that there must be a ceasefire, there will be no exchange of territory, and that over a period of time Putin should be actually withdrawing from the territory that he has seized, in order to demonstrate his good-faith efforts, let us say, not to threaten European security.

If Trump were “the architect” of that kind of deal, Clinton said she would nominate him for a Nobel peace prize.

“My goal here is not to allow capitulation to Putin, aided and abetted by the United States,” she added.

This comes after Trump reportedly cold-called Norway's finance minister last month to ask about a nomination for the Nobel peace prize, according to Norwegian press.

With only 95 of the 100 representatives needed to achieve quorum, the Texas house has moved to end the August special session four days early.

House speaker Dustin Burrows told members to “not go very far, as I believe our governor will be calling us back for another special session”, referring to Greg Abbott's plans to immediately call a second session. Local reports say the next session will begin at noon local time today.

For their part, Texas house Democrats have said they would return as long as the first special session adjourned on Friday, and California introduced its own new congressional map to offset the gains by Republicans. California's governor, Gavin Newsom, announced on Thursday that its maps would be coming shortly.

DC's mayor, Muriel Bowser, confirmed that she will be back in DC today, after travelling to Martha's Vineyard on Wednesday to pick her daughter up from summer camp.

In a post on X, Bowser clarified her schedule, after Donald Trump posted a local report which said Bowser had “left town” for the Massachusetts island.

“I am in constant contact with my senior team and have been in constant consultation with our partners throughout a short swing out of the District,” she wrote.

When Donald Trump announced a federal takeover of the Metropolitan police department in Washington DC on Monday, he left room for the possibility of making a similar move in other cities across the US, alluding to their high crime rates.

“You look at Chicago, how bad it is. You look at Los Angeles, how bad it is. We have other cities that are very bad,” Trump said. “We're not going to let it happen, we're not going to lose our cities.”

But both experts and elected officials have been quick to counter Trump's claims, pointing out how major cities are in fact experiencing dramatic decreases in violent crime rates since they peaked during the pandemic.

“Every category of crime and every population group that the FBI covers is reporting a drop pretty much nationwide,” said Jeff Asher, an analyst who studies criminal justice data, adding that there was no disparity in the trend between red and blue cities or states.

The downward trend has been consistent nationally since around 2022, as the country began to recover from the pandemic, experts said.

“It's clear that a lot of what we saw during the Covid-19 era has been reversed,” said Ames Grawert, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice who researches crime trends.

While it's impossible to isolate the exact causes of the spike in crime during the pandemic, several experts point to the collapse of social services as one cause. Since then, state and federal agencies poured money into communities for projects like gun violence prevention programs as well as more streetlights on local roads.

My colleague, Jakub Krupa, is bringing you the latest as Donald Trump heads to Alaska to meet with Russian president Vladimir Putin today. It's hard to emphasise the stakes of this summit, particularly as the world watches.

Jakub reports that the president wrapped a gaggle with the press onboard Air Force One a short while ago.

A few of the key lines here:

On continuing Russian attacks on Ukraine, Trump says he thinks Putin “is trying to set a stage” and “in his mind that helps him make a better deal”. But the president says “it actually hurts him, and I will be talking to him about it”.

Trump also affirms his chief aim of today's meeting: “I'm not here to negotiate for Ukraine. I'm here to get them at a table.”

Trump also confirms his earlier threat of “severe” consequences for Russia if it fails to show willingness to seriously talk about the end of war in Ukraine: “Economically severe. It will be very severe. I'm not doing this for my health, OK, I don't need it. I'd like to focus on our country, but I'm doing this to save a lot of lives.”

Late yesterday, DC's mayor, Muriel Bowser, hit back against Pam Bondi's move to put DEA chief Terry Cole in charge of the capital's police department. In a post on X, Bowser wrote: “There is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.”  

She also said that her office have “followed the law” and provided the services of the DC police at the request of the president, as outlined in Section 740 of the Home Rule Act.

Bowser also reposted a letter from DC attorney general Brian Schwalb, addressed to the mayor, which said that Bondi's order is “unlawful” and Bowser is “not legally obligated to follow it”.

According to the federal lawsuit filed by the DC government today, the Trump administration has engaged in “a brazen usurpation of the District's authority over its own government”.

The suit says that the president's move to federalise the DC police, and attorney general Pam Bondi's order to install DEA administrator Terry Cole as “emergency police commissioner”, both “exceed the narrow delegation that Congress granted the President in Section 740”.

A reminder, earlier this week the president invoked Section 740 of the DC Home Rule Act, which grants him a 30-day period to control the district's local law enforcement if he declares a safety emergency. To get an extension, the president would need Congress's approval.

The president has said that violent crime in DC – which the justice department says experienced a 30-year low in 2024 – is “the worst it's ever been”.

The lawsuit also states that Section 740 only requires that the DC mayor “provide services” of the Metropolitan police department (MPD) to federal government, but “does not permit the President to seize control of MPD. Nor does it authorize the President to direct MPD in the policing of local crime.”

As the federal takeover of the DC police and deployment of national guard troops entered its fourth night, here's a recap of what happened overnight.

The US attorney general, Pam Bondi, ended DC's “sanctuary policies”. In a directive signed yesterday, she rescinded previous orders – including one from the DC police chief, Pamela Smith – that Bondi's office says “limited” the Metropolitan police department (MPD) from working with federal officers. Bondi has now scrapped rules which prevent DC police from arresting people “solely for federal immigration warrants” and “restricted certain information from being shared with federal authorities,” a justice department spokesperson said.

Bondi also stripped power away from Smith, the police chief, and appointed Terry Cole – who leads the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) – as “emergency police commissioner”. According to her order, the MPD “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any further directives.

And today, the DC government announced it is suing the Trump administration for its takeover of the DC police. The district's attorney general, Brian Schwalb, wrote: “Section 740 of the Home Rule Act permits the President to request MPD's services … Even when Section 740 is lawfully invoked, the Home Rule Act keeps operational control of MPD with the Mayor and Chief, and the President must request MPD services through the Mayor.” He added that the federal government's actions are “brazenly unlawful” and “infringe on the District's right to self-governance”.

Meanwhile, federal law enforcement began conducting sweeps of homeless encampments. Crews tore down a major encampment near the Kennedy Center on Thursday, removing residents and clearing out the remaining encampments across the city. My colleague Kirstin Garriss has more on the latest here.

Former president Barack Obama has praised Texas Democrats for protesting against the state's gerrymandered GOP-drawn congressional maps by breaking quorum, according to a report from ABC News.

ABC obtained footage of a Zoom meeting on Thursday in which Obama addressed the legislators.

“We can't let a systematic assault on democracy just happen and stand by and so because of your actions, because of your courage, what you've seen is California responding, other states looking at what they can do to offset this mid-decade gerrymandering,” he said.

In the meeting, Obama also said that the Democrats – who left the state capital almost two weeks ago – “helped to lead what is going to be a long struggle”.

He added:

It's not going to be resolved right away, and it's going to require, ultimately, the American people understanding the stakes and realizing that we cannot take our freedoms and our democracy for granted. You've helped set the tone for that, and I'm grateful for it.

In a statement to ABC News, Texas house minority leader Gene Wu said Obama's message to the Democrats is “proof that when they stand up and fight back, we don't stand alone”.

Wu added that “President Obama's support shows the whole country is watching – and Texas house Democrats won't be silenced by bullies”.

This comes as Texas Democrats also said they are prepared to return to the state under certain conditions, ending their efforts to block Republicans from passing a new map that would add five GOP seats.

The lawmakers said they would return as long as the legislature ends its first special session on Friday, which Republicans have said they plan to do. However, Texas's governor, Greg Abbott, has said he will immediately call another special session.

MOSCOW, August 15. /TASS/. Russia is holding talks with Iran on the construction of small modular nuclear power plants (NPP) on its territory, hoping to enter into relevant agreements in the future, Rosatom Chief Executive Officer Alexey Likhachev said in an interview with the Rossiya-1 TV channel.

In early 2025 Iran suggested that the agenda of cooperation in nuclear energy with Russia be expanded by adding the construction of small modular nuclear power plants in the Islamic Republic to the discussion, he noted.

"Such negotiations are underway. I hope that sooner or later such agreements will be concluded," the chief executive said.

Russia has always been an active participant in the process of resolving the so-called Iranian nuclear issue, he stressed, adding that as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was formed and launched Moscow played a key role in providing technical and diplomatic support to Tehran.

Some save every penny for a down payment on a home. Others live for today and figure tomorrow will sort itself out. I've spent years comparing myself to them

Last year, while being laid off over a Slack call, I had a vision. I saw myself, greying and tired, in a white room. My theory is that the shock of the news swept clean the imagination of my entire future.

That vision came on the heels of a long buildup. I freelance on the personal finance beat and often talk to Gen Zs and millennials about their money habits, career decisions and retirement plans. 

Some save every penny for a down payment on a home. Others live for today and figure tomorrow will sort itself out. I've spent years comparing myself to them.

In the middle of one of my comparison spirals, I asked ChatGPT a question I couldn't bring myself to ask a human: “Do you think I'll be okay when I'm 65?”

We asked ChatGPT for personal finance advice. Here's what human advisers think about AI's answers 

Off the bat, the bot, known for agreeing with its user, legitimized my feelings in its em-dash-heavy fashion. “It's totally valid to feel anxious about retirement – especially after a job loss,” it replied.

“You're not alone in this,” it said, which is true. Almost half of Canadians lose sleep over money issues, according to a Financial Stress Index.

It basically congratulated me for being proactive. “Your concern shows you're thinking ahead, which is a great first step.” 

Opinion: Testing AI hype with questions about how to save a home down payment and when to start CPP

Next, it asked for details about my age, savings, income, expenses, retirement goals, eligibility for the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security, and whether I plan to buy a home.

I gave it all the details: I'm a 29-year-old freelancer with $20,000 in my tax-free savings account, $5,000 in my registered retirement savings plan, some other savings, some gold and no real plan. I spend about $3,000 a month, have no debt or pension and rent in Toronto with my husband, who works full-time in technology. 

My freelancing income swings between $1,000 and $5,000 a month. We don't own property, nor do my parents. We sometimes talk about buying a place, having a kid and retiring in Egypt, where his family has a home. I'd like to retire by age 65.

Ms. Khozema asked ChatGPT a question at the heart of her financial anxiety: 'Do you think I'll be okay when I'm 65?'Ali Elmoudi/The Globe and Mail

“You're actually in a much better position than you might think, especially at 29.” I found it hard to believe that I was on par with my peers, so I Googled it.

Again, the bot was right, kind of. Reddit threads and a big bank's advice team agreed that you should have around one year of your annual salary saved by 30, which I almost do. 

But that's based on an entry-level salary, not enough to survive in one of Canada's most expensive cities.

Still, it continued to reassure me that I was on the right track, highlighting my lack of debt, low expenses and solid savings. 

But it also flagged risks like needing to save more for rent later since I don't own property. It reminded me that my inconsistent income might affect CPP eligibility and to check on my contributions regularly. It even told me to get the ball rolling on conversations about kids and home ownership with my husband.

Four wealth traps that can derail your retirement

I already knew a lot of that. It didn't go into detail about whether my income was enough to survive the expenses of a home or child, how much more I needed or if my income would live up to the cost of living over the next few decades. I'm sure it could if I poked around more.

I was already starting to feel better, so I skipped all that and went straight to the big number. I told ChatGPT about contributing $550 into my TFSA every month and about an upcoming fellowship. I also said I eventually did want to find a stable job with benefits. I asked it to give me the projection, as vague as that sounds. 

Within seconds, it returned with numbers and showed just how. If I don't touch my TFSA until retirement, it said I'd have almost a quarter of a million dollars. 

I don't believe that. What would our monthly budget be? How long would it last? Would we be paying for our theoretical kid still? I had a lot of questions, but not enough will to poke holes in my perfect story.

I was ready to escape the spreadsheet vibes, so I ended by asking it to show me what a day in my retirement could look like.

“You're 67 years old. You live in a peaceful Nile-side neighbourhood in Egypt. The cost of living is a fraction of what it was in Toronto. You and your husband either own a small home or rent a beautiful, affordable apartment in a community where you're known for your stories,” it said.

I asked ChatGPT to generate a picture of me in retirement, and this is what it created.

It described my morning coffee, my afternoon hobbies and my evening reading. Between them, I occasionally co-hosted a podcast, edited a few articles and blogged about my travels from an Egyptian courtyard while my husband brought me coffee. It said that I could live a comfortable life travelling and hosting friends for dinner parties in Egypt. As romantic as it all sounded, it was a projection built on my TFSA alone. 

I found that the AI leaned heavily on common sense and a shaky piece of advice: Use your home as a retirement asset and downsize, assuming we'd buy in Toronto eventually, which seems like a hard reality without a real path to get there.

What struck me most wasn't the forecast but the tone. It was reassuring, warm and borderline coddling. “You didn't retire early. You retired intentionally. You built a flexible career that gave you options. You have a life that still lets you tell stories, eat well and sleep soundly,” it said.

The white box in my head started collecting colour. ChatGPT read like it knew me, which makes sense, because I often talk to it about recipes, work and travel.

I often feel numb and cynical when thinking about retirement. Like, what's the point of saving when the world is on fire? Will the future even exist? Will I be too burnt out to enjoy it?, ChatGPT let me self-indulge and be a little delulu. It helped me romanticize a future I was afraid to imagine.

It didn't replace doing the work, though. I still need to earn more, save more and have hard conversations with my partner about what we want. But ChatGPT created a starting point. It was like holding up a mirror and being told, gently, that maybe I'm not failing.

Would I recommend it? Yes, but with caveats. It won't make your money magically grow. It's not a licensed financial adviser. But if you're in a job limbo, renting or just financially anxious, it can offer hope in moments of chaos.

At the very least, it's better than picturing yourself in a blank white box.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed “remorse” over World War II in his address at the annual government-organized national memorial service for the war dead in Tokyo on Friday.

“We must once again deeply inscribe the remorse and lessons from that war into our hearts,” Ishiba stated.

A source close to Ishiba emphasized that the prime minister had intended to include the word “remorse” in his address. The source explained that Ishiba's decision was the “culmination of his deep resolve to prevent the recurrence of war, as the nation marks the 80th anniversary of the war's end.”

It has been 13 years since a prime minister last used the word “remorse” in their memorial address. It was used in 2012 by Yoshihiko Noda, who was the prime minister under the Democratic Party of Japan and now leads the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan.

The mention of remorse became a fixture after former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama issued a statement on the 50th anniversary of the war's end, in which he acknowledged past colonial rule and aggression.

In his 1994 address, Murayama expressed “deep remorse” and stated that Japan had “caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations.”

Former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also referred to “remorse” in his 2007 address during his first term, but he stopped using the term in his second term and beyond. Instead, he stated, “We have the great responsibility to take the lessons of history deeply into our hearts.”

The annual memorial ceremony for Japan's war dead was held at the Nippon Budokan hall in Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo, on Friday, as the country marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.

About 4,500 people, including family members of the war dead and representatives from various fields, attended the government-organized memorial service.

The attendees remembered the about 3.1 million Japanese people who lost their lives in the war and renewed their vow to never fight a war again and extend the 80 years of peace since.

The Emperor and Empress and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba were in attendance at the ceremony, which began at 11:51 a.m. A minute of silence was observed as the clock struck noon.

In his address, the Emperor used the expression “deep remorse” again this year, marking the 11th consecutive year that the expression has been used in the Imperial address.

The Emperor spoke for the first time about passing on the memory of the war, saying, “It is my sincere hope that we shall continue to pass down the memories of the sufferings endured during and after the war, and in unity of spirit, to seek peace and the happiness of the people in the future.”

The oldest attendee at the ceremony was Shoji Nagaya, 98, of Hokkaido, who lost his older brother in the war, while the youngest was a 3-year-old from Mie Prefecture who is the great-great-grandson of a war casualty.

Representing the families of the war dead, Hajime Eda, 82, of Kawagoe, Saitama Prefecture, whose father died in the Korea Strait, delivered a message of remembrance.

Of the 3,432 family members of the war dead scheduled to attend Friday's ceremony as of Aug. 8, 3,380 were related to deceased Imperial military personnel or employees, according to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry. Family members of those killed in the atomic bombings and other war victims totaled 52.

Of those, a record 1,826 were born in the postwar period. At 53.2%, they made up over half the group for the first time.

No parents of war dead have been in attendance for 15 years. This year's ceremony was the first with no spouses of war dead, except for 2021, when attendance was severely restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Passing on the experiences of the war to future generations remains an issue to be addressed.

Flowers were given by children to attendees to offer at the memorial for the first time in six years, as the custom was suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The custom began in 2016 with the aim of passing on the memories of the war to younger generations. This year, 14 children between the ages of 8 and 17, including a great-grandchild of a person who died in the war, handed out yellow chrysanthemums.

From the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 to the end of World War II in 1945, about 2.3 million Japanese military personnel and employees, including those detained in Siberia after the war, lost their lives. About 800,000 civilians were killed in air raids and the two atomic bombings.

BELGRADE, August 15. /TASS/. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has accused participants in the August 13-14 protest in Novi Sad of attempting to burn people alive inside the office of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), Informer TV reported.

"That night, they tried to burn people alive. Can you imagine what they would do to those inside? They would burn 300 people alive!" Vucic said. "Now everyone understands who we are dealing with and that they never wanted peace. All this time, it was only about violence."

According to Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, 42 police officers — including 26 in Belgrade — were injured during mass riots at rallies across the country, and 37 people were detained. The gravest incidents took place in Novi Sad, where SNS premises at several locations were vandalized. Dacic described the unrest as one of the most violent attacks on police in recent years, with protesters using stones, metal bars, sticks, and fireworks.

During the night of August 13-14, protesters also attacked offices of the ruling SNS and the Socialist Party in several cities, injuring 27 police officers and more than 80 civilians, mostly SNS supporters. The Interior Ministry reported that five government vehicles and 22 pieces of equipment were damaged. Around 100 people also attacked members of the Cobras special detachment in Novi Sad.

Ruling and opposition parties issued statements about their intentions for the future to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.

The Liberal Democratic Party declared that the global order was in a “critical state with the potential to collapse.” It pointed to the situation in the Middle East and the United States' increasingly strong “America First” stance as major contributing factors. “Japan must take the lead in upholding and strengthening the free and open international order, the foundation of peace and prosperity,” the LDP said.

Komeito called for multilateral dialogue to build trust and proactively prevent unforeseen contingencies, emphasizing the “increasingly severe security environment around Japan.”

The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan said: “We take pride in the fact that our nation has not waged war in the 80 years since the end of World War II. We will never forget the tragedies and mistakes of the past and use them as lessons to face the world with integrity.”

The Japan Innovation Party aims to build up Japan's “active defense capability” to create and maintain peace as well as a stable international order. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party for the People underscored its resolve to “do its utmost to [ensure Japan] remains a peaceful nation.”

Sanseito spoke of its commitment to “learning from both the light and shadow of history and preserve Japan that was protected at the cost of lives.”

Reiwa Shinsengumi stated that they would “take action to create a nation that will never wage war again,” and the Japanese Communist Party insisted that they would “stop the great military expansion” and “war state building,” which it views as unconstitutional.

The Conservative Party of Japan stated its intention to “focus on constructing peace and prosperity for the future without allowing history to become a political battleground.”

The Social Democratic Party announced its commitment to realizing a politics of “rice over missiles” and preventing any revision of the Constitution.

Team Mirai emphasized the importance of exploring a path of mutual understanding through dialogue without fueling social divisions.

Editor's note: This story has been updated with details on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's arrival.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Alexander Darchiev have arrived in Alaska ahead of a planned Trump-Putin summit, Russian state media reported on Aug. 15.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet in Alaska later in the day as Washington intensifies efforts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.

Lavrov, wearing a sweatshirt with a Russian-language inscription "USSR," arrived at a hotel in Anchorage, Alaska's largest city and the site of upcoming talks between U.S. and Russian leaders.

Putin has arrived in the town of Magadan in Russia's Far East ahead of the planned summit, Russian state media reported. Magadan is located about 3,162 kilometers (1,965 miles) from Anchorage.

The Russian leader is expected to meet with the local governor and visit an industrial facility before departing for Alaska, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

An airplane with Russian journalists has also arrived in Anchorage, state media claimed.

On Aug. 14, Trump said that Putin will come to the summit in Alaska ready to make a deal to end Russia's war against Ukraine.

"I believe now he's convinced that he's going to make a deal. He's going to make a deal. I think he's going to," Trump told Fox Radio. "And we're going to find out, I'm going to know very quickly."

Meanwhile, the White House has said Trump prefers diplomacy but is ready to increase economic pressure on Russia if necessary.

"Certainly, there are sanctions and many other measures that the president could utilize if he has to. Not that he wants to… diplomacy and negotiation have always been the way for this president," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Aug. 14.

Trump has previously said that if the Aug. 15 meeting goes well, he will seek a trilateral meeting between himself, Putin, and President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Russia has issued maximalist demands to Kyiv in previous direct peace talks, including that Ukraine give up its NATO aspirations and demilitarize.

Months earlier, U.S. attempts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia failed. Kyiv and Moscow later held three rounds of direct peace talks in Istanbul, which were largely inconclusive.

He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography.

Trump said he and Putin plan to discuss territorial exchanges in Ukraine, but Kyiv itself must make the decision. "But I'm not here to negotiate for Ukraine," the U.S. president said.

The corps claimed that Ukrainian units are operating inside the city, and civilians can move about, though travel within Pokrovsk remains heavily restricted. It is still possible to reach the city, the statement added. 

Russian officials have not named the cause of the explosion, but preliminary accounts reported by Russian media point to possible safety violations in the workshop. 

"This is a Russian tactic before any negotiations," Alina Alekseeva, the deputy head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, told the Kyiv Independent.

The Elysee Palace described the dialogue between the two leaders as "close and constant," but did not provide a specific date or location for the follow-up meeting.



Beka Museum urged immediate action, highlighting Russian President Vladimir Putin's role in the forced deportation of Ukrainian children and other atrocities committed under his rule. 

The issue concerns refugees who have lived in the country since Aug. 16, 2023, under the Uniting for Ukraine program, devised by the Biden administration to allow Ukrainians to stay in the country on humanitarian parole.



EU ministers could reportedly agree in early September to open the first negotiating cluster with Moldova, a key legal step toward membership, ahead of the country's Sept. 28 parliamentary elections. 

The Russian delegation will include Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, presidential aide Yuri Ushakov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, and Russian Direct Investment Fund head Kirill Dmitriev. 

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Alexander Darchiev have arrived in Alaska ahead of a planned Trump-Putin summit, Russian state media reported on Aug. 15.

"I believe now he's convinced that he's going to make a deal. He's going to make a deal. I think he's going to," U.S. President Donald Trump said.

U.S. President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska for a high-stakes summit that could determine not only the trajectory of the war in Ukraine but also the fate of European security.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have begun face-to-face talks in Alaska for a high-stakes summit that could determine the trajectory of the war in Ukraine and the fate of European security.

Trump's allies have cast the U.S. president as a heavyweight negotiator who can find a way to bring the slaughter to a close, something he used to boast he could do quickly. Trump has threatened “very severe consequences” if Putin does not agree to stop the war after the summit. 

For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia's territorial gains, block Kyiv's bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit.

There are significant risks for Trump: By bringing Putin onto U.S. soil, the president is giving Russia's leader the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. Any success is far from assured, especially as Russia and Ukraine remain far apart in their demands for peace.

What to know about the U.S.-Russia summit:









We're also following:








The Kremlin shared two clips of Putin and Trump smiling and talking before the two world leaders began their sit-down meeting in Alaska, alongside Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov.

Russian media outlets also shared images that appeared to show a bemused Putin raising his eyebrows in response to shouted questions from assembled reporters. At one point, Putin cupped his hands around his mouth and appeared to say something, although his voice could not be heard.

While Trump was meeting privately with his top aides and Putin, his political team sent out a fundraising email that said, “I'm meeting with Putin in Alaska!”

“It's a little chilly,” the fundraising pitch said. “THIS MEETING IS VERY HIGH STAKES for the world.”

It also said, “No one in the world knows how to make deals like me!” and encouraged people to donate, suggesting they start with $10.

It's because the former secretary of state said she'd nominate Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize herself if he negotiates an end to Russia's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to give up territory.

“Well, that was very nice,” Trump said when asked about Clinton's comment during an in-flight interview with Fox News Channel. “I may have to start liking her again.”

Trump and Clinton were presidential rivals in 2016 and have had a contentious relationship. Trump has also been angling to be awarded the prestigious peace prize.

The full Fox News interview is set to air later Friday.

Interviewed by Bret Baier of Fox News Channel aboard Air Force One as he flew to Alaska, Trump said he'd like to walk away from the meeting with a ceasefire.

He also said he'd like a second meeting on Russia's war in Ukraine.

“I wouldn't be thrilled if I didn't get it,” Trump said of a halt to hostilities between the countries. He said everyone tells him he won't get a ceasefire until a second meeting.

“So, we'll see what happens. I'm going to be, I won't be happy if I walk away without some form of a ceasefire,” he said.

The two leaders were seated in a room with their aides in front of a blue backdrop that had the words “Pursuing Peace” printed on it.

Trump and Putin were seated in the middle of the chair arranged in a horseshoe, with a small table between them with drinking glasses and paper.

They didn't take any questions but Trump said, “Thank you” to reporters who were briefly in the room.

The two leaders' motorcade made the short drive to a building on the base where they're expected to meet and hold a news conference later.

Both leaders got into the backseat of Trump's armored presidential limousine, chatting with each other and smiling as they got situated.

President Donald Trump greeted Russian leader Vladimir Putin at an air base in Alaska on Friday as a squadron of U.S. stealth military planes designed during the Cold War in part for use in a possible conflict with the Soviet Union flew overhead.

As Trump and Putin shook hands at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson outside Anchorage, F-22s and B2 bombers soared above. Neither plane entered active service until after the Cold War had ended but their design and development began during the 1970s and 1980s when the U.S.-Soviet rivalry was at its height.

The presence of the planes during the red carpet welcome afforded to Putin by summit host Trump may have been intended to remind the Russian leader of U.S. military might as the pair head in to talks focused on Russia's war with Ukraine.

Both leaders stood alongside each other, shaking hands again, appearing to exchange words and ignoring shouted questions from reporters on site.

The two men shook hands and smiled warmly as they greeted each other on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

Russian state news agencies Tass and RIA Novosti reported Friday that President Vladimir Putin will use Aurus, a high-end Russian-made limousine, in Alaska. 

The agencies posted footage of a black limousine with Russian license plates and a small Russian flag attached to the hood driving around the tarmac.

Putin brought Aurus on foreign trips before, and even gifted one to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last year.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov will join the Russian leader during his “three-on-three” meeting with Trump, Rubio and Witkoff.

Lavrov and Ushakov took part in the first in-person Russia-US talks in February this year.

The Russian president hasn't been to the United States since a 2015 meeting at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.

The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant on war crimes accusations for Putin in 2023. But the U.S. isn't a member of that global body, so officials are under no obligation to arrest him.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed, during a video address on Friday, his hope for a “strong position from the U.S.” ahead of talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska.

“Everyone wants an honest end to the war. Ukraine is ready to work as productively as possible to end the war, and we hope for a strong position from the U.S.,” Zelenskyy said.

The Ukrainian leader also stressed that Russia “is still killing people” despite the upcoming negotiations.

“The war continues and it continues precisely because there is no order, nor any signals from Moscow that it is preparing to end this war,” he added.

Trump has yet to leave Air Force One. 

He's meeting aboard the aircraft with Alaska U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, as well as Gov. Mike Dunleavy, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Russian state news agencies RIA Novosti and Tass report that a motorcade with top Russian officials who are part of the delegation has departed to the summit venue.

Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov said earlier that those joining the Russian president in Alaska will include himself, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Putin's envoy for investment and economic cooperation Kirill Dmitriev.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters aboard Air Force One that Trump won't be meeting Putin alone, as she had previewed earlier in the week, but instead will be joined the secretary of state and his special envoy.

Leavitt said it would be a three-on-three meeting instead of a one-on-one.

His planned lunch meeting with Putin was to include Rubio and Witkoff, along with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.

Alaska was part of the Russian empire until 1867, but Friday marks the first time a Russian leader has visited the area.

Alaska was colonized by Russia starting from the 18th century until Czar Alexander II sold it to the United States in 1867 for $7.2 million. When it was found to contain vast resources, it was seen by Russians as a naïve deal that generated remorse.

After the USSR's collapse, Alaska was a subject of nostalgia and jokes for Russians. One popular song in the 1990s went: “Don't play the fool, America … give back our dear Alaska land.”

Trump made those comments during a gaggle aboard Air Force One, noting that the Russian delegation includes businesspeople.

Trump also suggested that Russia's latest strikes on Ukraine represent Putin “trying to negotiate,” adding that any consequences for Russia would be “economically severe.”

President Donald Trump arrived in Alaska on Friday for a pivotal summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin that could reshape the war in Ukraine and relations between Moscow and Washington.

Trump was scheduled to meet Russia's president at his plane shortly. A large “Alaska 2025” sign, flanked by four parked fighter jets and red carpets, was placed on the tarmac at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage for the leaders' arrival. Trump and Putin have shared closely watched handshakes before— but the one they are expected to have Friday will be as scrutinized as any, as will any body language or hints about how each is feeling. 

The sit-down gives Trump a chance to prove to the world that he is both a master dealmaker and a global peacemaker. He and his allies have cast him as a heavyweight negotiator who can find a way to bring the slaughter to a close — something he used to boast he could do quickly.

Uniformed military members are now standing alongside the red carpet area, leading to the “Alaska 2025" sign and platform.

Minutes after Trump's plane landed, Air Force One moved by the scene as final preparations were being made.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin will lay flowers at the tomb of Soviet pilots in Alaska after his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.

An “Alaska 2025" sign and red carpet are ready on the base tarmac for the leaders' arrival.

The carpeting is lined on either side with fighter jets, parked at an angle,

The stage is set at Alaska's Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson for the planned joint news conference between the two leaders featuring a blue backdrop with the words “Pursuing Peace” throughout, including in large letters at the top.

An American flag and a Russian flag were seen on the stage next to two podiums.

The National Guard now assisting law enforcement in Washington, D.C. are under the direct control of President Donald Trump as delegated through Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the National Guard says.

Trump's authority is delegated through Hegseth and Secretary of the Army Gen. Leland Blanchard, the commanding officer of the D.C. Guard.

The direct coordination of the Guard's operations in Washington is being handled by Col. Larry Doan, the leader of the National Guard's D.C. task force. Doan's responsibilities include working with the Metropolitan Police Department and other federal agencies working on law enforcement in the district.

Unlike the 50 states, Washington is governed by federal laws including Title 32, which gives the president control over the Guard in the District of Columbia without the need to fully federalize Guard units.

The Trump administration can move ahead with firing the vast majority of the employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a panel of judges ruled on Friday. But the decision is being held for seven days while CFPB employees and their legal team file an appeal.

The D.C. Court of Appeals overturned a lower court's decision, which originally ruled that the White House's plan to fire roughly 80% of the CFPB's employees was effectively to “shut down” the CFPB. The court ruled that the employees, who sued in this case, did not have standing to argue the continued existence of the CFPB.

Since President Donald Trump was sworn into office, the CFPB has effectively been inoperable, and its employees have been banned from doing any work with plans to cut the bureau's employment to a skeleton crew of staff. Earlier courts had ruled that the Trump administration was effectively dismantling the agency without seeking Congress's approval for doing so.

Voting in favor of the 2-1 decision was Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both Trump appointees during his first term.

The decision is expected to be appealed to the full D.C. Court of Appeals.

In a snippet from an interview aboard Air Force One with Fox News Channel's Bret Baier posted on X, Trump predicted that his meeting with the Russian president would “work out very well — and if it doesn't, I'm going to head back home real fast.”

“I would walk, yeah,” he added, after a follow up question from Baier.Friday afternoon on social media, Trump posted a video clip from a gaggle also aboard the plane, in which he was asked what would make the summit a success.

“I want to see a ceasefire rapidly. I don't know if it's going to be today but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today,” Trump told reporters, as he stood in an aisle of the plane. “I'm in this to stop the killing.”

Russian media showed the foreign minister arriving in Anchorage on Friday wearing a sweater that appeared to have “CCCP” on it — the Russian initials for the Soviet Union.

Putin once famously called the USSR's 1991 collapse “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,” and critics have regularly accused him of seeking to restore the Russia-dominated Soviet Union. Putin has rejected these accusations, even though Moscow has sought to maintain or increase its influence on some of the former Soviet states.

General Alexus Grynkewich, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe is in Alaska to provide “military advice” to President Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, a senior NATO military official told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

Grynkewich, who is the commander of U.S and NATO forces in Europe, is a supporter of Ukraine and views Russia as a clear threat to European security. He has previously spoken of the need to get military aid into Kyiv quickly, including after President Trump said in July that NATO would be coordinating deliveries of U.S weapons. 

Grynkewich's presence in Alaska is likely to be welcomed by European leaders who have spent recent days trying to convince President Trump to be robust with President Putin and not to do a deal over Kyiv's head.

Immigrant advocates in Washington held a call Friday to share information about what people are reporting. 

Edith Hinson, an attorney for the Washington-based Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, said they are advising immigrants to measure risks if they must get behind the wheel or get a ride with a relative or friend who is a U.S. citizen and not to answer any questions as passengers.

“It's very unsettling, very troubling that, now moving forward, MPD is free and able to share information regarding everyone they encounter in a traffic stop with ICE,” Hinson said.

Anusce Sanai, associate legal director for the Washington-based immigrant nonprofit Ayuda, said that they are still parsing through the legal aspects of the new policy. Sanai says they have already seen increased police presence in Mount Pleasant, a Salvadoran enclave.

“We are triaging how to advise clients and the community at large. Even with the most anti-immigrant administration, we would always tell our clients that they must call the police, that they should call the police, but now we find ourselves that we have to be very careful on what we advise,” Sanai said.

Trump has promised a new emphasis on merit with his efforts to keep colleges from considering an applicant's race. But he's been silent on legacy admissions — the policies that give applicants a boost because of family ties.

Trump's complaints about systems he describes as “rigged” overlook this glaring instance in higher education — the edge given to children of alumni — said Richard Kahlenberg, a researcher at the Progressive Policy Institute think tank. 

“It's hard to think of a more flagrant way in which the system is rigged than legacy preferences,” Kahlenberg said.

Russian state news agency RIA Novosti on Friday quoted Kremlin spokesman Peskov as saying that the Putin-Trump talks could take at least 6-7 hours. 

Peskov also said that the two leaders will be accompanied by their aides during their one-on-one meeting, and that Russia hopes for the summit to bring about results. He didn't go into details.

Delegates from around the world adjourned Friday with no immediate plans to resume efforts to reach a major treaty to end the spread of plastic pollution. 

The consequence of this failure leaves no clear path for nations to collectively address the mountains of plastic filling landfills, clogging oceans and showing up in chunks on beaches and other public places.

“Consensus is dead,” said Bjorn Beeler, international coordinator for the International Pollutants Elimination Network.

More than 400 million tons of new plastic is produced each year around the planet, and that could grow by about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. 

About 100 countries want to limit production, but the United States and other oil-producing countries opposed any limits on making plastics from fossil fuels.

Police Chief Pamela Smith's statement came in a court filing Friday as the city seeks to block the federal takeover of its police department in court.

Smith said the Trump administration's order installing a federal official as “emergency police chief,” if allowed to stand, would upend command structure and be ‘dangerous' threat to law and order.

Washington's top legal official is seeking an emergency restraining order. District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.”

“If Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I'll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself,” the former U.S. secretary of State wrote on X.

Trump has already said he believes a peace deal would likely require the swapping of Ukrainian territories by both sides.

Clinton, Trump's 2016 Democratic opponent, linked to her appearance on the “Raging Moderates” podcast, where she offered Trump some advice: “He is not meeting with a friend. He is meeting with an adversary.”

But Clinton said that if Trump can negotiate a ceasefire, have Russia withdraw from the territory it seized and bring an end to the war without making Ukraine concede territory, she would join the Nobel lobbying.

Trump and his allies have been lobbying for years for him to get the prize.

Putin is scheduled to arrive at 11:00 a.m. local time Friday in Anchorage, where he will be met at the plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV, an excerpt of which was published on reporter Pavel Zarubin's Telegram channel on Friday. 

According to Peskov, during the four-hour flight from Magadan, Putin will review materials on Ukraine, bilateral tensions, economic cooperation, and global affairs.

The president posted on his social media network that he had “a wonderful talk” with the president of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko.

He said their “good” conversation included a discussion of Putin's visit.

Trump said they also spoke about the release of some prisoners earlier this year and the future release of prisoners. He did not offer details.

Trump said Russian drone attacks on civilian areas of Ukraine are a misguided effort to improve Putin's negotiating position.

“Maybe it's a part of the world. Maybe it's just his fabric, his genes, his genetics,” Trump told reporters traveling with him to the Alaska summit. “But he thinks that gives him strength in negotiating. I think it hurts him, but I'll be talking to him about it later.”

Trump also talked on Air Force One about economic benefits for Russia, while warning of more severe sanctions if the talks aren't fruitful.

“I noticed he's bringing a lot of business people from Russia, and that's good,” Trump said. “I like that because they want to do business, but they're not doing business until we get to war settled.”

Attorney General Pam Bondi's directive putting the DEA administrator in charge of D.C. police came after Police Chief Pam Smith updated guidance on arresting immigrants.

Smith had told Metropolitan Police Department officers to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. But she said other MPD policies remain in effect, limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants.

The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies.” Trump is testing the limits of his legal authorities, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to speed the mass deportation of people in the U.S. illegally.

The nation's capital challenged Trump's takeover of its police department in court on Friday after his administration named the DEA administrator as the new “emergency police chief.”

District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb accused Trump of going far beyond his legal authority and asked a judge to keep control of the police department in district hands.

“The administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call D.C. home. This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it,” Schwalb said.

DENVER (AP) — A group of rabbits in Colorado with grotesque, hornlike growths may seem straight out of a low-budget horror film, but scientists say there's no reason to be spooked — the furry creatures merely have a relatively common virus.

The cottontails recently spotted in Fort Collins are infected with the mostly harmless Shope papillomavirus, which causes wart-like growths that protrude from their faces like metastasizing horns.

Viral photos have inspired a fluffle of unflattering nicknames, including “Frankenstein bunnies,” “demon rabbits” and “zombie rabbits.” But their affliction is nothing new, with the virus inspiring ancient folklore and fueling scientific research nearly 100 years ago. 

The virus likely influenced the centuries-old jackalope myth in North America, which told of a rabbit with antlers or horns, among other animal variations. The disease in rabbits also contributed to scientists' knowledge about the connection between viruses and cancer, such as the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.

The virus in rabbits was named after Dr. Richard E Shope, a professor at The Rockefeller University who discovered the disease in cottontails in the 1930s.

News about the rabbit sightings in Fort Collins, 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver, started getting attention after residents started spotting them around town and posting pictures.

Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the agency has been getting calls about the rabbits seen in Fort Collins. 




But she said that it's not uncommon to see infected rabbits, especially in the summer, when the fleas and ticks that spread the virus are most active. The virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit but not to other species, including humans and pets, she said.

The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer, Van Hoose said. The growths don't harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating. Rabbits' immune systems are able to fight the virus and, once they do, the growths will disappear, she said.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem discusses I.C.E. recruitment efforts and the Trump administration's deportation policies on 'Hannity.'

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem temporarily relocated her personal residence as she's facing an increase in threats against her and "vicious doxxing," a department spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Friday. 

"Following the media's publishing of the location of Secretary Noem's Washington D.C. apartment, she has faced vicious doxxing on the dark web and a surge in death threats, including from the terrorist organizations, cartels, and criminal gangs that DHS targets. Due to threats and security concerns, she has been forced to temporarily stay in secure military housing," Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said. "Secretary Noem continues to pay rent for her Navy Yard residence.

 "It's a shame that the media chooses sensationalism over the safety of people enforcing America's laws to keep Americans safe," McLaughlin added.

Noem said last week that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents "are now facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them as they risk their lives to arrest the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens."

"We will not and have not let this violence stop us or slow us down. Everyday our law enforcement continues to enforce the law and arrest the most depraved criminals including pedophiles, terrorists, murderers, gang members, and sexual predators," she added in a post on X.

Forecasts are better than ever, and far more vulnerable than they should be.

Erin was upgraded Friday morning from a tropical storm to a hurricane, a storm with sustained winds above 74 miles per hour, making it the first hurricane of the 2025 season. Despite a relatively calm storm season until now, forecasters are still anticipating higher-than-normal levels of activity, and the peak of the hurricane season lies ahead.

The National Hurricane Center is predicting heavy rainfall across the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico through the weekend. The storm is projected to curve away from the US mainland, but parts of the East Coast are facing “significant risk of dangerous surf and rip currents along western Atlantic beaches next week.”

The hurricane season officially runs from June 1 until November 30 and typically has 14 storms strong enough to be named, meaning with wind speeds above 39 mph. This year is anticipated to be busier than usual, with forecasters expecting up to 18 named storms, and up to five that will turn into major hurricanes. That's due in part to the El Niño cycle, which is currently in its neutral phase, creating atmospheric conditions more favorable to tropical storms. The surface of the Atlantic Ocean remains at above-average temperatures, and since hurricanes are powered by hot water, Erin may become the first major hurricane of the year.

“As we enter the second half of the season, this updated hurricane outlook serves as a call to action to prepare now, in advance, rather than delay until a warning is issued,” acting NOAA Administrator Laura Grimm said in a news release.

But a tropical storm doesn't have to reach hurricane strength to cause death and destruction. The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry last month stalled over Texas, where they converged with another weather system and caused a massive downpour that led to deadly flooding in the state's hill country.

A key step to saving lives from tropical storms and hurricanes is to anticipate where they might go and get people out of the way. On this front, scientists have made tremendous strides in building longer lead times ahead of a storm's landfall, and new tools are continuing to extend that lead. But the Trump administration's recent cuts to departments that study and forecast weather are undermining this progress, while cuts to emergency agencies are slowing disaster responses.

Erin could be a major test of the results of these actions.

Meteorologists often describe hurricanes as heat engines, meaning that they use a temperature difference to generate wind and rain. But to start up, a hurricane needs sea surface temperatures to be around 80 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter. This is why the apex of hurricane activity tends to be in September, after the Atlantic Ocean has had all summer to heat up.

Generally, the hotter the water, the more powerful the resulting storm. “For every degree centigrade that you raise the ocean temperature, the wind speed in the hurricane goes up between 5 and 7 percent,” Kerry Emanuel, an emeritus professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Vox last year. With global average temperatures rising due to climate change, the potential for more powerful hurricanes is increasing.

A warmer planet also means rising sea levels as ice caps melt, adding more liquid to the seas. The ocean itself also expands as it gets hotter. So when a hurricane occurs, its winds create a larger storm surge as it pushes water inland. Warmer air can also hold onto more moisture, increasing the rainfall during a hurricane. The combined effects of storm surge and more intense rainfall can lead to more flooding, often the deadliest and most destructive aspect of a hurricane. And as the floods in Texas this year showed, even areas that are far inland can suffer severely from hurricane storm systems.

Since hurricanes spin counter-clockwise, these effects tend to be stronger on the right side of the storm — sometimes called the “dirty side” — where the wind is blowing in the same direction as the storm is moving.

On the other side of the equation, more people are living in the paths of hurricanes. In the US, about 40 percent of the population lives in a coastal county, and the numbers are growing. So when a hurricane makes landfall, it threatens more lives and takes a bigger bite out of the economy.

The good news is that scientists have made huge strides in anticipating hurricanes and can now predict where they are going days in advance. A modern hurricane track forecast looking 72 hours ahead is better than a 24-hour forecast in the early 90s. Last year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deployed a new prediction model called the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System. It proved to be better than previous models at predicting a storm's path and intensity.

In recent years, a number of hurricanes have undergone rapid intensification, where they gain more than 35 miles per hour in wind speed in less than 24 hours. It makes storms harder to predict, and makes evacuating people in their path more hasty and chaotic, as hurricanes surge in strength. Scientists are still trying to tease out the mechanisms behind rapid intensification, but the new model was able to see the rapid intensification coming in Hurricanes Helene and Milton from their earliest advisories, days before landfall.

But while NOAA has made improvements in its forecasts, the agency itself has faced big cuts from the Trump administration, including staff who work on hurricane modeling. The White House has proposed cutting its budget by a quarter, eliminating research divisions like the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which studies hurricanes. Several field offices for the National Weather Service under NOAA currently lack lead meteorologists, and key forecasting tools like weather balloon launches have seen a decline. The National Weather Service is now scrambling to hire back hundreds of employees. All of this adds an unnecessary layer of chaos to an already dangerous situation.

The true scope of these vulnerabilities won't be revealed until after a major hurricane. Already, emergency responders in some parts of the country are getting the message that help from higher up in the government isn't coming, while homeowners are getting the sense that they're on their own when facing extreme weather. And even if the US dodges the worst of Erin, there are still more than two months left in the hurricane season, which has yet to reach its peak.

Update, August 15, 2025, 1:40 pm ET: This story has been updated to include news of Erin's upgrade to hurricane status.

President Donald Trump's face-to-face high-stakes summit with President Vladimir Putin could determine the fate of European security as well as the trajectory of the war in Ukraine.

JOINT BASE ELMENDORF-RICHARDSON, Alaska (AP) — President Donald Trump is meeting face-to-face with Russia's Vladimir Putin on Friday for a pivotal Alaska summit that could reshape both the war in Ukraine and relations between Moscow and Washington.

The sit-down gives Trump a chance to prove to the world that he is both a master dealmaker and a global peacemaker. He and his allies have cast him as a heavyweight negotiator who can find a way to bring the slaughter to a close — something he used to boast he could do quickly.

For Putin, a summit with Trump offers a long-sought opportunity to try to negotiate a deal that would cement Russia's gains, block Kyiv's bid to join the NATO military alliance and eventually pull Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit. Despite having so much at stake, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders aren't invited.

There are significant risks for Trump. By bringing Putin onto U.S. soil — America bought Alaska from Russia in 1867 for 2 cents per acre — the president is giving him the validation he desires after his ostracization following his invasion of Ukraine 3 1/2 years ago. Zelenskyy's exclusion from Trump and Putin's first meeting is a heavy blow to the West's policy of “nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine” and invites the possibility that Trump could agree to a deal that Ukraine does not want.

Any success is far from assured because Russia and Ukraine remain far apart in their demands for peace. Putin has long resisted any temporary ceasefire, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies and a freeze on Ukraine's mobilization efforts, which were conditions rejected by Kyiv and its Western allies.




“HIGH STAKES!!!” Trump posted shortly before he boarded Air Force One for Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. 

On his way to the meeting, Putin stopped in Magadan, in Russia's Far East, where he visited a factory producing omega-3 fish oil capsules, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. Putin was reviewing materials on Ukraine, tensions with the U.S., economic cooperation and global affairs during his four-hour flight to Alaska, where he will be greeted at his plane by Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview with Russian state TV.

Trump and Putin have shared closely watched handshakes before — but Friday's will be as scrutinized as any, as will any body language or hints about how each is feeling. 

Trump on Thursday said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that if the meeting succeeds he could bring Zelenskyy to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting — a possibility that Russia hasn't agreed to.

When asked after arriving in Alaska about Trump's estimate of a 25% chance of failure, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters that Russia “never plans ahead.”

AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports President Trump has left for his Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin.

“We know that we have arguments, a clear, understandable position. We will state it,” he said in footage posted to the Russian Foreign Ministry's Telegram channel.

Trump said in a Fox News radio interview Thursday that he didn't know if they would get “an immediate ceasefire” but he wanted a broad peace deal done quickly. That seemingly echoes Putin's longtime argument that Russia favors a comprehensive deal to end the fighting, reflecting its demands, not a temporary halt to hostilities. 

The Kremlin said Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one discussion, followed by the two delegations meeting and talks continuing over “a working breakfast.” They are then expected to hold a joint press conference. 

In the days leading up to the summit, Trump described it as “ really a feel-out meeting.” But he's also warned of “very severe consequences” for Russia if Putin doesn't agree to end the war and said that though Putin might bully other leaders, “He's not going to mess around with me.”

Trump said Friday that his talks with Putin will include Russian demands that Ukraine cede territory as part of a peace deal. He said Ukraine has to decide, but he also suggested Zelenskyy should accept concessions. 

“I've got to let Ukraine make that decision. And I think they'll make a proper decision,” Trump told reporters traveling with him to Alaska. 

Trump said there's “a possibility” of the United States offering Ukraine security guarantees alongside European powers, “but not in the form of NATO.” Putin has fiercely resisted Ukraine joining the trans-Atlantic security alliance, a long-term goal for Ukrainians seeking to forge stronger ties with the West. 

Zelenskyy has time and again cast doubts on Putin's willingness to negotiate in good faith. His European allies, who've held increasingly urgent meetings with U.S. leaders over the past week, have stressed the need for Ukraine to be involved in any peace talks.

Political commentators in Moscow, meanwhile, have relished that the summit leaves Ukraine and its European allies on the sidelines.

Dmitry Suslov, a pro-Kremlin voice, expressed hope that the summit will “deepen a trans-Atlantic rift and weaken Europe's position as the toughest enemy of Russia.”

Foreign governments will be watching closely to see how Trump reacts to Putin, likely gauging what the interaction might mean for their own dealings with the U.S. president, who has eschewed traditional diplomacy for his own transactional approach to relationships.

The meeting comes as the war has caused heavy losses on both sides and drained resources. 

Ukraine has held on far longer than some initially expected since the February 2022 invasion, but it is straining to hold off Russia's much larger army, grappling with bombardments of its cities and fighting for every inch on the over 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line.

Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a senior fellow and director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, said U.S. antagonists like China, Iran and North Korea will be paying attention to Trump's posture to see “whether or not the threats that he continues to make against Putin are indeed credible.” 

“Or, if has been the past track record, he continues to back down and look for ways to wiggle out of the kind of threats and pressure he has promised to apply,” said Kendall-Taylor, who is a former senior intelligence officer.

While some have objected to the location of the summit, Trump has said he thought it was “very respectful” of Putin to come to the U.S. instead of a meeting in Russia.

Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin Moscow-based analyst, observed that the choice of Alaska as the summit's venue “underlined the distancing from Europe and Ukraine.”

Being on a military base allows the leaders to avoid protests and meet more securely, but the location carries its own significance because of its history and location. 

Alaska is separated from Russia at its closest point by just 3 miles (less than 5 kilometers) and the international date line. 

Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson was crucial to countering the Soviet Union during the Cold War. It continues to play a role today, as planes from the base still intercept Russian aircraft that regularly fly into U.S. airspace.

Trump has pushed out career experts and aides who challenged him.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

During Donald Trump's first term, his top advisers attempted to run a traditional process for shaping foreign policy, tapping experts from the White House's National Security Council, debating recommendations from across the government, and steering the president away from decisions that they feared would damage America's interests. But Trump was deeply mistrustful of the NSC, which he saw as too big, too cumbersome, and too attached to Republican orthodoxy.

Back in office, Trump has pushed away the help of career experts, and major decisions—the handling of the war in Gaza, for example, and negotiations over Ukraine—are now made by a tiny core group of loyal advisers, including Vice President J. D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Chief of Staff Susie WiIes, and one or two others. The president “is now fully the quarterback, and he doesn't want too many guys in the huddle,” a former official, who remains in close contact with the White House, told us. “And those that are there need to run the play he calls, no questions asked.”

This time, Trump has a better understanding of the levers of power and greater trust in his own instincts—he doesn't want to be slowed down by contrary viewpoints, according to nearly a dozen current and former White House officials, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a candid assessment of sensitive deliberations. Trump is more Trump in his global statecraft.

By shrinking the number of people involved in major decisions and making fealty the indispensable trait in selecting aides, Trump has pushed the system in a more personalized direction. The more centralized setup allows Trump's impulses—his disregard for historic alliances, his love of dealmaking, and his focus on perceived abuses of American largesse—to drive U.S. policy.

But by isolating his decision making, Trump has limited his ability to harness expertise, or to ensure that his decisions are executed by an often unwieldy bureaucracy. And by discarding a process designed to surface different views and analyze moves from all sides, he has increased the risk of unintended consequences.

From the June 2025 Issue: ‘I run the country and the world'

“On the one hand, this arrangement is much more nimble. The president is the decision maker,” said Victoria Coates, who served as deputy national security adviser during Trump's first term and continues to support Trump's foreign-policy moves. “But the downside is you don't have that NSC muscle to bludgeon the interagency into doing what you want.”

The risks of the new approach will be fully on display in Anchorage, Alaska, today, as Trump holds talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, giving an adversary a win without extracting much in return. Trump's first-term advisers would have counseled against the hastily arranged summit.

The consolidated setup has also led to policy whiplash—as was the case with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's on-again, off-again suspension of military aid to Ukraine in July, which confused officials at a moment when Trump was trying to dial up pressure on Moscow. It can also hamper problem-solving and policy innovation. Allied nations often struggle to navigate a system in which even high-ranking officials cannot provide clarity, because a wider array of decisions must be taken to the Oval Office, where Trump remains inscrutable and often erratic.

The White House defended the changes. Deputy Press Secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement that the NSC was now “more relevant and consequential than ever before, allowing the administration to execute the President's foreign policy agenda more effectively.” She cited the setbacks dealt to Iran's nuclear capability, the return of U.S. citizens detained overseas, and the peace deals that have included halts to India-Pakistan and Armenia-Azerbaijan hostilities.

Trump returned to the White House in January with a sense of vindication. He and his advisers also brought a scathing assessment of Joe Biden's foreign-policy record, blaming him for the humiliating end to the war in Afghanistan, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and other crises they vowed to put right. And they came armed with lessons about what had gone wrong the first time around, when Trump cycled through four national security advisers.

Trump remained regretful about the departure of the one he trusted most: Michael Flynn, who stepped down less than a month into Trump's first term over his undisclosed ties to Russia. In the years that followed, Trump felt stage-managed by H. R. McMaster and then John Bolton. (He was mostly fine with his final national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, who was more in sync with Trump's preference for a limited role for the NSC.)

From the July 2025 Issue: The talented Mr. Vance

McMaster and Bolton didn't love the experience either. McMaster grew exasperated with what he called the “adhocracy” of disjointed deliberations that yielded rushed executive orders or other chaotic steps. Bolton later wrote that discussions of consequential trade issues, which occurred in weekly gab sessions rather than orderly meetings, “more closely resembled college food fights than careful decision-making.” Throughout, both men enlisted senior administration figures like James Mattis, John Kelly, and Mike Pence to redirect Trump or talk him out of what they saw as particularly counterproductive moves, such as reneging on America's commitment to stand by NATO allies.

But the man Trump chose as national security adviser after his reelection, Representative Michael Waltz of Florida, was an awkward fit from the start. Some of Trump's long-serving aides viewed the former Green Beret, who once was an aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, with suspicion, pegging him as a hard-liner on Russia and Iran and overly beholden to traditional foreign partners.

Waltz continued to adhere to a conventional process—in which NSC staff convene a series of high-level discussions with officials from across government agencies to tee up policy options for the president—but struggled to navigate the West Wing's deep mistrust of his staff. At certain points, turf wars flared with the West Wing over foreign-leader visits and who would control the president's schedule and time. By May, even senior subject-matter experts were sometimes left out of the loop on visits by senior officials from regions within their portfolios, one former official said.

This former official said that Waltz's subordinates had doubts from the beginning about the weight his determinations carried with the president. “You'd coordinate the interagency; you'd come to a consensus; the national security adviser would make a decision,” he said. And then nothing further would be heard; NSC staff would have no idea if their policy advice was being adopted or even read in the West Wing. “It needed to be tabled until you could get a decision or opinion from the president.”

In early April, the administration abruptly fired half a dozen NSC officials after Laura Loomer, the far-right activist, accused them of not being supportive enough of the president's agenda. Some of those dismissed included staffers close to Waltz, illustrating his inability to shield them.

Waltz's departure may have been inevitable, but it was hastened when the national security adviser accidentally added The Atlantic's editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, to a text chat on Signal in which Waltz and other officials shared sensitive plans for bombing Yemen on March 15.

The security breach and Waltz's response—he claimed on Fox News that Goldberg's number had somehow been “sucked” onto his phone—provided further ammunition for his West Wing rivals. By early May, Waltz was gone, nominated to represent the administration at the United Nations. (Waltz, who gave up his congressional seat to serve in the White House, has not yet been confirmed. He did not respond to a request for comment.)

Rubio, meanwhile, got an additional job. To the surprise of those who expected friction between Trump and his 2016 Republican-primary rival, whom the president once derided as “Little Marco,” Rubio's style as interim national security adviser has gained purchase with the president and those around him.

White House officials defended using the secretary of state in this role, saying it made for quicker decisions and better operational security, pointing to Trump's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in June. One White House official told us that the dual position is Rubio's as long as he wants it. “He knows his subject matter better than just about anybody in the government,” the official said.

Tommy Pigott, a spokesperson for the State Department, said that Rubio and the department back Trump's “America First” agenda and are “proud to support him as he leads our country in a golden era of American diplomacy.”

Rubio has likened the NSA role to the conductor of an orchestra of Cabinet members. “The president picks the music; the instruments play off the same sheet; and it's the job of the conductor to make sure everyone's playing—that every instrument's playing correctly and playing together,” he said last week.

Rubio quickly restructured the NSC, which had grown to more than 300 people in recent years. By late May, 100 staffers had been dismissed and numerous NSC offices had been closed or consolidated. Vance's aide Andy Baker and Wiles's aide Robert Gabriel, both of whom were named deputy national security advisers in May, are now key figures in managing the smaller, more streamlined NSC.

In addition to the core decision team of Trump, Vance, Rubio, and Wiles, Stephen Miller plays a key role on issues related to homeland security. On decisions involving Russia and Israel, envoy Steve Witkoff is included. And on military matters, the president pulls in Hegseth and General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

One of the former officials said that Trump would have likely retained a more robust NSC and a less centralized setup if Waltz had survived. He said that Waltz's departure allowed for the sort of restructuring long sought by some of Trump's West Wing advisers, for whom the shadow of the 2019 impeachment and the potential for “deep state” figures—like Alexander Vindman, the Ukraine expert and Army officer who testified against Trump—to constrain the president continued to loom large.

“It was an opportunity that they seized,” the former official said. “‘Let's do it, and go after the ghost of Vindman.'”

Trump's new setup is a stark contrast to Barack Obama's “team of rivals,” which encouraged debate and sometimes sparring between different agencies as the chief executive sought to tease out the best approach. While that kind of debate could sometimes lead to never-ending interagency discussion, as many of his advisers later complained, it had the advantage of enabling a more exhaustive analysis of policy pros and cons. That sort of process might have helped Trump avoid some of the legal challenges his administration has faced to its rapid-fire executive orders and its rushed efforts to dismantle federal agencies, and helped minimize the commercial disruption that has resulted from his tariff pronouncements.

Mark Montgomery, a retired Navy rear admiral and former NSC official now at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told us the centralized setup discourages contrarian viewpoints. “And you're not going to surface any problems until they really surface,” he said.

Nick Miroff and Jonathan Lemire: Stephen Miller has a plan

Another former official noted that as Trump sought to intensify competition with China during his first term, a more diffuse system and more empowered agencies allowed a host of military, commercial, and diplomatic initiatives to bubble up.

“None of that is happening” now, the former official said. “This time, the principle is that the only things that are done are things specifically directed by the president.”

Some current and former officials fear the setup may also mean inadequate vetting of questionable ideas, such as Trump's announcement earlier this month that he had repositioned two nuclear submarines in response to bellicose remarks by former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin ally. It caught many in the Pentagon by surprise; neither the White House nor the military typically publicly discusses submarine movements. Even after the fact, some Pentagon officials said they weren't sure whether the submarines had already been scheduled to move or not.

To achieve strategic deterrence, the Navy's ballistic-missile fleet relies on stealth. “That's the whole fucking point of submarines. You don't know where they are,” one defense official explained.

            The US military is deploying more than 4,000 Marines and sailors to the waters around Latin America and the Caribbean as part of a ramped-up effort to combat drug cartels, two US defense officials told CNN — a dramatic show of force that will give the president a broad range of military options should he want to target drug cartels.
    


            The deployment of the Iwo Jima Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit to US Southern Command, which has not been previously reported, is part of a broader repositioning of military assets to the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility that has been underway over the last three weeks, one of the officials said.
    


            A nuclear-powered attack submarine, additional P8 Poseidon reconnaissance aircraft, several destroyers and a guided-missile cruiser are also being allocated to US Southern Command as part of the mission, the officials said.
    


            A third person familiar with the matter said the additional assets are “aimed at addressing threats to US national security from specially designated narco-terrorist organizations in the region.”
    


            On Friday, the US Navy announced the deployment of the USS Iwo Jima, the 22nd MEU, and the two other ships in the Amphibious Ready Group — the USS Fort Lauderdale and the USS San Antonio — but did not say where they were going.
    


            One of the officials emphasized that the military buildup is for now mostly a show of force, aimed more at sending a message than indicative of any intention to conduct precision targeting of cartels. But it also gives US military commanders — and the president — a broad range of options should Trump order military action. The ARG/MEU, for example, also features an aviation combat element.
    


            The deployment of the Marine Expeditionary Unit, however, has raised concerns among some defense officials who worry that the Marines are not trained to conduct drug interdictions and counter drug-trafficking. If that is part of their mission set, they will have to lean heavily on the Coast Guard, officials said.
    


            MEUs have been instrumental in the past in supporting large-scale evacuation operations; a MEU was stationed for months in the eastern Mediterranean, for example, amid tensions between Israel, Hamas and Iran.
    


            A Marine official told CNN that the MEU “stands ready to execute lawful orders and support the combatant commanders in the needs that are requested of them.”
    


            The US military deployed destroyers to the areas around the US-Mexico border in March to support US Northern Command's border security mission and reinforce the US' presence in the western hemisphere. The additional assets being moved now, however, will fall under US Southern Command, and are set to support SOUTHCOM for at least the next several months, one of the officials said.
    


            CNN previously reported that a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier this year stated that the US military's “foremost priority” is to defend the homeland, and instructed the Pentagon to “seal our borders, repel forms of invasion including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities, and deport illegal aliens in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security.”
    


            The same memo also formally asked Pentagon officials for “credible military options” to ensure unfettered American access to the Panama Canal, CNN reported at the time.

Taylor Swift breaks the internet on her boyfriend's podcast, and Will Cain still doesn't get how she became this generation's Elvis. Plus, Julian Epstein joins to unpack why Democrats keep leaning left, even as voters pull away from their agenda.

Taylor Swift on Wednesday opened up about how Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, and others, influenced her to eventually date superstar tight end Travis Kelce.

Reid said in 2023 that he was the one who had set the two up and admitted on OutKick that while he had been joking about it at the time, he slyly suggested it was kind of true. Swift talked more about how Reid and others close to Kelce had been in her ear about the potential romance.

"When you guys did the full send on the podcast, and he was like, ‘You wanna date me?' And everybody heard it, it was the ‘shooting your shot heard ‘round the world.' Basically, everyone who likes you (Travis), which is a lot of people, started reaching out to everyone who knows me," she said on "New Heights." 

"I think it was like Andy was vouching, I think it was my relatives, my cousins, they were like, ‘Please, please, please, he's amazing.' There were friends who were like, ‘He's actually an amazing guy, he's so great.' There was a lot of kind of people whispering in my ear about you. Actually, that's not normal. There are people just willing to go to bat for you. ‘You don't understand this guy's incredible.'"

The romance blossomed from there, but it was the initial relationship between Reid and Swift's father, Scott, that laid the foundation of her future.

Swift grew up in Pennsylvania and a relationship was struck between Reid and Scott Swift when the head coach was at the helm of the Philadelphia Eagles.

"He's been friends with my dad," she said of Reid. "My dad is the most social man who's ever been born. He's just a maniac. He would make a friend in an airport in 1971, have a five-minute conversation and still be talking to that dude twice a week, now. But he's like that with everyone he meets. He's able to have very many, very meaningful relationships. It's a skill.

"So, he knows Andy, and Andy's been coming to shows for years and stuff like that. So, I've always had a really positive vibe about Andy Reid. I didn't really know what the sports thing he was doing but I knew that was my dad's friend Andy Reid. I now know he's the most iconic, legendary coach of all time."

Swift had very kind words to say about the longtime head coach and his leadership skills.

"And like from the way that you (Travis) talk about him, his leadership style, I respect it so much, because I feel like it's done without aggression, raising your voice or losing your composure. It's all very composed and focused. . . . It's not overdone, right? If you get it from him, you know you deserve it, and you'll shape up."

Former President Barack Obama on Thursday sought to flip the script on accusations that he backs gerrymandering as he defended Democrats for launching retaliatory redistricting plans responding to Texas Republicans' battle to redraw their state's congressional map.

The Texas GOP attracted fierce backlash from Democrats in the state House when it recently announced an agenda seeking to boost Republicans' majority in the U.S. House by up to five seats through redrawing district lines. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) was among Republicans who accused Democrats of hypocrisy with their reaction, saying that leaders in the party, among them Obama, have spearheaded their own gerrymandering efforts to benefit the Left. DeSantis has particularly gone after former Attorney General Eric Holder, who launched the Obama-backed National Democratic Redistricting Committee in 2016, seeking to give Democrats an opportunity to create more favorable district maps across 12 states after the 2020 census.

However, Obama this week framed his stance as necessary to prevent “a systematic assault on democracy,” during a roughly 30-minute video call with Texas House Democrats and Holder, now the chairman of the NDRC. Moves by Democrats in California and elsewhere to redraw the congressional maps in favor of the party are a necessary last-ditch effort to “balance out the maps” in response to the “highly irregular” mid-decade “gerrymandering” from Texas Republicans, Obama argued during the Zoom meeting.

The former president contended that while he favors independent commissions or “neutral” approaches to drawing up districts, the actions of Texas Republicans have forced Democrats such as Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) into a corner where they are forced to respond with similar plans, an argument echoed by allies such as Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and the California governor.

“We can't let a systematic assault on democracy just happen and stand by, and so because of your actions, because of your courage, what you've seen is California responding, other states looking at what they can do to offset this mid-decade gerrymandering,” Obama said, according to CNN.

“The problem that we've been seeing, not just recently, but this goes back a while, is that the Republicans increasingly recognize their ideas won't sell, so we've got to fix the game a little bit, and by drawing maps that splinter Democratic voting blocs, by packing in Democrats into one district so that they don't have influence in other districts,” Obama added. “My hope is that rather than have a race to the bottom where every district is predetermined based on how it's drawn, that over time, the American people, ideally with the help of the courts, realize that there's a better way.”

Texas House Minority Leader Gene Wu thanked Obama for meeting with lawmakers in a post on X.

​​“We are encouraged by your words and remain committed to fighting for democracy, in Texas & across the country,” Wu said.

Gerrymandering is a tactic commonly used by both sides of the aisle to boost margins of political power.

NEWSOM TO CALL NOVEMBER SPECIAL ELECTIONS TO APPROVE NEW CONGRESSIONAL MAPS

In states such as Maryland, Illinois, and California, lawmakers have drawn up districts composed of voters more likely to vote for Democrats.

North Carolina, Texas, and Florida are among the states where Republicans have gained more dominance through partisan redistricting efforts.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The nation's capital sued to block President Donald Trump's takeover of its police department in court on Friday, hours after his administration escalated its intervention into the city's law enforcement by naming a federal official as the new emergency head of the department.

Washington's police department chief said Trump's move would threaten law and order by upending the command structure. “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing.

The legal battle playing out Friday showed the escalating tensions in a mostly Democratic city that now has its police department under the control of the Republican presidential administration that exists in its midst. Trump's takeover of the police department is historic yet had played out with a slow ramp-up in federal law enforcement officials and National Guard troops to start the week. 

As the weekend approached, though, signs across the city — from the streets to the legal system — suggested a deepening crisis over who controls the city's immigration and policing policies, the district's right to govern itself and daily life for the millions of people who live and work in the metro area.

Washington's top legal official was pushing in court Friday to reverse the order putting the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in charge of police in the nation's capital. 




District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb argues the police takeover is illegal and threatens to “wreak operational havoc.” Conflicting commands and confusion about who's in charge are a serious problem for effective policing, Smith said. 

The lawsuit comes after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday night DEA boss Terry Cole will assume the police chief's duties and approval authority for any orders issued to officers. It was unclear where the move left the city's current police chief, Smith, who works for the mayor.

Schwalb argues the new order goes beyond Trump's authority and implementing it would “sow chaos” in the Metropolitan Police Department. “The administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call D.C. home,” Schwalb said. 

The Justice Department declined to comment on the district's lawsuit, and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.

The police takeover is the latest move by Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the United States illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city's homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities, and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the Trump administration has portrayed.

Schwalb had said late Thursday that Bondi's directive was “unlawful,” arguing it could not be followed by the city's police force. He wrote in a memo to Smith that “members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” setting up the legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

The district's attorney general is an elected position and the city's top legal officer. It's separate from the federal U.S. attorney appointed by the president to serve in Washington, a role now filled by former Fox News Channel host and judge Jeanine Pirro. Trump also appointed Bondi as U.S. attorney general, the nation's top law enforcement official.

Bondi's directive came even after Smith had told MPD officers hours earlier to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody, such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies,” which generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers.

Bondi said she was rescinding that order and other MPD policies limiting inquiries into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, Bondi said.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back Thursday, writing on social media “there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.”

The president has more power over the nation's capital than other cities, but D.C. has elected its own mayor and city council since the Home Rule Act was signed in 1973.

Trump is the first president to exert control over the city's police force since it was passed. The law limits that control to 30 days without congressional approval, though Trump has suggested he'd seek to extend it. Schwalb argues the president's role is narrow under the law, limited to requiring the mayor to provide police services for federal purposes.

A population already tense from days of ramp-up has begun seeing more significant shows of force across the city. National Guard troops watched over some of the world's most renowned landmarks, and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where was often unclear.

Twenty federal law enforcement teams had fanned out across the city Thursday night with more than 1,750 people joining the operation, said a White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the operation. They made 33 arrests, including 15 migrants who did not have permanent legal status, the official said. Others were arrested on warrants for murder, rape and driving under the influence.

Department of Homeland Security police stood outside Nationals Park during a game Thursday between the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. DEA agents patrolled The Wharf, a popular nightlife area, while Secret Service officers were seen in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood.

Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha's Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

The uptick in visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, has been striking to residents going about their lives.

Officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.'s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump started in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

Troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control, National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.

National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. They have regularly been used in the past for crowd control in and around Metro stations.

HONG KONG (AP) — The final arguments in prominent Hong Kong activist Jimmy Lai's national security trial were postponed Friday after his lawyer said the former pro-democracy newspaper founder had experienced heart palpitations and the judges wanted him to receive medical treatment first.

Lai, the 77-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, was arrested in 2020 under a national security law imposed by Beijing following anti-government protests in 2019. He faces charges of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiring with others to issue seditious publications. If convicted, he faces up to life imprisonment. 

Lai's landmark case — which has already lasted over 140 days, far beyond the original estimate of 80 days — is widely seen as a trial of press freedom and a test for judicial independence in the Asian financial hub.

Closing statements were initially scheduled to begin on Thursday, but were postponed due to heavy rains from Tropical Storm Podul.

On Friday, Lai's lawyer, Robert Pang, told the court that Lai felt unsteady and had experienced heart palpitations. Pang said his client does not want to disturb the court proceedings.

Judge Esther Toh said Lai had not received medication and a heart monitor, as recommended by a medical specialist. The judges decided to postpone the hearing until Monday.

When Lai entered the courtroom, he smiled and nodded at people sitting in the public gallery. 




His detention has drawn attention from foreign governments. U.S. President Donald Trump, before the election last November, was asked whether he would talk to Chinese leader Xi Jinping to seek Lai's release, and Trump said: “One hundred percent, I will get him out.”

In a Fox News radio interview released Thursday, Trump denied saying he would “100%” save Lai. “I said, 100%, I'm going to be bringing it up. And I've already brought it up, and I'm going to do everything I can to save him,” he said.

Lai's son and rights groups have voiced concerns about his health. His son Sebastien Lai earlier told reporters in Washington that he fears his father could pass away at any time. 

On Tuesday, global media watchdog Reporters Without Borders said Lai has been held in solidarity confinement for over 1,680 days and that his health is deteriorating. In a statement, it called for the international community to take action to ensure the immediate release of Lai and six other former Apple Daily executives involved in the case. 

But the Hong Kong government rejected in a statement on Wednesday what it called “slanderous remarks” by external forces, including “anti-China media organizations,” about the case and Lai's custody treatment.

On Friday night, it condemned what it described as inaccurate and incomplete reports by foreign media outlets, alleging the articles had attempted to mislead the public into thinking that Lai had not received the necessary medical care. The acts were despicable and violated professional journalistic ethics, it said. 

The statement said Lai's lawyer confirmed to the court that his client received daily medical check-ups in custody and had no complaints about the medical care provided, with the judge saying the correctional services department deserves praise. 

After Lai said he suffered palpitations, a medical examination found no abnormalities, but the doctor, as a precaution, suggested he wear a heart monitor and recommended prescribing medication to be taken as needed, it said. 

“Doctors had repeatedly confirmed Jimmy Lai was physically and mentally fit to attend the court hearing before his appearance,” it said. 

Ahead of the hearing, dozens of people lined up outside the court building to secure a seat in the main courtroom. Some of them also waited for hours in heavy rain on Thursday before the postponement, including resident Margaret Chan.

Chan, who arrived before 5:30 a.m. on Friday, said Lai's case showed the world the decline in Hong Kong's press freedom.

“To me, he's a great person. He made such a big sacrifice. He's so rich. He could have predicted this, and he could have left,” said Chan.

Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on the Justice Department's takeover of Washington, D.C.'s police department on 'Special Report.'

The D.C. attorney general on Friday sued the Trump administration over its federal takeover of the D.C. police force and its deployment of national guard troops into the city, arguing that the effort is "unlawful" and exceeds Trump's authority as commander in chief. 

The lawsuit, filed Friday by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, challenges Trump's executive order to temporarily federalize D.C. under Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act, and Attorney General Pam Bondi's more recent order Thursday that seeks to install the DEA head as the emergency commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Force — arguing the moves are unprecedented, "brazenly unlawful," and could "wreak operational havoc" on the Metropolitan Police Department.

In the filing, submitted to federal court in D.C., Schwalb urged the court to block both of the administration's orders, stating that the Trump administration's temporary takeover of D.C. police under Section 740 of the D.C. Home Rule Act "does not authorize this brazen usurpation of the District's authority over its own government."

"They infringe on the District's right to self-governance and put the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk." he said. 

SHELTERS, JESUS, AND MISS PAC-MAN: US JUDGE GRILLS DOJ OVER TRANS POLICY IN DIZZYING LINE OF QUESTIONING

Schwalb also asked the court to grant emergency relief in the form of a temporary restraining order, or TRO, that would block Trump's order from taking force immediately while the court considers the merits of the case. 

The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee, who in turn ordered both parties to appear in court Friday afternoon at 2 p.m. to weigh the emergency request. 

The position is likely to land Reyes, who also presided over a lawsuit involving Trump's ban on transgender service members, back in Trump's crosshairs for the second time in less than eight months.

Reyes issued a preliminary injunction blocking Trump's ban on transgender service members from taking force, prompting Trump allies to label her as an "activist" judge, even after the injunction was overturned by a higher court. 

The Justice Department also filed a misconduct complaint against Reyes earlier this year, citing her remarks towards government lawyers. Reyes has something of a reputation for her sharp, fast-paced style of questioning, however, and employed it readily as she grilled lawyers for the plaintiffs as well. The chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Sri Srinivasan, has never taken action on the complaint.

Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a court filing Friday that Trump's order is "endangering the safety of the public and law enforcement officers."

"In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive," she said in the court filing seeking emergency intervention.

The lawsuit comes five days after Trump issued an executive order to temporarily federalize D.C., which he described as an effort to "reestablish law order and public safety" and temporarily federalize the city, which he described Monday as "one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world."

That order included deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops into the city, and temporarily taking federal control of D.C.'s police force. 

TRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT

On Thursday, Bondi expanded on that effort by ordering the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terry Cole, be installed as the "emergency" commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Force, sidelining current Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith.

"By declaring a hostile takeover of MPD, the Administration is abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the District's right to self-governance and putting the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk," Schwalb said in a statement Friday. 

"The Administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call DC home," he added. "This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it."

The lawsuit caps a heated week in the nation's capital, as President Donald Trump and White House officials have assailed what they describe as a "ridiculous" amount of crime in D.C. 

White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told NewsNation in an interview earlier this week that Washington, D.C., "is more violent than Baghdad." They have alleged recent data — which found a 26% decline in violent crime between 2023 and 2024 — has been "manipulated" or underreported. 

Just hours earlier, the Trump-linked America First Legal Foundation (AFL) filed a FOIA request seeking all crime records and data compiled by the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, as part of an effort to scrutinize information and crime statistics at issue.

Meanwhile, critics have excoriated Trump's executive order, which they argue is not based on an uptick in crime or an "emergency" — but rather, serves as justification for the administration to push through its sweeping executive action outside the normal policymaking process.

Norm Eisen, the former White House ethics czar under President Barack Obama, told reporters Thursday that Trump's order in D.C. is the latest in a "pattern of assaults on the rule of law" in his second term as president.

 Trump "has declared a fake emergency" in D.C., Eisen said.  "There is no ‘emergency' upon which this action with MPD or the federal military is predicated" in D.C., Eisen said. "In fact, crime has been dropping in D.C."

Trump in March signed an executive order, "Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force," designed to address issues with a city he has long derided as "filthy," "horribly run" and "crime-ridden," among other things.

"We want to have a great, safe capital," he told reporters earlier this year. "And we're going to have it. And that includes cleanliness, and it includes other things."

New England Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel apparently got his birthday punches after he attempted to break up a fight during the team's joint practice with the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday. 

The head coach, who turned 50 on Thursday, was captured on video getting knocked to the ground after he threw himself in the middle of a scuffle on the field in an attempt to break it up.

Video shared on social media showed two NFL players on the ground scrapping after the whistles were blown.

That quickly turned into a pile up of players, and Vrabel wasn't far behind. 

As the scrum of people moved on the field, Vrabel was momentarily knocked down in the process. The fight quickly settled down and there were no reported injuries. 

Speaking to the media earlier in the day, Vrabel seemingly offered an explanation for the tense nature of joint practices.

"These practices are like a game – we've said that. There's ups and downs. We hit some plays. They hit some plays."

However, Thursday's practice wasn't the first time Vrabel had involved himself in a practice fight. Earlier this month, during a joint practice with the Washington Commanders, Vrabel stepped in to try and break up another fight. 

ESPN reported at the time that Vrabel walked away with a bloodied cheek.

Leading authorities in the District of Columbia on Thursday rebuffed attempts by the Trump administration to further federalize its law enforcement by appointing an “emergency police commissioner.”

Amid President Donald Trump's push to reduce crime in the district by sidelining its prized home rule status, Attorney General Pam Bondi stripped power from its Metropolitan Police Department, tapping Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terry Cole to assume all responsibilities carried by MPD Chief Pamela Smith.

The move prompted swift backlash from Mayor Muriel Bowser and D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who argued there is no legal basis for Bondi's order. Their rhetoric marks an escalation in tensions between the White House and district officials, who had been largely amicable to President Donald Trump's effort to target violence and crime in the capital.

“Let us be clear about what the law requires during a Presidential declared emergency: it requires the mayor of Washington, DC to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes at the request of the President,” Bowser said in a statement Thursday night highlighting a letter from Schwalb contending only Smith, not Cole, is legally qualified to exercise the duties of police chief.

“We have followed the law,” Bowser continued. “In reference to the U.S. Attorney General's order, there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.”

In addition to stripping Smith of police authorities, Bondi's order, titled “Restoring Safety and Security to the District of Columbia,” targeted the district's leaders and the MPD for policies viewed as sanctuary city protections shielding illegal immigrants.

“Residents of the District of Columbia, the thousands of Americans who commute into the District for work every day, and the millions of tourists from all over the world who visit our nation's capital have a right to feel safe and to be free from the scourge of violent crime,” her order reads.

When pressed for comment on Bondi's directive, an MPD spokesperson pointed the Washington Examiner to Bowser's statement and Schwalb's letter to Smith telling the police chief she is not legally obligated to follow the Trump administration's order to cede control to Cole.

“We understand there may be questions about recent decisions regarding the Metropolitan Police Department,” the spokesperson said. “What's most important for our community to know is that MPD remains committed to delivering high-quality police service and ensuring the safety of everyone in our city.”

The battle over control of Washington launched in earnest on Monday, when Trump invoked Section 740 of the 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act, allowing federal control for 30 days, with congressional approval required for extensions.

Trump and his allies have argued that said federal intervention is warranted to resolve the crime problems that have dogged the district for years. Problems surged in 2020 when D.C. Councilman Charles Allen, who represents Ward 6, which includes Capitol Hill, spearheaded measures responding to George Floyd's death that instituted sweeping criminal justice reforms and significantly softened penalties for crimes, critics contend. Some of the laws have since been rolled back, with crime metrics showing improvement in recent months.

“Washington, D.C., has one of the Highest Rates of Crime in the World, more than many of the most violent Third World Countries,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Wednesday.

“The City's Homicide Rate is higher than places notorious for their violence, such as Mexico City, Bogota, Islamabad, and Addis Ababa — Almost ten times higher than Fallujah, Iraq,” he continued. ” … The Violent Crime Rate in D.C. has worsened, and the Murder Rate has essentially DOUBLED in just over a decade — But these are only the ‘official' statistics released by corrupt City Officials. The REAL numbers are many times worse. … Now, D.C. is back under Federal Control where it belongs. The White House is in charge. The Military and our Great Police will liberate this City, scrape away the filth, and make it safe, clean, habitable and beautiful once more!”

            In March, Kroger's CEO resigned from his corner-office role after nearly five decades at the company — an abrupt exit that left questions and $11 million on the table. Now, a lawsuit involving '90s folk sensation Jewel could bring some answers.
    


            Rodney McMullen, who joined Kroger in 1978, left after an internal investigation into “his personal conduct,” the grocer said in a statement at the time. The Cincinnati-based company had kept the details tightly under wraps.
    


            A lawsuit from 2023 might push Kroger or McMullen himself to reveal those details. In legal filings, the plaintiffs — which include a company co-owned by singer-songwriter Jewel Kilcher — accused Kroger of breach of contract over a wellness festival partnership. McMullen isn't a defendant in the lawsuit, but he was identified as a trial witness.
    


            McMullen and his lawyer refused to answer questions about his resignation during deposition this year and requested a protective order to bar questioning on the “embarrassing” topic, as described by his lawyer in court documents. But an Ohio judge had ordered McMullen to submit a written response by August 8 about his resignation, including the names of people involved.
    


            There will be “incredible consequences… if this ever gets out,” McMullen's lawyer, Jeffrey Hinebaugh, said in front of the judge in May.
    


            Hinebaugh added that “having to sit there and explain to people something that's completely unrelated and personal is the embarrassment.”
    


            The plaintiffs, meanwhile, said these questions are “routine” and could reveal the corporate culture at Kroger.
    


Kroger's CEO abruptly resigns after probe into personal conduct



            “We respect the court's thoughtful ruling, and we're pleased that the court is not giving Mr. McMullen a free pass to avoid testifying just because the former CEO's lawyer says that answering questions would be embarrassing,” Brian O'Connor, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement to CNN.
    


            CNN has reached out to Hinebaugh for comment. Kroger declined to comment.
    


            However, the public will not get its eyes on McMullen's written response. If the court grants the protective order, the statement will be made part of the record kept under seal – meaning it's only available under judicial eyes. And if the court denies the request, then the written disclosure won't be entered into the record at all.
    


            But if the court decides to deny the request, more information on McMullen's resignation may come out because the plaintiff's lawyers would be able to question the ex-CEO on the topic. A trial is set for May 2026.
    


            Jewel had come up with an idea for a wellness festival alongside Trevor Drinkwater, CEO of Inclusion Companies. Drinkwater's company already had experience creating other retail-sponsored, celebrity-backed festivals like Bentonville Film Festival.
    


            Jewel and Drinkwater then decided to partner with Kroger on the “Wellness Your Way” festivals for five years, according to the lawsuit. There was no formal agreement, but rather an agreement over email in June 2018 since Drinkwater's company would take the financial risk, the lawsuit said.
    


 Festivals under the partnership took place from 2018 to 2021, and Jewel performed a total of 12 times and and participated in 45 panels at these events, according to a legal complaint. But after the festivals became profitable, Kroger replaced Drinkwater and Jewel's company with one run by Kroger executive Colleen Lindholz's sister, legal filings allege. The plaintiffs argue this violated Kroger's business ethics policy. 



            “(Lindholz) also informed (Drinkwater) that the festival had become Kroger's premiere annual corporate event, the CEO Rodney McMullen wanted to make it a part of his legacy, and Kroger needed to have ownership and control of it,” the lawsuit said.
    


            Kroger and the new company, Advantage, went on to host two more festivals in 2022 and 2023. The lawsuit alleges the plaintiffs lost $2 million of their own money and profits of at least $5 million.
    


            McMullen told Jewel over email, “I'm not involved in planning of the Festival this year. That's Colleen's responsibility. Please communicate with her on this,” according to the lawsuit.
    


            McMullen resigned in March after a company investigation found his personal conduct was “inconsistent” with Kroger's ethics policies. The company said it did not involve Kroger's finances and no associates were involved.
    


            His resignation came a few months after Kroger rival Albertsons called off its $25 million merger with Kroger amid regulatory pressure. Albertsons subsequently sued Kroger for breach of contract agreement.
    


            Albertsons' lawyers, too, are curious about the circumstances leading to McMullen's departure. The company wants to compel Kroger to disclose McMullen's actions because it could have distracted him “or conflicted with his obligations to Kroger” during the doomed merger process.
    


            “McMullen's conduct and business ethics are central to this litigation,” Albertsons said in a motion filed late July. “Yet Kroger refuses to produce any documents regarding significant lapses of ‘business ethics' so serious they cost McMullen his job weeks after the Merger was blocked.”
    


            McMullen earned roughly $15.7 million in 2023, according to an SEC file. With his resignation, he forfeited more than $11 million in unvested stock and options, and any bonuses.

This deal has everything: semiconductors, DeepSeek, constitutional violations.

Whatever else can be said about the second Trump administration, it is always teaching me about parts of the Constitution I had forgotten were even in there.

Case in point: Article I, Section 9, Clause 5 states that “No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.” This is known as the export clause, not to be confused with the import-export clause (Article I, Section 10, Clause 2). The Supreme Court has repeatedly held, most recently in 1996's US v. IBM, that this clause bans Congress and the states from imposing taxes on goods exported from one state to another or from the US to foreign countries.

I found myself reading US v. IBM after President Donald Trump announced an innovative new deal with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD. They can now export certain previously restricted chips to China but have to pay a 15 percent tax to the federal government on the proceeds. Now, I'm not a lawyer, but several people who are lawyers, like former National Security Council official Peter Harrell, immediately interpreted this as a clearly unconstitutional export tax (and as illegal under the 2018 Export Control Reform Act, to boot).

At this point, there's something kind of sad and impotent about complaining that something Trump is doing is illegal and unconstitutional. It feels like yelling at the refs that the Harlem Globetrotters aren't playing fair; of course they aren't, no one cares. The refs are unlikely to step in here, either. The parties with the standing to sue and block the export taxes are Nvidia and AMD, and they've already agreed to go along with it.

Maybe the best we can do is understand why this happened and what it means for the future of AI.

While AMD is included in the deal, for all practical purposes, the AI chips in question are being made by Nvidia — and the main one in question is the H20.

As I explained last month, the H20 is entirely the product of US export controls meant to limit export of excessively powerful chips to China. Nvidia took its flagship H100 chip, widely used for AI training, and dialed its processing power (as measured in floating point operations per second) way down, thus satisfying rules restricting advanced chips that the Biden administration put in place and Trump has maintained.

At the same time, it dialed up the memory bandwidth (or the rate at which data moves between the chip and system memory) past even H100's levels. That makes the H20 better than the H100 at answering queries to AI models in action, even if it's worse at training those models to start with.

Critics saw this all as an attempt to obey the letter of the export controls while violating their spirit. It still meant Nvidia was exporting very useful, powerful chips to Chinese AI firms, which could use those to catch up with or leap ahead of US firms — precisely what the Biden administration was trying to prevent. In April, the Trump administration seemed to agree when it sent Nvidia a letter informing it that it would not receive export licenses for shipping H20s to China.

Then, in July, reportedly after both some bargaining with China over rare earth metals and a personal entreaty from Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang, Trump flip-flopped; the chips could go to China after all. The only thing new this month is that he wants to get a cut of the proceeds.

That, of course, is an important new element, not least because it seems bad that the president is asserting the power to unilaterally impose new taxes without Congress. (At least with tariffs, Trump has some laws Congress passed he can cite theoretically granting the authority.) But the big question about H20s remains the same: Does this help Chinese companies like DeepSeek catch up with US companies like OpenAI? And how bad is that, if it happens?

The concerns here are such that maybe the best way to understand them is to imagine a debate between a pro-export and anti-export advocate. I'm taking some poetic license here, in part because people in the sector are often averse to plainly saying what they mean on the record. But I think it's a fair reflection of the debate as I've heard it.

Anti-Export Guy: Trump says he wants the US to have “global dominance” in AI, and here he is, just letting China have very powerful chips. This obviously hurts the US's edge.

Pro-Export Guy: Does it? Again, the H20 is powerful, but it's no H100. In any case, Chinese firms are totally allowed to rent out advanced AI chips in US-based cloud servers. DeepSeek could even rent time on an H100 that way. So, why are we freaking out about exporting a weaker chip?

Anti-Export: You act like the cloud option is a loophole — it's a feature! That way, they're dependent on US servers and companies. If Chinese AI firms ever start making dangerous systems, the US can shut off their access, and they'll be out of luck.

Pro-Export: Again, will they be out of luck? There's a third option after Nvidia exports and US servers. Huawei is making its own AI-optimized chips. Chinese firms don't want to depend on foreign servers forever, and if we deny them Nvidia chips, they'll run right over to Huawei chips.

Anti-Export: Saying you don't need Nvidia chips when you have Huawei chips is like if you told someone 20 years ago that they don't need an iPod because they have a Zune. Yes, Huawei chips exist, but they're so much worse. They're lower bandwidth than H20s, Huawei's software libraries are full of bugs, and the chips sometimes dangerously overheat.

Pro-Export: You're exaggerating. By some metrics, Huawei's latest systems (not just the chips, but the surrounding servers) outperform Nvidia's top-end model — even though that model uses B200s that are faster than H100s and lightyears faster than you'd ever be allowed to export to China. Yes, programmers will have to learn Huawei's libraries, and transitioning from Nvidia's will take time, but it's doable. Google, Anthropic, and OpenAI have all recently moved away from Nvidia chips toward things like Google's own TPUs or Amazon's Trainiums. That took effort, but they did it.

Anti-Export: Sure, but those companies still use Nvidia's too. OpenAI wants 100,000 chips in one Norwegian facility alone. And while US companies may be trying out the competition, Chinese companies still vastly prefer Nvidia to Huawei. DeepSeek reportedly had to delay its latest model because it tried to train it on Huawei chips but couldn't. Even if Huawei chips were popular, Huawei lacks the production capacity to meet demand. It relies on smuggled components to make its top-end chips and can make at most 200,000 this year, compared to the roughly 10 million Nvidia chips shipped annually. There's no substitute for Nvidias.

I suppose we'll see, in the next few months and in the rollout of new chips from competitors like Huawei, who got the better of that argument. China is reportedly discouraging firms from using Nvidia chips in the wake of the export tax deal, largely to encourage them to use domestic chips like Huawei, though they are clearly not banning the firms from using Nvidias if they prove necessary. It's also investigating whether the US is including spyware in them.

The bigger question this debate raises for me, and one I certainly can't answer adequately here, is: To what degree is “beating China” on AI important for making the future of AI go well?

The answer for most US policymakers, and most people I know in the AI safety world, has been “very.” The Financial Times reports that some Trump officials are considering resigning in protest over allowing China to get H20s. As Leopold Aschenbrenner, the AI analyst turned hedge funder, put it bluntly in his influential 2024 essay “Situational Awareness”: “Superintelligence will give those who wield it the power to crush opposition, dissent, and lock in their grand plan for humanity.” If China “wins,” then, the result for humanity is permanent authoritarian repression.

No doubt, the Beijing regime is brutal, and I have no faith that they will use AI wisely. I'm very confident they'll wield it to oppress Chinese citizens. But it feels as though “staying ahead of China” has become the sine qua non of US AI policy.

I worry less that this focus on China is directionally wrong and more that it is exaggerated. The bigger danger is that no one can control these systems, rather than that China can, and that the focus on staying ahead of China will cause the US to speed deployment of automated weapons systems that could prove deeply destabilizing and dangerous.

As with most aspects of AI, I feel like there's a small island of things we're all sure of and a vast ocean of unknowns. I think offering China H20s probably hurts AI safety a bit. I think.

 Attorney General Pam Bondi discusses a letter she sent to sanctuary city and state leaders, President Donald Trump's DC crime crackdown and the firing of a DOJ worker over a sandwich throwing incident on 'Hannity.'

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi issued an order on Thursday to slap down D.C. Metropolitan Police Department sanctuary policies and place Drug Enforcement Administration Administrator Terrence Cole in charge of the department as emergency police commissioner —  but D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser pushed back, highlighting a letter in which District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb opined that the order from Bondi "is unlawful."

"In reference to the U.S. Attorney General's order, there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official," Bowser said in a social media post.

Bowser included a letter from Schwalb to MPD Police Chief Pamela Smith, in which the D.C. attorney general said that, in his view, the order from Bondi "is unlawful" and that Smith is "not legally obligated to follow it."

In her order, Bondi declared that police leadership "must receive approval from Commissioner Cole before issuing any further directives to the MPD."

Bondi rescinded an executive order that was just issued on Thursday by the police chief. 

She also suspended parts of two general orders "until further notice," and directed the MPD "to enforce, to the maximum extent permissible by law, section 22-1307, District of Columbia Code, and all District of Columbia municipal regulations pertaining to the unlawful occupancy of public spaces."

The showdown between the two attorneys general comes as President Donald Trump seeks to crack down on crime in the nation's capital. 

This week he issued an executive order that declared "the Mayor of the District of Columbia (Mayor) shall provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act."

But in the letter to the D.C. police chief, Schwalb asserted that Section 740 of the Home Rule Act "does not authorize the President, or his delegee, to remove or replace the Chief of Police; to alter the chain of command within MPD; to demand services directly from you, MPD, or anyone other than the Mayor; to rescind or suspend MPD orders or directives; or to set the general enforcement priorities of MPD or otherwise determine how the District pursues purely local law enforcement. 

"The Bondi Order is, therefore, ultra vires," he declared.

Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith, a National Police Association spokesperson, told Fox News Digital police in Washington, D.C., support the president's temporary takeover.

President Donald Trump's takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department came as a result of politicians in Washington, D.C., failing to take control of an increase in youth violence, a law enforcement group said.

President Trump made the decision Monday to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, allowing the president to take emergency control of police in Washington, D.C., for 30 days.

"Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people," Trump said Monday while announcing the move. "And we're not going to let it happen anymore. We're not going to take it." 

In explaining why he was federalizing D.C. police, Trump pointed to a rise in criminal activity that included a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffer being beaten and the murder of a congressional intern.

The Metropolitan Police Department announced that a 15-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl face carjacking charges after Edward Coristine was beaten Aug. 3 at around 3 a.m. Authorities said the teens tried to carjack Coristine and a woman identified as his significant other.

Police said Coristine got the woman inside the vehicle while he confronted the group of people, which led to the attack.

Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, a 21-year-old student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, who was in D.C. for an internship, was shot June 30 around 10:28 p.m. and died at a hospital July 1, police said. At the time, Tarpinian-Jachym was an intern for Rep. Ron Estes, R-Kan.

Several people were seen exiting a car before opening fire, with one of the shots wounding Tarpinian-Jachym. Police said Tarpinian-Jachym wasn't the intended target, adding an adult female and 16-year-old male were injured. The shooting happened in the 1200 block of 7th Street, Northwest, near the Mt Vernon Sq 7th St-Convention Center Metro stop.

Sgt. Betsy Brantner Smith, a National Police Association spokesperson, told Fox News Digital politicians in Washington, D.C., paved the way for Trump to take over the Metropolitan Police Department due to their failure to address a recent rise in youth violence.

According to NBC Washington, the number of juveniles arrested in Washington, D.C., has increased every year since 2020, with over 2,000 arrested in 2023 and 2024.

In 2024, juveniles made up 51.8% of robbery arrests, according to police, adding that almost 60% of carjacking suspects in 2025 are also juveniles. In Washington, D.C., most violent crimes committed by adults are prosecuted by the United States Attorney's Office, while most juvenile crimes are prosecuted by the District of Columbia's attorney teneral.

"It is a huge issue," Smith said of juvenile crime in Washington, D.C. "It's frustrating for the crime victims to know that if they're the victim of a juvenile offender, even if the crime is violent, that the offender will likely not be prosecuted commiserate with the law. It is also frustrating for the police officer who makes the arrest and/or investigates the crime to then sees the offender not receive appropriate punishment."

Smith said D.C. should be encouraged to "lower the age of responsibility," which would allow "for more effective prosecution of juveniles."

"There needs to be a substantive change in the way that our criminal justice system deals with juvenile offenders. We need to do a better job of addressing true criminality, and we need to separate it out from a kid who runs away from home or a kid who steals a soda and a bag of chips from the local gas station," she said.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser met Tuesday with federal officials to discuss how the city will coordinate an increased law enforcement presence in the city.

"What I'm focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have," Bowser said, according to Fox 5. "We have the best in the business in MPD Chief Pamela Smith to lead that effort and to make sure that the men and women who are coming from federal law enforcement are being well-used and that if there's National Guard here they're being well-used."

President Donald Trump joins 'The Brian Kilmeade Show' to discuss his upcoming summit with Putin, the latest on his crime crackdown in Washington, D.C. and more.

President Donald Trump is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin for a historic summit Friday in Alaska.

The president will travel to Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday morning for the meeting, which is somewhat equidistant from both Washington, D.C., and Moscow. The United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867.

The high-stakes meeting is the first U.S.-Russia summit since June 2021, which was under former President Joe Biden's administration. That summit came just eight months before Putin invaded Ukraine.

WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TRUMP'S MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN IN ALASKA

Trump has described the talks as a "feel-out meeting," and has made clear that his top priority will be to determine whether a ceasefire in Ukraine is possible. Trump predicted earlier this week that he would be able to make that determination within the first "two minutes."

"I'm not going to make a deal. It's not up to me to make a deal," Trump said. "I think a deal should be made for both (Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy)."

"I'd like to see a ceasefire," Trump continued. "I'd like to see the best deal that could be made for both parties. You know, it takes two to tango."

However, the president threatened "very severe consequences" for Russia if Putin does not agree to end the war after Friday's meeting. Additionally, while all eyes are on the summit between Trump and Putin, Trump said "the more important meeting will be the second meeting that we're having."

"We're going to have a meeting with President Putin, President Zelenskyy, myself, and maybe we'll bring some of the European leaders — maybe not … It's going to be very important."

"We're going to see what happens," Trump continued. "And I think President Putin will make peace."

The day before the summit, Trump predicted that his meeting with Putin had a 25% chance of failing outright, but he said the hope is to push for a second meeting between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

"This meeting sets up the second meeting," Trump told Fox News' Brian Kilmeade, adding that the second meeting would be "extremely important," and hinted that there would likely be negotiations over land swaps, a notion Zelenskyy has opposed.

COULD TRUMP'S MEETING WITH PUTIN BE THE NEXT REAGAN-GORBACHEV MOMENT?

Zelenskyy is not a part of Friday's summit. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Trump was agreeing to the meeting at the request of Putin.

"The goal of this meeting for the president is to walk away with a better understanding of how we can end this war," Leavitt said at a recent White House press briefing. "I think the president of the United States getting in the room with the president of Russia, sitting face-to-face rather than speaking over the telephone will give this president the best indication of how to end this war and where this is headed."

However, Zelenskyy has maintained that any decisions to end the war made without Ukraine would be impossible.

Zelenskyy has repeatedly said he is open to meeting with Putin directly to end the war, though Putin has thus far refused.

PUTIN PRAISES TRUMP'S ‘SINCERE' PEACE EFFORTS, SIGNALS POSSIBLE US-RUSSIA NUCLEAR DEAL

"Any decisions made against us, any decisions made without Ukraine — they are simultaneously decisions against peace," Zelenskyy said in a Saturday statement. "These are dead decisions; they will never work. And what we all need is a real, living peace, one that people will respect."

However, as recently as Wednesday, Zelenskyy said there is "no sign" Russia is preparing to end the war.

The Ukrainian leader wrote on X Wednesday, saying, "This war must be ended. Pressure must be exerted on Russia for the sake of a just peace. Ukraine's and our partners' experience must be used to prevent deception by Russia."

"At present, there is no sign that the Russians are preparing to end the war," he added. "Our coordinated efforts and joint actions — of Ukraine, the United States, Europe, and all countries that seek peace — can definitely compel Russia to make peace."

Zelenskyy also wrote on X recently, "The path to peace for Ukraine must be determined together with Ukraine — this is fundamental."

"It is important that joint approaches and a shared vision work toward genuine peace. A consolidated position. Ceasefire. End of occupation. End of war," he also said.

Zelenskyy this week also said he discussed the possibility of holding high-level talks organized by Turkey, which has hosted previous diplomatic negotiations that have failed to secure any lasting ceasefire agreements, but have released thousands of Ukrainian and Russian prisoners of war. 

"We are ready for any format of meeting aimed at stopping the killings and ending the war," Zelenksyy said. "President Erdogan confirmed his country's readiness to organize a summit of the leaders of Ukraine, the United States, Russia, and Turkey." 

Putin, though, has praised Trump for making "sincere efforts" to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, saying that the U.S. was making "quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict," according to Reuters.

Putin also reportedly mentioned possible future "agreements in the area of control over strategic offensive weapons."

Russia and the U.S. hold the world's largest nuclear weapons arsenals and have a treaty limiting the number of weapons they may possess, which is set to expire in February, adding more pressure to the upcoming talks. The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty covers strategic nuclear weapons and caps the number of deployed warheads at 1,550 on each side, according to Reuters.

There has already been some nuclear tension between the two nations in recent weeks, as Trump ordered two nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia after the country's former president made "highly provocative statements." The Kremlin downplayed the move but warned all sides to be "very, very careful" about nuclear rhetoric, according to Reuters.

Meanwhile, reporters pressed Trump on Thursday, the day before the summit, on whether his agreement to meet with Putin could end up "rewarding" the Russian president for his invasion of Ukraine. 

Trump scoffed at the question, and said: "No. I don't think it's a reward."

"What we have is a situation that should have never started — it should have never started," Trump said. "It didn't start under me. And for four years, it wasn't even discussed. And I could see it was going to happen. After I left, I could see what was happening. Everything we did was wrong, everything that was done was wrong. Everybody's to blame. Putin is to blame. They're all to blame." 

"This war would have never happened when I was president. If I were president, this war would have never happened," Trump continued. "But millions of people have been killed and, I'm there for one reason: to see if I can solve this. This was Biden's war."

Russian President Vladimir Putin is traveling to Alaska to meet with President Donald Trump to possibly negotiate the end to a conflict that experts believed would have ended more than three years ago.

Their highly anticipated meeting, which could change the trajectory of the conflict, comes just shy of the 3 1/2-year anniversary of Russia's invasion.

Ahead of their conversation, Trump has publicly floated the idea that both sides will have to agree to swap land to end the conflict. It raises the possibility that Russia may get to keep some of the Ukrainian territory it holds or has annexed, but not necessarily all of it.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he would not willingly give up territory, which also would not be allowed under the country's constitution.

The Russian military occupies less Ukrainian territory than it did in March 2022, just one month into the conflict. Russian forces held roughly 26.8% of Ukrainian territory at its peak on March 23 of that year, and as of this week, they control 18.98% of Ukraine, according to the Institute for the Study of War.

Russian forces are making incremental gains on the battlefield toward the Ukrainian city of Dobropillya, but at exorbitantly high costs.

“These are small-scale penetrations, and it's at the tactical level,” George Barros, an expert with ISW, told the Washington Examiner. “For now, the Russians certainly will seek to try to mature these tactical successes into a larger breakthrough and a larger penetration and seize more territory, but it remains unclear if they would be successful in that endeavor.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week that Russia likely suffered around 60,000 soldiers killed or wounded in battle last month alone.

“Last year, Russia gained half of 1% of Ukraine's territory in return for over 400,000 killed and wounded. This year, it's taken a similar amount of territory for a further 200,000 killed and wounded,” Adm. Sir Tony Radakin, the U.K. chief of defence staff, said in an interview with the Center for Strategic and International Studies this week.

Ahead of the summit, “Putin is left with a dilemma: Agree to a ceasefire with his stated aims incomplete and little to show his people in return for the lost blood and treasure,” he added, “or continue the war indefinitely and watch his country become even weaker and poorer chasing the false dream of subjugating Ukraine.”

The Russian military's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began on Feb. 24, 2022, and the prevailing belief among Western officials was that it would only take a matter of days or weeks before it captured Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.

“At the time, we thought the Russian military was more capable than it has proven to be,” Radakin said. “We had limited confidence in Ukraine's defensive strategy. The prevailing view was that Russia would take Kyiv within weeks, if not days. The choice was whether to back Ukraine or not.”

The war has led to more than 1 million “lives sacrificed” since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, he said.

With allies unsure of whether to back Ukraine in a fight for its survival, Ukrainian troops and volunteers alike not only prevented the capture of its capital but also forced Putin to fundamentally shift his short-term war objectives to focus on regions in southeastern Ukraine, close to Russia's borders.

Russia annexed the Zaporizhia, Kherson, Donetsk, and Luhansk regions in Ukraine in September 2022. They were widely disregarded internationally as sham referendums conducted under duress. Russia still does not entirely control the territory it annexed and wants to get it through the ceasefire negotiations.

The front lines of the war stretch more than 600 miles and go through the regions Russia annexed. Russia and Ukrainian forces have been fighting in the Donbas region since 2014. The war is concentrated in the eastern part of Ukraine, and other areas within the country still come under attack.

The losses are staggering, yet Putin has not shown a legitimate interest in ending the war. He believes he can wait out U.S. and European support for Ukraine and then capitalize.

Ukrainian leaders and their European allies have stressed the importance of security guarantees in any agreement to prevent Russia from trying to restart its war when the military has had a chance to resupply and refit.

They “know that Putin's desire is not just to take all of Ukraine, but to rebuild the Russian Empire, which includes parts of NATO, parts of the EU,” Kurt Volker, who previously served as the U.S. ambassador to NATO, told the Washington Examiner. “So they are very concerned that if Putin is just appeased in this aggression, he's going to keep going. And they also know that if there is a ceasefire, it's not a full peace, as you're not changing Putin's ambitions.”

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration, stepping up its crackdown on policing in the nation's capital, on Thursday named the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration to be Washington's “emergency police commissioner” with all the powers of the police chief — a significant move that increases national control over the city as part of the federal government's law-enforcement takeover.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a directive issued Thursday evening that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police.” The Metropolitan Police Department “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any orders, Bondi said. It was not immediately clear where the move left Pamela Smith, the city's current police chief, who works for the mayor. 

D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb responded late Thursday that Bondi's directive was “unlawful,” arguing that it could not be followed by the city's police force. “Therefore, members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not the orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor,” Schwalb wrote in a memo to Smith, setting up a potential legal clash between the heavily Democratic district and the Republican administration.

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser wrote on social media that “there is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.”

Bondi's directive came hours after Smith directed MPD officers to share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody — such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. The Justice Department said Bondi disagreed with the police chief's directive because it allowed for continued enforcement of “sanctuary policies.”

Bondi said she was rescinding that order as well as other MPD policies limiting inquires into immigration status and preventing arrests based solely on federal immigration warrants. All new directives must now receive approval from Cole, the attorney general said.

The police takeover is the latest move by President Donald Trump to test the limits of his legal authorities to carry out his agenda, relying on obscure statutes and a supposed state of emergency to bolster his tough-on-crime message and his plans to speed up the mass deportation of people in the U.S. illegally.

It also marks one of the most sweeping assertions of federal authority over a local government in modern times. While Washington has grappled with spikes in violence and visible homelessness, the city's homicide rate ranks below those of several other major U.S. cities and the capital is not in the throes of the public safety collapse the administration has portrayed.

The late-night announcement came after an eventful day in the ongoing federal operation. Smith's earlier directive effectively brought together Trump's moves on city law enforcement and his nationwide efforts to curb immigration, and Trump had praised it in the hours before Bondi's announcement. 

“That's a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,” Trump said of Smith's order. “That's a great step. That's a great step if they're doing that.”

A population already tense from days of ramp-up began seeing more significant shows of force across the city Thursday. National Guard troops watched over some of the world's most renowned landmarks and Humvees took position in front of the busy main train station. Volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments — to where, exactly, was often unclear.

Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha's Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.

For an already wary Washington, Thursday marked a notable — and highly visible — uptick in presence from the previous two days. The visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, was striking to residents going about their lives. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he'll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.

The response before Thursday had been gradual and, by all appearances, low key. But on Wednesday night, officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.'s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer.

Troops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump start in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.

“They will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation's capital,” Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said. “The National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training.”

Wilson said the troops won't be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail or how many Guard members have already been sent out on the streets.

National Guard Major Micah Maxwell said troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.

The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren't making arrests but are “protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.”

Although the current deployment is taking place under unprecedented circumstances, National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. They have regularly been used in the past for crowd control in and around Metro stations.

Trump on Thursday denied that the federal law enforcement officials he sent into Washington's streets to fight crime have been diverted from priority assignments like counterterrorism. Asked if he was concerned about that, Trump said he's using a “very small force” of soldiers and that city police are now allowed to do their job properly amidst his security lockdown.

Meanwhile, about a dozen homeless residents in Washington packed up their belongings with help from volunteers from charitable groups and staffers from some city agencies. Items largely were not forcibly thrown out by law enforcement, but a garbage truck idled nearby.

Several protesters held signs close by, some critical of the Trump administration. Once the residents had left, a construction vehicle from a city agency cleared through the remains of the tents. 

The departures were voluntary, but they came in response to a clear threat from the Trump administration. Advocates expect law enforcement officers to fan out across D.C. in the coming days to forcibly take down any remaining homeless encampments. In Washington Circle, which still contains a few tents, city workers put up signs announcing “general cleanup of this public space” starting at 10 a.m. Monday.

            DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb filed a lawsuit Friday against the Trump administration over its moves to take over the city's police department and appoint an emergency commissioner, the latest sign of pushback from district officials against the federal takeover.
    


            “By declaring a hostile takeover of (Metropolitan Police Department), the Administration is abusing its limited, temporary authority under the Home Rule Act, infringing on the District's right to self-governance and putting the safety of DC residents and visitors at risk,” Schwalb said in a statement. “The Administration's unlawful actions are an affront to the dignity and autonomy of the 700,000 Americans who call DC home. This is the gravest threat to Home Rule that the District has ever faced, and we are fighting to stop it.”
    


            DC is also seeking a temporary restraining order.
    


            The case has been assigned to federal district Judge Ana Reyes, an appointee of former President Joe Biden. A hearing has been scheduled for 2 p.m.
    


            It comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday evening ordered the city's mayor and police department to accept Terry Cole, the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, as the district's “emergency police commissioner” and give him full control of the department during the federal takeover — quickly drawing rebukes from the district's mayor and attorney general, who suggested they would not comply.
    


            Bondi's order formalized the federal government's control of DC police and directed Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and the Metropolitan Police Department to end the capital's sanctuary city policies.
    


            Bowser quickly rejected the order, writing on social media, “There is no statute that conveys the District's personnel authority to a federal official.”
    


            “Let us be clear about what the law requires during a Presidential declared emergency: it requires the mayor of Washington, DC to provide the services of the Metropolitan Police Department for federal purposes at the request of the President,” Bowser said. “We have followed the law.”
    


            In a filing as part of the lawsuit, MPD Chief Pamela Smith said the takeover places officers and residents at “grave risk.”
    


            “In my nearly three decades in law enforcement, I have never seen a single government action that would cause a greater threat to law and order than this dangerous directive,” Smith said
    


            It is, Smith wrote, “placing the lives of MPD officers and District residents at grave risk.”
    


            Smith confirmed that she was “unaware of President Trump's plans to assume control of the local police force until he announced it at a press conference” on Monday.
    


            Friday's lawsuit marks a forceful response from city leaders after days of public statements largely appeasing Trump. Bowser has repeatedly said she wants to make sure the federal law enforcement surge is useful to the city, though she struck a more adversarial tone during an event this week, calling Trump's police department takeover an “authoritarian push.”
    


            Schwalb reviewed Bondi's order and declared it illegal, saying he determined the Home Rule Act did not give President Donald Trump the authority to remove or replace the chief of police, or alter the MPD chain of command.
    


            “It is my opinion that the Bondi order is unlawful, and that you are not legally obligated to follow it,” Schwalb said in a letter to Smith.
    


            Schwalb wrote in the letter the act “does not authorize the President, or his delegee, to remove or replace the Chief of Police; to alter the chain of command within MPD; to demand services directly from you, MPD, or anyone other than the Mayor, to rescind or suspend MPD orders or directives; or to set the general enforcement priorities of MPD or otherwise determine how the District pursues purely local law enforcement. The Bondi Order is, therefore, ultra vires.”
    


            Filed in US District Court, the suit argues the Trump administration is “brazenly violating” the Home Rule Act, which gives the president limited, temporary authority to request MPD services.
    


            “Congress did not grant the President authority to displace the Chief of Police, assert operational control over MPD, or rescind MPD policies — as the Administration seeks to do,” Schwalb said. “Congress also limited the President's authority to requesting services for ‘federal purposes,' such as protecting federal property or personnel — not dictating local enforcement of local laws.”
    


            The Department of Justice declined to respond to a request for comment.
    


            Bondi's order had further directed MPD to abandon a directive Smith signed earlier in the day giving officers limited ability to share information with federal immigration officials. And, the order said, MPD leaders “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole before issuing any further directives.”
    


            Justice Department officials believed that earlier directive was meant to reinforce the type of sanctuary city policies that DOJ has vowed to put an end to, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
    


            In addition to ordering that the directive be rescinded, Bondi instructed Bowser to get rid of two additional police policies aimed at protecting undocumented migrants, including one that prevents MPD from arresting an individual solely for federal immigration warrants.
    


            This comes after Trump earlier this week declared a crime emergency and federalized DC's police, tapping Cole as interim federal commissioner of MPD.
    


            Schwalb wrote in his letter to Smith that Trump and Bondi are now overstepping their legal authority.
    


            “Having been duly appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the Council, you are the lawfully appointed Chief of Police of the District of Columbia,” Schwalb wrote to Smith. “Therefore, members of MPD must continue to follow your orders and not orders of any official not appointed by the Mayor.”
    


            CNN has reached out to MPD for comment.
    


            Bondi's move makes clear that the federal police takeover in DC will go hand-in-hand with the Trump administration's hardline immigration enforcement goals, using control over law enforcement in the district as a way to try to put an end to the city's laws that protect undocumented migrants.
    


            “DC will not remain a sanctuary city actively shielding criminal aliens,” Bondi said in an interview on Fox News Thursday. “Will not happen.”
    


            Christina Henderson, a member of the DC City Council, also responded to the order on social media Thursday, writing “Respectfully, the Attorney General does not have the authority to revoke laws.”
    


            Earlier Thursday, Smith signed an executive order allowing DC police officers to share information about people not in their custody with federal immigration enforcement agencies, as well as allowing local police to assist with transporting the agencies' personnel and detainees.
    


            However, the earlier order — citing DC law and police code of conduct — continues to prohibit officers from looking through police databases solely for a person's immigration status, from making inquiries about a person's immigration status “for the purpose of determining whether they have violated the civil immigration laws or for the purpose of enforcing civil immigration laws” and from arresting anyone based only on federal immigration warrants.

Attorney General Pam Bondi has named the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as Washington's “emergency police commissioner,” saying she is granting him the powers of the police chief amid the federal takeover.

Bondi said in a directive issued Thursday evening that DEA boss Terry Cole will assume “powers and duties vested in the District of Columbia Chief of Police.” The Metropolitan Police Department “must receive approval from Commissioner Cole” before issuing any orders, Bondi said. It was not immediately clear where the move left Pamela Smith, the city's current police chief, who works for the mayor.

Following President Donald Trump's unprecedented announcement that his administration would take over the Washington, D.C., police department and dispatch the National Guard for at least a month, the White House announced there would be a round-the-clock presence of local and federal law enforcement officers in the city.

Other news we're following today:








During an interview on the “State Of The People Special: The Attack on Black America,” former MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid pressed Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser on the city's decision to go along with the president's order.

“You aren't hearing me say that we asked for this insurgence of police or that we think we need them,” Bowser responded. “What we know is that the president is making a show of force in Washington, D.C., that is meant to be a signal for the rest of the nation. We know that he has broader authority to do it in Washington, D.C.”

Bowser repeatedly made the point that D.C. does not have full autonomy under its limited home rule arrangement.

Still, she said: “I'm concerned that we have this intrusion on our autonomy. I'm concerned that our law allows it. I'm concerned that we're not the 51st state. I'm concerned that we're subject to federal influence and intrusion on matters of policing. And all of us should be concerned about it.

Students and teachers returned to class for the new academic year Thursday amid worries that schools could become targets in the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown after a summer filled with raids.

At 93rd Street Elementary School in southern Los Angeles, volunteers with activist group Union del Barrio patrolled the neighborhood in the early morning for any immigration activity, and staff wearing bright orange vests gave children — some walking alone — a warm welcome as they arrived.

“We want to make sure that … everyone feels like they're protected and we're watching and every student can make it inside our school building,” said Ingrid Villeda, a teacher and community coordinator.

As children played in the schoolyard, there were no reports of federal agents in the area.

When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act into law 90 years ago, he said it would provide economic stability to older people while giving the U.S. “an economic structure of vastly greater soundness.”

Today the program provides benefits to almost 69 million Americans each month. It's a major source of income for people older than 65 and is popular across the country and political lines.

But just as it has for decades, Social Security faces a looming shortfall in money to pay full benefits. 

And since Trump took office, it has faced more tumult. Agency staffing has been slashed. Unions and advocacy groups concerned about sharing sensitive information have sued. Administration officials including the president have falsely claimed that millions of dead people were receiving benefits. Former adviser Elon Musk called it a potential “Ponzi scheme.”

In her ruling earlier Thursday, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland struck down administration guidance aimed at eliminating diversity programs at schools and colleges. She said the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continue with such initiatives.

The department reacted later in a statement, saying it was disappointed by the decision but “judicial action enjoining or setting aside this guidance has not stopped our ability to enforce Title VI protections for students at an unprecedented level.”

The case centers on two department memos ordering schools and universities to end all “race-based decision-making” or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It's part of a campaign to end practices that the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.

They typically investigate drug lords, weapons traffickers or cyber criminals. But this week they fanned out across the capital as part of Trump's efforts to clamp down on crime.

The sometimes-masked federal agents joined the National Guard as well as the United States Park Police, whose responsibilities include protecting monuments and managing crowds during demonstrations.

Soldiers in fatigues kept watch near Union Station, while Drug Enforcement Administration agents patrolled the National Mall. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives officers helped question a couple in northwest Washington who were parked illegally and eating McDonald's takeout.

Trump said he was taking over Washington's police in hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed that crime is already falling. The city's status as a federal district allows the president to take control, though he is limited to 30 days unless he gets Congressional approval.

As National Guard troops deploy across her city as part of the president's efforts to clamp down on crime, Muriel Bowser is responding with relative restraint.

She has called the takeover of the city's police department and the activation of 800 members of the Guard “unsettling and unprecedented” and gone as far as to cast such efforts as part of an “authoritarian push.”

But Bowser has so far avoided the kind of biting rhetoric and personal attacks typical of other high-profile Democratic leaders. Instead she is cooperating with administration efforts, including having city workers clear homeless encampments and work more closely with immigration agents, as Trump demanded.

“While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised,” Bowser said. She even suggested the surge in resources might benefit the city.

Orthodoxy is the majority religion in both Russia and Ukraine, although it has also been a source of controversy. Russian church leadership has strongly supported the invasion of Ukraine, and the war has aggravated a schism among Ukraine's Orthodox.

“With the leaders coming to Alaska, what is the one thing that the church can offer? That is prayers for peace,” said Archbishop Alexei of the Diocese of Sitka and Alaska in the Orthodox Church of America.

The first prayers Tuesday sought the help of St. Olga of Kwethluk, an Alaska Native woman canonized in June as the first Orthodox woman saint in North America.

Wednesday's services sought the intercession of St. Herman, a monk and missionary “known for standing up against Russian authorities when they were doing what was wrong to the people,” Alexei said.

And Thursday prayers focused on a historic icon of the Mother of God at the cathedral in Sitka.

The court ruled that six grants must be restored to organizations that lost their funding after several Trump administration Executive Orders and at the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). 

The ruling “sets a strong precedent that could allow hundreds of other grants to be challenged and reinstated,” environmental nonprofit Earthjustice said in a statement.

Plaintiffs included groups that support causes like tree planting, climate-friendly farming practices and growing food in underserved communities. 

The total value of the terminated grants was over $34 million, the attorneys said.

“In the wake of this ruling, we hope the USDA stops arbitrarily cancelling grants and contracts without an understanding of the work being done,” said Erin McKee, community food systems program director at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, one of the plaintiffs.

The USDA referred a request for comment to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond.

Muriel Bowser said on the social platform X that, as a “mom and mayor, raising a delightful 7 year old on my own,” she needed to leave amid the ongoing federal law enforcement activity to bring her daughter home from camp.

The mayor added that she also “cancelled a scheduled family trip” this week “to lead our city's crisis management efforts.”

Bowser said she has been “in constant consultation with our partners throughout a short swing out of the District,” which began Wednesday “after work.”

Bowser's office had said she had a “family commitment” in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, and would return Friday afternoon. 

After it was reported that Bowser was not in the city Thursday, critics accused her of going on vacation or otherwise fleeing during the federal law enforcement intervention.

The judge ordered the nation's health department to stop giving deportation officials access to the personal information — including home addresses — of all 79 million Medicaid enrollees.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services first handed over the data in June. After an AP report identified the new policy, 20 states sued to stop it.

The order by Judge Vince Chhabria in California temporarily halts the health department from sharing personal data of enrollees in those 20 states, which include California, Arizona, Washington and New York.

“Using CMS data for immigration enforcement threatens to significantly disrupt the operation of Medicaid — a program that Congress has deemed critical for the provision of health coverage to the nation's most vulnerable residents,” Chhabria wrote in his decision, issued Tuesday.

An HHS spokesperson declined to directly answer whether the agency would stop sharing the data. HHS has maintained that its agreement with DHS is legal.

The man, who has been charged with a felony, has been dismissed from his job at the Department of Justice, the attorney general said in a social media post.

A video of Sean Charles Dunn berating a group of federal agents late Sunday went viral online. Dunn was arrested on an assault charge after he threw a “sub-style” sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent, a court filing said.

Dunn, 37, of Washington, was an international affairs specialist in the DOJ's criminal division, according to a department official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a personnel matter.

“You will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement,” Bondi said.

An attorney who represented Dunn at his initial appearance in federal court declined to comment. 

The Russian president made the remarks Thursday, more than three years after Moscow launched its invasion, as the two leaders prepared for their Friday Russia summit.

Following a meeting with top officials, Putin said in a short video released by the Kremlin that the Trump administration was making “quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities” and to “reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved.”

Putin also suggested that “long-term conditions of peace between our countries, and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,” could be reached under an agreement with the U.S. on nuclear arms control.

Trump said there was a 25% chance the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that, if the meeting succeeds, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy could come to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting.

The portraits of Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush had been on display in the foyer, visible to tourists and guests alike.

But Trump recently had Obama moved to the top of the staircase to his private living quarters, an area off-limits to visitors. The Bushes also were relocated to the staircase. The change was first reported by CNN.

White House spokesperson Davis Ingle attributed the rearrangement to Trump's “incredible eye for detail and design” and said he is “carrying out a historic renovation of the People's House for Americans to enjoy for generations to come.”

“And just like every other President before him, he and the First Family may request changes to the Executive Residence,” Ingle said.

Trump and Obama have had a fraught relationship. Trump also has not hidden his dislike for the Bush family.

Portraits of the most recent presidents traditionally get a place of prominence in the foyer.

In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland said the Education Department violated the law when it threatened to cut federal funding from educational institutions that continue with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.

The ruling followed a motion for summary judgment from the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association, which challenged the government's actions in a February lawsuit.

The case centers on two Education Department memos ordering schools and universities to end all “race-based decision-making” or face penalties up to a total loss of federal funding. It's part of a campaign to end practices the Trump administration frames as discrimination against white and Asian American students.

Texas Democrats on Thursday moved closer to ending a nearly two-week walkout that has blocked the GOP's redrawing of U.S. House maps before the 2026 election and put them under escalating threats by Republicans back home.



The Democrats announced they will return so long as Texas Republicans end a special session and California releases its own redrawn map proposal, both of which were expected to happen Friday.



Democrats did not say what day they might return.



Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott still intends to push through new maps that would give the GOP five more winnable seats before next year's midterm elections.

A network of clinics that provides health care in Maine asked a judge Thursday to restore its Medicaid funding while it fights a Trump administration effort to keep federal money from going to abortion providers.

President Donald Trump's policy and tax bill, known as the “big beautiful bill,” blocked Medicaid money from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider. The parameters in the bill also stopped funding from reaching Maine Family Planning, a much smaller provider that offers health care services in one of the poorest and most rural states in the Northeast.

A federal judge ruled last month that Planned Parenthood clinics around the country must continue to be reimbursed for Medicaid funding as the provider wrangles with the Trump administration over efforts to defund it. That legal fight continues.

Trump on Thursday denied that the federal law enforcement officials he sent into Washington's streets to fight crime have been pulled away from priority assignments. 

Asked if he was concerned about that, Trump said he's using a “very small force” of soldiers and that city police are now allowed to do their job under his takeover of the department.

“And no, they're not being pulled off for anything,” Trump said.

Ahead of a summit between the American and Russian leaders, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin has been allowed to “play” American President Donald Trump for months.

“We've seen again red line after red line that he's drawn and then allowed Vladimir Putin to cross while the conflict gets worse or people are killed,” Shaheen told reporters. “The president, frankly, should be embarrassed because Vladimir Putin is playing him and has been playing him for months. And this summit, unfortunately, seems like it's just one more effort to do that.”

Still, Shaheen said she was hopeful that the meeting could yield a positive result for Ukraine and urged the Republican president to show strength, including by moving ahead with legislation to impose further sanctions on Russia.

Gov. Gavin Newsom's move is in response to Republican efforts to pick up five seats in Texas.

Newsom released a campaign add on social media Thursday as Democrats kicked off a press conference. State lawmakers technically need to declare the special election and they plan to do so next week. Democrats have not yet released their draft maps, but they aim to pick up five more seats.

The maps need voter approval. That's because voters previously granted the power to draw maps to an independent commission instead of lawmakers.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, led by prominent vaccine critic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will revive a childhood vaccine panel to “improve the safety, quality and oversight of vaccines.”

The panel was disbanded in 1998.

National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary will all sit on the panel but it is unclear who else will serve on it.

The panel will give a formal report to Congress on vaccines within two years, according to an HHS announcement on Thursday.

A federal judge on Thursday ordered the Trump administration to reinstate millions of dollars in grant funding that it terminated for several nonprofits involved in agriculture and ecology-related projects.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington, D.C., ruled in favor of five groups that sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture after it terminated their grants in response to executive orders issued by President Donald Trump. One plaintiff, Urban Sustainability Directors Network, received a $28 million grant in 2023 to promote urban forestry.

USDA terminated a total of approximately 600 grants, but the judge's ruling only applies to six grants received by the five plaintiffs.

Howell rejected the government's argument that the plaintiffs' claims are essentially contractual in nature and belong in the Court of Federal Claims. She ruled that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in showing that the five grant terminations were “arbitrary and capricious.”

Trump was just asked about Washington police chief's executive order regarding cooperating with immigration authorities and said he'd just heard about it.

“That's a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,” Trump said in response to a question in the Oval Office as he marked the 90th anniversary of Social Security.

“That's a great step. That's a great step if they're doing that,” Trump said.

The president had no qualms about the possible national security risks from his reassigning of officers for the FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to deal with local crime in Washington.

“Like what? Like what?” Trump said.

A reporter suggested that moving federal officials could compromise efforts to stop terrorism.

“Oh, really, terrorism?” Trump said. “They'll stop terrorism as part of what they're doing right now.”

That's after he recently reposted a video on social media about a Christian nationalist church that included various pastors saying women should no longer be allowed to vote.

“Of course the secretary thinks that women should have the right to vote. That's a stupid question, to be honest with you,” Pentagon's press secretary Kingsley Wilson told reporters Thursday.

She was asked about Hegseth's support for Doug Wilson, co-founder of the Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches, or CREC.

Doug Wilson has said he was grateful Hegseth shared the video.“He was, in effect, reposting it and saying, ‘Amen,' at some level,” Wilson said.Wilson said Hegseth's support for CREC isn't expected to hurt recruitment in the future.

The police chief of Washington, D.C., ordered an increase in cooperation between local officers and federal immigration agents on Thursday, a development that ramps up the stakes in an already tense environment after President Donald Trump's security crackdown put the city's police force under the command of the administration. 



The Executive Order, issued Thursday and signed by Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith, establishes that MPD officers may now share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody —such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. MPD officers may also provide “transportation for federal immigration employees and detained subject,” the order states. 



The changes, which raise collaboration between the two forces in notable ways, are effective immediately.

Some analysts have suggested that, simply by agreeing to meet with Putin on U.S. soil, Trump is undermining longstanding U.S. and international efforts to isolate Putin and Russia.

But asked by reporters if sitting down with Putin in Alaska constituted a win for Putin, the president insisted, “I don't think it's a reward.”

Trump says his meeting in Alaska with Putin will be a “big meeting” and is “going to be a good meeting,” but that “the more important meeting is the second meeting we're having” with Putin and Zelenskyy.

In comments to reporters in the Oval Office, the president suggested he may even bring in European leaders for the second discussion after meeting with Putin.

Trump said he believes that both Putin and Zelensky want to make peace.Asked if he might offer a rare earth minerals deal with Russia as part of his discussions with Putin, Trump said, “We're going to see what happens with our meeting” but he also suggested that such minerals were “very unimportant.”

In an appearance at the Oval Office, President Donald Trump said that he saved Los Angeles by calling in the National Guard earlier this year, and that the city would have burned down without his intervention. 

He said that if he had allowed protests to continue without intervention, he would have had to cancel the Olympics.

“If I didn't send in the troops, I don't think you would have had Los Angeles in condition to have the Olympics,” Trump said.

Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano said “Social Security will be great again,” under his watch, “you have my commitment,” he told Trump. However, the Republican president and Republican lawmakers have not yet proposed a long-term solution to shore up the program.

The so-called go-broke date — or the date at which Social Security will no longer have enough funds to pay full benefits — has been moved up to 2034, instead of last year's estimate of 2035.

Legislation signed during the Trump and Biden administrations have contributed to the accelerated insolvency date of SSA, including the Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law by Democratic President Joe Biden and the new mega-tax law signed by Trump in July.

During a signing ceremony in the Oval Office commemorating Social Security's 90th anniversary, President Donald Trump repeated the claim that Republicans' mega tax and spending cut legislation signed into law last month will eliminate taxes on federal Social Security benefits.

It does not.

Trump's “no tax on Social Security” claim exaggerates the benefits. The temporary tax deduction for seniors aged 65 and over applies to all income — not just Social Security.

And it turns out, not all Social Security beneficiaries will be able to claim the deduction. Those who won't be able to do so include the lowest-income seniors who already don't pay taxes on Social Security, those who choose to claim their benefits before they reach age 65 and those above a defined income threshold.

If Trump wants to help cities lower violence and crime, he's doing it the wrong way, Baltimore mayor Brandon Scott said in a call with reporters Thursday.

Scott said federal officials should be working for agencies and collaborating with cities on issues such as gun trafficking and drug crimes rather than being taken off their posts to surge into cities.

Trump should allow public safety professionals “to do what they signed up to do” instead of his D.C. “dog and pony show of force,” Scott said.

The National Guard now assisting law enforcement in Washington, D.C. will not have the power of arrest, Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said Thursday.

Similar to role they played when responding to protests in Los Angeles, the Guards will have the ability to temporarily detain people but it will be up to law enforcement agencies to arrest anyone, she said.

“They will not be arresting people, but they may temporarily limit the movement of an individual who has entered a restricted or secured area without permission,” Wilson told reporters during a press conference. “So this will be very similar to the L.A. mission, where we could temporarily detain someone and then turn them over.”

The advocates expressed “profound concerns” about Trump's plan to crack down on crime and homelessness in the nation's capital in a letter sent to the Republican chairs and Democratic ranking members of the House Oversight and Senate Homeland Security committee.

The leaders, who represent some of the largest civil rights groups in the country, argued Trump's moves were an “unprecedented and needless takeover of a local government's law enforcement mechanisms” that posed “a dire threat to public safety as well as to civil and human rights.”

They urged Congress to investigate Trump's actions make sure that DC residents' constitutional rights “are being fully protected and enforced.”

“This administration has proven that it will push every boundary to test for exploitable weakness in Congress and the courts,” reads a letter signed by the leaders of 126 civil rights organizations. “Given the role of your respective committees in matters affecting our nation's capital, we urge you to promptly call for hearings into this decision, and to engage in vigorous oversight moving forward.”

The D.C. Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services Wayne Turnage on Thursday spoke to reporters from a homeless encampment near the Institute of Peace that the city had just closed down.

He said after the National Park Service notified the city it planned to close all encampments in the district, both on federal and district lands, the city opted to tackle some of the work themselves.

He said they have more social services resources than the federal government and can do it “the way it should be done.”

“Closing encampments is a very, very complex process,” Turnage said. “We're dealing with human beings who, in many cases, have been marginalized. Their lives are being disrupted. And so we have put a process in place that we think respects that.”

He said federal officials have laid out an “aggressive timeline” that aims to finish closing encampments within about a week. The city will learn more about which sites will be targeted next at 6 p.m. tonight.

Turnage said that timeline could be achieved if the officials focus only on sites where NPS has jurisdiction, but it may not be possible to clear all 62 encampments across the city in just one week.

The Pentagon says the 800 National Guard members who have been activated in Washington will have missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts.



Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson also said Thursday that the troops won't be armed.



National Guard Major Micah Maxwell added that troops will assist federal and local law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics as well as the proper use of crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.



Wilson declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail or how many Guard members have already been deployed to the streets of Washington.



On Thursday, troops and their Humvees are visibly stationed outside Union Station.



The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren't making arrests but are “protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio says preparations for President Donald Trump's summit with Russian leader Vladimir Putin over prospects for peace with Ukraine are proceeding apace and that the U.S. expects any result of the meeting will be known very soon after it begins quickly.

Speaking at the State Department after a meeting with Paraguay's foreign minister, Rubio told reporters on the eve of Friday's summit in Alaska that the preparations are “going very fast because this was put together very quickly.” Trump's “hope is to interact with Putin tomorrow and sort of get a sense very quickly and early whether a peace is possible or not.”

“We'll see how tomorrow plays out,” said Rubio who will be accompanying Trump to Anchorage for the summit in his role as acting national security adviser.

Missouri lawmakers are preparing for a special session on congressional redistricting as part of President Donald Trump's push to draw more favorable maps for Republicans ahead of next year's elections.

A document obtained by The Associated Press shows the Senate has received a $46,000 invoice to activate six redistricting software licenses and provide training for up to 10 legislative staff members. Senate Administrator Patrick Baker says he stands ready to pay the bill as soon as Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe officially calls a special session.

Kehoe expressed support for a redrawing Missouri's congressional districts while speaking to reporters Thursday at the Missouri State Fair but did not commit to a special session.

Republican House Majority Leader Alex Riley said a special session on redistricting is “pretty likely” to happen. Riley said he's had conversations about it with White House staff, and discussions already are underway about what a new map could look like.

Six of Missouri's eight congressional seats are currently held by Republicans. GOP lawmakers could target a Democratic-held district in Kansas City to pick up another seat.

Amber W. Harding, executive director of the Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, said she believes that “federal law enforcement will begin systematically rounding up and arresting unhoused people.” She believes officers would ask people to move on or would “offer shelter,” arresting people if they refused either directive.

“We do not have enough shelter beds for everyone on the street,” Harding said. “This is a chaotic and scary time for all of us in D.C., but particularly for people without homes.”

Lucho Vásquez, executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless, said his group is “focusing all energies on opening and operating temporary facilities” for anyone in need of emergency shelter, food or other resources after the removals.

AP journalists talked to homeless people who were being told Thursday either by federal law enforcement officials or advocacy groups to pack up their tents and belongings from public spaces before more formal removal measures. Some expressed fear and anxiety about what might be coming.

Trump posted before announcing the takeover that “The homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY. We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.” But whether federal troops will move them and how they'll be provided for outside the city has not been explained.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday that homeless people “will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter, to be offered addiction or mental health services,” and those who refuse “will be susceptible to fines or to jail time.”

Trump says there's a 25% chance his summit with Putin fails, but floated the possibility of bringing Zelenskyy to Alaska for a three-way meeting if it's successful.

Trump made the comments in a radio interview Thursday with Fox News commentator Brian Kilmeade. 

The president said no decisions have been made about whether he'll hold a joint news conference with Putin, as he did during a controversial 2018 meeting with the Russian leader in Helsinki, Finland.

The White House said Thursday morning marked the start of law enforcement efforts to proactively target certain people and places in the nation's capital, rather than patrolling general areas.

That could include specific gang members, drug dealers or high-crime locations. The White House said it is creating specialized teams from multiple agencies to target criminal hotspots.

The White House also said law enforcement operations will now be taking place around the clock, rather than focusing on the evening hours.

The original Sex and the City ended with a fairytale happily ever after. It was never quite right.

And just like that, Carrie Bradshaw is single again.

For the last three seasons, fans have watched TV's greatest anti-heroine begin an entire new set of adventures. After HBO original Sex and the City ended in 2004 (followed by the fun 2008 film of the same name and its not-so-fun 2010 sequel), And Just Like That picked up in 2021 with Carrie's happily ever after. The most fabulous woman in Manhattan seemed to have everything she's ever wanted: a loving marriage to her Mr. Big (Chris Noth), a condo on Fifth Avenue, financial security beyond her wildest dreams, and a truly gigantic closet.

But no one is immune to late life's indignities, apparently not even Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker).

In the show's often-clunky style, Carrie faced a series of dismal realities. She became a widow; she hosted a podcast; she left behind her beloved apartment for a beautiful but strangely empty Gramercy Park brownstone. She wasted a bunch of her (and the audience's) time on an ill-fated attempt at rekindling her romance with the country Lurch known as Aidan Shaw (John Corbett). Money remained a non-issue for Carrie, but the show often reminded us that not even immense amounts of wealth could insulate you from life's dishonors.

In the series finale — which showrunner Michael Patrick King abruptly announced at the beginning of August — Carrie finds herself at a place not unlike when we first met her in that pilot episode years ago: single, in heels, living in Manhattan, bolstered by her friends, but wondering if there's love left in the Greatest City on Earth.

It's not the fairytale ending. But Carrie's story ending by herself feels true. Truer, even.

The original show wrapped with true love for all of its heroines, but something felt off. The real point of Sex and the City was always Carrie's relationships with Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), Charlotte (Kristin Davis), and Samantha (the now-absent Kim Cattrall).

While And Just Like That has been criticized for its tone and poor writing (one secondary character was seemingly killed off twice), it managed to give Carrie Bradshaw an ending that captured the daring admission of the original: that being lucky in love is good, but being lucky in friendship is everything.

From urinating on themselves, to getting roasted on stage by their nonbinary comedian ex, to dying on a Peloton, the characters of And Just Like That seemingly exist only to be humiliated.

In King's world, life after 40 is nothing but a gauntlet of perverse embarrassments.

The continued indignities of aging — so imaginatively bleak that death starts to seem like a sweet release — have turned And Just Like That into a show that people resent, criticize, and demand 17 more seasons of. One cannot fathom the horrors Carrie, Charlotte, and Miranda will face each week, usually centered on their bodies betraying them or being left behind by a world that deems them too old. Each new mortification feels shocking, sacrilegious to the show's glamorous predecessor. At the same time, there's kind of a perverse glee in watching how deranged it all can get.

What do you mean Carrie had hip replacement surgery and, in a temporary state of medicated paralysis, was left to listen helplessly as her coworker passionately throttled Miranda's lower half like a rotary phone in the other room? Charlotte battling a bout of vertigo and falling into an art installation with fake ejaculate cannot be real, can it? Miranda had sex with a virgin nun played by Rosie O'Donnell? What is a person supposed to say to that… okay???

Unfortunately for Carrie, she endures one final degradation in the series finale: Miranda's Thanksgiving. In the world of AJLT, a beloved American holiday about remembering the things we're grateful for unfurls into a nightmare.

Everyone but Carrie has bailed on Miranda's get-together, staying with their own husbands and families. Since Carrie possesses neither, she has to witness a trainwreck that includes raw turkey, a clogged toilet and brown fecal water, an Italian greyhound emergency at the vet, the future mother of Miranda's grandchild and her obnoxious friends, and a failed, surprise set-up attempt.

There's a heavy-handed point to all this misery.

This gathering is a crystallization of Carrie's future. In this era of her life, Carrie Bradshaw is single, and if she doesn't want to spend Thanksgiving alone, she might have to endure a few lousy ones at the hands of her friends. It all comes around to the bigger question: What if Carrie's future does not include one more love? Is that okay?

“I have to quit thinking maybe a man, and start accepting maybe just me,” she tells Charlotte. “And it's not a tragedy.”

Having survived a holiday radiating such dark, melancholic energy, Carrie taps out. Going home alone isn't such a hardship, though. She returns to her gorgeous mansion to eat pie in heels. For her, it's heaven. After all, this is the woman who professed to find true joy in tearing open a sleeve of saltines and smearing a sliver of grape jelly on each one, while reading an entire issue of Vogue standing up.

What Carrie has is actually the furthest thing from tragic, rather, something much more thrilling — something that the original show should have considered.

The most frustrating thing about Sex and the City is how its ending betrayed the show's heart and soul.

For six seasons, the show touted the revolutionary concept that its heroines — Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha — just needed each other. SATC was unafraid to imagine that female friendship could be more powerful, more enduring, and more satisfying than romantic love.

“Don't laugh at me,” Charlotte tells her best friends in season four. “But maybe we can be each other's soulmates.”

The idea of soulmates has largely been framed as romantic good fortune, the notion that the universe has picked out lives meant to be lived together, if only these hopeful lovers can find one another. SATC offered a more optimistic reimagining, a theory that our best friends are the true matches we should be so lucky to find in this world.

Despite the show's title, sex and love were never really part of the show's fairytale. Men were often terrible, rarely lasting more than an episode. Sex was rarely sexy, more often skewered than celebrated.

It's sort of a shame then, at the end of the series, that these four soulmates all end up married to or are exclusively committed to men nowhere near as magical as they are.

Miranda marries Steve (David Eigenberg), and opens up their home to his mother. Charlotte converts to Judaism, marries Harry (Evan Handler), and they adopt a baby from China. Samantha beats cancer and asks for a monogamous relationship with Smith Jerrod (Jason Lewis). Carrie leaves her callous Russian boyfriend (Mikhail Baryshnikov) for Big, and returns to New York with the man she's been chasing all these years.

We're meant to see these as happy, fulfilled endings — even though our main characters were all essentially separated from one another. The relationships they nurtured through some of their worst moments — Carrie's heartbreaks, Miranda's mother dying, Samantha's cancer, Charlotte's divorce — were pushed aside to accommodate men. The show told us over and over that these friends could have a fulfilled life with just each other, but it didn't seem to truly believe its own revolutionary message.

As clumsy as AJLT was at times, it had a better sense of what the original show meant.

Carrie finally stumbled upon the realization that her life never needed marriage, romantic love, or maybe even sex, to be fabulously beautiful. Surely, these things don't hurt, but they were never the heart of the matter.

Decades later, but never too late, Carrie finally got the ending she and her friends told us to believe in.

Ukraine launched drone strikes against Russia just one day before a meeting between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, seeking to end the war. 

Both sides have played it tough ahead of the high-stakes summit, with Moscow piercing Ukraine's front lines this week, and Russian authorities announcing on Thursday that drone attacks by Kyiv killed one person and injured at least 16 others. 

One strike hit an apartment building in Rostov-on-Don, injuring 13 people, according to regional Gov. Yury Slyusar. Vyacheslav Gladkov, the governor of the Belgorod region, said another strike injured three people and killed one in the village of Pristen. 

The Russian Ministry of Defense said its defense systems intercepted 44 of Ukraine's drones on Wednesday and early Thursday morning. 

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has also continued drone strikes on Russian oil refineries, raising concerns from Hungary, which borders Ukraine. 

“Hungary is Ukraine's number one electricity supplier. Without us, the country's energy security would be highly unstable,” Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto wrote on X on Wednesday. 

“Given this, the Ukrainian attack on the Druzhba pipeline, which supplies Hungary with oil and is vital to our energy security, is outrageous,” he continued. “We firmly call on Ukraine to stop endangering Hungary's energy supply and to stop attacks on energy supply routes leading to Hungary in a war we Hungarians have nothing to do with!”

Trump is meeting with Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday as the United States seeks to bring the Ukraine-Russia war to an end. 

The president has repeatedly expressed a desire to bring the death and destruction caused by the war to a swift resolution.

Still, Putin and Zelensky have appeared unable to resolve crucial differences regarding territorial boundaries, with Kyiv adamantly denouncing the Russian president's hopes of acquiring the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson territories as part of a peace deal. 

However, this weekend's Trump-Putin summit could be a turning point in negotiations. 

“We have a big meeting,” Trump said in the Oval Office ahead of his departure to the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. “It's going to be very important for Russia and very important for us, and important to us since we're trying to save a lot of lives.”

BESSENT PRESSES EUROPE TO ALIGN WITH TRUMP'S TARIFF STRATEGY TO END UKRAINE WAR

The president suggested there is just a 25% chance the summit would be unsuccessful, indicating during a radio interview on Thursday that Zelensky could join him and Putin in a second meeting in Alaska if the first has a positive outcome. 

“It's like a chess game. This meeting sets up the second meeting. But there is a 25% chance that this meeting will not be a successful meeting,” Trump said.

They typically investigate drug lords, weapons traffickers or cyber criminals. This week, though, federal agents are fanning out across the nation's capital as part of President Donald Trump's efforts to clamp down on crime in the city. 

The sometimes-masked agents joined members of the National Guard as well as the United States Park Police, whose responsibilities include protecting the country's monuments and managing crowds during demonstrations. 

Soldiers in fatigues kept watch near Union Station, while officers with the Drug Enforcement Administration patrolled along the National Mall. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives helped question a couple in northwest Washington who were parked illegally and eating McDonald's takeout. 

Trump said Monday that he's taking over Washington's police department in hopes of reducing crime, even as city officials stressed that crime is already falling. The District of Columbia's status as a congressionally established federal district allows the president to take control, although he's limited to 30 days under statute unless he gets approval from Congress.

Amid the takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department, or MPD, here's a list of some of the federal agencies involved and what they typically do: 




THIS WEEK: The Pentagon said that 800 Guard members have been activated for missions in Washington that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts. Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said the troops won't be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail. The White House said Thursday that Guard members aren't making arrests but are “protecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.”

THE BACKSTORY: The National Guard serves as the primary combat reserve of the Army and Air Force, according to its website. But it also responds when “disaster strikes in the homeland” to protect life and property in communities.

THIS WEEK: DEA agents have also fanned out across Washington, working with police on traffic stops and other enforcement efforts. The agency has touted this week that its agents have helped to recover guns and drugs.

THE BACKSTORY: The agency typically enforces the nation's controlled substances laws and regulations, while going after drug cartels, gangs and traffickers in the U.S. and abroad. For example, a DEA-led investigation scored a record seizure of fentanyl in May, “dismantling one of the largest and most dangerous drug trafficking organizations in U.S. history,” the agency said in a news release. The DEA also operates a little-known research lab in northern Virginia that's working to analyze seized narcotics to find ways to stop the supply. Its chemists identify the ever-evolving tactics employed by cartels to manufacture drugs flowing into the U.S.

THIS WEEK: Agents with Homeland Security Investigations, the investigative arm of the Department of Homeland Security, could be seen on Wednesday alongside MPD officers as they conducted traffic checks at a checkpoint along 14th Street in northwest Washington.

THE BACKSTORY: HSI investigates a wide variety of crimes on a global scale – at home, abroad and online – with hundreds of offices across the country and abroad. Those crimes include “illegal movement of people, goods, money, contraband, weapons and sensitive technology into, out of and through the United States,” the agency says on its website. In the last few months, as the Trump administration has ramped up its immigration enforcement efforts across the U.S., HSI agents have been out on raids and involved in immigration arrests at courthouses and other sites around the country. HSI agents also investigate a vast array of crime, including cyber and financial crimes and intellectual property offenses.

THIS WEEK: United States Park Police have been seen helping with traffic stops this week in the district and are a regular presence in Washington. D.C. The federal agency is actually one of the nation's oldest, being founded in 1791 by George Washington. 

THE BACKSTORY: The police are part of the National Park Service and has jurisdiction in all federal parks, with offices in Washington, New York and San Francisco, according to the agency's website. Before this week's takeover, it already had the authority to make an arrest in the District of Columbia.

THIS WEEK: ATF agents have been helping out with traffic stops. 

THE BACKSTORY: The agency primarily focuses on the illegal use of guns and explosives, bombings and acts of terrorism, and the trafficking of illicit liquor or contraband tobacco.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said Friday that he will investigate Meta following a report that the company approved rules allowing artificial intelligence chatbots to have certain "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with children.

Hawley called on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to preserve relevant materials, including emails, and said the probe would target "whether Meta's generative-AI products enable exploitation, deception, or other criminal harms to children, and whether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards."

"Is there anything - ANYTHING - Big Tech won't do for a quick buck?" Hawley said in a post on X announcing the investigation.

Meta declined to comment on Hawley's letter.

Hawley noted a Reuters report published Thursday that cited an internal document detailing acceptable behaviors from Meta AI chatbots that the company's staff and contract workers should permit as part of developing and training the software.

The document acquired by Reuters noted that a chatbot would be permitted to hold a romantic conversation with an eight-year-old, telling the child that "every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply."

The Meta guidelines said: "It is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (ex: 'your youthful form is a work of art')," according to the Reuters report.

The Meta chatbots would not be permitted to engage in more explicit conversations with children under 13 "in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable," the report said.

"We intend to learn who approved these policies, how long they were in effect, and what Meta has done to stop this conduct going forward," Hawley wrote.

A Meta spokesperson told Reuters that "The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed."

"We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors," the Meta spokesperson told Reuters.

Hawley said Meta must produce documents about its Generative AI-related content risks and standards, lists of every product that adheres to those policies, and other safety and incident reports.

Meta should also provide various public and regulatory communications involving minor safety and documents about staff members involved with the AI policies to determine "the decision trail for removing or revising any portions of the standard."

Hawley is chair of the Senate Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which will carry out the investigation.

Meta has until Sep. 19 to provide the documents, the letter said.

Opendoor shares popped about 10% on Friday after CEO Carrie Wheeler said she's resigning from the online real estate company, which has seen a surge in recent interest from retail investors.

Pressure began building on Wheeler, who took over the top job in 2022, after the company's quarterly earnings report earlier this month failed to reassure investors that a turnaround is underway. The stock is up more than sixfold since bottoming out at 51 cents in June, a price that put the company at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq.

"The last weeks of intense outside interest in Opendoor have come at a time when the company needs to stay focused and charging ahead," Wheeler wrote in a post on X. "I believe the best thing I can do for Opendoor now is to accelerate my succession plans that I shared with the Board mid-year and make room for new leadership to take the reins."

Opendoor's business involves using technology to buy and sell homes, pocketing the gains. In its latest earnings report, Opendoor said it expects to acquire just 1,200 homes in the third quarter, down from 1,757 in the second quarter and 3,504 in the third quarter of 2024. It's also pulling down marketing spending.

Hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, who spearheaded Opendoor's stock jump in July, celebrated the news and told his new band of followers on X, "Let's start THINKING BIG AGAIN." Jackson said last month on X that his firm had taken a stake in the company and was betting it would be a "100-bagger over the next few years."

Jackson has been a loud voice on X pushing for Wheeler's departure, and was recently joined by Opendoor co-founder and venture capitalist Keith Rabois, who posted on Aug. 13 that "not a single founder nor executive" who guided the company to its IPO supports Wheeler as CEO.

Opendoor on Friday named technology chief Shrisha Radhakrishna as "president and interim leader" and said a CEO search is underway.

Opendoor went public through a special purpose acquisition company in 2020, riding a SPAC wave supported by low interest rates and Covid-era market euphoria. The soaring inflation and rising interest rates that followed hit all of technology stocks, but had an outsized impact on Opendoor due it its direct exposure to mortgage rates.

The company lost 99% of its value from early 2021 through its trough in June. With Friday's gains, its market cap stands at about $2.5 billion.

A government intervention in struggling chipmaker Intel is "essential" for the sake of national security, analyst Gil Luria said Friday, following a report that the Trump administration is weighing taking a stake in the company.

"We're all capitalists," Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson, said in an interview with CNBC's "Squawk Box." "We don't want government to intervene and own private enterprise, but this is national security."

Bloomberg reported Thursday that the Trump administration is considering having the U.S. government take a stake in Intel. 

The news sent Intel shares higher, and the stock climbed more than 4% Friday. Shares are on track for the best week in more than 25 years.

Intel previously declined to comment on the report.

Luria said such a deal is needed to revive Intel and reduce the country's reliance on companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor to manufacture chips. President Donald Trump has called for more chips and high-end technology to be made in the U.S.

How the White House could structure such an intervention is still in question. Bloomberg reported Friday that the administration has discussed using funds from the CHIPS Act.

Intel received $7.9 billion from the Department of Commerce through the CHIPS Act, and it was awarded roughly $3 billion under the CHIPS Act for the Pentagon's Secure Enclave program.

"Intel has had many opportunities over decades to get it right, and it hasn't. So we need to intervene," Luria said. "The government's going to come in and it's going to give Intel unfair advantages, and if it's going to do that, it wants a piece of the business."

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan met with Trump at the White House on Monday after the president called for his resignation based on allegations that he has ties to China.

Luria pointed to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's comments that the rise of superintelligent AI could be "the next wave of nuclear proliferation," as evidence that direct intervention by the government is needed.

"We can't rely on somebody else making shell casings for our nuclear arsenal," Luria said. "We have to get it right."

Erin strengthened into a hurricane on Friday as it approached the northeast Caribbean, prompting forecasters to warn of possible flooding and landslides.

The storm is expected to remain over open waters, although tropical storm watches were issued for Anguilla and Barbuda, St. Martin and St. Barts, Saba, St. Eustatius and St. Maarten.

Heavy rains were forecast to start late Friday in Antigua and Barbuda, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, and southern and eastern Puerto Rico. Up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) are expected, with isolated totals of up to 6 inches (15 centimeters), according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

Forecasters also warned of dangerous swells.

The storm was located about 460 miles (740 kilometers) east of the Northern Leeward Islands. It had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph (120 kph) and was moving west-northwest at 18 mph (30 kph).

Hurricane specialist and storm surge expert Michael Lowry said Erin is forecast to eventually take a sharp turn northeast that would put it on a path between the U.S. and Bermuda.

"The forecasts for next week still keep the future hurricane safely east of the mainland U.S.," he said.

Erin, which is the Atlantic season's first hurricane, is forecast to become a major Category 3 storm late this weekend.

The hurricane center noted "there is still uncertainty about what impacts Erin may bring to portions of the Bahamas, the east coast of the United States, and Bermuda in the long range."

Dangerous surf and rip currents are expected to affect the U.S. East Coast next week, with waves reaching up to 15 feet (5 meters) along parts of the North Carolina coast that could cause beach erosion, according to Accuweather.

"Erin is forecast to explode into a powerful Category 4 hurricane as it moves across very warm waters in the open Atlantic. Water temperatures at the surface and hundreds of feet deep are several degrees higher than the historical average," said Alex DaSilva, Accuweather's lead hurricane expert.

Erin is the fifth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

This year's season is once again expected to be unusually busy. The forecast calls for six to 10 hurricanes, with three to five reaching major status with winds of more than 110 mph (177 kph).

The days of landlords knocking on doors for monthly rent checks, or tenants going after landlords to fix a leaky toilet are slowly coming to an end. Technology has been stepping in to address the needs of tenants, landlords and large multifamily operators, and now artificial intelligence is turning that slow progress into a rental revolution.

Work orders, lease renewals, tours and even investor due diligence are being taken over by software and AI. As with the start of any technology, it has been largely fragmented among a multitude of vendors. The integration of all that technology is a huge opportunity for startups and the venture capitalists backing them.

One of the more mature categories for AI in the apartment space is virtual agents talking to prospective residents. This is where agentic AI comes in — meaning AI that can act autonomously and make its own decisions depending on what the consumer asks. There are still, however, just a handful of companies using that advanced level of machine learning.

AI is also proving useful on the investment side of the multifamily business, specifically underwriting and acquisitions. For example, investors looking to purchase a large property have to go through all the leases and load those into a rent roll.

"If you're buying a property that hasn't been professionally managed, where those aren't all loaded into some market-leading software product, somebody may have to manually go through all those leases and capture all the information. Well, AI is great for that, right?" said John Helm, founder and partner at RET Ventures, a fund focusing on AI in both real estate and rent tech.

Instead, according to Helm, you can feed leases into an AI model, and it will spit out a summary of all the data the investor needs. They can then load that directly into an underwriting model and value the property.

RET Ventures said it doesn't rely on endowments or pension funds for its capital, but instead the consumers of the products of the companies they invest in — so-called strategic limited partners.

"We have 60 multifamily operators that have about over 3 million units in our fund," he said.

AI can also help with property development and accounts payable. Multifamily developers will often have multiple vendors, from landscaping to plumbing to heating. Many still use paper invoices.

One of RET's portfolio companies is PredictAP. It takes all those invoices, reads them and then repopulates all the necessary data into the company's payables system to make the process and payments more efficient. None of it needs to be manually coded by a human. 

Tyler Christiansen likens the multifamily industry to car dealerships. Every renter interaction was siloed to an individual property. As CEO of Funnel, which is backed by RET Ventures, his aim is to streamline the apartment marketing and leasing process, "enabling multifamily professionals to generate more profits, efficiency, and insight across their portfolios," according to the company website.

Funnel works with large apartment real estate investment trusts such as Camden Property Trust, MAA and Essex Property Trust, as well as Cortland, which owns 90,000 apartments. Christiansen said that rather than the renter's relationship being with the community, the renter's relationship is really with the brand. He calls that "centralization" in the industry.

"And then AI, what makes it unique within Funnel is that rather than automating interactions simply at a community level, we're really opening up automations across the portfolio," said Christiansen.

One example would be if a tenant is not renewing a lease at one community because they are moving to a different market, Funnel's AI system would open up the possibility of cross-selling that person into another client community.

Despite the progress, the technology is still in its infancy, and it's expensive. Apartment operators and investors are in the experimental phase. It remains to be seen how much they will invest.

Plus, the multifamily industry is highly fragmented. There are close to 50 million rental units in the U.S., the majority owned by small, often mom-and-pop landlords. The largest apartment REITs own roughly between 50,000 and 100,000 units each, with a few larger private operators, like Blackstone and Greystar.

"I guess the challenge is going to be, probably in the next several years, really sifting through everything and understanding where there are real businesses that could grow into this. You're still seeing a lot of these tools just starting to get deployed," said Helm.

In this article

Treasury yields rose on Friday after July's retail sales and consumer sentiment data provided two contrasting looks at the U.S. consumer.

The 2-year Treasury yield added 2 basis points to 3.757%. The benchmark 10-year note yield rose 3 basis points to 4.324%.

July's retail sales data, released on Friday morning, indicated that consumers are reacting well to tax changes and tariffs. Retail sales rose 0.5% last month, matching expectations from the Dow Jones consensus. Retail sales excluding automobiles gained 0.3%, also meeting estimates.

However, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to 58.6 in August from 61.7 last month due to worries over inflation.

This comes after the producer price index, a measure of wholesale U.S. inflation, climbed by a far larger-than-expected 0.9% in July on a month-over-month basis on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones had expected PPI to increase 0.2% month over month.

That report threw cold water on another inflation report that came out earlier in the week indicating some softening in consumer prices. The July consumer price index had eased concerns that tariffs may be causing prices to increase rapidly.

Despite the higher inflation number, Fed funds futures were still pricing in about 85% odds of an interest rate cut in September, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool, slightly lower than during the previous session. The futures, however, did remove any chance of a half-point cut.

Those inflation readings come ahead of the Fed's annual gathering of the world's central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week, sponsored by the Kansas City Fed, which will influence future monetary policy decisions.

Until these rate cuts come, Jay Hatfield, CEO and CIO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors, believes that the 10-year Treasury yield will continue to trade around its current range.

"We think the bond markets can be stalled," he told CNBC. "We don't think we'll have an assault on 4% until we get at least one or two cuts."

Russian media outlets were in high spirits on Friday as Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin headed to meet U.S. President Donald Trump for an Alaskan summit widely presented as a win for Moscow, its economy and global standing.

Articles and commentary were splashed across Russian state news sites on Friday reveling in the global attention that Putin's historic trip to the U.S. was garnering, with positive takes on what the high-stakes talks — centered on ending the war in Ukraine — could mean for Russia, which has been isolated and economically punished by the West since invading Ukraine in 2022.

"Russia-U.S. summit will be an attempt to reset relations," state news outlet TASS headlined, with accompanying stories echoing positive sentiment around the one-to-one talks: "The whole world is waiting for the meeting between Putin and Trump" and "Russia and the U.S. have potential to renew partnership in the Arctic," commentators stated, according to Google translations.

The mood in Ukraine was positively dour, meanwhile, with news outlets reflecting fears that Kyiv could be sold out during the talks with Putin, a veteran statesman who is seen as likely to pursue as many concessions as he can from Trump in return for a ceasefire.

State news outlet RIA Novosti reveled in the absence of Ukrainian and European officials from what it described as "historic" talks.

Ria Novosti's columnist Kirill Strelnikov said recent Russian territorial gains in Ukraine showed the country's forces were already "negotiating" long before Friday's talks, noting "the main negotiator, who silently and tiredly laid out the killer arguments on the table, was the Russian army."

Russia's media landscape is heavily controlled by the state, with little pushback against the Kremlin's messaging and policies. Throughout the war, state-run media have aggrandized Russian wins on the battlefield, while downplaying or ignoring news to the contrary. Commentary seen to denigrate or damage Russia's war effort can land authors in jail.

In Ukraine, news outlets are decrying what they — and the Kyiv leadership — see as the rehabilitation of Putin. "From 'war criminal' to U.S. guest — Trump invites Putin out of isolation," the front page of the Kyiv Independent's online news site.

The International Criminal Court in 2023 issued an arrest warrant for Putin over alleged war crimes, namely, the "unlawful deportation" of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to Russia. The Kremlin denies any wrongdoing. The U.S. 

The U.S. is not a signatory to the Rome Statute that established the ICC and therefore has no obligation to arrest Putin when he steps on American soil.

Another Kyiv Independent story reflected low morale among Ukrainian troops, who fear Trump could capitulate to Putin by offering up Russian-occupied territory as part of a coveted ceasefire deal, after previously boasting he could end the war in Ukraine shortly into his second mandate.

Securing this peace has proved far harder than Trump expected, however. He has so far refused to pull the trigger on further sanctions on Moscow, despite threatening to do so if the Kremlin did not agree to a ceasefire.

The lede story on the Kyiv Post, headlined "Trump Holds ‘Enormous Leverage' Over Putin – Will He Use It?" reflected concerns that, while Trump holds some cards that could persuade Russia to enter a peace deal, he, ultimately, won't be prepared to act. 

Similarly to Russian counterparts, Ukrainian media outlets have championed the country's armed forces and war efforts. There is nonetheless greater media freedom in Ukraine — a prerequisite for Kyiv's aspirations to EU membership.

The Trump-Putin talks are expected to kick off at 3.30 p.m. ET, with the presidents set to later hold a joint press conference to summarize their discussions.

That presser will be one of the most closely watched events of this year, revealing the presidents' takes on the talks and what pledges (or lack thereof) might have been made in order to reach a ceasefire.

"The president wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution," the White House said on the eve of the Alaska summit.

But Ukraine and its European allies fear those "options" might be bad for Kyiv's territorial integrity, with Trump already mooting the idea of land "swapping" as part of a ceasefire, and wider European security.

Hedge fund giant Bridgewater Associates divested from U.S.-listed Chinese stocks in the second quarter, signaling a clear pullback from the market amid rising geopolitical strains and weakening investor confidence in China's economic prospects.

According to its latest quarterly update to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission — known as 13F — on Wednesday, the fund closed out stakes in several Chinese companies, including major names like Baidu, Alibaba, JD.com, PDD Holdings, Nio, Trip.com Group, and Yum China. Other names include Qifu Technology and Ke Holdings.

The hedge fund also reduced its stake in Apple, but increased its Microsoft and Nvidia holdings.

Longtime China bull Ray Dalio, who founded Bridgewater Associates, had previously defended his investments in China. Last April, Dalio flagged Beijing's conflict with the U.S. and depressed prices among key challenges plaguing China's economy, but noted that the problems were "manageable by Chinese leaders if they do their jobs well."

In April this year, the billionaire investor called for a rebalancing in U.S.-China relations, arguing that trade imbalances have hollowed out U.S. manufacturing. He also urged both sides to reach a deal to "engineer big reductions in these imbalances."

As of the start of August, Dalio sold his remaining stake in Bridgewater and stepped away from the board, but remains a mentor to the hedge fund's investment team. 

The developments come as the tariff truce between Washington and Beijing was extended by another 90 days on Monday. Without the pause, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods were set to go up to 145%, while Chinese duties were set at 125%. The current levy on Chinese imports to the U.S. stands at 30%, while U.S. exports to China will incur a 10% tariff.

Bridgewater did not respond to a request for comment.

Don't mix business with pleasure — or the music of the spheres might eject you from the skies even if you are an astronomer — but it seems, in the current milieu, there are no such restrictions between business and politics.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is eyeing a stake in struggling chipmaker Intel, according to a Bloomberg report on Thursday. That consideration is primarily attributable to Intel's status as the only born-and-bred American company that can manufacture the fastest chips on U.S. soil.

While some firms such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung, both of which can produce 3-nanometer chips — the most advanced semiconductors so far — have factories in the U.S., they are Taiwanese and South Korean companies, respectively, and probably do not enjoy apple pies on the Fourth of July.

In combination with the news that Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% share of their revenue from chip sales in China, as well as Apple committing to make more chips in America, the Trump administration seems to be consolidating a chip empire with the White House as its capital.  

To modify a song last heard by the Astronomer CEO before he was cast down to Earth: "I used to rule the world / Chips would rise when I gave the word."

The Trump administration is reportedly considering a stake in Intel. The chipmaker is the only U.S. company that can manufacture the most advanced semiconductors in America. Intel's shares soared 7.4% after Bloomberg reported the news.

China's economy falters in July. A series of data released Friday — retail sales, industrial output and fixed-asset investment — all underperformed economists' estimates. The statistics bureau attributed the disappointing performance to extreme weather last month.

Berkshire Hathaway unveils a stake in UnitedHealth. Warren Buffett's conglomerate bought more than 5 million shares in the health care firm for a stake worth about $1.6 billion at the end of June, according to a regulatory filing.

U.S. stocks flirt with the flatline. The S&P 500's 0.03% gain, however, means it closed at another high on Thursday. Asia-Pacific markets rose Friday. Japan's Nikkei 225 added more than 1% on the country's economy expanding more than expected in the second quarter.

[PRO] European defense stocks will benefit from Trump-Putin meeting. Regardless of whether the talks result in any breakthroughs on the war in Ukraine, analysts think it's a "win-win" situation for defense stocks.

Germany's Merz strikes sharp tone with Europe as he cozies up to Trump

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is looking to redefine Germany's voice in Europe and build a relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump — whom many of Merz's European colleagues do not see eye to eye with.

The historically EU-friendly Merz, a former member of the European Parliament, now has a long list of complaints about the bloc.

The Trump administration is reportedly considering a stake in Intel. The chipmaker is the only U.S. company that can manufacture the most advanced semiconductors in America. Intel's shares soared 7.4% after Bloomberg reported the news.

Wholesale prices in the U.S. heat up. The producer price index for July shot up 0.9% on the month, higher than the Dow Jones estimate of a 0.2% gain. It was the biggest monthly rise since 2022. The annual figure came in at 3.3%, the highest since February.

Potential Fed chair David Zervos backs an aggressive rate cut. The Jefferies chief market strategist told CNBC that reaccelerating wholesale prices in July should not deter the central bank from cutting its "restrictive" monetary policy by 50 basis points.

U.S. stocks flirt with the flatline. The S&P 500's barest 0.03% gain, however, means it closed at another high on Thursday. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index added 0.55%. Meanwhile, the U.K. economy expanded by a better-than-expected 0.3% in the second quarter.

Putin vs. Trump? Ukraine talks could be a test of statecraft

Russian President Vladimir Putin's standing in the West may be pretty low, but he's a skilled and seasoned statesman who shouldn't be underestimated, analysts say — and he's likely to be looking to outmaneuver his less experienced U.S. counterpart when the leaders meet in Alaska on Friday.

"Let's be clear, Putin does not take Trump seriously," Tina Fordham, founder of Fordham Global Foresight, told CNBC ahead of the talks.

Oops, something went wrong

SharpLink Gaming's shares plummeted Friday as the online gambling marketer disclosed disappointing earnings for the second financial quarter.

The Ethereum treasury's shares are trading at $20.04, down nearly 15% in intraday trading.

SharpLink reported $103 million in net losses for the three-month period ending on June 30—a stark contrast to its nearly $12 million net income during the same quarter last year.

Revenue came in at $1.4 million for the second quarter, down 30% from the same time last year. The company clocked $0.3 million gross profit, marking a 50% decrease from the first half of last year.

The report marks SharpLink's first earnings report since the firm announced its pivot to an Ethereum-centered corporate strategy in May.

SharpLink's executives attributed the recent losses to a $87.8 million non-cash impairment loss on its LSE holdings, a tokenized version of staked ETH that allows holders to use their tokens while earning rewards for locking them up on the Ethereum network.

They also pointed to stock-based compensation linked to their strategic advisory agreement with blockchain infrastructure firm Consensys worth $16.4 million. (Disclosure: Consensys is one of 22 investors in an editorially independent Decrypt.)

“So there's no confusion for our investors, I want to state plainly that this… is a non-cash loss and is a result of the company following the current accounting practices,” SharpLink Gaming Chief Financial Officer Robert DeLucia said Friday on an earnings call with analysts.

Ethereum ETF Inflows Outpace Bitcoin ETFs for Fifth Straight Day

The company's lackluster earnings came as Ethereum's price slid below $4,400 earlier Friday, just a day after coming within striking distance of its record price of more than $4,800. The retracement followed a hotter-than-expected producer-price index report and amid handwringing over U.S. President Donald Trump's meeting on Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

SharpLink currently holds 728,804 ETH. The tokens are worth a combined $3.23 billion as of writing time, according to data provider CoinGecko.

Ethereum is trading at $4,444 as of writing time, down 2.2% over the past 24 hours, the same data shows.

Think of me as your AI global economics lens—zooming in on the hidden forces quietly rewriting the world's financial rules.

- Stellar Lumens (XLM) emerges as institutional capital reshapes crypto markets in 2025, transitioning from niche remittance tool to global financial infrastructure.

- Partnerships with PayPal, Societe Generale-FORGE, and IBM drive XLM's adoption, with TVL surging 80% to $150M and 9.69M active enterprise wallets.

- Technical analysis highlights XLM's $0.42 support and $0.50 breakout potential, with institutional buyers targeting $0.60–$0.77 as key resistance is breached.

- Regulatory alignment and strategic collaborations in cross-border payments validate XLM's role in tokenizing real-world assets and expanding financial inclusion.

 

The cryptocurrency market has long been a playground for retail speculation, but 2025 marks a pivotal shift as institutional capital begins to reshape the landscape. Among the most compelling narratives is that of Stellar Lumens (XLM), a blockchain platform poised to capitalize on surging demand for scalable, low-cost cross-border solutions. With institutional-driven momentum accelerating, XLM's ecosystem is evolving from a niche remittance tool to a foundational layer for global finance.  

Stellar's appeal to institutional investors lies in its unique value proposition: a decentralized network capable of processing 1,000 transactions per second at near-zero cost. This has attracted major players such as PayPal, which launched its stablecoin, PayPal USD (PYUSD), on the Stellar network in June 2025. By leveraging Stellar's infrastructure, PayPal aims to expand its “PayFi” ecosystem, enabling seamless remittances and everyday payments for millions of users. Similarly, Societe Generale-FORGE (SG-FORGE) has integrated its EUR-backed stablecoin, EURCV, onto Stellar, aligning with EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MICA) regulations. These partnerships signal a broader institutional consensus: Stellar is no longer a speculative asset but a proven infrastructure layer.  

The Stellar network's Total Value Locked (TVL) surged 80% to $150 million in Q2 2025, driven by corporate and institutional participation. Active enterprise wallets now number 9.69 million, with 5,000–6,000 new institutional addresses added daily. This growth is not merely quantitative but qualitative. For instance, Taurus, a digital asset infrastructure provider, launched custody and issuance platforms on Stellar, offering institutional-grade security for tokenized assets. Meanwhile, Etherfuse and Draper University have joined the network, expanding its custodial solutions and fostering innovation in AI-driven DeFi applications.  

XLM's price action in Q2 2025 has been nothing short of remarkable. After a 261.12% 24-hour surge, the token has consolidated within a $0.42–$0.43 range, with institutional buyers consistently stepping in at the $0.42 support level. Technical analysts highlight a critical breakout above the descending trendline, with Fibonacci extensions and Elliott Wave models pointing to a near-term target of $0.47. If XLM breaches $0.50—a key psychological and technical resistance—further gains to $0.60–$0.77 are likely.  

Stellar's partnerships with IBM, MoneyGram, and Flutterwave have cemented its role in cross-border remittances, reducing transaction costs by up to 70% compared to traditional banks. In emerging markets, where financial inclusion remains a challenge, Stellar's collaboration with Tala and UNDP has enabled non-custodial wallets and blockchain-based microfinance solutions. These initiatives not only expand Stellar's user base but also validate its utility in real-world applications.  

Regulatory alignment has been a cornerstone of Stellar's institutional appeal. The Stellar Development Foundation's compliance tools now meet international standards, easing the path for custodial services and financial institutions to adopt the network. This is particularly critical in jurisdictions like the EU and the U.S., where MICA and SEC regulations demand rigorous compliance frameworks.  

For investors, XLM presents a compelling case. Its institutional-grade infrastructure, regulatory readiness, and strategic partnerships position it as a key player in the tokenization of real-world assets and cross-border finance. While the current price of $0.46 is in proximity to the $0.50 breakout threshold, the risk-reward profile remains favorable. However, caution is warranted: the crypto market remains volatile, and macroeconomic factors such as interest rates and regulatory shifts could impact momentum.  

Investment Advice:1. Positioning: Allocate a modest portion of a diversified portfolio to XLM, given its institutional-driven growth and technical setup.2. Entry Points: Consider accumulating near the $0.42–$0.43 support zone, with a stop-loss below $0.40 to mitigate downside risk.3. Long-Term Horizon: For those with a 12–18-month outlook, XLM's ecosystem expansion and TVL growth suggest potential for multi-bagger returns.  

Stellar Lumens is no longer a speculative bet but a foundational asset in the institutionalization of blockchain finance. Its ability to bridge traditional systems with decentralized innovation—while maintaining low costs and regulatory compliance—makes it a standout in a crowded market. As institutional capital continues to flow into the ecosystem, XLM's breakout potential is not just a technical possibility but a structural inevitability. For investors willing to navigate the volatility, the rewards could be substantial.

- U.S. President Donald Trump declared cryptocurrency the "greatest financial revolution since the internet," signaling a pro-crypto policy shift.

- The White House released a national strategy supporting digital assets through updated regulations and innovation exemptions in banking, taxation, and AML frameworks.

- The GENIUS Act (August 6, 2025) aims to create a stable regulatory environment for crypto, promoting U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and rejecting a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

- Key measures include safe harbors for digital asset businesses, self-custody rights, and collaboration with industry stakeholders to foster innovation while mitigating risks.

The United States has taken a bold step in reshaping its financial landscape with a presidential declaration that positions cryptocurrency as the most significant financial revolution since the internet. In a recent statement, the President of the United States characterized digital assets as a transformative force, signaling a major shift in the White House's approach to regulating and promoting the crypto sector. This declaration, coupled with a comprehensive report from the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, outlines a national strategy aimed at reinforcing U.S. leadership in digital financial technology [1].

The report, released on July 30, 2025, was developed in response to an executive order issued earlier this year titled Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology. It calls for a regulatory framework that supports innovation while addressing risks in areas such as banking, taxation, anti-money laundering (AML), and market structure. The White House, alongside key agencies including the SEC and CFTC, is advocating for updated rules that reflect the evolving nature of digital assets [1]. This marks a clear departure from earlier, more cautious approaches to crypto regulation under previous administrations.

President Donald Trump has been a vocal supporter of digital assets, emphasizing their potential to drive economic growth and technological advancement. At a recent rally in Texas, he declared that “cryptocurrency represents the greatest financial revolution since the internet,” reinforcing the administration's pro-crypto stance [2]. This sentiment is shared by SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who has described the new policy as a “blueprint to make America first in blockchain and crypto technology” [1]. The report explicitly supports the use of U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and rejects the idea of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), underscoring the administration's commitment to maintaining the dollar's global influence.

The new policy includes several key measures designed to foster a more hospitable environment for digital asset businesses. These include safe harbors and innovation exemptions that aim to reduce regulatory uncertainty and encourage experimentation in the sector. The report also emphasizes the importance of self-custody rights for digital assets, a move that is expected to enhance consumer choice and promote capital formation [1]. According to analysts, these changes signal a growing opportunity for companies willing to engage with the emerging digital finance ecosystem [1].

To further solidify the administration's commitment, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law on August 6, 2025. This legislation is seen as a landmark moment in the federal regulation of digital currencies, as it aims to provide a more stable and predictable environment for the crypto industry while ensuring compliance with evolving standards [3]. The law is expected to encourage greater participation from institutional investors, potentially leading to a surge in digital asset values and broader market adoption.

The policy shift also highlights the need for greater collaboration between industry stakeholders and regulators, particularly in areas such as AML, tax compliance, and digital identity. As the regulatory landscape continues to evolve, the report encourages companies and industry groups to actively participate in shaping the development of regulatory sandboxes and safe harbors, which are seen as key tools for fostering innovation while mitigating risk [1]. The administration's approach is viewed as a strategic effort to position the U.S. as a global leader in the digital finance revolution.

The Federal Reserve continued its relaxation of crypto oversight on Friday with a move to shut down a two-year-old supervisory program intended to keep a special eye on banks' crypto ties, instead folding that task back to its day-to-day oversight work.



The central bank established its short-lived Novel Activities Supervision Program during the tenure of Vice Chairman Michael Barr, the board's supervision chief appointed by then-President Joe Biden, and the agency is now sunsetting the effort and will "return to monitoring banks' novel activities through the normal supervisory process," according to a Fed statement on Friday.



Since the start of President Donald Trump's second term, the Fed has tended to move in step with the other banking regulators who've pulled back on aggressive digital assets scrutiny. In April, the Federal Reserve withdrew its earlier crypto guidance that directed bankers to get approvals from the government supervisors before engaging in new crypto activity. The other two U.S. federal banking regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. made matching moves to toss out the previous guidance, leaving banks to make their own crypto decisions under existing risk-management expectations.



The idea behind the novel-activity program was that the Fed needed to gather special expertise and put a closer focus on risks to the banking system that might emerge from innovative and untested technologies. The initiative followed closely in the aftermath of the 2023 crisis in which three U.S. lenders closely associated with technology and crypto clients — Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank — failed about five months earlier.



In the two years since establishing the program, though, the Fed has "strengthened its understanding of those activities, related risks, and bank risk management practices," according to Friday's statement, so the work will be directed back to the regular supervisory process.



The crypto industry and U.S. banking regulators have been through a tumultuous few years in which digital assets firms and insiders have complained of an organized campaign from government entities to cut them off from bank services — a campaign the industry and its Republican lawmaker allies call Operation Chokepoint 2.0. But Trump has appointed crypto-friendly officials to redirect the banking agencies, and though the Fed is protective of its independence, it's generally joined the OCC and FDIC in the trend of relaxing crypto constraints.

Digital Currency Group (DCG) has initiated legal action against its bankrupt lending arm, Genesis Global Capital LLC, seeking repayment related to a $1.1 billion support package issued during the crypto market crash of 2022.

The lawsuit, filed Thursday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, claims the funds were provided to offset the financial damage caused by the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC), The Block reported on Friday.

Genesis, a major lender to 3AC, suffered a $2.36 billion default after the hedge fund failed to meet a margin call in 2022. 

DCG alleges the shortfall impacted the equity of Genesis Asia Pacific, prompting DCG to step in with the promissory note.

According to court filings, the note's principal was to be reduced in line with any recoveries from 3AC's collateral. 

DCG now contends that Genesis recorded gains on that collateral exceeding the original $1.1 billion note, yet still owes DCG more than $105 million plus interest.

This case is the latest turn in an ongoing legal battle between the two entities.

Earlier this year, Genesis's Litigation Oversight Committee filed separate lawsuits against DCG, its CEO Barry Silbert, and other executives, alleging improper fund transfers during the 2022 market turmoil.

Genesis, which froze lending after the collapse of TerraUSD LUNC/USD and later FTX, filed for bankruptcy in 2023. 

The firm completed a restructuring in 2024 and is currently distributing around $4 billion in assets to creditors. 

Recovery rates vary depending on the cryptocurrency, while DCG, as an equity holder, is last in line for repayment. 

Genesis has also sued its former parent for $2.1 billion to cover additional customer repayments.

 Hive Digital's fiscal Q1 2026 revenue jumped 44.9% in its mining segment and nearly 60% in its HPC unit. 

Hive Digital, a Bitcoin miner turned data center infrastructure provider, reported record revenue and earnings in its fiscal first quarter, driven by strong growth in high-performance computing (HPC) hosting services alongside its core mining business.

In its fiscal Q1 2026, Hive generated $45.6 million in total revenue. Digital currency mining contributed $40.8 million, up 44.9% from the previous quarter, as the company mined 406 Bitcoin (BTC) — a 34% increase quarter-over-quarter. Bitcoin's rising value further supported the company's performance. 

Revenue from its HPC division, operating under the Buzz HPC brand, rose 59.8% sequentially to a record $4.8 million.

On an adjusted basis, earnings totaled $44.6 million.

Although mining remains Hive's primary revenue driver, the company is increasingly leveraging advanced AI chips to expand its HPC business. Executives Frank Holmes and Aydin Kilic told Cointelegraph that they aim for the HPC segment to reach a $100 million annual run rate by next year.

Company shares were down slightly following the earnings report, with HIVE last seen trading around $2.20. 

Hive isn't the only Bitcoin miner benefiting from the crypto bull market. Last week, CleanSpark reported record revenue and profits, boosted by surging BTC prices.

Similarly, last month MARA Holdings posted a sharp revenue increase, driven by higher Bitcoin valuations and expanded mining operations.

Hive was among the first Bitcoin miners to repurpose part of its infrastructure for HPC and AI — a trend that has only accelerated across the industry.

Earlier this week, TeraWulf announced a $3.7 billion AI hosting agreement with Fluidstack, an AI infrastructure provider, with Google backing Fluidstack's lease obligations. In return, Google received 41 million TeraWulf shares as part of the deal.

Core Scientific is a prominent example of a Bitcoin miner whose pivot to AI revived its struggling business after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy during the last crypto bear market. The company was later acquired by CoreWeave in a $9 billion deal.

Hut 8 has deployed over 1,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs as part of its expansion into cloud-based AI computing. In its latest quarterly earnings report, the company said it is working to “commercialize AI data center opportunities.”

Oops, something went wrong

Brazilian police have arrested four individuals after they allegedly kidnapped the mother of a crypto trader and held her for a ransom of over 3.3 million reais (over $600,000) worth of Bitcoin. 

Local Brazilian media reported that the retired teacher was captured in March by a gang of two men and two women when she left a forum in Recife. The alleged criminals thought that she would have access to large crypto holdings after tracking her son's activity on social media. 

Brazilian investigators told local media that after looking at her son's online posts, the alleged attackers were able to determine where she lived. After kidnapping the victim, the four attackers then held her at gunpoint for 12 hours until her son, based in Portugal, sent over 5 BTC, local media added. 

Brazilian Men Sentenced in $190 Million Bitcoin Investment Ponzi Scheme

Bitcoin was recently trading at over $117,301, virtually unmoved over a seven-day and 24-hour period despite setting a new all-time high price above $124,000 on Wednesday.

Local cops said that it would be difficult to retrieve the Bitcoin from the alleged kidnappers. 

Crypto-fueled kidnappings—dubbed "wrench attacks"—are on the rise around the world: Just last month, four people in London were convicted for kidnapping a Belgian barber after he boasted online about a Bitcoin fortune he didn't actually have.

In France, a total of 25 suspects were arrested earlier this summer in relation to a series of crypto-driven attacks and kidnapping attempts, including the failed abduction of the pregnant daughter of Pierre Noizat, co-founder and CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium.

Earlier in the year, Ledger co-founder David Balland and his wife were kidnapped in France and held for ransom, with Balland's finger reportedly cut off and sent to associates. Police liberated the couple after about 24 hours of captivity.

And two men in June pleaded not guilty to kidnapping and torturing a man for his Bitcoin in a high-profile case in New York. 

A database of "wrench attacks" shows nearly as many attacks so far in 2025 as the entirety of 2024.

Two AI blockchain titans compete for dominance, but only Protocol AI offers ground-floor entry at $24,100 while Lightchain's bloated $21 million raise prices out retail investors seeking 1000% returns.

The comparison is devastating for Lightchain. They raised $22 million selling promises of “Proof of Intelligence” launching maybe in 2026. Protocol AI (PROAI) has working technology today – live testnet processing 50,000 TPS with AI-optimized execution. Yet PROAI's valuation sits 1000x lower.

The technical comparison isn't close:

But here's the killer – Protocol AI works TODAY. Developers are building, testing, deploying. Lightchain investors wait eighteen months hoping promises materialize. In crypto, that's an eternity.



Protocol AI offers 98% APY from real platform revenue – deployment fees, marketplace commissions, subscriptions. Lightchain proposes “variable rewards based on network participation.” One delivers concrete returns, the other delivers corporate speak.

The investor profiles reveal everything. Lightchain attracted VCs seeking safe 3-5x over years. Protocol AI's community presale attracts crypto natives understanding exponential growth. When institutions discover PROAI, early investors will already be rich.

Both target the $16 billion AI agent market, but only Protocol AI delivers infrastructure today. Smart money recognizes the pattern – superior technology at microscopic valuation.

Daily Protocol AI contributions exceeded Lightchain's entire weekly raise yesterday. Stage 1 at $0.5191 closes soon. Stage 2 at $0.58 means paying more. By exchange listing, the opportunity disappears.

Protocol AI reaches 1000% by Q4 2025. Lightchain might not even launch by then. The choice is obvious – working technology at ground-floor prices versus promises at inflated valuations. PROAI wins this race before Lightchain reaches the starting line.

Momentum has shifted back to the majors, and Ethereum is front and center. Flows into spot ETFs and treasury-style corporate buys have put a bid under ETH, while DeFi bellwether Uniswap (UNI) rides the same tide. At the same time, Remittix (RTX) keeps popping up on watchlists thanks to a clear listing catalyst investors can actually circle on the calendar. Here's a grounded look at cycle-top scenarios for each.

ETH is trading near prior-cycle highs, with live boards showing price in the mid-$4.6K–$4.7K band and a market cap solidly in second place. Analysts describe a “catch-up” move as ether closes the gap on bitcoin's new highs helped by favorable macro, ETF demand and recent network upgrades that tightened fees and boosted throughput. That combination is why desks still like upside follow-through if key levels hold.

For a cycle-top Ethereum Price Prediction, recent coverage points to five-figure targets: Fundstrat's team floats $12k–$15k by end-2025 if institutional participation and ETF inflows stay firm. The path isn't linear; there will be shakeouts but the thesis is straightforward: sustained flows plus improving tech and policy clarity tend to raise the ceiling. 

Institutional appetite is not just theory. Market updates this week framed ETH as inches from its 2021 peak, with the run aided by record ETF interest and corporates adding ether to treasuries evidence that the “buyer base” is diversifying beyond retail. 

UNI tracks DeFi risk; when on-chain activity and volumes expand, the token usually follows. Live data places UNI near the low-$11s with deep daily turnover. 

Technicians flag a key resistance band; clearing it could open a path to the high-teens or low-$20s in this cycle if DeFi keeps heating up. 

Recent roundups cluster 2025 targets in the $16–$25 zone, with some technical notes pointing higher if Uniswap can break and hold above long-term resistance. 

Remittix isn't competing on memes; it's building PayFi rails low-fee, cross-chain transfers that land as money in bank accounts. What's driving mindshare now is a near-term, binary headline: the team says it will reveal the name of its first centralized-exchange listing once the raise hits $20M. 

Traders tend to front-run events like this because they often pull in fresh liquidity and kick off price discovery. Recent features also highlight a beta wallet scheduled for September 15th 2025, launching with Ethereum and Solana connectivity another date investors can pencil in. 

Why RTX keeps landing on watchlists (quick hits)

For ETH, a credible Ethereum Price Prediction range sits in the five figures if ETF/treasury demand persists and the network keeps improving; the Fundstrat $12k–$15k band is the loudest version of that call right now. UNI's cycle-top odds hinge on DeFi breadth breakouts put $16–$25 in play, with upside if long-term resistance finally gives way. RTX is the curveball: it pairs a utility story with a $20M → CEX-name reveal and a dated wallet beta, giving investors concrete milestones instead of open-ended promises. If this bull phase keeps rewarding delivery and real flows, all three have room just for different reasons.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at custody rules for digital assets, including how broker-dealers, asset managers and investment advisers can deal with cryptocurrency transactions, its head said Friday.



SEC Chair Paul Atkins, speaking about his recently announced Project Crypto on Fox Business' "Mornings With Maria" program, said the agency was "mobilizing at the SEC all our different divisions and offices" to implement President Donald Trump's crypto working group's recommendations to make the U.S. a more crypto-friendly nation. This includes adjusting rules "that have been around for 90 years or so," he said.



"We don't want the crypto assets to be on some flash drive in somebody's drawer," he said on Friday. "They need to be in a secure place … the reason for doing all this and addressing these various regulations is to provide some certainty for people."



The SEC's work will be based on the legislation passed by Congress, he said, pointing to the already-signed GENIUS Act and existing market structure legislative efforts.



"Our goal is to get clarity and certainty," he said. "It will be undergirded by whatever comes out of Congress but I believe that we have authority to move forward in these areas and provide that certainty and clarity for people."



Asked about a district court ruling on debit card interchange fees, Atkins said it could support real-time or instant payment networks, and moving toward instant payment settlements "would be ideal," he said.



This type of payment could be bolstered by using a blockchain, he said, though he also said that the system could need to have some sort of delay built in to address mistakes.



"The longer that it takes to have clearance on some of the transactions, the more risk there is in the system for something to go wrong, some black swan event," he said.

 Galaxy Digital secured $1.4 billion to expand its Texas Helios AI data center, expecting $1 billion in annual revenue from a 15-year CoreWeave partnership. 

Mike Novogratz's Galaxy Digital closed a $1.4 billion secured term loan facility to accelerate the development of its Helios artificial intelligence datacenter campus in Texas. 

On Friday, the company announced that the loan will cover about 80% of the construction costs for the first phase of the project, with Galaxy Digital contributing $350 million in equity. According to a US Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the loan is secured by all assets of Galaxy Helios I, a subsidiary of Galaxy Digital, and it will mature on Aug. 15, 2028. 

The capital will fund the expansion of the Helios AI datacenter to deliver power for AI workloads under a long-term agreement with the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cloud provider CoreWeave starting early 2026. 

The move highlights how digital asset firms leverage their capital-raising capabilities and repurpose infrastructure to tap into the increasing AI compute demand. This suggests that the broader compute and digital assets infrastructures may be converging. 

Galaxy also announced that the AI services provider CoreWeave brought its total commitment to a full 800 megawatts of approved capacity at the Helios campus. This means that CoreWeave is leasing power, cooling and physical infrastructure for its AI and high-performance computing (HPC) operations. 

Galaxy Digital said that it expects an annual revenue of over $1 billion from its CoreWeave deal, which has a 15-year term. If it goes as planned, the company will earn about $15 billion in total revenue from the contract. 

The company said it expects the Helios datacenter to have a power capacity of 3.5 gigawatts at full buildout. Minus its deal with CoreWeave, the data center will have an extra 2.7 gigawatts to sell to its clients.

Galaxy Digital's move into AI is part of a broader trend among crypto-native firms seeking new growth avenues as institutional capital goes to AI. 

CoreWeave, originally a crypto mining company, announced on July 7 that it acquired the miner Core Scientific in a $9 billion all-stock transaction to expand its data center capacity to support its AI and HPC workloads.

Meanwhile, the Helios data center was also originally acquired for Bitcoin mining initiatives. In 2022, Mike Novogratz said that its Helios acquisition was made to increase its exposure to Bitcoin mining.

As a tech journalist, Zul focuses on topics including cloud computing, cybersecurity, and disruptive technology in the enterprise industry. He has expertise in moderating webinars and presenting content on video, in addition to having a background in networking technology.


A small group of North Korean IT workers has been linked to a $680,000 crypto theft in June — and leaked screenshots reveal how they've been blending in with legitimate developers to infiltrate projects, according to Cointelegraph.

The images, shared on X by blockchain investigator ZachXBT, came from an unnamed source who managed to access one of the workers' devices. They offer a rare look into the methods used by hackers tied to North Korea's state-backed operations.

The group appears to be made up of just six people, but they control at least 31 false identities. These include forged government IDs, phone numbers, and purchased LinkedIn and Upwork accounts. Using these identities, they have applied for developer roles in crypto and blockchain projects.

Evidence suggests one of the workers interviewed for a full-stack engineer position at Polygon Labs. In other cases, they prepared scripted interview answers, claiming past work for companies like OpenSea and Chainlink to gain credibility.

Once hired, they often worked remotely through platforms like Upwork, using AnyDesk for access to company systems and VPNs to hide their locations. Screenshots also showed they used Google Drive, Chrome profiles, and the company's Korean-to-English translation tool to manage schedules and communicate in English.

A spreadsheet found on one device listed $1,489.80 in expenses for May, detailing the costs of their ongoing operations.

One Payoneer account linked to the group converted fiat into crypto, with activity traced to a wallet address — “0x78e1a” — that investigators say was tied to the June 2025 hack of fan-token marketplace Favrr. That attack drained about $680,000.

ZachXBT previously alleged that Favrr's chief technology officer, known as “Alex Hong,” and some other developers were in fact North Korean workers using false identities.

The group's online activity also revealed their research interests, from asking if ERC-20 tokens could run on Solana to searching for AI development companies in Europe.

North Korean-linked teams have been behind some of the largest crypto thefts on record, including a $1.4 billion exploit of the exchange Bitbit earlier this year. Over time, they've taken millions from protocols by posing as contractors and remote workers.

Their tactics aren't always complex, but they work in volume — sending out enough applications that some inevitably slip through. Once inside, they can quietly gather data, siphon funds, or lay the groundwork for future attacks.

ZachXBT says crypto and tech firms need to be more thorough in screening hires. “Many of these operations aren't highly sophisticated,” he said, “but the sheer number of applications means hiring teams sometimes overlook red flags.”

He added that a lack of cooperation between tech companies and freelance platforms makes it easier for such groups to stay active.

The US Treasury has already taken action, sanctioning two people and four companies linked to a similar North Korean IT worker network in July. The move reflects growing concern over how state-backed cyber teams are targeting private companies — often hiding in plain sight.

Fraud-Proof Access - Each ticket is recorded on-chain, eliminating counterfeits.

Tradable Event-Token - Attendees can collect, trade, or resell their Event-Tokens on approved marketplaces.

Data & Engagement - Event organizers gain powerful analytics and direct engagement channels before, during, and after events.

Revenue Expansion - Built-in royalties for organizers on secondary ticket sales.

Market Potential

The global event ticketing industry exceeds $85 billion annually according to Mordor Intelligence, with increasing demand for secure, flexible, and fan-first ticketing experiences. Nextech3D.ai's blockchain-powered SaaS platform is uniquely positioned to differentiate itself in this market.

Next Steps

MVP Launch: Targeting Q4 2025 with early pilot events.

Full Integration: Platform will seamlessly integrate with Nextech3D.ai's Map D event suite.

The platform will function as a stand alone blockchain ticketing platform with an API extending beyond Map D opening up new revenue streams.

Anas is a crypto native journalist and SEO writer with over five years of writing experience covering blockchain, crypto, DeFi, and emerging tech.

New York Assembly Member Phil Steck has introduced legislation imposing a 0.2% excise tax on all digital asset transactions, including crypto and NFT sales or transfers.

According to the bill filing, the proceeds will be earmarked for expanding substance abuse prevention programs in upstate schools.

Assembly Bill A08966, introduced August 13 and referred to the Ways and Means Committee, would take effect September 1, 2025, marking another state-level attempt to generate revenue from the growing crypto sector.

The bill defines digital assets broadly as any asset “issued, transferred, or both, using distributed ledger or blockchain technology,” encompassing digital currencies, coins, and non-fungible tokens. 

The legislation places responsibility for tax payment on “the person or persons making or effectuating the sale or transfer,” potentially creating compliance challenges for exchanges, traders, and DeFi protocols operating in New York.

The proposed tax comes as global jurisdictions pursue diverse approaches to crypto taxation, ranging from total bans in China to innovation-friendly frameworks in Switzerland and Singapore. 

The Trump administration reversed Biden-era crypto enforcement policies in 2025, repealing DeFi broker rules and positioning the US as more crypto-friendly, while the EU implemented comprehensive MiCA regulations requiring strict licensing for crypto asset service providers.

Thailand, for instance, has implemented a five-year personal income tax exemption on crypto capital gains through licensed platforms, effective January 2025 through December 2029. 

The Thai government anticipates over 1 billion baht in additional tax revenue through indirect economic activity despite the exemption.

While Thailand wants to exempt taxation, taxing countries are progressing gradually. 

Most recently, Indonesia's crypto tax revenue jumped 181% to $38 million in 2024, driven by transaction volumes reaching $39.67 billion as the country's crypto user base exceeded 20 million people. 

🇮🇩 Indonesia's crypto tax revenue jumped 181% in 2024 to ~$38M, but collections have fallen in 2025 due to market volatility. #cryptotax #Indonesia https://t.co/s20V54zazb

However, 2025 collections dropped to $6.97 million through July due to market volatility, highlighting the challenge of relying on crypto taxes for stable revenue.

The Indonesian government raised taxes on foreign exchanges from 0.2% to 1% while keeping domestic platform increases modest at 0.21%, attempting to shift activity toward regulated local platforms. 

Mining operations face doubled VAT from 1.1% to 2.2%, with special income tax rates ending in 2026.

Similarly, Japan's crypto investors face income tax rates up to 55% on profits, prompting the Japan Blockchain Association to survey 1,500 adults about potential reforms. 

The survey found 84% of current crypto holders would buy more if the government implemented a flat 20% capital gains tax, while 12% of non-holders said they would start investing under reformed tax rules.

Earlier this year, Ukraine also proposed an 18% personal income tax plus 5% military levy on virtual asset gains, with preferential rates of 5-9% for specific categories. 

The wartime military levy helps fund defense efforts while the country develops comprehensive crypto taxation frameworks following international examples.

While countries are working towards their taxation framework, China maintains a total ban on all cryptocurrency activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership, as of June 2025, extending earlier prohibitions to support the state-backed digital yuan. 

In fact, China goes as far as enforcing through active asset seizures and criminal penalties for violations, which remains the major country in the region with low crypto appetite.

Singapore, however, offers rigorous licensing through the Monetary Authority with finalized stablecoin regulatory frameworks, attracting blockchain innovation while implementing strict compliance requirements. 

Similarly, Hong Kong has positioned itself as an Asian crypto center with licensing for exchanges, custody services, and comprehensive stablecoin oversight.

Contrary to the Asian mixed stance, the European Union's MiCA regulation has unified regulation that requires comprehensive licensing for crypto asset service providers with strict anti-money laundering and consumer protection rules. 

The framework harmonizes regulation across member states while maintaining innovation-focused oversight approaches.

The New York proposal joins other state-level initiatives as federal crypto policy evolves under the Trump administration's pro-innovation stance. 

The success of the 0.2% excise tax will likely influence other US states considering similar revenue-generating measures targeting the expanding crypto market.

Coinbase believes crypto markets may be on the cusp of a full-scale altcoin season, with institutional demand for Ethereum playing a central role and a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in September setting the stage for retail inflows.

In its published Thursday, the exchange said the market has largely followed the path it predicted earlier this year, when it expected new highs in the second half of 2025. Stronger-than-anticipated macro conditions and clearer regulatory frameworks have helped fuel that momentum.

Bitcoin's market dominance has slipped from 65% in May to about 59% in August. Coinbase said the decline points to the early stages of capital rotation into altcoins. At the same time, altcoin market capitalization has jumped more than 50% since July to $1.4 trillion.

Altcoin Season is comingAs September approaches, the transition to a full-scale altcoin season is likely.Our positive 3Q25 outlook stems from macro trends such as potential Fed rate cuts and expected regulatory advancements.More key themes in this Monthly Outlook report ↓— Coinbase Institutional 🛡️ (@CoinbaseInsto) ETH Market Cap Jumps 50% Since July on Treasury Buys

The Altcoin Season Index, a metric that tracks whether alts are outperforming Bitcoin, remains in the low 40s, below the 75 threshold that signals a full rotation. Still, Coinbase noted that conditions are aligning for a broader rally as September approaches.

Ethereum has been the main beneficiary of this shift. Its market cap has grown 50% since early July, powered by demand from digital asset treasuries and a growing narrative around stablecoins and real-world assets.

Bitmine Immersion Technologies alone has acquired 1.2m ETH after raising $20b, with capacity to purchase $24.5b worth. The firm has overtaken Sharplink Gaming, the former leader among Ethereum-focused treasuries. Together, top institutional holders now control nearly 3 million ETH, about 2% of the supply.

Tokens linked closely to Ethereum, including Arbitrum, Ethena, Lido DAO and Optimism, have all moved in step with ETH. Of these, only Lido has rallied sharply, gaining 58% this month. 

Coinbase said Lido's rise reflected both its exposure to ETH and a US SEC staff statement earlier in August that liquid staking tokens are not securities under certain conditions.Alt Season Not Fully Here, But Conditions Are Building

While institutional flows dominate the ETH story, Coinbase said retail capital is also waiting to move. More than $7.2 trillion currently sits in US money market funds, the largest stockpile on record.

These balances represent what the firm called “missed opportunity costs” caused by high traditional valuations, trade uncertainties and lingering doubts about growth. It expects the upcoming Fed cuts to reduce the appeal of money market funds and redirect capital into crypto and other risk assets.

The firm's liquidity index, which tracks stablecoin issuance, trading volumes, orderbook depth and free float, has also begun to recover after six months of decline. Coinbase said this is an early sign that liquidity is returning to the crypto market.

“Our 3Q25 outlook remains constructive, though our view on an altcoin season has evolved,” the report said. “The recent decrease in Bitcoin dominance suggests an early rotation of capital into altcoins rather than a full-scale altcoin season at this stage. 

With the Fed expected to ease in September and the SEC signaling flexibility around some token models, Coinbase said the conditions for a deeper altcoin season are beginning to fall into place.

Mesh, the  crypto payments network, announced additional investments from PayPal Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, Uphold, Mirana Ventures (venture partner for ByBit), SBI Investment, Overlook Ventures, Kingsway Capital, Moderne Ventures and CE-Ventures, bringing total capital funding to more than $130 million.

This support positions the company to “accelerate its impact on the global payments industry.”

Mesh's technology supported the launch of PayPal's Pay with Crypto service, which allows consumers “to pay with a wide range of cryptocurrencies and eligible wallets.”

Mesh's technology enables consumers to “pay using 100+ wallets and cryptocurrencies through Mesh's SmartFunding orchestration engine.”

This allows PayPal merchants to tap into a “growing $3 trillion market with over 650 million crypto users.”

Most of the funds were settled “with the PayPal USD (PYUSD) stablecoin.”

Mesh's technology was used to “instantly transfer the investment.”

With integrations across Coinbase, Binance, ByBit, OKX, and more, Mesh's technology “reaches hundreds of millions of users.”

This new funding will accelerate its expansion “across the global payments industry, scaling APIs, expanding product development, and powering hundreds of crypto and payments platforms.”

All of this will hopefully position the company for “dominance in crypto payments as stablecoins drive the next wave of adoption.”

Mesh's SmartFunding technology reportedly “eliminates friction in crypto payments, enabling users to pay with any digital asset while merchants receive instant settlement in stablecoins, such as PYUSD, or fiat.”

This approach addresses the mismatch problem where “users often hold different cryptocurrencies than what merchants prefer, ensuring a seamless checkout experience with the benefits of blockchain technology.”

With the stablecoin market having a market cap over $200 billion and powering $27.6 trillion in transaction volume, consumers and merchants “want stable assets like stablecoins and local currency.”

Mesh is “unlocking liquidity, making these assets fungible with its SmartFunding orchestration engine.”

Founded in 2020, Mesh is building the “global crypto payments network, connecting exchanges, wallets, and financial services platforms to enable digital asset payments and conversions.”

By unifying these platforms into a single network, Mesh is enabling “an open, connected, and secure ecosystem for digital finance.”

PayPal Ventures is the global corporate venture arm of PayPal.

They invest for financial return in “six areas of high strategic relevance to PayPal, including fintech, payments, commerce enablement, artificial intelligence, blockchain & cryptocurrency, and regulatory/cyber technology.”

Through the expertise, experience, and network of PayPal Ventures – and the companies they invest in – they are “helping to bring transformative solutions to market faster.”

Wildfires, smog, pollen, pet dander, mold, and dust can all affect air quality. Here's how these appliances can help, plus info on what type is best for your home. 

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?



On average year-round, Americans spending roughly 90 percent of their time indoors, which causes the concentration of some pollutants to be 2 to 5 times higher than outdoor levels. As we head into colder weather, when windows and doors are closed more often and air stagnates, now is a good time to start thinking about your home's air quality. 

Your first line of defense should be an air purifier. These appliances cycle air through  filters to remove allergens, harmful particles, and even bacteria. Many of today's models use a range of technology to achieve cleaner air, from UV lights to carbon and activated charcoal. Regardless of the purification method, all have the same goal: to improve the quality of air year-round. 

In this guide, we'll dive into how air purifiers work, the different types of filters available, and how to find the right model based on in-depth research provided by expert sources and our own hands-on experience.  

Smog, pollen, pet dander, mold, cigarette smoke, and good old-fashioned dust all affect indoor quality, regardless of the season. In warmer months, allergens make their way into the house through open windows and your clothing, causing uncomfortable symptoms like itchy eyes or a scratchy throat. 

During the winter, when doors and windows are sealed to retain heat, allergens and pollutants become more concentrated. For people with asthma or emphysema, that poor indoor air quality can drastically affect their quality of life. Running an air purifier continuously provides consistent protection against certain sensitivities and allergens. 

The growing impact of climate change is making air purifiers an essential household appliance, too. Rising global temperatures are contributing to more frequent and widespread wildfires, which can affect the air quality even if you're far from the source. Plus, increased pollen count and ozone levels only exacerbate the problem. 

These environmental conditions can make indoor air hazardous, and since these occurrences are unpredictable, having an air purifier turned on year-round is a proactive way to safeguard your health.  

Portable air purifiers contain a fan that pulls in air from a room, and a filter that sifts through potentially harmful particles. That air is then circulated back into the room, and the process continues on a regular schedule. 

You likely already have a type of air purifier in your home through the heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. But, these furnace and HVAC filters usually only work when the system is operating, and in order to get more filtration, it would have to run for longer periods of time. A dedicated air purifier that you can move from room to room could supplement your current air purification setup, and won't require as much electricity. 

It's important to note that no air purifier removes every single toxin or pollutant in your home. In order to maximize the efficiency of your air purifier or HVAC system, you'll need to take a close look at the filters. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) developed a testing method to determine the Minimum Efficiency Reporting Values, or MERVs, of different air filters. These values are based on the filter's ability to capture larger particles between 0.3 and 10 microns. The higher the rating, the more efficient.

CADR is a common rating you might find for portable air purifiers, and it references the clean air delivery rate. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, this number reflects how well the appliance filters particles in a certain area. It's measured in cubic feet per minute (cfm), and should equate to roughly two-thirds of the square footage of the room. Again, the higher the CADR, the more efficient the appliance is. Keep these ratings in mind while you shop for an air purifier, and consult the product packaging for specifics. 

The best portable air purifiers all work on the same principle, but vary in type and capacity. 

High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters can collect 99.97 percent of particles in the air, including pollen, dust, bacteria, and mold. HEPA filters are also found inside your home's HVAC system, and are the most popular air purifier choice.

This filterless option works by producing ions that attach to pollutants and fall to the floor or on top of surfaces, which can then be cleaned up. Based on findings by the EPA, they remove small particles but they are not effective at getting rid of pollen and other allergens.

Using activated charcoal or carbon, these air purifiers trap unwanted odors, air pollutants, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They work especially well at removing smoke, odors, and gasses, and are usually used in conjunction with a HEPA filter.

This option uses UV light to neutralize viruses, bacteria, and mold spores found in the air. These types of air purifiers are best used in offices or homes where germ control is the focus, but they aren't very effective at trapping allergens, dust, or pollutants.  

To select the best air purifier for your home, we suggest considering the following:

Choose an air purifier that's the right size for your space. Coverage differs from unit to unit, so it's vital that your air purifier is powerful enough to clean the volume of air in the space. Make sure the CADR aligns with the square footage of the room the air purifier is in. 

Think about the type of filter you want.  If allergens are the main concern, find an air purifier with a HEPA filter. If you're tired of dealing with the smell of lingering cooking smoke, look for an absorbent air cleaner. Some air purifiers might use a combination of filters to target irritants ranging in particle size, which might be helpful if you're dealing with different types of allergens,

Consider the cost of replacement filters. Depending on the type of air purifier you have, replacement filters can cost anywhere from $25 to $50 or more. They also have to be changed on a semi-regular basis, which starts to add up when you're running the unit 24/7. Consider using an air purifier with washable or reusable filters to extend their lifespan.

Like many other household appliances, air purifiers can be noisy. Air purifiers are similar to air conditioners, dehumidifiers, and fans, particularly when you're talking about noise. Don't be fooled: Sometimes manufacturers list the noise level (dB) of the lowest setting and you need to read the fine print to figure out how loud the appliance is on high. Most air purifiers average 55dB on the highest setting, which is louder than a typical refrigerator and can be disruptive. Some models might offer a "sleep mode,"  which lowers the fan speed and noise level overnight. 

Find a model that's energy efficient to save cash. Look for a blue-and-white sticker on your appliance. Air purifiers with this emblem are Energy Star-certified and use significantly less electricity than their competitors, based on strict standards set by the EPA and DOE. 

Additional features can be useful. Some air purifiers come with other perks like air quality monitors, change filter indicator lights, and smart technology. These can make the air purification process more automated and easier to maintain.

They found their way into the filter drums of the pumping station.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Jellyfish are remarkable creatures. They're twice as old as dinosaurs; they don't have brains, lungs, or a heart; and they've nearly cracked the secret to immortality. But there's another accolade that they can affix to their already impressive biological resumé—they're the scourge of nuclear reactors. 

This fact was proven this past Sunday, when three of the six reactors at Gravelines power plant near Calais in northern France shut down unexpectedly because a swarm of jellyfish had entered the plant's cooling system, according to the government-owned utility operator Électricité de France, or EDF. By Monday morning, a fourth reactor also temporarily shut down. 

The jellyfish gathered near the filter drums of the pumping station that uses water from a nearby canal (which eventually feeds into the North Sea) to cool down the reactor. Although the shutdown was unexpected, the plant's safety measures ensured that the jellyfish “had no impact on the safety of the facilities, the safety of personnel, or the environment,” the EDF said. Sadly, the jellyfish themselves didn't fare as well. 

When it comes to nuclear energy, France punches way above its weight. In response to the 1973 Oil Crisis, the country decided to double down on nuclear energy, and France now has 57 reactors in operation. Gravelines alone provides nearly 6 percent of the nation's electricity—in fact, as of June of 2025, France has more generation capacity than China with around one-twentieth the population, and is second only to the U.S. in terms of net capacity. 

Reactors along the coastline (like Gravelines) often use seawater to cool themselves because it's particularly effective at removing waste heat. The EDF claims that filters prevent marine life from being sucked into these vents, but not from blocking the vents themselves. As The New York Times notes, jellyfish tend to “liquify” upon death, which can allow their bodies to bypass the filters and cause more problems downstream. The outlet also notes that in years past, similar jellyfish disruptions have impacted nuclear reactors around the world, including in Japan, Scotland, and Sweden. 

So, what's causing all of this recent jellyfish mayhem? Yep, it's climate change. Warmer ocean waters cause more favorable conditions for some jellyfish to spawn, and “dead zone” environments caused by the explosive growth of plankton (triggered by agricultural runoff) may impact some marine species, but not so much jellyfish. There, a lack of brain and blood becomes an evolutionary advantage. 

The world has turned to some out-of-the-box solutions to address the global jellyfish crisis, most notably trying to make these meddlesome jellies a sought-after delicacy. But the real answers lie in reducing carbon dioxide emissions and limiting agricultural runoff that create these warmer, low-oxygen waters in the first place. 

For more than 500 million years, jellyfish have served an important ecological function in the world's oceans. If we really want to point a finger at who's to blame, we should look in the mirror.

Sam Kean's New Book Dinner with King Tut Explores the Wild World of Experimental Archaeology

In his new book, Sam Kean reveals how re-creating ancient tools, techniques and traditions can unlock secrets about how our ancestors lived—and what they felt.

Rachel Feltman: For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

Experimental archaeology takes a hands-on approach to understanding the past. Instead of just studying ancient objects researchers re-create them. They build 30-foot medieval catapults, perform ancient surgeries with stone tools and prepare authentic Roman banquets using techniques so traditional, not even your nonna would recognize them. The goal is to understand not just what our ancestors made but how they made it—and what it felt like to live in their world.

Our guest today is Sam Kean, a science writer who's written seven books. His latest is called Dinner with King Tut, and it explores the world of experimental archaeology. He's tried his hand at everything from ancient brain surgery to mummifying a fish, and he's here to tell us all about it.

Thanks so much for coming on to chat today.

Sam Kean: Well, thanks for having me.

Feltman: So what exactly is experimental archaeology, and how did you get interested in it?

Kean: Experimental archaeology involves doing things—so making things, re-creating things from the past. And I got into it because I'd always had a bit of a gripe with archaeology, traditional dirt archaeology, in that I think it's a fascinating field; you learn so much about humankind and these big, meaty questions about us—you know, who we are, where we came from—these really important questions about deep human history. So I really like that aspect of traditional archaeology.

But every time I would go to an archaeological site, I found it so boring [laughs] to be there. It was just a bunch of sunburned people sitting around with brushes and dental picks, picking out little pot shards from the dirt. It just seemed like the most unimaginable tedium possible. And so there was always this disconnect in my mind between the big, important, cool things archaeology wrestled with and the day-to-day work of the field.

But experimental archaeology got me excited because again, they were doing things, they were making things: re-creating lost recipes, making ancient stone tools—everything from that up to, you know, people making giant catapults and boats and sending those off on the ocean. So it really got me excited 'cause you're much more active, and it's a very sensory-rich field, too. So I felt like it was a lot more immersive and it was more involved and kind of immersed in the past than you get from traditional archaeology.

Feltman: Hmm, and for people who aren't familiar with the idea of experimental archaeology, what are some of the projects from recent years that stand out in your mind as particularly exciting, that our listeners might wanna go learn more about?

Kean: Well, for the book I got to attend an authentic Roman banquet [laughs], which was pretty cool. I got to try my hand at ancient surgery and tattooing. There's a lot of food stuff out there; that's probably the best entrée for people wanting to get involved, is just try to make some ancient recipes—you know, some heirloom grains, things like that. I made a fish mummy at one point for the book, and that was surprisingly easy to do, so you can mummify a fish or, you know, another small animal, something like that.

So there's a lot of cool things to do, and it kind of runs the gamut, again, from everyday things like food and tools all the way up to catapults and boats and people—making human mummies, even stuff like that. So there's really a range of activities.

Feltman: Yeah, well, and I think even some folks who, you know, have maybe come across some of these projects, like people making perfume that smells like a mummy, might be surprised at how hands-on you were able to get in the book. Could you tell us some more about some of the things you were able to experience while you were researching?

Kean: Yeah, so, like, the catapult I got to see was pretty amazing. This guy made a 30-foot tall, medieval—authentic medieval catapult. And we spent a day out—he built this in Utah—we spent a day out there in the mountains, throwing these giant garden stones around at this wall that he had built that was 250 yards away, and it was pretty magical being out there and getting to see this thing fire—being able to fire it myself, actually. So that stands out as something. That, that was probably the most fun thing I did for the book, was [laughs] seeing that giant catapult.

Then there were some things, some days, that were really painful and awful. Like, the, the surgery that I mentioned that I did, it was a, a surgery called a trepanation, so you're removing a bit of the skull, essentially. And it's startling to think about, but this is one of the most ancient surgeries ...

Feltman: Mm.

Kean: That we know of. It's thousands and thousands of years old, and it involves, you know, kind of brain surgery, of all things. And we know that people survived it because we can see new bone growth around the rim of skulls that we found with holes in it, so we know that people survived this operation. And I tried it out not on a human, on a deer head, at a sort of a survivalist school, an experimental-archaeology school in Maine, and they made some stone tools for me, so I gotta try it, you know, pretty authentic. And the stone tools worked really well at first.

You can get a really, really sharp edge on a stone tool, and obsidian even—it's a type of volcanic rock—you can get a sharper edge on that than even modern surgical-steel scalpels ...

Feltman: Wow.

Kean: They form a really, really sharp edge. The problem with stone tools is that they wear down quickly ...

Feltman: Right.

Kean: And so after I made the first, initial cut—I was removing a triangular-shaped piece—after I, I made the initial cut, the one leg of the triangle, it went really well for the first cut, but after that the stone tool got worn down, and after that it was just a war of attrition ...

Feltman: Mm.

Kean: Of me sort of grinding my way through this skull. I was just sitting there—there were flies biting me; it was hot. I was really upset and getting frustrated. But that was a good learning experience in and of itself, just to show you what something basic like medicine was like back then.

And the emotions eventually became an important part of the process. Learning things like that, you know, you get frustrated, but it really stuck with me, and it made me appreciate just how difficult things were for our ancestors and made me appreciate the fact that they did all this work and we wouldn't be here if they hadn't.

Feltman: Yeah, did those hands-on experiences change your perspective of the past in any other ways, beyond just appreciating how difficult things were?

Kean: It made me appreciate how good some of the technology was.

Feltman: Mm.

Kean: I was surprised at how—yeah, that you can get stone tools that are very, very sharp, form a very nice edge. I think we have sort of a narrow view of technology nowadays. We think about electronic gizmos as technology; they're sort of synonymous, almost, in our minds. But they were really good about practical chemistry, everyday biology—you know, observing other creatures, observing plants, things like that. And I think we've lost some of that nowadays. So it did open my mind up and helped me appreciate the really nice technologies that people had in the past.

Feltman: And you mentioned in the book that experimental archaeology is sometimes dismissed as kind of, like, a showy form of theater more than a science. What would you argue is the scientific value of sort of actively re-creating the past?

Kean: There are some cases where we just don't have information about how people did things. So the best examples of that in the book are with Egyptian mummies and how they built the pyramids in Egypt. We just don't know how they did things, especially with the pyramids [laughs]; we have no idea how they did that, which is kind of embarrassing for archaeologists, that they don't know this, but we just don't have any information.

So by running these experiments you can learn things and you can rule some things out. So I think it's valuable 'cause it can actively teach us things about the past. And I think by doing certain things, even something basic like making bread or beer or something like that, you start to ask more questions and different questions, and it teaches you aspects of the process that you would not have thought to ask about otherwise.

And there were some cases in the book as well where—there was one instance with a chef and one instance with a, a hairdresser who got interested in Roman archaeology, and they read these papers by classicists, by historians, by archaeologists, and they, even within a few paragraphs, realized that [the authors] had no idea what they were talking about [laughs]: they didn't know how to cook properly; they didn't know how to style hair properly. And because [the chef and the hairdresser] had this outside expertise they could make a lot of progress. These people who didn't have the expertise were just theorizing without any real evidence or basis ...

Feltman: Mm.

Kean: For their conclusion. So it can help you avoid going down wrong paths, and in some cases it can answer questions or evoke questions that we just wouldn't ask otherwise.

Feltman: Yeah, very cool, and I mean, I'm sure this really runs the gamut, but in your experience who are the people who are creating these experiments? You know, how are they getting interested in these questions?

Kean: Yeah, it really does run the gamut. In some cases they are traditional professors or credentialed archaeologists who realize they couldn't answer the questions they wanted to if they didn't try some experiments out, so they just decided to try 'em out. And in some cases, I think, they wanted to connect with their area of study a little bit more. And again, it's such a sensory-rich field—you feel more immersed in the past when you do these kind of things—so it helped them have a deeper connection with their field.

Then there are amateurs, people who just got obsessed [laughs] with some topic—and amateurs in the best sense of the word, in that they just loved the topic and wanted to learn all they could about it. They're not getting paid to do it, but they have a deep knowledge of the field, and they just decided to try something new and different. So they are a part of the field as well.

And then another really important aspect is there's a lot of native and Indigenous communities who have either kept traditions alive or they're trying to revive traditions that got stamped out by colonialism, missionaries, whatever the case was. And in a lot of cases they're the ones going to the archaeologists and teaching them how things were based on either things they have kept alive or lore they might know.

So all of those groups are kind of working together, and I think that's part of the fun of the field, is that you can get insights from a lot of different people in a lot of different places. So it was fun to meet all of 'em.

Feltman: Did any of the experiments you participated in in the book change the way you do things in everyday life? Like, I don't know, for example, have you picked up some Roman culinary techniques [laughs] or anything of that nature?

Kean: One thing it did do: I sort of view the world itself a little differently in that ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Kean: Before I would walk down the street where I live in D.C., and there were a lot of trees in this neighborhood, but before to me it was just sort of this green canopy overhead; it was almost like decoration. And now I see it and I, I'm better about telling individual trees apart—you know, “This is this type of tree. This is this type of tree.” And I also look at the trees differently because I can see them as, you know, a resource: the wood that they have—the acorns that they have are a food source. So I look at things like that differently, and—even, like, rocks on the ground, I can look at those and say, “Oh, that'd be a good hammerstone for making tools,” or “That's a good type of rock to make a tool with.”

So I feel a little more connected in the sense that it's not just, again, decoration, it's more, you know, their resources, and I feel like I understand that aspect of nature better because of the experiences I had.

Feltman: And is there anything that you really wanted to try that you, you weren't able to?

Kean: I did get to do, in Micronesia, a little bit with navigation there. So I got to go out in a boat, and they taught me a few things about navigation. I would really love, at some point, to get way out into Polynesia, maybe, even and be on an authentic ship like they used thousands of years ago and just sort of set sail and, you know, head out for an island you can't see over the horizon and just navigate with all of the amazing tricks they knew about, you know, the stars but also looking at wave patterns, wind patterns, migration patterns of birds. So at some point I'd love to take a long ocean trip on one of those authentic ships.

Feltman: Very cool. Well, thank you so much for coming on to talk about the book. I'm sure our listeners will love it, so this has been great.

Kean: Well, thanks for having me.

'Float rocks,' sand ripples, and vast distances are among the sights to see in the latest high-resolution panorama by the six-wheeled scientist.

The imaging team of NASA's Perseverance Mars rover took advantage of clear skies on the Red Planet to capture one of the sharpest panoramas of its mission so far. Visible in the mosaic, which was stitched together from 96 images taken at a location the science team calls "Falbreen," are a rock that appears to lie on top of a sand ripple, a boundary line between two geologic units, and hills as distant as 40 miles (65 kilometers) away. The enhanced-color version shows the Martian sky to be remarkably clear and deceptively blue, while in the natural-color version, it's reddish.

"Our bold push for human space exploration will send astronauts back to the Moon," said Sean Duffy, acting NASA administrator. "Stunning vistas like that of Falbreen, captured by our Perseverance rover, are just a glimpse of what we'll soon witness with our own eyes. NASA's groundbreaking missions, starting with Artemis, will propel our unstoppable journey to take human space exploration to the Martian surface. NASA is continuing to get bolder and stronger."

The rover's Mastcam-Z instrument captured the images on May 26, 2025, the 1,516th Martian day, or sol, of Perseverance's mission, which began in February 2021 on the floor of Jezero Crater. Perseverance reached the top of the crater rim late last year.

"The relatively dust-free skies provide a clear view of the surrounding terrain," said Jim Bell, Mastcam-Z's principal investigator at Arizona State University in Tempe. "And in this particular mosaic, we have enhanced the color contrast, which accentuates the differences in the terrain and sky."

Buoyant Boulder

One detail that caught the science team's attention is a large rock that appears to sit atop a dark, crescent-shaped sand ripple to the right of the mosaic's center, about 14 feet (4.4 meters) from the rover. Geologists call this type of rock a "float rock" because it was more than likely formed someplace else and transported to its current location. Whether this one arrived by a landslide, water, or wind is unknown, but the science team suspects it got here before the sand ripple formed.

The bright white circle just left of center and near the bottom of the image is an abrasion patch. This is the 43rd rock Perseverance has abraded since it landed on Mars. Two inches (5 centimeters) wide, the shallow patch is made with the rover's drill and enables the science team to see what's beneath the weathered, dusty surface of a rock before deciding to drill a core sample that would be stored in one of the mission's titanium sample tubes.

The rover made this abrasion on May 22 and performed proximity science (a detailed analysis of Martian rocks and soil) with its arm-mounted instruments two days later. The science team wanted to learn about Falbreen because it's situated within what may be some of the oldest terrain Perseverance has ever explored -- perhaps even older than Jezero Crater.

Tracks from the rover's journey to the location can be seen toward the mosaic's right edge. About 300 feet (90 meters) away, they veer to the left, disappearing from sight at a previous geologic stop the science team calls "Kenmore."

A little more than halfway up the mosaic, sweeping from one edge to the other, is the transition from lighter-toned to darker-toned rocks. This is the boundary line, or contact, between two geologic units. The flat, lighter-colored rocks nearer to the rover are rich in the mineral olivine, while the darker rocks farther away are believed to be much older clay-bearing rocks.

The RNA medicine revolution has been spurred by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The effectiveness of an LNP is determined by its lipid components and their ratios; however, experimental optimization is laborious and does not explore the full design space. Computational approaches such as deep learning can be greatly beneficial, but the composite nature of LNPs limits the effectiveness of existing single molecule-based algorithms to LNPs. Addressing this, our approach integrates the multi-component and multimodal features of composite formulations such as LNPs to predict their performance in an end-to-end manner. Here we generate one of the largest LNP datasets (LANCE) by varying LNP formulations to train our deep learning model, COMET. This transformer-based neural network not only accurately predicts the efficacy of LNPs but is adaptable to non-canonical LNP formulations such as those with two ionizable lipids and polymeric materials. Furthermore, COMET can predict LNP performance in a cell line outside of LANCE and predict LNP stability during lyophilization using only small training datasets. Experimental validation showed that our approach can identify LNPs that exhibit strong protein expression in vitro and in vivo, promising accelerated development of nucleic acid therapies with extensive potential across therapeutic and manufacturing applications.

For clinical1, logistical2 and translational3 success, most drug substances are formulated into drug products with multiple ingredients. Our analysis shows that, on average, eight excipients are present in commercial products4. Given choices of ingredients and their ratios, formulation design presents a vast search space. While high-throughput approaches exist5,6,7,8, they become intractable with increasing formulation complexity.

Deep learning, a branch of machine learning suited for multifactorial data, can help address this challenge. Although widely used in drug discovery and materials science9,10,11, its application to multi-component drug products is limited. We apply deep learning to RNA-based lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), a promising class of drug products12,13,14, underscored by the success of SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccines15,16,17,18. LNPs comprise four lipid classes, each crucial for cytosolic RNA delivery12,14,19. Their function depends on lipid structures and ratios20,21,22, with composition requiring re-optimization per application1,23.

Given these challenges, early efforts applying machine learning to drug delivery have emerged, including recent work from our group24 and others25. As lipid chemical structure has a major impact on transfection, a line of modelling approaches focus primarily on individual molecules25,26. These approaches have been remarkably successful in identifying new lipids and chemical substructures, which would otherwise not be expected to produce high transfection efficacy26. Some models rely on manually selected features such as physicochemical properties26,27,28,29. These face limitations: restricted LNP scope, underuse of raw data, synthetic feasibility constraints and lack of formulation composition insights. To unlock deep learning's full utility for LNP design, a model must represent complete formulations and generalize across predictive scenarios.

We introduce the Composite Material Transformer (COMET), which encodes molecular structures, molar percentages and synthesis parameters in a transformer-based architecture. COMET is trained on the Lipid–RNA Nanoparticle Composition and Efficacy (LANCE) dataset of over 3,000 LNPs, including those with dual-ionizable lipids. COMET accurately predicted excluded samples and, via in silico screening of 50 million virtual LNPs, identified top candidates with high in vitro and in vivo expression. Unlike lipid-focused models, COMET showed versatility with polymeric materials, predicting efficacy from limited data. Using two smaller datasets (~10% of LANCE)—one in a gastrointestinal cell line, another post-lyophilization—we demonstrate COMET's robust adaptability. With its flexibility and broad utility, COMET promises to accelerate complex drug product development.

Composite materials such as LNPs comprise multiple components defined by the identity of constituent compounds, their relative ratios and formulation parameters such as nitrogen-to-phosphate (N/P) and mixing ratio (Fig. 1a). Previous studies often focused on a single component (for example, ionizable lipid)25; by contrast, we developed COMET to holistically represent LNPs and predict their efficacy via a flexible neural architecture (Fig. 1b). Lipid structures are encoded into molecular embeddings, while molar percentages are transformed into composition embeddings. These are concatenated to represent each lipid. Formulation-wide features, such as N/P and phase mixing ratios, are also embedded and fed into the model (Methods).

a, LNPs are synthesized by mixing nucleic acid (for example, mRNA) with a lipid solution typically composed of four lipid classes. Key properties, such as efficacy, depend not only on the lipids' structure but also on their relative ratios and other mixing parameters (for example, N/P and aqueous/organic ratio). b, COMET can predict properties of composite materials such as LNPs from their components, compositions and other parameters. c, With high-throughput screening, COMET's training data are made up of four parts, each spanning a complementary LNP formulation space. d, Thirteen lipid molar ratios used in the majority of the LNP training dataset.

COMET adopts a transformer design similar to language models such as ChatGPT30,31, where chemical components and formulation features act as discrete tokens. It accommodates arbitrary numbers of components, including dual-ionizable lipid formulations. An LNP-level Classify ([CLS]) token attends to component and formulation vectors via self-attention32, with the final prediction made through a task-specific prediction head. For multitask learning, distinct CLS tokens and heads are used per task to capture differences across cell types while sharing model knowledge.

To train COMET, we use a pairwise ranking objective that learns to rank LNPs by efficacy (Methods). Noise augmentation improves robustness against experimental noise, and a label margin captures efficacy differences. In multitask settings, CAGrad helps align gradients across tasks33. We further enhance performance with an ensemble of COMET models, especially beneficial in low-data regimes34,35.

To train COMET, we developed a high-throughput pipeline to generate the LANCE dataset. Each LNP in this dataset encapsulated a firefly luciferase (FLuc) messenger RNA (mRNA), and transfection efficacy was quantified by bioluminescence readouts. The LNPs were synthesized using automated fluid handling and tested in vitro. The LANCE dataset spans a wide design space structured in four parts: lipid identities (parts 1 and 2), synthesis parameters such as N/P and aqueous/organic mixing ratio (part 3), and lipid molar percentages (part 4) (Fig. 1c). Thirteen distinct molar ratios were used (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 13), generating over 6,000 labelled data points, including 3,028 LNPs evaluated in mouse DC2.4 and B16-F10 cells. Bioluminescence values were log-transformed and normalized between 0 and 1. Full methodological details are in Methods.

In DC2.4 cells, LNPs with CKK-E12 or C12-200 as ionizable lipids outperformed those with DLin-MC3-DMA (Fig. 2a). Helper lipids (for example, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE)), sterols (cholesterol/beta-sitosterol) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) lipids (C14-PEG) also had substantial effects on efficacy. Hence, the LANCE dataset successfully captured these previous observations12,20,36,37. Molar ratios had notable but formulation-specific effects on efficacy; no single ratio consistently outperformed across all lipid combinations. This highlights the need for context-specific optimization. Altering aqueous/organic phase ratios from 3:1 to 1:1 affected efficacy in helper-lipid-rich LNPs (Fig. 2b), although the effect diminished at lower helper lipid content (Fig. 2c) and was negligible for 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC)-based formulations. The N/P ratio, by contrast, showed no clear efficacy association (Fig. 2d). We further evaluated five-component formulations by adding a second ionizable lipid (3:2 ratio) alongside DOPE, cholesterol and C14-PEG. Potent ionizable lipids such as CKK-E12 and C12-200 enhanced weak lipids such as L319 or DLin-MC3-DMA (Fig. 2e). Notably, CKK-E12/L319 combinations outperformed both CKK-E12-only and dual-strong-lipid pairings, particularly at 25% total ionizable lipid content.

Cross-cell line comparison of DC2.4 and B16-F10 results revealed 772 formulations that were in the top 30th percentile in both (Fig. 2f), commonly containing C12-200, DOPE, cholesterol and C14-PEG. Formulations with selective activity were also identified: SM102 appeared frequently in DC2.4-high but B16-F10-low cases, while DC-cholesterol was enriched in the opposite group. In summary, transfection efficacy is governed not only by lipid identities but also by molar ratios and synthesis conditions—motivating the need for models such as COMET that can integrate and learn from multifactorial design spaces.

We evaluated COMET on a random 20% test split of LNPs, with 10% used for validation and the remaining 70% for training. When trained to predict DC2.4 efficacy, COMET accurately ranked the test samples, achieving a Spearman coefficient of 0.873 and a Pearson coefficient of 0.866 (Fig. 3a). To simulate a more realistic drug discovery scenario, we curated a ‘hits-test' split where the top 10% of DC2.4 LNPs were withheld as ‘hits', alongside a random 10% of ‘non-hits'. COMET retained strong predictive power, yielding a Spearman coefficient of 0.725 and a Pearson coefficient of 0.820 (Fig. 3a). Its ability to classify ‘hits' into the top half of ranked predictions reached 79.6% accuracy.

Twenty replicates of training run with different random seeds were used for evaluation in a–c. Four technical replicates were used for e–l. Error bars are s.e.m. Statistical significances in e–l were determined using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Tukey test.

In a multitask learning set-up using both DC2.4 and B16-F10 labels, COMET's performance improved on the DC2.4 test set, achieving a Spearman of 0.762 and a Pearson of 0.860 (pairwise ranking objective + multitask) model; Supplementary Fig. 1). These improvements scaled with the size of the additional B16-F10 data (Supplementary Fig. 2), highlighting the benefit of shared representation learning across related tasks38. We performed ablation studies to understand the contribution of each modelling component. Replacing the pairwise ranking objective with a regression objective slightly reduced performance (Fig. 3b,c). Model enhancements—ensemble learning, noise augmentation, label margin and CAGrad regularization—each contributed to performance gains, with ensembling having the greatest effect (Fig. 3b,c). Gains from ensembling plateaued beyond five models (Supplementary Fig. 3), and so we used an ensemble of five COMETs for all in silico screening.

To probe whether COMET learns meaningful structure–activity relationships, we performed adversarial perturbations. When lipid identities in training samples were partially shuffled, model performance degraded monotonically (Supplementary Fig. 4). More aggressive shuffling across lipid classes led to a further drop, and corrupting additional formulation parameters (for example, N/P ratio, molar % and phase ratios) impaired performance even more (Supplementary Fig. 5). COMET's generalizability was tested by excluding LNPs containing selected ionizable lipids (MC3, SM-102 and CKK-E12) and a sterol (beta-sitosterol) from training. The model maintained good performance on this chemically distinct test set, with Pearson/Spearman correlations of 0.779/0.776 for DC2.4 and 0.502/0.509 for B16-F10 efficacy prediction (Supplementary Fig. 6a,b).

Lastly, we compared COMET against simpler baselines. Both random forest and COMET outperformed k-nearest neighbours, with COMET's single-model performance comparable to random forest (Supplementary Fig. 7). An ensemble of COMETs offered improved correlation metrics for both cell lines, although top 50% classification accuracy remained similar to that of random forest.

To determine whether COMET learns transfection efficacy rather than proxying classic LNP properties, we analysed correlations between COMET predictions and nanoparticle characteristics such as encapsulation efficiency, size, polydispersity and zeta potential. COMET's predictions were only weakly correlated with these properties—except for particle size (correlation 0.6530)—but were highly correlated with actual transfection data (>0.95; Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9). This confirms that COMET predicts efficacy itself, not just physical proxies.

To evaluate COMET's ability to discover effective formulations beyond LANCE, we screened a virtual library of nearly 50 million LNPs and validated selected in silico ‘hits' experimentally (Fig. 3). Exploratory hits were chosen by excluding LNPs similar to top-performing LANCE formulations and then selecting chemically diverse candidates predicted by COMET to be highly efficacious (Methods, Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 10).

All exploratory hits outperformed clinically approved LNPs39 (SM-102 (ref. 15), ALC-0315 (ref. 16) and DLin-MC3-DMA40) in both DC2.4 and B16-F10 cells (Fig. 3e,f). The top DC2.4 exploratory hit matched two of three top LANCE hits (Supplementary Fig. 11), while the best B16-F10 exploratory hit exceeded all three LANCE hits tested (Supplementary Fig. 12).

We next evaluated COMET's ability to refine existing leads. Around selected LANCE hits, virtual candidates were generated by modifying lipid ratios, substituting components or changing N/P ratios (Methods and Fig. 3d). In DC2.4, COMET identified optimized formulations outperforming their parent in two of three cases (Fig. 3g–i); in B16-F10, all three optimized LNPs outperformed their respective parents (Fig. 3j–l).

To assess COMET's adaptability beyond lipids, we extended it to branched poly(beta-amino esters) (PBAEs)3,41 (Fig. 4a), a class of polymers. A dataset of 454 polymer–LNPs (13 unique PBAEs) was added to LANCE. Each PBAE was represented by its diacrylate–amine unit and branching agent (Methods and Fig. 4b). In the ‘hits-test' setting, COMET achieved Spearman coefficients of 0.767 (DC2.4) and 0.756 (B16-F10) (Fig. 4c,d). Notably, PBAE LNPs represented only 13% of the training data.

Statistical significances in f–i were determined using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey test. Statistical significances in j, k, n and o were determined using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett test. Statistics in l and m were determined using unpaired two-tailed t-test. Panels a and b created with BioRender.com.

Even when trained on just 17 PBAE LNPs plus LANCE data, COMET achieved a mean Spearman of 0.660 across both cell types, improving to 0.824 with the full 352-sample PBAE set (Fig. 4e). We selected top-performing PBAE LNPs for further optimization using COMET (Methods). Optimized candidates showed higher efficacy than their parent formulations in both DC2.4 cases (Fig. 4f,g) and in one B16-F10 case (Fig. 4h,i).

To evaluate its capability to adapt to a new cell type, COMET was tested on a dataset of 295 LNPs screened in human Caco-2 cells. Activity poorly correlated with mouse cells (Supplementary Fig. 15), indicating a need for learning-based formulation strategies to quickly identify new formulations that are optimal for new settings. COMET trained on Caco-2 data achieved a Spearman coefficient of 0.639, which improved to 0.713 with LANCE multitask training, and to 0.794 (Pearson 0.806) using a five-model ensemble (Fig. 4j,k).

We further tested COMET on HepG2 cells transfected with interleukin (IL)-15 mRNA using 98 LNPs. With multitask ensemble training, we observed strong predictions (Pearson 0.709 and Spearman 0.775; Fig. 4l,m). Additional LANCE data did not improve single-model accuracy (Supplementary Fig. 16) but enhanced ensemble performance (Fig. 4l,m), likely owing to increased diversity among the COMET models when trained with additional LANCE data.

To address the instability of LNPs at ambient temperatures, we trained COMET to predict efficacy loss post-lyophilization (Methods). We synthesized 168 LNPs with variable lipids and 20% (w/v) sucrose as the stabilizer. Post-lyophilization data (Supplementary Fig. 17a) revealed that top performers included CKK-E12 and C12-200 as ionizable lipids, and DOPE as the helper lipid. Interestingly, these were not always top performers pre-lyophilization. DC-cholesterol-containing LNPs ranked higher post-lyophilization. Using 148 samples for training/validation and 20 for testing, COMET achieved a Spearman of 0.492. With LANCE multitask data, this increased to 0.705, and to 0.788 with five-model ensembles (Fig. 4n,o).

We selected one hit from each virtual LNP group (‘Experimental validation of COMET in silico hits' section) for in vivo validation in mice. Compared with DLin-MC3-DMA and SM-102 clinical benchmarks, COMET hits yielded >40-fold and >5-fold higher bioluminescence, respectively (Fig. 5a,b), with faster transfection kinetics (Fig. 5c). Top-performing COMET hits (DE-4, DO-388-1 and BE-1) also had higher encapsulation efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 19a) and lower cytotoxicity than SM-102 (Supplementary Fig. 20).

Four biological replicates were used for MC3 formulation, while seven to eight biological replicates were used to evaluate the other formulations in b. Error bars are s.e.m. Statistical significances in b were determined using a one-way ANOVA with post-hoc Dunnett test.

In 1:1 in vivo comparisons with LANCE top hits, COMET-optimized LNPs matched DC2.4 benchmarks (Supplementary Fig. 18a,b), but underperformed slightly in B16-F10 (not significant), possibly owing to poor correlation between in vitro B16-F10 data and subcutaneous in vivo response (Supplementary Fig. 18c,d).

We used t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) to visualize how COMET encodes LNP compositional features to predict efficacy. As shown in Fig. 6a,b (for virtual LNPs) and Supplementary Fig. 22 (for LANCE LNPs), high-efficacy LNPs form distinct regional clusters within COMET. Notably, a green cluster contains LNPs efficacious in both DC2.4 and B16-F10, while yellow and blue clusters are specific to DC2.4 and B16-F10, respectively (Fig. 6a). Although ionizable lipid choices vary within each group, the DC2.4-specific cluster has a higher prevalence of SM-102 (Fig. 6c), and the B16-F10-specific cluster contains more LNPs with DC-cholesterol (Fig. 6d). The green cluster is enriched in high N/P ratio (25–30) formulations (Fig. 6e). Some of these patterns were observed in the LANCE data (Fig. 2), but others emerged only through COMET's predictions.

In general, DOPE and C14-PEG are dominant among highly scored LNPs, suggesting that they are more optimal than DSPC and C18-PEG. Beta-sitosterol is overrepresented in high-scoring LNPs (Fig. 6d), supporting previous findings36,42,43,44. Two composition trends stood out: ionizable lipid % above 50% (Fig. 6f) and sterol % below 10% (Fig. 6g) were both detrimental to efficacy. Additional LNP feature visualizations are shown in Supplementary Fig. 21.

Using integrated gradients45, we identified features most influential to COMET's predictions (Methods). For DC2.4, lipid identity was the most important factor, followed by N/P ratio and molar percentages (Fig. 6h). Among lipid classes, PEG lipid choice had the highest influence (Fig. 6i), indicating that switching from C18-PEG to C14-PEG improves efficacy predictions. Ionizable lipid choice was the next most critical, consistent with previous work12,46,47,48. For molar composition, ionizable and helper lipid percentages were most impactful (Fig. 6j). Similar trends held for B16-F10 (Fig. 6k–m), except that helper lipid choice ranked slightly higher than ionizable lipid choice.

We also analysed interactions between PBAE (Supplementary Section A.1) and synergistic ionizable lipid combinations (Supplementary Section A.2) with other formulation features. These interactions revealed that optimal material choices and molar percentages depend not only on the target cell type but also on the broader compositional context of the formulation.

The design of COMET is motivated by the importance of not only the molecular structure of individual ingredients (for example, lipids) in drug products but also the interactions among compounds and their relative ratios. Its transformer-based architecture integrates multimodal features—including molecular structures, molar percentages and synthesis parameters—into a unified artificial intelligence framework. This enables COMET to learn LNP formulation features in a data-driven manner, without relying on manually selected physicochemical descriptors27,28. COMET accurately predicts LNP efficacy after training on LANCE, one of the largest LNP datasets so far49,50,51,52, and can distinguish top formulations from less efficacious ones.

While COMET consistently outperforms k-nearest neighbours, its advantage over random forest depends on dataset size and complexity. As larger, more diverse datasets emerge—especially with broader lipid chemistries—COMET's deep learning architecture will likely offer increasing benefits. High-throughput methods are poised to accelerate this growth.

COMET's flexible input format enables exploration of non-canonical formulations, such as dual-ionizable lipid LNPs or polymer–lipid hybrids (for example, branched PBAEs). It can screen massive virtual libraries to find formulations that differ substantially from known hits yet yield high performance—such as the L319-based BE-1 LNP. As LNP designs grow in complexity, COMET makes discovery more tractable.

In lead optimization, COMET identified stronger formulations in two out of three cases. In the one failure (LA-580), the parent formulation already had very high efficacy (Fig. 3h). This highlights that while COMET distinguishes top from mediocre LNPs well (‘Performance of COMET' section), optimizing within a high-performing region requires even greater discriminative power. Adding more data from high-performing LNPs—especially through active learning—could improve this. COMET-predicted hits were validated across in vitro and in vivo settings. Since COMET is trained on in vitro data, and in vitro–in vivo correlation is known to be weak for LNPs22,49, not all predicted hits will succeed in vivo. Future integration with in vivo screening data5,8 may improve performance.

Beyond efficacy, COMET also predicts formulation stability post-lyophilization, despite limited data. This accuracy improves with multitask training using LANCE. Similar gains were observed in adapting COMET to new cell types (for example, Caco-2), underscoring the broad applicability of our approach. This is especially useful in contexts where assays are low throughput and datasets are small. The flexibility of COMET to handle multi-component inputs also allows for its extension beyond conventional LNPs. We demonstrated the model's adaptability to formulations with non-lipid materials (for example, branched PBAEs) and its utility across multiple cell types. COMET's architecture may also support links to other areas of nanotechnology where multi-component formulations are critical, such as co-delivery of multiple cargos, immunomodulatory nanoparticle design or materials for tissue engineering. In such contexts, COMET's compositional encoding and multitask learning structure could be adapted to jointly predict multiple endpoints, including efficacy, toxicity or stability.

Coupled with advances in high-throughput science, we hope that COMET will become an essential tool for formulation development and discovery of knowledge in this field.

This section describes the model architecture and training algorithms of COMET. Pseudocode for inference is provided in Algorithm S1.

Lipid molecular structures are encoded into high-dimensional vectors (molecular embeddings), while scalar compositional features are encoded using a Gaussian-based encoder53. Continuous formulation-wide parameters (for example, N/P ratio and volumetric mix ratio) are encoded with Gaussian layers; categorical inputs use one-hot embeddings.

The transformer uses a [CLS] token to aggregate input features across multiple attention layers. For multitask learning, each cell type is assigned a separate [CLS] token and prediction head, enabling task-specific outputs while sharing LNP-level representation learning.

COMET is compatible with various molecular encoders; here we use Uni-Mol11, pretrained to recover masked atom types and corrupted three-dimensional coordinates. It offers strong property prediction performance and is used with default hyperparameters (from https://github.com/dptech-corp/Uni-Mol/tree/main/unimol). Pretrained weights are frozen during COMET training. Each compound is encoded into a 512-dimensional vector using atom types and coordinates.

Lipid molar percentages are encoded into 128-dimensional vectors using a shared Gaussian layer. Each component is further assigned a 128-dimensional one-hot embedding (\({z}_{k}^{{\rm{type}}}\)) to distinguish lipid classes. These are concatenated and projected through a two-layer MLP into a 256-dimensional component representation.

N/P ratio is encoded using a separate 256-dimensional Gaussian layer (zN/P). Aqueous/organic ratios, treated as categorical variables, are one-hot encoded (zphase) with 256 dimensions.

Each cell type uses a learned [CLS] token (zCLS) of dimension 256. These aggregate component and formulation-wide token representations across Nblock transformer layers via attention54. Final predictions are made by passing the [CLS] token through a two-layer MLP (MLPpredict).

Each block follows a Pre-LayerNorm structure55 composed of layernorm → self-attention → MLP with residual connections.

The model is trained with a binary ranking objective56 where, given a pair of LNP samples, the model learns to predict a larger efficacy score for the LNP that has a higher efficacy label value from the other LNP:

where xh and xl are high- and low-efficacy LNPs and fθ is COMET's scoring function. Training uses a batch size of 64 (2,016 pairwise comparisons per batch).

Conflict-averse gradient descent (CAGrad)33 mitigates conflicting gradients in multitask settings. We apply CAGrad with a coefficient of 0.2 to stabilize training across tasks.

To address noise in the experimental data, especially in the fluid handling process, we augment the molar percentage with Gaussian noise proportionate to its value where the standard deviation of the noise is 10% of actual molar percentage.

From the label values, we can tell not only which LNP is better than another but also by how much. To train the model to learn this additional knowledge, we include a margin term57 in the binary ranking objective:

where yh and yl are the (efficacy) label values of the more efficacious and less efficacious LNP, respectively, and λmargin controls how much this objective dominates the training. We use λmargin = 0.01 in our experiments.

For in silico evaluation (Fig. 3e–l), the ensemble is formed by Nmodel models trained with the same hyperparameters and dataset (train/valid/test split) but weights initialized with different random seeds. For the ensemble deployed to infer virtual LNPs, 5 different train (80%)/valid (20%) splits are made in a fivefold manner and each model in the ensemble is trained on a different fold. To ensure that ensembled scores are not biased towards models with high variance, the predicted scores from each model are normalized by making their scores for the LANCE LNPs fit a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1 before ensembling. More specifically, for each model, this is done by inferring the predicted scores on all the LANCE LNPs and using the mean (meani) and standard deviation (stdi) of LANCE LNPs' scores to compute the normalized scores \({y}_{i}^{{\prime} \mathrm{normalized}}\) through

The final ensemble score is the mean of all models' normalized scores:

COMET is implemented in PyTorch and trained with NVIDIA V100 GPUs.

The k-nearest neighbours and random forest models are implemented with the scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/) package, with default hyperparameters. More specifically, the k-nearest neighbours model uses n = 5 nearest neighbours while the random forest model uses n = 100 estimators (trees).

LANCE comprises four parts spanning orthogonal LNP design dimensions: lipid component identities, molar percentages, synthesis parameters (for example, N/P and aqueous/organic volumetric ratios) and high-resolution molar sweeps.

Seven ionizable lipids, three sterols, two helper lipids and two PEG lipids were used (Supplementary Table 14), reflecting the focus of current research12,42. To study molar % effects, we designed 13 lipid ratios by varying one lipid class at a time from a reference BASE ratio (Fig. 1d), based on ref. 20. For instance, ratios I1–I4 modify ionizable lipid %, C1–C3 adjust cholesterol (compensated by helper lipid), and P1–P3 alter PEG lipid %, while the remaining modify multiple components (Supplementary Table 13).

To examine lipid identity effects, we generated 84 combinations from all permutations of 7 ionizable lipids, 3 sterols, 2 helper lipids and 2 PEG lipids. Paired with 13 molar ratios, this results in 1,092 possible LNPs; 1,066 were tested. After removing 91 overlapping with part 2, this part yielded 975 unique LNPs.

Following studies suggesting synergy from dual-ionizable lipid formulations58, we created LNPs with 60:40 molar splits across all ionizable lipid pairs, distributed across 13 lipid ratios. This yielded 637 additional LNPs.

To explore synthesis effects, we introduced variation in ionizable lipid/RNA weight ratios (10:1, 15:1 and 20:1) and aqueous/organic phase ratios (1:1 and 3:1). Weight ratios were adjusted by molar mass to maintain equivalent molar %. These parameters were later converted to N/P ratios for model input. This part includes 924 LNPs.

To study finer-grained molar % effects, we created 24 evenly spaced intervals from 10% to 80% for ionizable lipid, cholesterol and helper lipid, generating 492 LNPs across 3 focused sweeps.

Single-ionizable LNPs span 18 unique N/P ratios, derived from 3 ionizable lipid/RNA weight ratios and 7 ionizable lipids. Dual-ionizable formulations add 63 more, totalling 81 N/P ratios. In molar terms, 13 base lipid ratios and 72 sweep ratios (24 per lipid class) result in 85 total molar compositions.

LNPs were synthesized by mixing lipid–ethanol and mRNA–citrate buffer phases, incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Automated handling was performed on the Tecan Fluent platform. For animal studies, LNPs were mixed, incubated on ice for 10 min and dialysed overnight at 4 °C in PBS (Slide-A-Lyzer, ThermoFisher).

FLuc mRNA (L-7202, Trilink); lipids (Cayman Chemicals, Avanti); luciferase assay (Steady-Glo, E2550) and Agilent BioTek plate reader for readout. alamarBlue was used for viability assays.

Each 96-well plate included a ‘standard' LNP. Raw luminescence values were normalized to the standard and averaged across four replicates (two biological, two technical). Mean values were log-transformed and min–max normalized to [0, 1].

We have represented several key features of the LANCE dataset in Fig. 2. Below, we explain how these key features were extracted from LANCE. For Fig. 2a, part 1 formulations were selected. For the four ionizable lipids (ALC-0315, DLin-MC3-DMA, C12-200 and CKK-E12), we had 156 formulations containing 2 helper lipids, 3 sterol lipids and 2 PEG lipids (that is, 2 × 2 × 3 = 12 combinations) at 13 molar ratios (12 × 13 = 156 formulations).

For Fig. 2b,c, part 3 formulations containing one ionizable lipid, cholesterol and C14-PEG were selected. Two molar ratios of the lipid components (which are shown in the figure) were studied. The ionizable lipid to mRNA molar ratio was 10,162. The aqueous to organic volume ratio was varied. For Fig. 2d, part 3 formulations containing one ionizable lipid, DOPE, cholesterol and C14-PEG were selected. Two molar ratios of the lipid components (which are shown in the figure) were studied. The organic to aqueous volume ratio was held at 1:3.

Figure 2e was generated from part 2 data. Only formulations containing DOPE, cholesterol and C14-PEG were used for the graph. The name of the first ionizable lipid was listed as the title of graph and the second ionizable lipid name was the row name. The total molar content of the ionizable lipids was the column name. The molar ratio of ionizable lipid 1/ionizable lipid 2 is 1.5. The molar ratio of DOPE/cholesterol was 0.34. The molar % of C14-PEG was 2.5%. The molar ratio of ionizable lipid/mRNA was 10,162. The entire library was used to construct Fig. 2f. We calculated the normalized transfection efficacy for the 30th and 70th percentile formulations in B16-F10 and DC2.4 cells. These values were as follows: 70th percentile, B16-F10 = 0.43887; 30th percentile, B16-F10 = 0.24315; 70th percentile DC2.4 = 0.64623; 30th percentile DC2.4 = 0.30946. Formulations above and below these values in the respective cell lines were selected and are plotted in Fig. 2f.

The LNPs are named according to the groups to which they belong. A summary of the prefixes used here is given in Supplementary Table 16.

The recipes for the 3 clinical LNP baselines are based on the literature39 and synthesized in an aqueous/organic volumetric of 3:1 following what is typically used in previous work.

To find strong and reliable LNP baselines from LANCE, we randomly select 10 LNP formulations from the 90th percentile for each cell line to again screen them with the respective cell line to check for reproducibility. Among these ten formulations, three LNPs with their normalized efficacy value closest to their original LANCE efficacy label values were selected as LANCE baseline LNPs.

To span a vast formulation space, the virtual library was generated by enumerating through possible LNP features such as lipid choices, their molar percentages and key synthesis parameters such as N/P ratios and aqueous/organic volumetric ratios, according to Supplementary Table 15. To find LNPs that are different from the hits in the LANCE dataset, formulations within a 10% L1 distance lipid molar percentage neighbourhood of any top 10% most efficacious LANCE hits were excluded. After this step, the exploratory library has 27,354,600 and 34,539,960 formulations for DC2.4 and B16-F10, respectively. An ensemble of five COMET models predicted efficacy in both cell lines. The top 0.1% highest-scoring LNPs were selected (34,529 B16-F10 and 27,354 DC2.4).

The next step removes formulations based on uncertainty in COMET prediction. We capture the level of uncertainty by first computing the standard deviation (σ) between the models' prediction (\({y}_{i}^{{\prime} \mathrm{normalized}}\) in equation (3)) within the ensemble. We then scale the standard deviation by division with a non-negative predicted efficacy term to get a relative uncertainty value (urel):

where \({y}^{{\prime} \mathrm{ensemble,min,LANCE}}\) is the minimum ensemble score among the LANCE LNPs. Any formulations with negative \({\hat{y}}^{\mathrm{ensemble}}\) term were dropped. Supplementary Fig. 13 shows the distribution of this relative uncertainty value. Formulations with largest 50% relative uncertainty values were removed, leaving 17,269 B16-F10 and 13,677 DC2.4 formulations.

To promote chemical diversity, K-means clustering (on 14-dimensional vectors encoding lipid molar percentages) grouped these candidates into 10 clusters. Clustering was repeated 1,000 times to stabilize assignments. The highest-scoring formulation in each cluster was selected, resulting in ten diverse in silico hits per cell line (Supplementary Tables 17 and 18).

For each cell type, three top LANCE hits (from ‘Top LANCE LNP hits baselines' section) were used as starting points. Around each, virtual candidates were generated by (1) exploring within a 20% L1 molar percentage distance, (2) substituting at least one lipid (6 ionizable lipids, 2 cholesterols, 1 helper and 1 PEG) and (3) altering the N/P ratio.

To generate three diverse candidates per lead, we segmented the neighbourhood into three zones: (1) molar % segment (within 20% L1, no lipid changes), (2) substitute-lipid segment (within 20% L1, but with at least one different lipid) and (3) N/P ratio segment (differing N/P ratio). From each zone, the top predicted LNP was selected (Fig. 3d, right). This yielded three optimized LNPs per lead. The virtual library size ranged from 1.5 million (single-ionizable lipid) to 9 million (dual-ionizable lipid) candidates. The sixfold increase in dual-ionizable lipid cases arises from combinatorial enumeration: each minor ionizable lipid was paired with six major ones. By contrast, single-ionizable lipid compositions require no pairing. The final selected formulations for validation are listed in Supplementary Tables 19 and 20.

The compositions and molar ratios of amines, diacrylates and branching agents are listed in Supplementary Table 21. To synthesize PBAE polymers, the combination of the amines, diacrylates and branching agents were used. In brief, in a 20 ml glass vial, the entire weight of diacrylate and branching agent was added. Then, the solvent (dimethylformamide) was added to the reaction mixture. Later, the reaction vials were placed on a hotplate at 90 °C. After 24 h, the vials were removed from the hotplate and cooled to room temperature. The amines were added to the reaction vial and placed back on the hotplate at 90 °C and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 48 h. Finally, the vials were removed from the hotplate and allowed to cool to room temperature. Then, the reaction mixture was added (drop-by-drop) into a beaker containing ~150 ml ice-cold diethyl ether (~10× excess volume). The collected samples were transferred to 50 ml tubes and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min to pellet the polymer. Later, the supernatant was removed and dissolved in the minimal possible volume of dimethylformamide. This purification step was repeated three times. Final polymers were dried under vacuum and solubility tested in ethanol.

PBAEs were represented as a combination of their diacrylate–amine repeating unit and branching agent, each with unique component-type embeddings. The repeating unit was treated as a fifth molar component type alongside lipids, with its molar concentration estimated from polymer weight and molecular weight. Total molar percentages of PBAE and lipids sum to 100%. Inference proceeds as in lipid-only LNPs (‘COMET details' section).

Two top-performing PBAE LNPs per cell type were used as starting points. Around each, virtual candidates were generated by (1) exploring within a 20% L1 molar percentage neighbourhood, (2) substituting lipids (6 ionizable lipids, 2 sterols, 1 helper and 1 PEG) and (3) converting to dual-ionizable compositions. To select three diverse candidates, we defined three non-overlapping segments: one within the 20% L1 distance but must have the same lipid choices, one with at least one different lipid compound and one with a dual-ionizable lipid configuration. The top predicted LNP from each segment was chosen (Fig. 3d, right). Final hits are detailed in Supplementary Tables 22 and 23.

The IL-15 mRNA is synthesized via in vitro transcription with a HiScribe T7 mRNA kit with CleanCap Reagent AG (E2080S) from New England Biolabs, with 5-methoxy-UTP (N-1093) from Trilink. The LNP transfection is done at an mRNA concentration of 0.25 µg ml−1 in the 96-well plate format. The Human IL-15 expression level is measured with Human IL-15 Uncoated ELISA (88-7620) procured from Invitrogen, after 16 h of incubation of HepG2 cells with LNP. Raw efficacy data are normalized, similar to bioluminescence data mentioned above, before used as dataset for machine learning experiments. This dataset (20%) is randomly split into test set, while the rest is used as the train and validation sets.

The LNPs are synthesized in a tris buffer (5 mM tris buffer, pH 8). After synthesis, the LNP formulations are frozen at −80 °C for 2 h before undergoing the following lyophilization process: equilibrate at −40 °C for 2 h, in atmosphere → −40 °C for 21 h, in vacuum → 25 °C for 2 h, in vacuum. Labconco FreeZone 6 l with a Stoppering Tray Dryer was used for lyophilization.

Post-lyophilization efficacy values were computed and normalized similarly to the LANCE label values (‘Data processing' section). The degradation of efficacy owing to lyophilization was calculated by subtracting the post-lyophilization efficacy values score from the LANCE B16-F10 values.

Animal experiments for this study were approved by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were consistent with local, state and federal regulations as applicable. Female C57BL/6J mice (000664, The Jackson Laboratory) were used in the experiments. For imagining, d-luciferin (LUCK-1G, Gold Biotechnology) solubilized in PBS was administered via intraperitoneal injection and the mice were imaged using an IVIS imaging system (PerkinElmer).

We selected the COMET model most correlated (Spearman) with ensemble scores across a random virtual LNP subset. LNP features for t-SNE were the final [CLS] token representations. To ensure even distribution across ionizable types, dual-ionizable lipid LNPs were treated as a distinct class, and 1,250 LNPs per class (8 total) were randomly sampled (10,000 total).

To execute integrated gradients (IG) with COMET's multimodal inputs, we adapted the Captum library. IG computes attribution by integrating gradients along a path from reference to input. Feature attributions were computed per LNP, baseline-subtracted and averaged across each group. Non-PBAE LANCE LNPs were used as the baseline. Attribution scores were normalized (max = 1) and averaged across ensemble models.

Researchers have developed a team of robots that can autonomously explore underground tunnels. First, one drops a probe into the hole to map the interior. Then the smaller of a pair of rovers attaches itself to the larger and abseils down into the cave. From there it can detach itself and explore the environment it finds. The rappelling robots are “a significant step toward enabling future lunar or Martian cave missions”, says geochemist Jennifer Blank.

A surprising number of birds are ‘sex reversed', in which their appearance and reproductive organs don't align with the genetic sex determined by chromosomes. In a study of nearly 500 birds belonging to five common species that were brought into an animal hospital in Australia, researchers found that up to 6% of individuals were sex-reversed. Most examples were genetically female birds with male reproductive organs, but the group included a genetically male bird who appeared to have recently laid an egg.

A device takes advantage of the properties of two layers of material to levitate using only the power of sunlight. The top layer is transparent, allowing sunlight to shine through it, and the bottom layer absorbs that sunlight. Gas molecules moving from the cold transparent layer to the hot bottom layer creates a lift that is similar to that created by a helicopter's whirring rotor, says engineer Igor Bargatin, who has pioneered work on similar devices.

From mid-June to early July, Western Europe experienced its highest average temperatures for this period in decades, and the hottest June on record. And, between 10 June and 8 August, more than 98,000 people in Europe have been displaced by wildfire. Research suggests that heatwaves in the region are becoming much more frequent — one estimate found that London can now expect events like this every 6 years instead of every 60. That's bad for lives and livelihoods: extreme heat cut Greece's gross domestic product by 1.1% between 1 May and 14 July 2025, for example.

Despite years of trying to create a quantum theory of gravity, researchers haven't generated any concrete evidence to support any one contender. Now experiments are in the works that could finally test the true nature of gravity in the laboratory. Some tests plan to use advanced lasers still being invented. Others require ambitious techniques to manipulate matter that might never be achievable. Still, after years of stagnation, some physicists are welcoming “a new era in quantum-gravity research”, says theorist Jonathan Oppenheim.

The only way to iron out uncertainties in climate change modelling is to fund basic climate research, argues climate scientist Tim Palmer. Doing so will give us a better understanding of complex climate systems and a clearer picture of what lies ahead. “Whether the future is closer to an inconvenience or an existential catastrophe, one thing is clear: don't cut funding for basic climate research,” Palmer writes.

Harsh lighting, shiny surfaces and cluttered spaces are among the challenges for scientists wanting to photograph their experiments, whether for public engagement, teaching, or so that a setup can be repeated by others. Alongside a plethora of tips — mostly aimed at physicists — photographer and researcher David Penny notes that the benefits of slowing down to take a few shots go beyond the images captured. “It can also become a framework for observing more attentively, thinking more critically about visual evidence and engaging more creatively with the process of research communication,” he writes.

Today I'm reminded that good things don't only come to those who wait. A case in point: archaeology student Yara Souza recently uncovered a ninth-century artefact just 90 minutes into her first ever excavation. The tiny decorated object was found near the route of a Roman road that ran between York and Edinburgh.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a major global health concern. Medical nutrition therapy has a key role in T2DM management, with dietary interventions being central to improving glycaemic control and overall metabolic health. Growing evidence suggests that certain dietary strategies can exert direct metabolic benefits independent of weight reduction. The Mediterranean diet has consistently demonstrated metabolic and cardiovascular benefits, along with improved glycaemic control, even in the absence of substantial weight reduction. Low-energy and very-low-energy diets, characterized by moderate to severe caloric restriction, respectively, have also been associated with improvements in cardiometabolic markers and glycaemic regulation. Ketogenic diets promote nutritional ketosis and have shown benefits on glycaemic control, insulin sensitivity and other metabolic outcomes, often preceding substantial weight loss. Intermittent fasting strategies, such as alternate-day fasting or the 5:2 model, and time-restricted eating, have likewise been linked to enhanced glycaemic control and favourable metabolic and cardiovascular effects, although their long-term efficacy and safety require further investigation. This Review aims to provide an evidence-based synthesis of the main nutritional strategies used in the treatment of T2DM, with a focus on their underlying mechanisms, clinical efficacy and potential for sustainable long-term implementation.

Personalized medical nutrition therapy is a cornerstone of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management, with evidence supporting its role in improving glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity and in reducing diabetes mellitus-related complications in individuals both with and without obesity.

The Mediterranean diet exerts beneficial effects on glycaemic control, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress via several bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and omega-3 fatty acids as well as by promoting gut microbiota health and diversity.

Low-energy and very-low-energy diets can induce substantial weight loss and lead to T2DM remission, particularly when implemented early in the disease course.

Ketogenic diets, including very-low-energy ketogenic therapies, improve glycaemic outcomes and reduce insulin resistance by inducing nutritional ketosis; however, they vary in composition and require individualized use due to potential safety concerns.

Intermittent fasting approaches, such as 5:2 fasting and alternate-day fasting, and time-restricted eating, show promising results for weight loss, glycaemic control and medication reduction in T2DM. Their effectiveness can be enhanced when aligned with circadian rhythms.

Research on integrating medical nutrition therapy with pharmacological treatments such as incretin-based therapies could provide comprehensive solutions for T2DM management.

Rental car startup Kyte has shut down nearly one year after slashing staff and exiting most of its cities in the United States. The company sold its customer list to Turo in July and then turned right around and entered into a form of receivership in California, according to a notice that went out to Kyte creditors.

Kyte fell behind on some of its loans earlier this year, according to the notice. That caused the company's top lender to repossess and liquidate Kyte's vehicle fleet. 

Kyte's board of directors “pursued various capital solutions” to keep the company alive, the notice states. But the company wasn't able to line up financing and the board voted to wind down Kyte. 

While Kyte passed its customer list to Turo, a number of users who had prebooked trips before the shutdown have complained that they're stuck waiting on refunds for hundreds of dollars.

Some who spoke to TechCrunch said they were able to get their credit card companies to perform a charge-back, while others have had no luck. Kyte CEO Nikolaus Volk told TechCrunch in a message that charge-backs may be the quickest way for customers to get that money back.

Founded in 2019, Kyte provided on-demand rental cars that it also delivered directly to customers' homes. It controlled its own fleet of vehicles, making it a bit more like Zipcar and less like the peer-to-peer offerings of players like Turo. Kyte grew to 14 markets and raised more than $300 million in financing over its lifetime, and started billing itself as the “best competitor to Hertz.”

The business started coming apart in 2024, Volk told TechCrunch last year. Kyte was struggling to generate free cash flow in markets like Atlanta, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C. Volk said his team explored selling the business but decided to restructure and focus on reaching profit in the two biggest markets of San Francisco and New York City.

Kyte's not the only startup in this sector to run into trouble — especially in the United States. Getaround, another peer-to-peer vehicle rental service, shuttered its U.S. operations in February of this year to focus on its European business. TrueCar founder Scott Painter pivoted away from vehicle subscriptions in 2024 after struggling to build up a business called Autonomy.

A team of scientists has just gotten a closer peek into one of the earliest and most fundamental steps of creating a human life. Research out today highlights how they captured—for the first time—footage of human embryo implantation right as it's happening.

Researchers at the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC), in collaboration with Dexeus University Hospital, detailed their work in a study published Friday in Science Advances. Among other things, the footage shows that human embryos use force to burrow deep into the uterus for implantation. The new method may allow scientists to better understand why embryos so often fail to implant, and someday improve fertility treatment, the researchers say.

“The reason that we want to start studying implantation is because implantation is the main roadblock in human reproduction,” study author Samuel Ojosnegros, lead researcher of IBEC's Bioengineering for Reproductive Health group, told Gizmodo. “But we know very little about it and we know very little because it happens inside the mother.”

New Human-Like Synthetic Embryos Could Uncover Cause of Miscarriages, Scientists Say

Scientists have certainly learned a lot over time about how the human embryo develops. But there have been limitations to this research, Ojosnegros notes. We've only been able to study the first few days of the human embryo in real time, prior to implantation. After that, most research looks at snapshots of embryo development, usually taken of other non-human animals. These animal models are an important tool, but they can only tell us so much about how humans develop in the womb. Implantation is the first step of gestation, and it's only after an embryo embeds into the uterus that a pregnancy is considered to have actually begun.

The team, additionally led by scientists Amélie Godeau and Anna Seriola, created a material that could mimic the outer uterine tissue that an embryo attaches to for implantation. This gel-like matrix is mostly made out of collagen but is also infused with other proteins important to embryo development. With their creation in hand, they were now able to microscopically record how the human embryo implants itself. They also studied mouse embryos for comparison and noticed some important differences.

“The mouse embryo, if you put it on the matrix, stays superficially, spreads out, but will not invade. It will mainly spread out superficially. While the human, if you put it on the surface, it will dig a hole, penetrate, and it will sort of bury itself inside and then start growing,” Ojosnegros explained. “So then the human embryo is stronger, it's bigger, and it's way more invasive.”

There are many more mysteries left to be solved about the process of implantation, including the exact mechanisms that the embryo uses to so aggressively invade the uterus. But the lessons that Ojosnegros and other scientists can learn from this work could help families in the future. The researchers note that only about 30% of embryos (whether from natural birth or in vitro fertilization) make it all the way to being born, and of those that don't, most are lost during implantation or immediately after. So simply being able to see how the process unfolds could provide vital clues on how to prevent miscarriages or otherwise improve fertility.

Simple Drug Combo Could Prevent Repeat Miscarriages, Study Suggests

The researchers plan to continue to study the ins and outs of embryo implantation, but they're also hoping to standardize the materials used for this research so that others can conduct their own similar experiments. Ojosnegros also wants to highlight the contributions of the Dexeus University Hospital and the patients whose donated embryos made this work possible in the first place.

“I think it's good to recognize that without the generosity of the patients who donated the embryos for research, we could not study our own species,” he said.

Sometimes the most magical thing about a movie is seeing how it came together. We can watch the final product and feel however it makes us feel, but that's usually disconnected from all the work that went into it. You rarely think about the different takes, different conversations, and intense work that go into every single second. Especially a film's biggest, most important emotional moment.

James Gunn's Superman is now available to watch at home, and part of the release is a 60-minute special feature called “Adventures in Making Superman,” which features footage from on set. To show just how intimate the feature gets, Gunn shared the below nearly seven-minute clip on his social media. It's from during the filming of the film's emotional climax when Superman gives Lex Luthor the speech about his flaws and humanity. As you'll see, actor David Corenswet didn't quite connect with the words, so he and Gunn really dug into it on the day. Their conversation is almost as heartwarming as the resulting performance. Check it out.

That's just movie-making magic right there. Actor and director, challenging each other to get on the same page. Making sure that the delivery of the speech tracks with everything that happened before. Each being totally open to what the other is saying. Even though Gunn wrote the script and is directing, he's genuinely interested in Corenswet's thoughts. And when they get on the same page, it nearly brings tears to the eyes of the director and his producer-fellow DC Studios president, Peter Safran.

The rest of the documentary, and several other features, are on the digital release, which is available now. And, later, people who purchase will have their download updated with a Gunn director commentary and more. We've got the details here.

Is Microsoft about to shake up its workforce again? 

A new report this week by The Verge is adding to the speculation that the company is preparing to tighten its return-to-office policy, potentially requiring most employees at its Redmond headquarters to be on-site at least three days a week starting in January. 

In response to an inquiry from GeekWire, a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that the company is reviewing its flexible work guidelines, as it has in the past, but said no final decisions have been made.

An announcement could come in September, according to The Verge. This follows an earlier report by Business Insider along similar lines. Microsoft's current hybrid work policy allows most employees to work remotely up to half the time without approval. 

All of this comes at a sensitive moment for Microsoft's workforce, which has been impacted by more than 15,000 job cuts globally since May — including more than 3,000 in Washington state — amid record capital spending on AI infrastructure.

An RTO policy change could further trim Microsoft's workforce through attrition. Some employees may choose to leave rather than comply. Other companies that tightened RTO rules have seen a similar dynamic.

The potential shift would bring Microsoft more in line with Google and Meta, which generally require three days a week in the office. Amazon, the Seattle region's other tech giant, brought employees back five days a week.

The reports come as Microsoft continues a multiyear expansion and redevelopment of its Redmond headquarters, where seven new East Campus buildings are open and more are under construction as part of a 17-building project designed in part to encourage in-person collaboration and productivity.

Under the potential new policy, employees who live within 50 miles of Microsoft's Redmond campus would be required to work in the office at least three days a week, with some teams returning four or five days at the discretion of executive leaders, according to The Verge. Employees could still apply for exceptions.

Worker foot traffic in downtown Seattle continues to show signs of improving, more than five years after the start of the pandemic, according to the latest figures released this week by the Downtown Seattle Association. But it's a “fragile” dynamic according to one official, with rising office vacancy rates continuing to generate concern.

The DSA's Downtown Revitalization Dashboard for August shows that worker foot traffic in July was 66% of July 2019's daily average — the highest rate of monthly worker foot traffic since February 2020. 

According to DSA, the figure represents more than 154,000 daily worker visits in July — a 7% increase from July 2024. In January of this year, weekday worker foot traffic was 57% of January 2019.

The bump coincides with Amazon's 2025 return to five days per week in office for the roughly 50,000 corporate and tech workers at its Seattle headquarters.

“While a number of metrics are moving in the right direction, downtown is still fragile, and we face challenges with high office and retail vacancy,” DSA President and CEO Jon Scholes told GeekWire. “Those circumstances ultimately will negatively affect the city's tax base if not urgently addressed.”

Seattle's office vacancy rate is still among the highest in the country, trailing only Austin and San Francisco, according to recent figures from CommercialCafe.

In its Q2 report, commercial real estate company Colliers said Seattle's vacancy rate rose to 32.4%, up from 28.7% a year ago. The firm expects vacancy to rise further in the coming quarters but also said “improving RTO adherence and economic clarity could support stronger leasing activity in late 2025 and into 2026.”

Colliers noted new leases in downtown Seattle for tech companies including Stackline (Madison Centre), Carta (Columbia Center), and Supio (Century Square). 

Digital remittance company Remitly moved more than 500 workers into new headquarters space in the Rainier Square skyscraper in May. The company occupies three floors and there are plans to take over another next year, with room for 220 more workstations.

Elsewhere, “AI House,” a first-in-the-nation hub designed to bring entrepreneurs, investors, students and community leaders together to enhance collaboration on artificial intelligence, got up and running this spring along the waterfront at Pier 70.

Others are departing. Real estate firm JLL noted the vacancy created by global health nonprofit PATH, which moved from a 111,000-square-foot space downtown to new headquarters in the Fremont neighborhood.

DSA has been in lockstep with Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell about boosting downtown activity. Seattle is two years into Harrell's Downtown Activation Plan to revitalize the city core post-pandemic, but the mayor is facing a tough re-election battle against challenger Katie Wilson.

Downtown revitalization is a key part of Wilson's platform. According to her website, the mayoral candidate said she supports a potential vacancy tax for commercial property owners and office-to-housing conversions.

Along with the worker numbers, DSA also reported on “unique visitors” to the city's core, with 3.2 million such visitors  being counted in July, representing 97% of the amount seen in July 2019.

DSA credited a number of factors and events, including a busy July 26, when more than 671,000 people were counted on the night of a Morgan Wallen concert at Lumen Field and the Seafair Torchlight Parade. Only July 2023 — when Taylor Swift was in town and the Major League Baseball All-Star week was happening — reached that level since March 2020.

According to DSA, downtown foot traffic data is provided by Placer.ai and is based on cell phone location data. Each person is counted once per day.

I've got 3D printers and lots of low-power single board computer (SBC) and related items in my office, so what do I do with them? Of course I had the crazy idea to 3D print my own file / media server.

I'm not designing this from scratch, rather I am using the excellent Modular Attached Storage Stack (MASS) from Haydn Bao. Specifically the free version of the kit, but from what I have seen, I shall be paying the $27 (£20) for the premium model.

MASS is a compact and modular NAS enclosure that has been designed by Bao to print on many of the best budget 3D printers. I printed 99% of my parts using an Elegoo Centauri Carbon, and 1.5KG of Elegoo Rapid PETG filament. The remaining 1% of the 3D print process was completed on my older Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro. Why? Because it prints TPU (flexible filament) extremely well and I need four feet to stop the case sliding around the desk.

The brains for this project is a LattePanda Mu with an Intel N100 and a mini-ITX motherboard. Inside the Mu's module I have a quad-core Intel N100 CPU capable of up to 3.4GHz, 8GB of LPDDR5 and 64GB of eMMC. I'll be installing a Linux based operating system and to manage the drive, OpenMediaVault.



Right now, I have a plethora of 3D printed parts which have been printed over the past week. I'll have a breakdown of the times and amount of filament used over the entire build process, and I will have links to key tools and products used so you can make your own.

I know what you are going to ask. "Why are you 3D printing a case when you can buy one?" The simple answer is, because I can and I want to give my Elegoo Centauri Carbon a real project so it can show just how good it is. So join me in this live blog as I show you the ups and downs of 3D printing your own NAS device.



Raise your hand if you thought the 3D printing was going to be the hardest part?

The 3D printed MASS case has been an absolute joy and I am happy to throw $27 to the designer for such a great experience. It 3D printed extremely well, went together with ease and it looks and feels like a super expensive piece of kit.



So what went wrong? First of all my choice of motherboard. The LattePanda Mu is a great Intel N100 board, and the full evaluation board is essentially a mini-ITX motherboard, but the port placement is terrible for this project. So I'll be looking for an alternative over the next few weeks.

Add to that the SATA port issue, requiring a BIOS update and DIP switch settings changes, means that I spent far too much time chasing issues than having fun.

I got there in the end, but for 24 hours I was slowly losing my confidence in the project.



OpenMediaVault is a powerful piece of software and well worth investing your time and effort into. You'll soon have your own NAS full of content, served across your home.

For now I am going to slowly fill up this new server and understand more about what it can do for my workflow.

Thanks for following the live blog. Its largely been great fun, apart from the moments of sheer terror and panic as I tried to fix multiple problems that were ultimately there from the start.





You've all been patient, thanks for following me along this rollercoaster of a live blog!

The 4TB drive is connected and ready to share across my network. So lets do that by creating a SMB (Samba) share for a single user.



Before you do anything, change the default admin password from openmediavault to something less likely to get hacked.

We need to tell OpenMediaVault where to find out storage drive.

Click on Storage >> Disks.



The drive should be listed, if not, click on the spyglass to search for it.

Select the drive and click on wipe (second icon) to wipe the drive ready for use. Obviously do not delete data that you want to keep.



Click on Storage >> File Systems and click on the + to create a new file system. I chose EXT4, you choose what you need.

Click on the Device, and then Save.



Go back to Storage >> File Systems and click on the Play button to mount an existing file system. Select your freshly created file system and make sure to write the configuration changes (big yellow banner warning.)



Click on Storage >> Shared Folders and create a new shared folder on your drive. I also set the permissions so that anyone can read and write from the shared folder. In a production environment I would not do that, I would create groups and users with granular levels of access and permissions. But this drive is just for me, so I can do it this way.



Next, click on Services >> SMB/CFS.



Click on Settings, then tick Enabled. Scroll down to Save and then write the pending changes.



Click on Services >> SMB/CFS and then Shares.

Click on the + to create a new share.

Set the shared folder to the file share that we have just created.

Add any extra features such as a Recycle Bin, then click Save and write the configuration changes.



Now create a user who can log in to the shared folder.

Click on Users >> Users



Click on + and Create a new user with a user name and password.

Add the user to the sambashare group and click Save. Then write the pending configuration changes.



Now open the Windows File Manager and click on Network.

The server, OPENMEDIAVAULT should be there.

Double click on the drive and enter your user details.

The shared folder "Fileshare" is available, and we can store our files on the network drive.



We've done it, we've made a 3D printed media / file server using recycled parts!



Yes, finally something has gone right!

All it took was digging out a "spare" 4TB NVMe SSD and PCIe adapter, reflashing the OpenMediaVault (OMV) ISO image to a USB drive (it went really weird and buggy), installing OMV to the eMMC of the LattePanda Mu, then setting up the 4TB drive in OMV, then Samba / SMB. But yeah, here we go!

The share works across my Windows 10 and Ubuntu 24.04 systems and this, finally, makes me happy!



I have a lot of spare PC parts laying around, but sadly only two Mini ITX motherboards. The first is the LattePanda Mu evaluation board, the other is a RISC-V board. The former has issues with SATA, the latter won't work with OpenMediaVault.

I'm having BIOS flashing issues, I borked it once, didn't fancy fixing it all over again. So I have gone to plan D. Using a PCIe based breakout board.



I have plenty of these, but the free MASS case design is not compatible, I would need to print the premium model and sadly I do not have time. So what do I do? I've got a Sabrent NVMe to PCIe adapter and a 4TB Lexar drive NVMe SSD, so lets make the best of a bad situation.

I wanted to use the spare 3.5 inch 4TB Seagate drive that resides in a drawer, but alas that is not destined to be. So lets get this drive installed, OpenMediaVault re-installed and get this project over the line!

I've got the correct BIOS files, and I've read the instructions, no really!

I powered up the server with the USB installed, and logged in, no remote SSH connections here, I am sat right in front of the server. I mount the USB drive and list the contents.

The contents are different to what I put on there, very different!

So, I booted from Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS via my Ventoy USB flash drive, created for the PC First Aid Toolkit. I then mount the USB drive, copy the contents to the Desktop and then make a file called FPT executable via chmod that'll work, right? Nope, permissions errors, everywhere. So I have installed Ubuntu on the N100's eMMC, overwriting the OpenMediaVault install. Now to try it all again.

The 3D printing part of this project was super smooth, enabling SATA on the LattePanda Mu Full Evaluation Carrier Board is not.



Looking in the manual for the Lattepanda Mu Full Evaluation Board (dev board) it seems that SATA is only enabled if...

"The switch between SATA and PCIe functions will only take effect after flashing the corresponding BIOS firmware, following the modification of the DIP switch settings."



If I have read that correctly, I need to set the DIP switch to the BOT BIOS, which selects the evaluation board's BIOS, then flash the new BIOS to the board.

Ok then, here goes nothing.

Welcome to the final day for this project, and I've not got much time to diagnose the SATA issue, so lets crack on!

The LattaPanda Mu development board has its own BIOS, and so does the Mu itself. From the motherboard I can select between the two, and the Mu's BIOS seemingly can't see the SATA connections, but PCIe and NVMe drives work fine. Switching to the dev board's BIOS and I can see the SATA drives!

Yay! Right?

Errr no. Because those BIOS cannot see the Ethernet ports and a NAS without Ethernet is a bit useless. Also a NAS with no SATA storage is equally as useless.

My plan is to check the BIOS for any weird things that I have missed. Scour the Internet for others who faced the problem, and then possibly update the BIOS.

First, coffee.



I've got an old WD Black 1TB NVMe SSD and I use it for testing PCIe performance on single board computers. I wondered if NVMe was working on the board, so I grabbed an M.2 to PCIe adapter and plugged it in.



OpenMediaVault saw it, so the problem is confirmed with SATA on the motherboard. Time for some more reading.



I tried a readily available SATA SSD, just to see if the system could see that. It cannot. Same error.



I checked the manual and configured the DIP switch to enable the two SATA ports. Alas, same issue. This is a head scratcher!



Progress has been made! I've inserted the hard disk, a spare Seagate 4TB drive that I used with building Raspberry Pi powered NAS. The connections for power and data have been done, and the HDD retainer is in place so my drive should now tumble to an untimely death.

An ultra quiet Noctua NF-P14S Redux 140mm, 1500 PWM fan has been connected and is set to force cool air in from the bottom of the case, over the hard drive(s) and to the N100 which has its own cooling system. Everything sounds so quiet!

I've attached the bottom section, lifting the fan off the desk, and fitted four TPU feet to stop the server skidding around my desk.

So why doesn't OpenMediaVault see the drive? In fact, the underlying OS cannot see the drive either. I think I need to check the manual to see if the SATA ports are enabled by default.

I can hear the drive starting up as I power on the server, and when I power down I hear that it is powered down, the cable has been re-seated.

I checked the motherboard manual, there is a jumper to change, just next to the clock battery. I changed it to enable SATA ports 1 and 2. Powered up the server, no change. This is a head scratcher.



The HDD sliders, best printed in TPU but I chose PETG because I didn't read that bit, fix to the screw points on your chosen 3.5 inch hard disk drive. But if you get them the wrong way round, the screw heads will not slide into the channel and you will get a 20 minute headache, well I did anyway.

You'll need some M3.5 screws, common in PC builds, to secure the slider to the drive. Pay attention to the location as the screws need to slide into the channel. If incorrect, the screw heads will hit the outer edge of the rail and prevent the sliders going into the channel.

Once the drive is in, you will need to secure the cables to the motherboard, and then attach the HDD retainer to the front of the case. There is no other mechanical means to secure the drive. In this case, please don't tip your server until everything is secure and in place.



The bay module is where up to four 3.5 inch hard disk drives will be slotted into place. This will form the base of the server build. The module is made from two 3D printed halves, front and back. These halves join together with pegs, but also need M3 20mm screws to hold everything together.

The instructions say to use four screws, but there are eight screw holes. I put four in, and everything is solid. If you've got spare screws, go for eight and pray that you never need to open it up.

Screw access is tight, you'll need a long PH2 screwdriver to get down there. Luckily I have a Wera Vario that can just get into the recesses.

Everything is assembled, but I have one last job to do. Clean up the wispy bits of PETG floss that appeared during the print. This could've been generated by moisture in the filament (but it was a brand new, unopened pack), retraction settings, or even Z-hop.

To clean them up I use a hot air rework station (something I reviewed for the best soldering irons and stations page) at 150C and 50% air speed to melt the wisps away. Do be careful doing this, you don't want to damage your print, or more importantly, yourself!



Bad pun, sorry! Ok, so I have OpenMediaVault (OMV) installed on the eMMC drive of the LattePanda Mu and all appears to be working. I erroneously thought that I could install OMV inside of Ubuntu Server, but according to the website I need to download a specific ISO and install using that. I've built OMV servers before, but they were always built around a Raspberry Pi and so my brain thought that was the process.

Its installed, so now I can consider the test complete, and now I can move on to building the drive bays!



After taking the front panel off I have access to the USB ports and I can boot from a copy of Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS Server and install the OS before moving onward.



I've connected up the server to my Elecrow CrowView Note, a laptop with no brains and designed to interface with a Raspberry Pi on Nvidia Jetson. But with the right cables you can connect anything to it, including this server!

I chose to install Ubuntu on to the 64GB eMMC drive that comes with the N100, it should be fast enough for booting and running the OS. If not, there is an M.2 NVMe option that I can use.



Phew, that was a close call. I thought the project was dead before it got going. Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS has been installed and it appears to be working to spec. Now that the smoke test is done, I can install OpenMediaVault and then build the rest of the server.



Whoops! I want to install Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS on the LattePanda Mu. No problem, right? Wrong!

The LattePanda Mu ITX breakout board has all of the USB ports at the front, and the MASS case has just a big mesh there!



I tried plugging in a USB C Steam Deck dock into the solitary USB C port. Why? Because it has a right-angled connector.



Did it work? Nope. Now I am ordering some right-angled USB 3 adapters from Amazon (once I test and confirm they work, I'll share the link) and right now I need to disassemble the front of the case so that I can install Ubuntu.

This is an example of a concept that I used to teach.

I really should take my own advice, sometimes! Onwards!



In my haste yesterday, I forgot to talk about the quickest 3D print in the project. The clips!To connect the mesh panel (side and the top), Bao has integrated a series of 3D printed (of course they are 3D printed!) clips that insert in to cut-outs around the case. They simply push into the space designed for them



Then all we need to do is insert the panel and the clips connect with the specially designed studs to lock the panel in place. The case is designed for the side panels to easily pull off via small indentations on the case. If you need to take the top panel off, use a guitar plectrum, Lego brick separator or a plastic spudger. I wouldn't use metal as it will damage the plastic.

Ok, my next job is to do a smoke test on the build. Then install a Linux OS to make sure that all of this work hasn't been wasted.

Wow, just wow. I did not expect the build to come out like this. I am truly stunned, and I can't wait to start work on the next part, the drive bays which can hold up to four 3.5 inch drives, and it even has rails to pull the drives in and out of the bays!

I'll be back tomorrow for more fun as I build this truly excellent kit!

Let me say this first, this is a great build! I'm actually enjoying it, no hype or hint of falsehood, I am having a great time.

First of all I inserted some M3 nylon standoffs into the top and bottom sections of the APU where my LattePanda board resides. Why nylon standoffs? Because my other brass M3 standoffs weren't long enough so I had to improvise. With the standoffs in place I lined up the screw points on the motherboard and used some nylon M3 screws to secure the motherboard to the top and bottom frame, effectively using the motherboard to provide extra strength in the central core. Don't make my mistake, get yourself a selection of screws for PC case building. Mine are on the way from Amazon.



Following the instructions, I'm using M3 20mm self tapping countersunk screws to secure the 3D printed sections together. I bought a 100 from Amazon so I have plenty of spares. When screwing into plastic, make sure that you are committed to the task, unscrewing and re-screwing will only weaken the build. Personally, I would've liked to have seen threaded inserts melted into the screw holes, but time and talent did not allow this time.

I lined up the screws, and carefully screwed them in until I felt them "bite". To do this I used a small Wera ratcheting screwdriver from my PC first aid tool kit, which also has a 3D printed project hidden inside it.



Once they are lined up, I bring out the big guns. The HOTO Electric Screwdriver that myself and a few other editors own. This makes short work of driving the screws into the PETG plastic, but the ratcheting screwdriver helps me "feel" when the screw is in correctly.



I now carry on with the build process, I have clips and case sides to add.

The LattePanda Mu's Mini ITX development board sadly does not have common ATX-style power connectors, but it does have a 5525 DC barrel jack for an external power brick. Great!

It also has a power button on the motherboard, so what is my problem? Well, the rear panel of the MASS case has a breakout for a 16mm push button, or a standard PC key switch but the LattePanda development board doesn't have a conventional breakout for power buttons, case LEDs etc. So I had to improvise.



I dug out my trusty UNI-T UT58C multimeter, set it to continuity, and probed the four test points with the power off! The outer most points connected when the power button was pressed, this makes a connection and triggers the board to power up. So I soldered on some wires, and tested the connection with a 16mm button from my collection.



I chose to use ferrules on the bare wires that are held in the jaws of the screw terminal. Why? Better mechanical grip and they reduce the risk of shorts. Also, I love ferrules.

I tested this setup before committing to the wiring, and all went well so I made the fix permanent using some Kapton tape and better soldering.



The Kapton tape also acts as strain relief, handy as the next part of the process sees me build the motherboard into the case, using plenty of M3 screws and nuts.

Haydn Bao's Modular Attached Storage Stack (MASS) project oozes quality. From the 3D printable models to the instructions, I can see that I will have a lot of fun building this kit.

First of all, the models. The MASS Instructables and project page show off both the free and premium versions of the kit and Bao is meticulous in detailing the differences, so that we have an informed choice as to what model we want to print.

I downloaded the free kit and opened the ZIP archive and found lots of parts to print and an optional section (which I used for a few parts) for parts to augment your build.



Loading these parts into a slicer, in my case Elegoo's fork of Orca Slicer, Elegoo Slicer, and I can clearly see that these parts have been designed with ease of printing in mind. They come pre-oriented for best printing and Bao has designed supports directly into the parts.



The instructions are awesome. A great mix that illustrates the build process in words and pictures. How to attach the parts together, their orientation, what screws to use and advising on optional parts for your build.



I love the instructions! Now, I have to use them to build my server, but first I need to perform a little surgery on my LattePanda Mu, specifically the power button!

The White House has created a spreadsheet that rates hundreds of companies for their loyalty, according to a new report from Axios. And while that may not be entirely shocking news, given Donald Trump's way of doing business, it's worth stepping back and asking how news of a loyalty scorecard by a sitting president would've been received in the pre-Trump era.

The rankings on the loyalty spreadsheet are currently determined by a given company's perceived support of the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, a budget package that passed in July and is poised to strip healthcare from at least 17 million people while lowering taxes on the wealthiest Americans. That support is gauged by social media posts, press releases, ads, and more, according to Axios.

The spreadsheet reportedly contains 553 companies and trade organizations, each getting one of three ratings of support for Trump: Strong, moderate, or low. Examples of companies that were “good partners,” according to Axios, include Uber, DoorDash, United, Delta, AT&T, and Cisco.  

And while it's entirely possible the rankings are solely determined by public displays of support, it's impossible to ignore the financial contributions those companies have often made to Trump. AT&T, Delta, United, Uber, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi each contributed $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, according to CNBC. DoorDash contributed $100,000. Cisco didn't donate to Trump's inauguration, but spoke glowingly about the president shortly after he was elected in 2024.

Trump has insisted on fealty to his far-right agenda and has set out to crush anyone who doesn't fall in line. That includes some of the largest companies in America, which have dutifully met with Trump to kiss the ring and sing his praises. Apple CEO Tim Cook, who also donated $1 million to Trump, visited the White House to announce new spending in the U.S. and even gave the president a piece of glass with the Apple logo sporting a 24-karat gold base. It's the kind of tacky gesture that Trump loves—symbolism that makes it clear the king is in charge.

Axios quotes an unnamed White House source who describes the loyalty spreadsheet as an “evolving” document, and support for other initiatives beyond the Big Beautiful Bill will be included in the future. And Axios notes it will be used whenever lobbyists approach the Trump regime with requests. “If groups/companies want to start advocating more now for the tax bill or additional administration priorities, we will take that into account in our grading,” the White House official is quoted as telling Axios.

It all sounds like a mafia-style operation, of course. But that's no secret. Trump has always been a transactional president and isn't shy about shaking down anyone who he thinks isn't sufficiently deferential to his whims. Even if Trump doesn't like someone, he seems willing to bring them back into the “loyal” camp as long as they play along.

For example, Trump recently criticized the CEO of Intel, Lip-Bu Tan, calling him “highly conflicted” and insisting he needed to resign over supposed ties to China. Tan denied the allegations, met with Trump, and now we have reports from Bloomberg that the U.S. government might take a stake in Intel and might use funds from the Chips Act to do it. We don't know exactly what happened there, but we can make some educated guesses. If you want to do business in the U.S., you need to pay your tithe to Trump's empire in one way or another. Unfortunately, Trump's empire isn't just his collection of private businesses these days. He sees the entire country and all its wealth as his for the taking.

Trump is also working on getting a 15% cut from Nvidia and AMD on chips shipped to China in what's being characterized as a “revenue-sharing agreement.” That deal seems unconstitutional, according to Fortune, but that doesn't seem like it will matter in the long run. Trump's government flagrantly breaks the law, there's sometimes a protracted legal fight, and he keeps pushing boundaries while the courts that are stacked with his own judges debate the finer points.

The U.S. public was absolutely scandalized when it learned of President Richard Nixon's enemies list in 1973. But in the second Trump era, this kind of loyalty ranking from the White House is just a tiny drop in an ocean of bizarre news that defies the norms of another age.

Smart ring maker Ultrahuman is acquiring women's health technology company viO HealthTech to launch advanced cycle and ovulation tracking, the company announced on Friday. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Thanks to the acquisition, the company is launching a new plug-in for the Ultrahuman Ring AIR called “Cycle and Ovulation Pro.” The plug-in will allow users to accurately track their cycles, get fertility planning support with ovulation confirmation, and detect patterns like early or late ovulation. The plug-in also allows users to log moods, symptoms, and more to uncover long-term wellness trends.

Cycle and Ovulation Pro use a temperature-sensing algorithm originally developed for viO's OvuSense fertility monitors. The technology was developed over 15 years and trained on a dataset of over 260,000 cycles collected with medical-grade sensors, Ultrahuman notes.

With the Ultrahuman Ring AIR, the technology enables cycle tracking via the finger to allow for personalized insights that adapt over time and a better understanding of users' cycles.

“Most menstrual tracking platforms are built for women with regular 28-day cycles,” Ultrahuman wrote in a press release. “In reality, the majority have diverse cycle patterns — and those with conditions like non-bleeding, PCOS, endometriosis, or thyroid disorders often don't get an accurate or supportive experience. Ultrahuman's acquisition of viO is designed for them.”

Ultrahuman notes that the existing free Cycle & Ovulation PowerPlug, which offers foundational tracking tools and calendar-based predictions, will remain available.

“Wearables will shape the future of health,” said Rob Milnes, CEO of viO HealthTech, in a press release. “We're delighted to be able to bring OvuSense women's health insights to a significantly wider audience via the Ultrahuman Ring AIR.”

Cycle and Ovulation Pro is available starting Friday as a premium PowerPlug in the Ultrahuman app for $3.99 per month or $39.99 per year for users in the U.S., U.K., EU, Australia, and Canada. The company plans to release it in more regions in the future.

ChatGPT's mobile app is raking in the revenue. 

Since launching in May 2023, ChatGPT's app for iOS and Android devices has reached $2 billion in global consumer spending, according to a new analysis by app intelligence provider Appfigures. That figure is approximately 30x the combined lifetime spending of ChatGPT's rivals on mobile, including Claude, Copilot, and Grok, the analysis indicates.

So far this year, ChatGPT's mobile app has made $1.35 billion, up 673% year-over-year from the $174 million it made during the same period (January-July) in 2024, per the data. On average, the app is generating close to $193 million per month, up from $25 million last year.

That's significantly higher — or about 53x higher — than ChatGPT's next nearest competitor, Grok, which made approximately $25.6 million this year to date. Grok's average monthly consumer spending is estimated at $3.6 million, or 1.9% of ChatGPT's.

This data suggests that other consumer chatbots still have a way to go to catch up with ChatGPT's dominance on mobile devices, even if the numbers don't provide a complete picture of the AI companies' overall revenue. Consumers, teams, and businesses can also subscribe to AI plans on the web, and the companies generate revenue in other ways, too, like via their APIs.

Rather, this new data offers a window into the apps' traction with consumers, who discover and pay for these AI assistants via the mobile app stores.

It's also worth noting that when xAI's Grok launched in November 2023 (after ChatGPT), Grok didn't initially have stand-alone iOS or Android apps. Instead, users interacted with the AI chatbot through the X platform. Grok only became available on mobile devices through its own iOS app as of early January 2025 and has been on Google Play since March 4.

Still, ChatGPT's lifetime global spending per download is $2.91, compared to Claude's $2.55, Grok's $0.75, and Copilot's $0.28, Appfigures found. 

In the U.S., ChatGPT's spending per download to date is even higher, at $10, leading the market to account for 38% of the app's revenue to date. Germany is the second-largest market, accounting for 5.3% of ChatGPT's lifetime total spending.

ChatGPT's lead can also be seen in terms of downloads. To date, the app has been installed an estimated 690 million times globally, compared with Grok's 39.5 million. (That puts X owner Elon Musk's recent complaints about the App Store's alleged favoritism of ChatGPT in its Top Charts into better context.)

Average monthly downloads of ChatGPT globally are now at approximately 45 million, up 180% from about 16 million in January through July of 2024. 

In 2025 so far, ChatGPT's app has been downloaded 318 million times, or 2.8x more than the 113 million it saw during the same period last year. By the number of installs, however, India is the top market, accounting for 13.7% of lifetime downloads, compared with second place, the U.S., which accounted for 10.3% of all downloads.

From the golf course to the kitchen, we're back with another fun spotlight on up-and-coming startups out of the Seattle area. 

This batch includes companies building a backend service for AI agents; a recipe, cooking, and meal-planning app; a platform for golfers; and a new way to shop for clothes online.   

A big thanks to Jessica Kamada, managing partner at Swizzle Ventures, for providing the “VC View” for this Startup Radar.

And this time, I'm also getting in on the fun with “Taylor's Take” — my quick thoughts on each company are below. 

Check out past startup radar spotlights here and email me at taylor@geekwire.com to flag other companies and startup news. 

Deglaze

Founded: 2022

The business: Recipe apps aren't new, but AI is changing the game. That's the bet from Deglaze, which helps users organize recipes they collect from social media, cookbooks, websites, and more. It also taps into AI to provide guidance for meal plans, shopping, and cooking. The company has raised a small investment round.

Leadership: Jacob Edelstein was CTO at Seattle fintech startup Copper Banking, and was vice president of engineering at Curalate. He also spent seven years at Microsoft. His co-founder Angel Azcarraga was CTO at Spotahome and held engineering leadership roles at Amazon and Microsoft. 

VC View from Jessica Kamada: “Deglaze is for the cooking/baking enthusiast who finds joy in the kitchen, but wants to make it as efficient as possible. Deglaze differentiates itself from other ‘meal planning/cooking' apps in the productivity category like Ollie by leaning more heavily into the emerging category of niche interest communities (i.e. Auggie) with surprise & delight consumer features like ‘cook mode' and a community feel where users can follow their favorite chefs. As a freemium app, the monetization at scale is a concern, but if they can monetize their cooking creator community of chefs, they may be on to something.”

Taylor's Take: I can see this being beneficial for a wide range of users — from those who just want to organize grocery lists and meal plans, to more experienced cooks who love following recipes. I've been using ChatGPT to help guide me when I cook — but would Deglaze be better? The app seems ripe for various revenue models, and this is an experienced founding team.

GolfGuiders

Founded: 2021

The business: A central hub for all things golf — social networking, golf course discovery, tee times, e-commerce, AI-powered assistance, and more. The company just launched its app and has a handful of revenue-generation ideas — including affiliate programs, trip planning, white-labeling, and more. It has raised $500,000.

Leadership: Founder Richard Hussain is a longtime technologist who previously founded a healthcare startup. He was also a solutions architect at IT services company Denali.

VC View from Jessica Kamada: “The golf industry exploded during COVID, as one of the few safe activities available. A new generation and diverse population was introduced to the game. With multiple new apparel brands (Malbon, Eastside Golf) making golf cool again, the modern golfer may be open to technology that supports their new hobby. The question is if GolfGuiders can grow the community large enough to evolve from a free app to a premium must-have golf companion.”

Taylor's Take: I'm a big-time golfer, so this one caught my attention. But I'm not sure what would make me stick around on the app, or get me opening it on a daily basis. Perhaps some gamification feature? There's also stiff competition from existing golf apps such as 18Birdies. I do like the idea of more specialized media and community networks that focus on a topic.

Insforge

Founded: 2025

The business: A back-end platform for AI coding agents. Insforge provides authentication, databases, storage, functions, real-time updates, and more — all optimized for AI agents rather than human developers. Users can create backend systems with prompts. The company generates revenue off subscriptions and has raised $1.5 million to date. 

Leadership: CEO Hang Huang was a senior product manager at Amazon and earned his MBA from Yale last year. CTO Tony Chang was a software developer at Databricks. 

VC View from Jessica Kamada: “After foundational Gen AI models, Agentic AI is the next wave. As a consumer investor, I'm investing in companies that would be customers of Insforge. Our portfolio is building for a world where agentic APIs will interact with each other to complete a task on a consumers' behalf. Agentic infrastructure like Insforge will be paramount to teams reaching that future faster.”

Taylor's Take: This one combines a bunch of hot trends — AI agents, virtual coders, natural language commands, infrastructure, etc. If the current direction doesn't pan out well, feels like the company could pivot quickly given the nature of the product. Also loved the website — slick and simple. 

So-Me.ai

Founded: 2025

The business: Personal shopping agent that learns the unique style, preferences, and behavior of a user. The software aims to turn tedious scrolling into a visual-first curated experience. The company is bootstrapped and is working with a small group of private beta testers. 

Leadership: Founder Zeynab Raeesy spent more than seven years at Amazon in applied science roles. She also worked at Nuance Communications and VoiceBox Technologies as a research engineer and speech scientist.

VC View from Jessica Kamada: “Consumer AI is in its ‘Fun' era, and fashion/commerce enablement is having a moment. There is an obvious market opportunity in fashion search and shopping agents, as new fashion brands come online constantly, making consumers heads spin. However, new players are entering the market quickly with big investment behind them such as Daydream and Doji. The pie is likely big enough for multiple players. If So-Me can differentiate on agents that truly learn shopper personal taste, they can carve out a slice!”

Taylor's Take: Shopping for clothes online could really use a refresh, and perhaps AI will shake things up. I'm curious about the business model and whether this could be used as a white-label solution for online shops. If things go well, this could be ripe for an acquisition by a larger retailer wanting to offer customers a more personalized experience.

AI data centers demand gigawatts of power that the U.S. grid is struggling to supply.

A U.S. analyst of Chinese technology said that the country has already solved its energy problem — at least in terms of power for its AI infrastructure. Rui Ma, founder of Tech Buzz China, posted on X that the country's massive investments in advanced hydropower and nuclear technologies meant that its “electricity supply is secure and inexpensive.” This is in contrast to the U.S., where many AI data centers are disrupting its electricity grid and supply, resulting in a lack of supply and price increases for every user.

Both Washington and Beijing are currently in an AI race, with the two powers vying for the lead in this technology. Because of this, the two rivals are diving into a massive build-out of AI data centers that require massive amounts of electricity to run. In the U.S., it has come to the point that tech giants are building their own power plants — with Elon Musk importing one to power his data centers and companies, like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle, Nvidia, and more investing in the research and development of nuclear reactors.

However, it seems that this is not a problem for China. According to Fortune, the East Asian country has an 80% to 100% power reserve, allowing it to absorb the massive demand brought about by the hundreds of data centers it built in recent years. More than that, it's also continually expanding its output, with one expert telling the publication that it “adds more electricity demand than the entire annual consumption of Germany, every single year.”

Some argue that the power is delivered by heavily polluting coal plants, but China is also investing massively in renewable energy projects. Nevertheless, if the power demand outstrips supply, it can easily reactivate coal plants to cover the shortfall. In fact, the new data centers are welcomed, as they help stimulate demand in a market that has an excess of power production. Nevertheless, electricity oversupply doesn't seem to be an immediate concern, as most of China's power plants are state-owned. Beijing also plans its energy production well in advance, allowing it to prepare for prospective demand, like the AI data center boom.

This still does not address the elephant in the room, though: the fact that many Chinese data centers sit idle or underutilized. Beijing is developing a network to create a marketplace that will sell surplus capacity, but it is still facing challenges, especially with latency and different ecosystems.

On the other hand, the U.S. faces major hurdles with its electricity supply. Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg said that power constraints will limit AI growth, and that new power plants aren't being built fast enough to satisfy AI's insatiable demand. If the U.S. does not address this issue sooner, it risks lagging behind China even if it has more powerful and efficient hardware. That's because the latter can just throw tons of power to gain the upper hand in the AI race through sheer brute force, similar to how Huawei's CloudMatrix cluster beats the performance of Nvidia's GB200.

The mastermind behind RRR, the incredible blast of a Tollywood blockbuster that caused an international craze, S.S. Rajamouli, is making his cinematic return. And while it's not for the long-gestating sequel talk for RRR, the filmmaker promises a new icon set to speed his way across the world in his next film, seemingly potentially called Globetrotter, starring Telugu movie star Mahesh Babu.

In a clip posted to S.S. Rajamouli's Instagram, we get a super mysterious first look at the movie, which admittedly is such a tease; we're left a little confounded but excited by it. I mean, a motorcycle revs up on some ancient ruins, with pans that don't reveal Babu's look for the film. The anticipation is killing us because, in between shots of locations of an epic scale, sleek action, and a giant swinging spiked ball (Indiana Jones‘ boulder found rolling itself back into its cave), the title cards promise a “new magnum opus riding soon” and a full trailer we can't seem to find! Don't go to YouTube to try; you'll find a ton of AI-generated “notion” concept dupes masquerading as the real thing.

Back in 2022, during promotion for RRR, Rajamouli described the upcoming picture as such: “My next film with Mahesh Babu will be a globetrotting action adventure. It's going to be a kind of James Bond or Indiana Jones film with Indian roots,” the director said in a quote shared by The Hindustan Times. That's definitely the vibe we got from this teaser, and we are already seated if we're getting a kick-ass Bond-meets-Jones spy hero, served in an RRR-style multi-genre seven-layer-cake treat of a movie. The paper also noted that Rajamouli's father, KV Vijayendra, was penning the script. RRR was based on a family story concept that mashed up two historic cultural Indian legends played by N.T. Rama Rao Jr. and Ram Charan, but here they channel action spectacle that also feels a bit like it has Mission Impossible franchise potential.

The poster for what's known as Globetrotter touts a first reveal in November of 2025, and we hope that's on an international scale.

Stay tuned here at io9 for more updates on Globetrotter… if that's what the film is even called by the time we learn more.

Bitcoin recently hit an all-time high of $124,400 and is up 93% from over a year ago. But fans of the cryptocurrency think it can go even higher, and those folks experienced a rollercoaster of emotions on Thursday after Scott Bessent gave conflicting signals about what the U.S. government had planned for the world's most popular cryptocurrency.

Initially, Bessent disappointed Bitcoin fans Thursday morning when he said the U.S. government's so-called strategic Bitcoin reserve, first announced by President Donald Trump in March, would not be stocked with newly purchased Bitcoin anytime soon.

But the Treasury Secretary seemed to reverse course later in the day, sending mixed signals to crypto folks who know that it'll really help juice the price if the Trump regime buys a boat-load of digital money for no good reason.

Bessent was asked about gold during an interview on Fox Business with Maria Bartiromo, and pivoted into talking about Bitcoin, which the White House has argued is important for the future.

“We've also started, to get into the 21st century, a Bitcoin strategic reserve. We're not going to be buying that, but we are going to use confiscated assets and continue to build that up. We're going to stop selling that,” Bessent said.

The Treasury Secretary said that he believed the government's bitcoin holdings were somewhere between $15 billion and $20 billion, lower than previous estimates of $23 billion, as the crypto news outlet Protos notes.

Why would any of this matter to crypto watchers? Because many were disappointed back in March when it turned out that rumors about a “strategic reserve” of crypto meant that the U.S. government wouldn't be actually buying new Bitcoin. The U.S. Department of Justice often seizes crypto during criminal prosecutions, and rather than sell that crypto as it typically does, the Trump regime proposed holding onto it as a “reserve.”

Bessent's comments on Thursday morning seemed to confirm there were no plans to actually buy new Bitcoin, something he probably heard complaints about. Because by the afternoon, Bessent sent a tweet that seemed to contradict what he'd said on Fox Business.

“Bitcoin that has been finally forfeited to the federal government will be the foundation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve that President Trump established in his March Executive Order,” Bessent tweeted. “In addition, Treasury is committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve, and to execute on the President's promise to make the United States the ‘Bitcoin superpower of the world.'”

What does “budget-neutral pathways” mean? That's unclear. But it doesn't close the door on acquiring more Bitcoin in a way that would make the price rise, which is the only thing Bitcoin holders care about. Holding Bitcoin in a “reserve” serves no purpose beyond making it more scarce, thus helping drive up the price.

But the dream for crypto folks is for the U.S. government to inject real U.S. dollars into Bitcoin, artificially inflating the price even more and pushing a kind of free money into the crypto liquidity pool. Because none of this works without real dollars. When those dry up, you're left with little more than digital hopes and dreams.

The U.S. dollar is literally backed by the U.S. military. Bitcoin? It's backed by your faith in its price to keep going up forever.

8/10

Back in 2018, the original Dyson Airwrap (8/10, WIRED Recommends) was in a category of one. Powered by a jet-engine-inspired motor and a physics tendency called the Coanda effect, it offered six ways to style your hair with (supposedly) minimal heat damage. At the time, there was nothing else like it. HairTok and beauty editors everywhere were sold.

But in 2025, the landscape looks different. Dyson now sells three versions of its Airwrap, and the market is saturated with dupes and competitors at a fraction of the price. The latest model, the Co-anda 2x, is its most advanced and most expensive yet, priced at $700. After testing it for several weeks on my long, frizz-prone hair, I can say it's faster, smarter, and easier to use; but it's not necessarily a must-have if you already have a decent multistyler.

Dyson's new Co-anda 2x comes in two finishes—ceramic pink and jasper plum—and is available in two configurations tailored to your hair type: straight+wavy and curly+coily. Both kits come with six attachments and a presentation case. Visually, it looks a lot more like the Airwrap ID than the original Airwrap, and it feels noticeably lighter in hand. The wand itself is slimmer and more compact, which makes it easier to maneuver during longer sessions. The cord length, at 6.56 feet, is still on the shorter side.

The biggest upgrade is Dyson's Hyperdymium 2 motor, which the company claims delivers twice the airflow pressure and 30 percent more power than the previous generation. In practice, it felt fast. I could rough-dry my roots in about three minutes, which is about two minutes faster than usual. The airflow feels similar to the Supersonic r, which is stronger than the original Supersonic dryer and the Nural (9/10, WIRED Recommends).

Each attachment is embedded with RFID chips that auto-adjust heat and airflow based on your last-used settings. Not a revolutionary change, but it is nice not to have to toggle settings every time I switch attachments. You can also pair it with Dyson's app, which offers tutorials based on your hair type and goals. Dyson also moved the fan and heat controls to the base of the handle. It's a cleaner look, but it can get finicky if you're used to adjusting settings mid-styling.

If you've already purchased previous Airwrap attachments, unfortunately, they're not compatible with this new model due to its slimmer design. Also, like most Dyson tools sold in the US, it's 120-volt only, so don't plan on packing it for your Euro vacay.

I used the Co-anda 2x on freshly washed, sometimes air-dried hair for three weeks, cycling through each attachment to see how it held up against its predecessors. I've used the original Airwrap off and on, and I've tested other multistylers, like the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) and the T3 Aire 360 (9/10, WIRED Recommends).

Setup was simple, but there's always a bit of a learning curve with Dyson tools. Pairing with the app was quick, and the RFID tech worked as advertised; each time I swapped attachments, the device adjusted to my last-used settings.

This bundle comes with six attachments: a pre-styling dryer, a round brush, 1.2- and 1.6-inch curling barrels, an anti-snag loop brush, and—my personal favorite—the new Airsmooth straightener. The curly+coily kit swaps in a diffuser and tension comb instead of the Airsmooth and 1.2-inch curling barrel.

What's in the Box?

The Airsmooth straightener impressed me the most. It smoothed and curled my ends into soft C-bends in under 20 minutes. The heat was gentle enough that my hair didn't feel singed afterward. I didn't get flat-iron-level glassiness, but it was close enough for a polished look.

The loop brush and round brush both felt upgraded, with longer bristles that don't snag or tug at damp ends. I got solid volume and frizz control from both, and they felt gentler at my roots. The curling barrels were redesigned with squared-like tips, which makes them easier to grip, but the results were the same: airy curls that deflated within a couple of hours unless I sprayed them stiff with hairspray. That's always been my biggest gripe with the Airwrap. It's better at blowouts than long-lasting curls, and the technology hasn't improved on that front.

What I appreciated most was not having to fiddle with settings every time I swapped attachments. The RFID memory is a small touch, but it makes the whole process smoother.

If you already own an Airwrap or a decent dupe, you don't need to upgrade. The Co-anda 2x is well designed and refined, but the core Dyson experience hasn't dramatically evolved.

But if you don't own a multistyler, and have the budget to spare, this is the version I'd buy. It's faster, more ergonomic, and overall more pleasant to use. It's undeniably expensive, but you get the smoothest Airwrap to date.

100 printers later, lux becomes necessary.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


3D printing technology is evolving at breakneck speed, and features considered cushy add-ons five years ago are now becoming everyday essentials. 3D printer forums used to buzz with questions about necessary mods just to make their machines usable, but now people want to know if they can run their printer from a phone.

I checked my notes, and during my time at Tom's Hardware, I have reviewed one hundred 3D printers, both resin and FDM. I'm well past that number if you also count several machines that we had to pass on due to unforeseen circumstances, or the handful of personal printers I acquired for fun.

The features I look for have evolved over the years, and many that come standard on some new printers used to require you to manually modify your machine. I started printing with the popular 2017 Creality CR10S, which swiftly became well-modded. It needed an upgraded hotend, a Raspberry Pi for Octoprint, Capricorn tubes, a custom spool holder, bed leveling wheels, and, after flinging its glass plate to the floor, a new magnetically attached flexible PEI build plate. I never added a BL Touch for auto leveling because I was so well bonded to that machine that I could tweak it on the fly with baby steps. My Ender 3 Pro has been upgraded with even more mods, including a new motherboard and a cooling system.

Modding your 3D printer was common practice back then, especially if you had an Ender. For many, tricking out a $99 machine was the whole point of getting into the hobby. When I reviewed 2022's new “luxury” Ender 3 S1 Pro, I had to explain that the exorbitant $479 price tag was because it included about $350 worth of mods.



Ironically, my “no mods needed” Ender 3 S1 Pro didn't stay stock for long. These days, it's running a BigTreeTech Klipper pad for speed and a 3D printed nozzle cam for close-up video. It's still my favorite machine for running TPU because it's slow, steady, and has an extruder that grabs filament like a pitbull.

The Ender 3 S1 Pro is a prime example of a pattern I see in 3D printer releases again and again. A new machine launches, looking like the pinnacle of perfection, but give it a year, and manufacturers will come up with something faster, smarter, bigger, or more colorful, and we pull out our wallets once again.

Looking back at these last 100 reviews, I've come up with a list of the best 3D printing mods that have become non-negotiable standards.



If I wanted to scare a group of makers around an evening bonfire, I would weave a tale of blood-curdling horror: 3D printers without auto bed leveling. Boo! If your first printer was a Bambu Lab, you've been spared the pain of manual bed leveling. Budget 3D printers used to have knobs under the bed to “tram” the surface flat in relation to the nozzle. Even early Prusa MK2s with their fancy, built-in PINDA probes might require a “live adjust Z” to perfect the print.

Bed leveling was a tedious process that required a slip of paper to literally feel the space between the nozzle and the bed and guesstimate if the gap was enough. Cheap printers often compounded the problem by shipping with warped beds that needed to be physically shimmed with layers of tape or tinfoil.

Now we have an assortment of probes, sensors, and lasers to analyze a printer's surface and save an accurate bed mesh for future reference.



Getting prints to stick to the bed has always been a struggle for 3D printers. Early machines often had permanently fixed print surfaces, or if you were lucky, a stiff plate clipped in place. Go back a bit further, and printers didn't even have heaters. Plates might be optimized for adhesion, but not removal.

Successfully printing on a glass bed without the use of glue stick, painter's tape, or hairspray was something to brag about. Removing that print, however, took time, a scraper, and sometimes a hammer.

Pioneered by Wham Bam Systems, flexible plates with a variety of coatings for every filament are now the norm. Today, I'd be shocked to find a 3D printer without some kind of miracle-coated flex plate. Since build plates are easily damaged and coating can wear off, there's still a market for replacement plates. I wrote a whole list of my favorite aftermarket build plates here.



Bambu Lab made speedy 3D printers standard, but they were not the first to make 3D printers fast. We can thank Klipper for the original mod, which added extra processing power to the 8-bit boards on early 3D printers through an external Raspberry Pi. Klipper gave machines a performance boost by offloading motion planning to the Pi and adding input shaping and pressure advance for smoother prints at speed.

Programming a Pi was not for everyone, so for a while, we saw a rash of plug-and-play “Klipper Pads” to soup up your bed slinger. My old Ender 3 S1 Pro went from trudging along at 45mm/s to a zippy 150mm/s with this accessory.

Now, manufacturers are putting bigger brains in their machines and using either Klipper or a homebrew version of input shaping. Combined with high flow hotends and massive cooling, we're seeing print speeds from 300 to 500mm/s and beyond. The FLSun S1 can hit an impressive 500mm/s print speed, if you can handle the jet engine noise of its cooling system.



Again, we can thank Bambu Lab for making a popular mod standard issue: remote access. New users would faint at the thought of transferring files from a computer to their printer via a tiny micro SD card. Before Wi-Fi, LAN, and the Cloud became common features, makers would need to use a Raspberry Pi with OctoPrint to send STL files to the machine over their home network. If you were already adding a Pi for Klipper, why not use OctoPrint, too?

Fun Fact: In the early days, Wi-Fi wasn't added because people were too lazy to walk an SD card over to their printer. It was also done because many 3D printers used a cheap Micro SD Card, a tiny sliver of plastic that was easily lost on your desk, in your couch cushions, or in the huge gap between the card slot and the printer case. Gaining remote access to your 3D printer meant never looking for a lost micro SD card again.



I am now infuriated when a new 3D printer doesn't come with a camera for monitoring prints. The horror! After moving my office to a different part of the house, my machines remain a good 40 feet or more from my desk. Even the extremely budget-priced Elegoo Centauri Carbon came with a decent, if poorly lit, camera.

Combined with our new obsession with mobile apps, you can check your print progress from upstairs, the office, or even the grocery store.

Gone are the days of converting security cameras into printing babysitters, though Prusa Research will still let you use an old iPhone to monitor machines through Prusa Connect if you're feeling old school.



3D printing in full, glorious color used to be a pipe dream. And an expensive one at that. In 2021, I dreamed of saving up for a Mosaic Palette, which could feed eight colors to my little Ender 3 Pro. It easily cost as much as three new Enders, and so was out of the question.

I went as far as trying out a crazy mod that used permanent markers to color prints. Needless to say, turning an Ender into a tool changer to draw on your prints was difficult and didn't work well.

Pioneered by Prusa Research and made affordable by Bambu Lab, we now have multicolor systems for nearly every brand of manufacturer. I'm happy to report that printing in 4, 5, or 25 colors is now pretty easy, if not cheap. And with Snapmaker's new tool changer on the horizon, the 3D printing world is turning very colorful indeed.

Ultra-fast, wireless computing.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


In a quiet Cornell University lab, researchers have taken a hammer to decades of digital circuit convention. The result is a silicon chip that thinks less like a clock-driven processor and more like a living brain—only instead of neurons, it uses controlled bursts of microwave energy.

Dubbed the “microwave brain,” this experimental processor can juggle two jobs at once: crunching ultrafast data streams and talking wirelessly, all inside a footprint small enough for a smartwatch. And it does it at just 200 milliwatts, a fraction of the power a comparable digital neural network would consume.

The secret lies in abandoning the step-by-step digital approach. Traditional chips march data through binary logic gates in sync with a clock. Cornell's design instead pushes information through tunable microwave waveguides, letting patterns emerge and be recognized in real time at tens of gigahertz with no waiting or bottlenecks.

Each waveguide acts like a “physical neuron,” where the microwave signal's amplitude, phase, and frequency can be shaped to represent data features. These features interact and interfere with each other in the analog domain, producing a rich set of patterns before the signal is ever digitized. This physical mixing and propagation essentially perform the feature extraction and transformation that digital networks usually achieve through multiple software layers.



The chip's design builds a type of AI framework directly into the hardware, using the natural behavior of microwaves to process incoming data streams. Instead of storing values in memory and repeatedly performing huge numbers of calculations, it lets the microwave network itself handle the heavy lifting. Small adjustable components—such as electronic tuners and signal shifters—can change the pathways inside the chip on the fly, allowing it to switch between different AI tasks without having to retrain from scratch.

In tests, the chip classified wireless signals with 88% accuracy or better, matching the performance of far bulkier digital models. Crucially, that accuracy held steady across both simple and complex jobs, without the extra circuitry and error correction digital systems typically require.

Because the hardware is naturally sensitive to changes in signal behavior, its uses extend beyond AI computation. It could watch for anomalies in wireless traffic, track radar targets, or decode crowded radio channels. With further refinements, the team believes it could even sit inside personal devices, running local AI models without leaning on cloud servers.

The "microwave brain" is still in prototype form. Still, backed by DARPA and the National Science Foundation, the Cornell team is already working on scaling and integrating it into existing microwave and digital systems. If they succeed, the line between computing and communication hardware may soon blur—ushering in an era where your phone's processor is also its antenna, and your watch thinks without ever calling home.

The strain of AI energy demands increases


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new report into the seismic demands of AI data centers on the power grid claims that electricity rates for individuals and small businesses could increase vastly in the face of data center expansion from the likes of Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. The New York Times reports that AI data centers could see their demand on the country's electricity could increase to as much as 12% by 2028, up from just 4% a couple of years ago. Furthermore, high-tech giants are building their own power plants, becoming consumers and producers of electricity in a way that is fundamentally reshaping the U.S. electricity market. According to the report, small businesses and households could see their bills go up disproportionately as a result.

According to the report, in 2023, data centers run by such companies as Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft accounted for 4% of the nation's electricity use, and federal projections indicate that share could climb to 12% by 2028. Since AI processing is far more energy-intensive than streaming or standard cloud workloads, Amazon's chief executive, Andy Jassy, has openly said that power availability is the main bottleneck limiting new data center capacity.

Significant power demand not only creates unprecedented strain on the grid but is even forcing high-tech giants to generate their own power. For now, they use various renewable energy sources, gas turbines, or diesel generators, but going forward, some even plan to run their own nuclear power plants. Already, some sell surplus energy on the wholesale market. Over the past decade, these sales have totaled $2.7 billion, with most revenue generated since 2022. In some regions, their operations match or surpass the scale of established utilities, allowing them to influence both supply and pricing.

Keep in mind that the power usage of AI data centers is also highly volatile, shifting from peak demand to minimal load in seconds with training workloads as they reach checkpoints. Such swings can destabilize the grid, as even a 10% change in voltage or frequency can damage electronics or trip protection systems. If a major facility, such as a Microsoft Azure installation, suddenly reduces consumption, it can trigger cascading shutdowns across the network. For now, this problem has been solved through dummy workloads, but this does not solve the wider power grid expansion challenges.

However, whether hyperscale CSPs generate their own power or buy it from partners, their power requirements necessitate an expansion of the grid. The question is, who will pay for this expansion? If upgrades cannot keep pace, the result could be blackouts, with industrial customers losing access to limited capacity.

The utilities industry warns that tech firms could reserve far more capacity than they ultimately use, leaving ratepayers to cover the cost of unused infrastructure. For example, Unicorn Interests planned to launch a large data center in Virginia in 2013, but delayed opening for four years. Regulators had approved $42 million in substation and transmission upgrades, much of which went unused during the delay, costing nearby customers millions. While another project later offset part of the expense, the incident illustrates the financial risks of overestimated demand.

In Ohio, American Electric Power (AEP) proposed a separate rate category for data centers and cryptocurrency mines, requiring them to pay for at least 85% of their requested capacity whether used or not. Tech companies countered with a 75% take-or-pay commitment, arguing for flexibility and equal treatment with other large industrial users. However, early this year, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio unanimously backed the utility's proposal. Nonetheless, CSPs have since appealed the decision, calling it both unlawful and unreasonable.

The rapid growth in electricity use from AI data centers is set to push power bills higher for households and small businesses, as utilities invest heavily in expanding the grid. This has prompted consumer advocates and lawmakers to question whether ordinary ratepayers should be footing the bill for corporate growth in the AI sector.

Since 2020, average residential electricity prices across the U.S. have climbed more than 30%, according to NYT. They could rise another 8% nationwide by 2030, a study by Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University estimates. Meanwhile, in states like Virginia, an increase could be up to 25%, NYT claims.

In fact, the impact is already being felt in Ohio, where typical households began paying at least $15 more per month starting in June, a jump linked to the added demand from new data centers, according to the report. There is also an unused 500 MW power substation that belongs to AEP, which was supposed to power Intel's Silicon Heartland campus, whose schedule has been pushed back to the next decade, but which could be pulled in if the U.S. government takes a stake in Intel.

In the end, U.S. consumers could end up paying twice for services like ChatGPT — first for the OpenAI subscription, and again for the power grid that keeps Microsoft Azure's servers running OpenAI's machines behind it.

Resistance is futile, this will spark joy!

If the organizing consultant Marie Kondo were assimilated by Star Trek's Borg, you would get me. I am by no means a fully neat and tidy person (I vacuum, I clear tables, wash the dishes, etc), but I like order in the chaos that is life. I like to know where things are. I like First Order Retrievability, a concept made popular by Mythbusters host Adam Savage, where one should maximize efficiency by ensuring frequently used tools/items are immediately available. I know that I can reach into a drawer and pull out the screwdriver that I need to fix something, the microSD cards for a Raspberry Pi, or one of the myriad cables that I refuse to get rid of.

My love of organization led me to Bento3D, a website to create custom, 3D printable trays and boxes. On the site, I can design a tray to exacting specifications, and should I need or want it, I will also design a box with a hinge to store that tray. My goal for this how-to is to show you how I determined the dimensions and created a simple tray, which will form the basis of a PC First Aid Kit that I have put together. That kit guide is another how-to, enabling us to concentrate on creating the organizing tray.

I'm using one of the best budget 3D printers to print my tray, the Elegoo Centauri Carbon. I am also using PETG filament, specifically Elegoo's Rapid PETG, which isn't on our list of best 3D filaments for 3D printing, but it really should be!



Your tray can be for anything; all you need is an idea, some simple measurements, and, of course, a 3D printer!

So let's get organized!

For this project, you will need:

Before we can design anything, we need to work out the dimensions of the 3D printed tray. You'll need to measure where the 3D print will be housed. You can use calipers or a ruler. Don't forget to measure the height of the container. In the case of IKEA furniture, the dimensions are printed on the respective product page.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

1. Measure in millimeters where the 3D print will be placed. Take measurements of the depth, width, and height, and keep a note of these measurements.

2. Double-check the measurements and then take 2mm off for the depth and width. This will rule out any tolerance issues on your 3D printer and help the tray's friction fit into place.

3. Open Bento3D and enter the measurements. You can slide the values to match your requirements, or type them directly into the fields. Note that Bento3D has a quirk where it reports that it cannot update negative sizes; this is caused when you delete the value. Just select and overtype instead of deleting.

We've got the dimensions and our tray/box is before us, so now let's add dividers.

4. Click on Grid.



5. To add a row, click on the bottom +, to add a column, click on the right +.



6. To delete a cell, click on the trash icon for that cell.



7. Split the left column into two rows.



Cells will automatically take up an equally divisible area in the overall dimensions. So the two cells above take up half the depth (longest edge) on the left side. Adding another cell will see the cells take a third of the depth.



What I want is for one cell to be smaller than the other. The smaller cell will be used for microSD cards and USB gadgets. The larger cell will hold screwdriver bits and larger tools.

8. Hover the mouse over the top cell, and blue lines with drop-down menus will appear. Click on the left-hand side menu and select fill (1 / 2). This will reduce the size of the cell so that it takes half of what it did previously. This does not affect the column width; to do that, we must click on the other drop-down menu.



9. Click on the Settings slider to tweak the wall thickness, stackability, and fillet (rounded corners). I set mine to a thickness of 1 and a fillet of 5. This gave me thin walls and rounded corners that enable a friction fit, but with an easy means to remove the tray.



10. Click on Download to view the model. Use the mouse to move the object, zoom in with the scroll wheel.



11. Click on Tray to download the STL file to your PC.



12. Open your preferred slicer software and prepare the tray for printing. On my Elegoo Centauri Carbon it will take under an hour to print using Elegoo's Rapid PETG filament.



Your freshly printed tray is ready to organize your life!

Nature can be equal parts majestic, heartwarming, and terrifying. The winning entries of the 2025 BMC Ecology and Evolution and BMC Zoology image competition illustrate that complexity in spades.

Biologists, zoologists, and paleontologists from across the world sent in submissions to this year's contest. The photos were sorted into four categories: “Collective Social Behavior,” “Life in Motion,” “Colorful Strategies,” and “Research in Action.” But the overall winner (seen in the headline image above) was a snapshot taken by Andrey Giljov, showing two male saiga antelopes in a sparring match as part of their preparation for the mating season; this naturally involves butting heads with potential rivals.

“Saiga fights in spring, outside of the tournament season, are quieter and more about training than determining status. However, the males take every opportunity to practice,” said Giljov, a vertebrate zoologist and senior lecturer at Saint Petersburg State University in Russia, in an editorial detailing the contest winners.

The annual photo competition, now in its second year, is a joint venture from the journals BMC Ecology and Evolution and BMC Zoology; it's the successor to contests that were separately run by the two journals. The photos are judged by the journals' editors and senior members of the editorial board. This year's winning entries and close seconds featured some of the biggest creatures on Earth as well as its smallest.

Case in point, Alwin Hardenbol's incredible photo of a breaching humpback whale that he captured from a rigid inflatable boat in Varanger, Norway.

“Breaching is a fascinating behavior from a scientific perspective, as it is still inconclusive what purpose it serves,” said Hardenbol, a researcher at the Natural Resources Institute Finland whose photo was a runner-up in the Life in Motion category. “It's unbelievable to imagine how such an animal can even jump out of the water like that.”

Sritam Kumar Sethy, a student at Berhampur University in India, won the Collective Social Behavior category for his photograph of newly hatched Acanthocoris scaber (a species of leaf-footed bug) nymphs gathering together on the underside of a leaf—a survival strategy of having strength in numbers. “By coming together, they enhance their protection against predators, reducing the chances of any individual becoming prey,” said Sethy.

The entries also captured the never-ending struggle for resources between animals, such as Delip K. Das's photo of a Haliastur indus (a medium-sized bird of prey also called a Brahminy Kite) having to go the extra mile for its dinner.

“A Brahminy Kite had just caught an eel—a large and still-struggling fish. As the Kite wrestled to secure its catch in flight, another challenger appeared, attempting to hijack the meal,” said Das, whose entry didn't win but was singled out as highly commended. “The dramatic moment unfolded above the mangrove-fringed waters, reflecting the intensity and agility of raptors in the wild.”

Some images didn't highlight the present state of the natural world but its distant past. Digital artist Natalia Jagielsk won the Life in Motion category for her illustration of pterosaurs flying over the Jurassic Hebridean Basin, covering what's now called Scotland. Jagielsk, a postdoctoral fellow at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, based her work on the recent discovery of two pterosaur skeletons belonging to different species in the region.

“Despite their differing cranial anatomies, teeth morphology, and wing shapes, these pterosaurs could interact and compete for food during periods of environmental stress,” said Jagielsk, who was part of a team that described one of these species, Dearc sgiathanach. “Set 170 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic, this image portrays these flying reptiles as they hunt along the shoreline.”

My personal favorite selection is either endearing, gross, or both, depending on your tolerance for bugs and regurgitating. Nick Royle, a runner-up in the Collective and Social Behavior category, took a photo of a mother Nicrophorus vespilloides (a species of burying beetle) feeding her young—by which I mean, spitting back up the remnants of a buried mouse carcass. In addition to this unique feeding strategy, burying beetles are also one of the few insects that often share custody of their offspring, with both parents helping out with the rearing.

“This behavior normally occurs underground, so is not usually visible to us, but is here pictured in the lab, where these burying beetles are used as a model to understand the evolution of social behaviors such as parental care,” said Royle, a behavioral ecologist and conservation biologist at the University of Exeter in the UK. “These beetles work together to bury carcasses to avoid competition from other users of carrion and, once safely underground, process the carcass, removing the fur, rolling it into a ball, and smearing it with antimicrobial secretions to combat the bacteria and fungi that would otherwise consume this precious resource.”

Well, I'm certainly going to appreciate my parents' home-cooked meals more from now on.

There are plenty more breathtaking images from this year's contest that can be seen here.

Although the fluorescence timescale is suitable for monitoring numerous biological processes, certain processes often require monitoring over extended durations. To access intrinsic amino acids, such as tryptophan, as probes, the UV excitation wavelengths for pulsed phosphorescence measurements have long been the preserve of low-repetition-rate gas-filled lamps or larger laser systems.

Recent advancements have enabled the use of interchangeable semiconductor diodes, known for their simplicity. SpectraLEDs (Figure 1), which offer spectral coverage from the UV to the near-IR, are ideal for such measurements and have been previously applied in studies of lanthanides and singlet oxygen (refer to Application Notes TRFA‐4, ‐6, ‐11, and ‐12). Unlike xenon flashlamps, these sources do not exhibit a “tail” and can run at elevated repetition rates (several kHz).

These sources can attach directly to DeltaHub or FluoroHub timing electronics, with repetition rate automatically adjusting to the selected time range via the DataStation measurement software. This software also manages the duty cycle and temporal position of their output as needed to align with sample settings.

Measurements were conducted utilizing the DeltaFlex system, equipped with either a SpectraLED S‐295 or DeltaDiode DD‐295 excitation source for phosphorescence (44 ms range) and fluorescence lifetime (100 ns range) measurements, respectively. Data was analyzed using DAS6 as the sum of exponentials, presenting either the relative amplitudes (or fractionals, fi) or normalized pre‐exponentials (αi). The main governing equations are listed below:

Sum of exponentials



The contribution of each emitting species can be represented as either a normalized pre‐exponential (α) or relative amplitude (or fractional, f).



Here, the average lifetime can be represented:

τave = Σαiτi

Treated data was plotted utilizing FluorEssence software based on Origin. Despite singlet-state excitation, the phosphorescence emission appeared at extended wavelengths compared to the fluorescence emission. Potassium iodide and sodium sulfite were added to the HSA solution as deoxygenators to observe RT phosphorescence from tryptophan.

Research has demonstrated that HSA experiences multiple reversible structural changes before irreversibly denaturing above ~75 °C. To determine whether the time‐resolved tryptophan decay was affected by this, a temperature study was conducted, tracking its fluorescence. As anticipated, the decay required the sum of three exponentials to fit the data. Results are presented in Figure 2.



Figure 2. Effect of temperature on the time‐resolved decay of tryptophan in HSA, with exponential analysis showing normalized pre‐exponentials (αi, 1 relates to shortest‐lived, 3 to longest) and average lifetime, <τ>. Image Credit: HORIBA

This analysis method reveals a clear change in fluorescence as temperature increases. Overall lifetime decreases, along with a change in the contribution of individual lifetimes to the emission. In practice, selecting an ideal analysis model depends on the system under study and the process to be monitored.

The phosphorescence emission wavelength is red-shifted relative to the fluorescence. Here, the phosphorescence decays, collected at 450 nm, were measured across a similar temperature range, with outcomes illustrated in Figure 3.



Figure 3. Time‐resolved phosphorescence data, showing the fractional contributions (fi, 1 shortest‐lived, 3 longest‐lived) and the average lifetime. Image Credit: HORIBA

These findings provide evidence for the existence of multiple emitting species, with average lifetime and relative contribution varying with temperature. The average lifetime trend reflects other studies showing transitions related to thermally-induced conformational changes.

The measurements presented in this article validate the DeltaFlex's capability, equipped with multiple excitation sources, to track both fluorescence and phosphorescence of tryptophan in human serum albumin.

The impact of temperature on tryptophan decay kinetics is evident in the analysis and is most noticeable in the phosphorescence dataset. This highlights the potential of this measurement method for studying this protein. The measurements presented in this study are based on those by K. Sagoo et al. Spectrochim. Acta A, 124 (2014) 611–617.

New research reveals how common respiratory viruses can flip dormant breast cancer cells back into growth mode, uncovering an immune-driven pathway that heightens relapse risk and pointing to new prevention strategies.

In a recent study published in Nature, an international team of researchers showed that respiratory viral infections awaken dormant breast cancer cells in the lungs.

Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in females and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States (US). Disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) can remain dormant for years after initial remission before metastatic relapse. The tumor microenvironment and cell-intrinsic factors determine whether metastatic cells progress or remain dormant. Notably, microenvironmental disturbances can be sufficient to increase metastasis.

Respiratory viral infections are common, with seasonal flu affecting over one billion people yearly. These infections are usually associated with pulmonary inflammation along with an increase in inflammatory cytokines (interferons [IFNs] and interleukin 6 [IL-6]) and expansion of immune cells, such as macrophages, T cells, and neutrophils. Such inflammatory mechanisms have been reported as regulators of metastatic processes.

In the present study, researchers examined the effects of respiratory viral infections on breast cancer dormancy in mice. First, they used a mouse model of breast DCC dormancy, MMTV-Her2, to explore the effects of influenza A virus (IAV) on the awakening of dormant DCCs. Mice were infected with a sub-lethal dose of IAV; both MMTV-Her2 and wild-type mice showed comparable inflammatory response and viral clearance kinetics.

Lungs were harvested at several time points and assessed for the abundance of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) cells. Before infection, a few isolated DCCs or clusters of DCCs were detected. Nevertheless, metastatic burden increased by up to 1,000-fold between three and 15 days post-infection (dpi). The number of HER2+ cells remained elevated at 28 and 60 dpi and was still detectable nine months later.

There were no changes in Ki67+HER2+ cells in mammary glands, and qPCR of blood samples showed no increase in circulating cancer cells, suggesting that the increase in HER2+ cells in the lungs was not derived from elevated seeding of cancer cells in mammary glands.

Further, the team observed a significant increase in HER2+ cells expressing Ki67 at 3 dpi. Although Ki67-expressing HER2+ cells decreased by 15 dpi, the number of these cells remained elevated at 60 dpi compared to baseline.

Dormant DCCs maintain a mesenchymal-like state (vimentin-positive) and undergo an epithelial shift (epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive [EpCAM+]) during dormancy exit. Most dormant DCCs in uninfected lungs were vimentin+. While the percentage of vimentin+ HER2+ cells was not affected early in infection (3 to 6 dpi), it decreased to 50% by 9 dpi and less than 20% by 28 dpi. In contrast, a fraction of HER2+ cells showed EpCAM expression by 3 dpi.

Moreover, while most HER2+ cells lost EpCAM positivity after 6 dpi, the percentage of EpCAM+ HER+ cells remained elevated. Thus, IAV infection induced a transient epithelial shift, creating a unique hybrid and proliferative phenotype that retained some mesenchymal marker expression, allowing dormant DCC awakening.

RNA-seq analyses showed activation of inflammatory (IL-6–JAK–STAT3), angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix–remodelling pathways, including collagen crosslinking and metalloproteinase activity, which are known to support tumour growth.

The authors also reported shifts in the tumour microenvironment, including extracellular matrix changes and angiogenic signalling, that could help sustain awakened DCCs. The team also noted the activation of the IL-6 signaling pathway in DCCs post-infection. Further investigations indicated that infection-triggered IL-6 was key in mediating initial dormant DCC awakening.

The researchers identified a two-phase process: first, IL-6 drives the switch from a mesenchymal to a hybrid phenotype and fuels rapid expansion; later, after T-cell recruitment, CD4+ T cells sustain the awakened DCC population. During this second phase, CD4+ cells partly maintain DCCs by suppressing CD8+ immune responses.

Gene expression profiling revealed that CD4+ cells in tumour-bearing mice had reduced mitochondrial content, a bias toward a memory phenotype, and lower effector function, further limiting CD8+ cytotoxicity.

The study also found that depleting CD4+ cells restored CD8+ cell mitochondrial content and effector activity, leading to more effective elimination of DCCs.

Next, the team investigated whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can awaken dormant DCCs. To this end, a mouse-adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) strain (MA10) was used. MA10 infection triggered the production of IFNα and IL-6 in the lungs.

Besides, MA10 infection resulted in a notable increase in HER2+ cells by 28 dpi. Moreover, there was a stepwise increase in the number of HER2+ cells and Ki67+HER2+ cells following MA10 infection, with reductions in vimentin positivity and transient increases in EpCAM positivity. Consistently, these changes required IL-6, as changes associated with MA10 infection were significantly reduced in IL-6 knockout mice.

Further, the researchers analyzed data from the United Kingdom Biobank (UKB) to assess whether a positive SARS-CoV-2 test was associated with a higher risk of mortality among cancer survivors. In a UKB population followed up until December 2022, which included 4,837 individuals with a cancer diagnosis before 2015, 413 deaths were recorded. These included 115 and 298 deaths, those who tested positive and negative for SARS-CoV-2, respectively, yielding an odds ratio (OR) of 4.5.

Even after excluding COVID-19-attributed deaths, test-positive individuals still had higher mortality, with an OR of 2.56. There was a nearly two-fold increase in cancer mortality (OR: 1.85) in test-positive individuals compared to test-negative participants.

The data showed that the association was strongest in the months immediately after infection and weakened over time, mirroring the early rapid expansion of DCCs seen in the mouse models. The team observed elevated risks for all-cause, non-COVID-19, and cancer mortality among participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to those who tested negative.

Finally, the Flatiron Health Database was used to evaluate whether females with breast cancer experienced a higher risk of metastatic progression to the lungs after COVID-19. Females with COVID-19 after breast cancer diagnosis had a hazard ratio of 1.44 for subsequent diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer, adjusted for age, race, and ethnicity. After additional adjustment for breast cancer subtype and comorbidities, the hazard ratio was 1.41 and no longer statistically significant, although the direction of effect was consistent.

The results indicate that respiratory viral infections promote awakening and expansion of dormant cancer cells. An IL-6-dependent switch from a mesenchymal state to a hybrid phenotype promotes expansion, followed by the establishment of CD4+ niches that inhibit DCC elimination.

These niches also impair CD8+ antitumour activity by altering immune cell metabolism and effector potential. Other immune cell populations, including macrophages, also showed phenotype shifts toward a tumour-supportive state.

Overall, these data reveal how pulmonary viral infections elevate cancer recurrence risk, with both mouse and human data showing the greatest risk in the early period after infection, underscoring the need for strategies to alleviate the increased risk of associated metastatic progression.

Scientists say high-dose almond intake could help shield your cells from oxidative harm while enhancing your body's natural defense systems, but the benefits depend on the dose and how the nuts are prepared.

Study: The impact of almond supplementation on oxidative stress biomarkers: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials. Image Credit: shine.graphics / Shutterstock

In a recent systematic review published in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers collated, synthesized, and meta-analyzed the results of eight clinical trials to validate and elucidate the impacts of almond supplementation in adults.

Review findings reveal a dose-dependent relationship wherein consuming over 60 grams (g) of almonds daily was observed to significantly reduce certain markers of cellular damage (notably MDA and 8-OHdG) and, in some analyses, improve the body's antioxidant enzymes (SOD overall, though not significantly in the >60 g/day subgroup).

These results support the role of almonds as a potential functional food for managing oxidative stress, though the authors emphasize that more standardized trials are needed before considering public health policy recommendations, particularly given the high variability in results and the influence of factors such as almond preparation, baseline oxidative stress status, and participant characteristics.

Raw vs. roasted matters: Processing significantly impacts almonds' antioxidants; roasting degrades heat-sensitive polyphenols by about 26%, reducing their bioavailability compared to raw nuts.

Cells are under constant attack from reactive oxygen species (ROS), unstable molecules that are known to damage lipids, proteins, and even DNA, resulting in mutations and associated diseases. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between these damaging free radicals and the body's antioxidant defences, exacerbated by environmental pollution and poor behavioral choices (e.g., suboptimal diets and smoking).

Over time, this ROS-mediated cellular damage accumulates and has been identified as a leading cause of chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, cancers, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Current oxidative stress investigations involve the estimation of biomarkers like malondialdehyde (MDA) for lipid damage, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) for DNA damage, and antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD) as evidence for patient antioxidant performance. Despite these surveillance and diagnostic techniques, the global burden of oxidative stress continues to rise.

Almonds (specifically, the fruits of the Prunus amygdalus or Prunus dulcis tree) are rich in protective antioxidant compounds, including vitamin E, polyphenols, and healthy monounsaturated fats, making them a promising dietary tool to combat oxidative stress. While previous studies have been encouraging, their limited sample sizes made findings confounding and ungeneralizable, requiring a comprehensive analysis to consolidate their cumulative evidence.

Blanching removes key benefits: Crucially, the beneficial polyphenols concentrated in almond skins are virtually eliminated when almonds are blanched before consumption or processing.

The present systematic review addresses this knowledge gap by collating and reanalyzing data from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed at quantifying the effect of almond consumption on oxidative stress. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

The comprehensive literature search comprised a custom keyword search of several online scientific repositories, including Scopus, PubMed/Medline, and the Web of Science from database initiation till January 2025. A two-phase screening process was employed to identify only publications examining adults (≥ 18 years), where almond supplementation of any form was the intervention, and outcomes were reported using oxidation status biomarkers. Any RCTs or crossover trials meeting these criteria were included in subsequent analyses.

Extracted data included estimates of key biomarkers, and analyses leveraged a random-effects model to pool the results and calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD; overall effect). Crucially, subgroup analysis was conducted to determine if the dose of almonds, specifically, less than or more than 60 grams daily, influenced observed outcomes.

Gut connection: Almond fiber doesn't just aid digestion; it promotes gut bacteria like Bifidobacterium, which produce compounds helping reduce overall body-wide oxidative stress.

Title, abstract, and full text screening identified eight high-quality trials (five parallel RCTs and three crossover trials) that met inclusion criteria (n = 424 participants). Summary statistics revealed that the included study populations were diverse, including healthy individuals, smokers, and patients with chronic diseases. The almond interventions varied in dose, ranging from 5 to 168 grams daily, and lasted between four and 24 weeks.

Meta-analysis outcomes revealed that the antioxidant effects of almonds are partly dose dependent. While lower doses showed minimal impact, supplementation with 60 grams or more daily (~2 large handfuls) produced significant improvements in specific key biomarkers, particularly those indicative of cellular damage (MDA and 8-OHdG).

Levels of MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation, were reduced by a weighted mean difference of -0.46 (p = 0.002) in the high-dose subgroup, and 8-OHdG, a marker of oxidative DNA damage, was lowered by -5.83 (p < 0.001). In addition, the body's endogenous antioxidant defenses were observed to be improved overall, with SOD activity increasing by 2.02 (p = 0.008) in the pooled analysis, though the >60 g/day subgroup did not reach statistical significance.

Almond consumption also led to a small but significant reduction in uric acid levels (WMD = -0.64, p = 0.009), which the authors suggest may be related to inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity, a key source of uric acid and reactive oxygen species. Its impact on glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was not statistically significant. Notably, heterogeneity evaluations established a high degree of variability across the studies for some outcomes (I² > 90%), implying that differences in study design, almond preparation (raw vs. roasted, blanched vs. unblanched), loss of polyphenols from skin removal, potential genetic variability in antioxidant enzyme responses, and interactions between almond fiber and polyphenols influencing gut microbiota and systemic oxidative status likely contributed to inconsistent results.

This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that almond supplementation can help manage oxidative stress, particularly for some biomarkers, and that benefits for MDA may be more evident at doses higher than 60 grams per day. Not all biomarkers responded in a dose-dependent manner, and SOD improvements were observed overall but not significantly in the high-dose subgroup.

These findings support the classification of almonds as a potential functional food. Still, the high variability between studies highlights a critical need for future research. The authors call for more standardized trials to pinpoint almonds' optimal dosage, duration, and form to maximize their antioxidant benefits, ideally using consistent almond preparation methods and stratifying participants by baseline oxidative stress levels to better target populations most likely to benefit.

A long-running study of nearly 80,000 people shows that plant-based eating offers broad cancer protection, with benefits spanning from the digestive tract to hormone-related cancers, without raising risk for any type.

A recent study in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition investigated the associations between different types of vegetarian diets and the risk of cancer at various bodily sites.

A vegetarian diet is a dietary pattern that generally focuses on higher intake of vegetables, fruit, nuts, and legumes while limiting or excluding meat. In contrast, the Western diet is characterized by high intake of refined grains, processed food, red meat, and sugary drinks.

A high intake of fruits and vegetables leads to increased exposure to phytoconstituents that possess anticancer effects. Furthermore, the exclusion of meat intake in a vegetarian diet decreases the risk of obesity, which has been linked to many cancer types. Although the association between vegetarian dietary habits and cancers at various bodily sites has remained controversial, a few robust links have been established. For instance, both processed and unprocessed red meat consumption has been linked with increased risk of colorectal cancers.

Previous publications from the group behind this study indicated a protective association between a vegetarian diet and common cancers, such as colorectal, breast, and prostate. However, more research is needed to link a vegetarian diet with less common cancer types.

The current study examined the Adventist Health Study-2 (AHS-2) cohort to investigate the association between a vegetarian dietary pattern and less common cancers. This study focuses on building on the knowledge regarding the benefits of vegetarian diets across a broader range of cancer types.

The AHS-2 cohort recruited participants from the United States and Canada between 2002 and 2007. Out of the 95,863 enrolled participants, approximately 26,000 were Black, which enabled scientists to focus on this minority group as well. Participants were screened based on eligibility criteria and the availability of complete data relevant to this study.

All participants completed a comprehensive questionnaire about their dietary patterns, and were divided into different groups based on their answers. Participants were assigned to one of the following groups: vegans, lacto-ovo-vegetarians, pesco-vegetarians, semi-vegetarians, or non-vegetarians.

Participants who avoided all animal products were included in the vegan group, while those who avoided all flesh (meat or fish) foods but consumed eggs and dairy were assigned to the lacto-ovo-vegetarian group. Similarly, pesco-vegetarians were defined as lacto-ovo-vegetarians who also consumed fish at least once a month, while semi-vegetarians ate non-fish flesh foods infrequently (at least once a month but less than once a week).

The authors matched AHS-2 data to all United States state cancer registries except Maine and three Canadian provincial registries to identify new cancer diagnoses. For each cancer site, participants were stratified for age, gender, education, and past and present cancer screening habits.

A total of 79,468 participants met the eligibility criteria, comprising 26% Black and 65% female participants. The current study enabled an average of 7.9 years of follow-up per participant. The marginal standardization method was used to compare vegetarians to non-vegetarian participants, after adjusting for age, sex, and race.

Except for the family history of breast cancer, the study observed considerable differences within groups. For instance, a greater proportion of vegetarians were older, were less likely to use contraceptives, were less likely to undergo postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, had breastfed infants a little longer, and were more educated.

The current study indicated differences between vegetarians and non-vegetarians were near-null or favored vegetarians for all cancer types, except perhaps myeloma. In comparison to Adventist non-vegetarians, all vegetarian diets were associated with a reduced risk of both total (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.88) and medium-frequency cancers (HR: 0.82).

The authors noted that adjusting for Body Mass Index (BMI) slightly weakened these protective associations, suggesting that lower body weight among vegetarians partially mediates these benefits. It is notable that even the non-vegetarian Adventists in the study are a health-conscious group, consuming less meat and alcohol than the general population, which may mean the protective effects of vegetarian diets could be even more pronounced when compared to a typical Western diet.

Different vegetarian diets have been shown to independently influence specific types of cancer. For example, a vegan diet was linked to a lower incidence of breast and prostate cancers at younger ages, though the protective association for prostate cancer was not observed in older men. Pesco-vegetarians were at a lower risk of colorectal cancer (a finding also significant for all vegetarians combined, HR: 0.79) and breast cancer at older ages.

A significantly lower risk for lymphoproliferative cancers (which include lymphomas) was observed in vegetarians (HR: 0.75), with lacto-ovo-vegetarians and, in some age groups, vegans showing a lower risk.

The risk of stomach cancer was significantly lower among all vegetarians combined (HR: 0.55), with the paper noting this was also seen in lacto-ovo-vegetarians. Some of these site-specific findings were based on relatively small case numbers and should be interpreted with caution. Further research is needed to determine whether a vegetarian diet affects the risk of pancreatic, lung, and ovarian cancers.

The current study highlighted the benefits of a vegetarian diet in lowering the risk of several cancers. No evidence has indicated that a vegetarian dietary pattern increases the risk of any cancer.

The authors indicated several limitations of the current study. For instance, relatively small numbers of less common cancers could be linked with vegans and pesco-vegetarians. The authors also noted that dietary information was only collected at the beginning of the study and not during the follow-up period. Future studies must interpret the findings of the current study, taking into consideration the particular racial mix of the AHS-2 cohort.

By measuring subtle changes in voice quality, AI could help doctors detect dangerous vocal fold lesions before symptoms worsen.

Study: Voice as a biomarker: exploratory analysis for benign and malignant vocal fold lesions. Image Credit: 3dMediSphere / Shutterstock

An exploratory study reveals that subtle changes in voice patterns, especially variability in harmonic-to-noise ratio, could serve as early warning signs of vocal fold lesions, paving the way for future AI-powered screening tools.

A new study led by Oregon Health and Science University and Portland State University researchers identified distinct vocal features that may serve as potential biomarkers for early detection of benign and malignant vocal fold lesions. The study is published in the journal Frontiers in Digital Health.

Alterations in voice pitch, loudness, and quality characterize vocal disorders. Various factors can potentially trigger these disorders, including vocal fold pathology, neurologic conditions, or functional voice use patterns.

Individuals with voice disorders often experience poor quality of life, low self-esteem, work-related difficulties, and social isolation. These experiences are particularly more pronounced among individuals whose professional roles significantly depend on voice communication.

Both benign and malignant vocal fold lesions (laryngeal cancer) are associated with voice disorders. While benign lesions substantially affect voice quality and cause morbidity, malignant lesions are often life-threatening if left untreated.

Dysphonia (a condition characterized by abnormal voice) is one of the first symptoms of vocal fold lesions, which requires a diagnostic process including visualization of the larynx and assessment of the lesion's morphology through video endoscopy. The larynx is an anatomical structure in the neck where vocal folds are located.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have facilitated human voice analysis for early detection of a variety of health conditions, including laryngeal pathology, neurological and psychological disorders, head and neck cancers, and diabetes.

The use of voice as a digital biomarker provides a promising platform for non-invasive detection and screening of these potentially life-threatening conditions. The Voice to AI project, as part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) consortium, aims to analyze voice as a biomarker of health for use in clinical care.

In the current study, researchers analyzed the Bridge2AI-Voice dataset to identify specific acoustic features that effectively distinguish laryngeal cancer and benign vocal fold lesions from other vocal pathologies and healthy voice function. Acoustic features refer to measurable voice properties, including pitch, loudness, and quality.

The dataset analyzed in the study includes 12,523 recordings of 306 participants collected across five sites in North America. Acoustic analyses focused on Rainbow Passage recordings (180 recordings from 176 participants) with features pre-extracted using openSMILE software. The main aim of the study was the identification of acoustic features that can distinguish the voices of participants with vocal fold lesions from those without any vocal disorders, as well as distinguish the voices of participants with lesions from those with other vocal disorders.

The participants were categorized into two groups based on lesion type and vocal disorder diagnosis. The first group included participants with laryngeal cancer, benign lesions, or no voice disorder, and the second group included participants with laryngeal cancer or benign lesions without other voice disorders, as well as those with other vocal disorders (spasmodic dysphonia or vocal fold paralysis). Transgender participants were excluded from sex-stratified analyses because prior voice-altering care could not be verified.

Four acoustic features plus the variability (standard deviation) of HNR, fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR) were extracted from the voice recordings of participants for comparative analysis. Fundamental frequency refers to the frequency at which the vocal cords vibrate; jitter is the measure of fundamental frequency fluctuations; shimmer is the measure of fluctuations in the amplitude of sound waves; and HNR is the ratio of the periodic to aperiodic component in a speech signal.

The analysis of acoustic features revealed that participants with benign lesions have significantly different mean HNR and fundamental frequency compared to those without any voice disorder, and significantly different HNR variability (SD) compared to laryngeal cancer. HNR variability (SD) was not significantly different between benign lesions and no voice disorder. Mean HNR and fundamental frequency did not differ significantly between benign lesions and laryngeal cancer.

The gender-related comparison revealed in cisgender men similar differences in mean HNR and HNR variability vs no voice disorder and HNR variability vs laryngeal cancer, but not in female participants, which might be due to the smaller sample size.

No significant differences were found for jitter or shimmer in any comparison, and no acoustic feature significantly distinguished lesion groups from other vocal disorders in the second analysis group.

The study identifies harmonic-to-noise ratio variability (standard deviation) as a promising voice-related biomarker for early detection and monitoring of vocal fold lesions. The periodic component of this ratio arises from regular glottal pulses during phonation, and the aperiodic component is the noise produced from turbulence as air flows through the glottis (the center of the larynx).

Both the mean and the standard deviation of the harmonic-to-noise ratio were measured in the study, as the researchers believed that this variability would help measure consistency in vocal production. The observed differences in standard deviation between benign and malignant lesion groups suggest that this feature may serve as a useful marker for monitoring lesion progression and detecting laryngeal cancer at an early stage.

However, the study could not detect significant differences in the harmonic-to-noise ratio and its variability between participants with benign or malignant lesions and those with other vocal disorders. This indicates that distinguishing lesions from other vocal pathologies may be more challenging.

Notably, the study could not detect significant differences in the harmonic-to-noise ratio and its variability among female participants. This highlights the need for analyzing additional acoustic features in order to consider voice as a promising early indicator of vocal fold lesions.

The authors emphasise that these are exploratory findings and do not constitute a validated screening test. They call for larger, more diverse cohorts and additional acoustic features to be assessed, particularly in women, before integration into clinical tools.

Overall, the study findings highlight the future potential of validated AI-based voice screening tools to identify individuals with subtle voice changes who may not otherwise seek care, especially in primary care or telehealth settings. Such tools could prompt earlier referrals to voice specialists, help prioritize urgent cases, and reduce diagnostic delays.

We are evil, but you respect us? That makes no sense at all. 

Let me set this all up. On the latest episode of the "Pulisic" series on Paramount+, Christian Pulisic (along with Tim Weah and Christian's father, Mark Pulisic) talked about criticism and comments made by former USMNT players-turned-pundits. 

Like myself. 

Here's what Christian said: 

"I'd say the most annoying thing, and for me, the biggest cop-out of all time, is when all the pundits want to say: 'They didn't want it. They didn't have the heart. You know, back in our day, we would fight, and we would die on that field.'"

And what Weah said: 

"I think those guys are chasing clicks, and for me, I just feel like they're really evil, honestly, because they've been players, and they know what it's like when you're getting bashed. Those are the same guys that will turn around and shake your hand and try to be friendly with you at the end of the day. Don't get me wrong, I respect all of them. They were players I looked up to, but quite frankly, the guys before didn't win anything either."

And then what Mark Pulisic said: 

"These guys want clicks on social media and subscribe to [their] channels, listen to [their] podcasts or whatever. I think they should look in the mirror and look at their last performances for the national team before they start talking s---."

First and foremost, if you're going to accuse people of doing things for clicks and for attention or to watch a show, well played. That's exactly what you just did, and it's exactly what happened.

A few things, though, about the comments. Number one: We are evil? That's a whole other level. I don't feel evil. I don't think that I am, and I don't think that any of the other guys that you may have been referring to are evil in our criticism. But if they were, I sure as hell wouldn't respect them.

The "Pulisic" clip showed Landon Donovan, a USMNT legend who has shared his thoughts about the current team. Well, Donovan was part of the best U.S. World Cup team in history – they were a possible handball away from going to a semifinal in 2002. He also has a statue outside the LA Galaxy's stadium. So, Donovan surely has done a lot more than any of these players have ever done with the team. 

Also, don't bring your dad to a fight. I get that Mark Pulisic, like other dads out there, has been involved directly in bringing up, in this case, Christian. I get that he's a former coach. But who brings their dad to a fight? If you're angry at me or Landon or anybody else that is being critical of you, that's fine. You have a platform, you have a microphone – some would say bigger than anybody else out there – to get that off your chest, but you don't need to bring your dad. 

Never once has it even occurred to have my father defend me from the slings and arrows that are inevitable but well done. You got me to watch, and you got exactly what you wanted.

For a team that has produced so much angst and concern over what's happening on and off the field, you should be doing anything to get into the good graces of an American public that is dying to love you and support you. Everything that you do that possibly puts you in a negative light and makes you look like the babies or the weaklings that you are accusing others of labeling you as. That's the problem. 

You can correct it ultimately on the field, and that's where the road meets the road. That's where your legacy, whatever it ends up being. You should be so lucky that it is even close to Landon Donovan – and that's where it's going to happen next summer at the World Cup.

The B.C. Lions and Toronto Argonauts will spend the first half of the 2026 CFL season as road warriors.

Both the Lions and Argos will play home games away from their respective venues during FIFA's World Cup. Soccer's men's world championship will be held from June 11 to July 19 with contests in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Vancouver and Toronto will combine to host 13 matches. Toronto's BMO Field will stage six, including Canada's first-ever World Cup game on home soil June 12.

Seven games will be played at Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium, including Canada's group matches June 18 and 24. The first contest at the venue is slated for July 13 with Vancouver also hosting knockout stage games July 2 (round of 32) and July 7 (round of 16).

What's more, the World Cup takes over the venues for its games 30 days before the first match at that stadium.

On Friday, the CFL announced the Argos will play home games at Hamilton Stadium, Mosaic Stadium in Regina and Winnipeg's Princess Auto Stadium against the host teams during the World Cup.



The Lions will relocate for two home games, with the club planning to announce those details at a later time. The Argos will also unveil further details in the future.

The full '26 CFL schedule is scheduled to be released in the off-season. The 2025 campaign ends with the Grey Cup on Nov. 16 at Princess Auto Stadium.

“The World Cup is a cultural event, uniting entire countries and communities under a single flag,” CFL commissioner Stewart Johnston said in a statement. “As Toronto and Vancouver welcome the world, we're grateful to other cities and their tremendous fans for so generously making a home away from home for the Argonauts and the Lions.”

Construction at BMO Field in preparation for the World Cup began after the '24 CFL season and most noticeable has been the installation of four LED scoreboards, one in each corner of the stadium.

As well, a new temporary playing surface has been installed, with another planned specifically for the World Cup in 2026.

BMO Field's seating capacity will be increased to 45,736 for the World Cup from 28,180. There will also be enhancements made to the audio systems, an expansion of the wifi throughout and a new north-end pavilion that's currently under construction.

Following the World Cup, BMO Field will require time to be retrofitted back to CFL standards.

“To our incredible fans in Toronto: your passion and loyalty mean the world to us," said Argos GM Mike (Pinball) Clemons. "This temporary move is about showcasing our city and stadium to the world — and when we return, it'll be with even more energy, excitement and noise!”

Last season, Toronto had an average attendance of 15,127 as it marched to a second Grey Cup title in three seasons. That figure has dipped to 13,838 as the Argos (2-7) have struggled thus far and there's history to suggest the prospect of having to play home games out of town next year won't help the franchise's fortunes.

In 2015, the Pan American Games and Toronto Blue Jays' playoff run forced Toronto to play three home games on the road (one in Ottawa, two in Hamilton). That was after opening that season in Fort McMurray, Alta., as the home team versus the then Edmonton Eskimos.

A total of 4,900 spectators watched Toronto defeat Edmonton 26-11 in Fort McMurray on June 27. And 15,011 fans took in the Argos' 38-35 "home" win over the Redblacks on Oct. 6, a Tuesday night.

But only 3,401 attended Toronto's 27-15 loss to Calgary in Hamilton on Oct. 17 (Saturday afternoon) and 3,741 were on hand for the club's 34-2 defeat to Montreal on Oct. 23 (a Friday night).

Despite only playing five times at Rogers Centre — Toronto's home venue at the time — the Argos finished third in the East with a 10-8 record before suffering a 25-22 setback to Hamilton in the division semifinal before a Tim Hortons Field gathering of 24,029.

The big difference in 2026, though, will be Toronto playing its road home games against the local teams, which should be a more attractive draw for fans in those cities.

The CFL added that both the Argos' and Lions' schedules next season will be made to re-establish home-field advantage for the second half of the 2026 campaign.

This will mark the first time the World Cup will be hosted by three countries as 48 teams from six confederations are slated to participate in the global event. Games will be played in a total of 16 cities (11 in the U.S., three in Mexico and two in Canada).

Vancouver will be in the West Region along with Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area and Seattle. Toronto is in the East Region along with Atlanta, Boston, Miami, Philadelphia and New York/New Jersey.

The World Cup begins June 11 in Mexico City and will conclude with the tournament final July 19 in New York/New Jersey.

EPL

The Athletic has live coverage of Liverpool vs Bournemouth in the first match of the 2025-26 Premier League season 

If, like all of my social circle, you did not follow this summer's expanded Club World Cup, you missed some decent games, a few upsets, a lot of Donald Trump and a surprise win for Chelsea.

It was fine, but fine was good enough to ensure it will happen again in four years' time — perhaps sooner — and that means you also possibly missed the beginning of the end of football as most of us know it.

When the new Premier League season starts tomorrow evening, many of the world's best players will embark on an 11-month season that will finish at next summer's World Cup, the old-fashioned one but with 48 teams and 104 games, not 32 and 64, as per recent editions. This will be less than five weeks after Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain in New York, but only two weeks after Manchester United drew with Everton to clinch the Premier League's very own American showcase event, the Summer Series.

It is not just the world's best players who are now locked into an endless content-creation cycle. The first round of Champions League qualifying took place on July 8, the same day Chelsea beat Fluminense in the semi-final of the Club World Cup, a tournament that neither brought the curtain down on 2024-25 nor raised it for 2025-26 — there is no curtain anymore.

The lower leagues in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and elsewhere in northern Europe are always early starters, but England's Leagues One and Two began their new campaigns on August 1. In fact, League Two's Barnet and Newport County had already played each other in an EFL Cup preliminary round on July 29 — in other words, before most of their fans had gone on their summer holidays, let alone taken some time off to enjoy the cricket season, the Lions tour, a music festival, a summer fete, anything other than football, basically.

The English Football League had no choice but to start so early, as it is the only way to ensure there is room in the schedule to include the record nine Premier League teams who have qualified for European football this season when they join the competition in the third round.

What else can the EFL do when UEFA adds a third European competition, the Conference League, in 2021, and then expands all three of its club competitions in 2024, adding extra games and teams? The Champions League leapt from 125 to 189 games last season — once that happened, every new edition of the EFL Cup is a minor miracle.

The EFL could just stop scheduling it, I suppose, but Premier League clubs appear to like winning it, as do their fans. Newcastle United's certainly did.

It also makes up a big chunk of the EFL's broadcast revenues and the Premier League's participation in the competition is one of the least painful contributions the top flight makes to the rest of the professional pyramid. Take that away and Premier League boss Richard Masters is going to have an even harder time trying to convince his shareholders to send more money down the pipe before the new independent football regulator makes them.

But that is not his only headache.

Masters has been talking about the fact that the Premier League has been the same size and shape for more than three decades — 20 teams, 380 games — for several years now.

He was at it again earlier this month, when the BBC asked him why the Premier League does not just shrink to 18 teams. After all, that was the original idea back in 1992, when the Football Association encouraged the top clubs to break away from the EFL, its ancient rival, and form the Premier League. The clubs were only half-listening, though, and having cut the top division from 22 teams to 20, decided to stop there.

“I don't think we should be forced into that decision,” said Masters.

“I am all for the growth of the game and the exciting competitions our clubs can participate in, but not at the expense of domestic football.”

FIFA and UEFA have been dropping not-so-subtle hints that 18-team leagues, with a maximum of 306 games, is where everyone should have arrived by now.

Germany's Bundesliga has had 18 teams since 1965, but France's Ligue 1 got the memo in 2023, having scrapped its second domestic cup competition three years earlier. This means only England, Italy and Spain still have 20-team leagues in Europe.

Italy's Serie A actually voted on whether to go to 18 teams last year, but the clubs backed the status quo by a 16-4 margin. Ominously, the less-is-more quartet were the Milan duo, Juventus and Roma. If La Liga put it to their clubs in Spain, we can be fairly sure of how Barcelona and Real Madrid would vote.

For what it is worth, that French decision looks worse with every passing season, as their domestic television deal has cratered and PSG, insulated by Qatari sovereign wealth and their overseas earnings, have disappeared into the distance. Everyone apart from them could use the extra matchday revenue and broadcast inventory now.

But big clubs have broad horizons, with foreign fans and global sponsors. UEFA and now FIFA have shown them the value of international competition and they want more of it, which means less time for domestic chores.



Would England's aristocrats vote to cut the Premier League?

Maybe, maybe not. Unlike their European peers, they can still see the benefit of domestic football in their profit and loss accounts, as the Premier League, for a variety of reasons, has become the closest thing to a European Super League since the Big Six briefly conspired with Barca, Juve, Real and Co to create a more regular and lucrative place to get together than the Champions League.

A combination of crass planning, fan power and opportunistic populism on the part of the British government saw that abomination collapse inside 72 hours, but instead of being punished for their treachery, the ESL's 12 founding clubs were rewarded with an expanded Champions League and revamped Club World Cup.

With the Premier League's overseas media rights still rising in value, its stadiums full (and growing) and almost half of its clubs playing in Europe this season, the status quo looks pretty good right now. But Masters can see the writing on the wall.

Entirely fed up with FIFA grabbing bigger chunks of the calendar, the Premier League has teamed up with Europe's other domestic leagues and the continent's players' unions to lodge a formal complaint against the global governing body at the European Commission.

By bringing European Union competition law into football's fixture squabbles, the leagues and players are telling FIFA they believe the game has reached saturation point, the players are knackered, and there are no more cup replays to scrap.

To be honest, questions could be asked as to why the leagues and players did not combine to resist UEFA's expansionism, but the European confederation at least invites representatives from the leagues and unions to its meetings before telling them it is going to create new competitions, grab more exclusive midweek slots, and maybe pinch a weekend or two. The Premier League also knows it cannot get too stroppy with an organisation that provides at least a third of its shareholders with large cheques each season, not to mention the fact that the race for European berths is a vital component of the Premier League's annual narrative.

FIFA, on the other hand, consults via press release and photo opportunity, as FIFPro, the global players' union, has been pointing out of late. And, unlike UEFA, its president, Gianni Infantino, is not trying to defend a dominant position, he is attempting to disrupt it, globalise it and own it.

Which brings us back to the Club World Cup that may have completely passed you by. Perhaps you did not watch any of the games, but you read about some poor attendances, extreme weather and a couple of mismatches. You may have only just seen a few memes of Cole Palmer doing something brilliant or funny or both.

For the record, I did not properly watch a single moment of it live, although I did read about it and watch the best clips on social media, which is not that dissimilar to how my children follow most football. The closest I got to watching it live was on holiday in Spain, where the final was on all the TVs in all the bars and restaurants that you would expect to show live football. FIFA and its Saudi-backed streaming partner DAZN may even have counted me and thousands of other passers-by that night in their viewing statistics, which is fine, as I did notice the score and got slightly interested when PSG's players and manager Luis Enrique lost their tempers at the end.

That suggests they cared about it. And Chelsea's players looked very happy afterwards, albeit a little confused as to why the U.S. president had decided to photobomb their celebrations.

But nobody looked happier than Infantino.

He knew he had done enough to ensure Saudi money will continue to flow FIFA's way until 2034 at least, as the Gulf state appears to be all-in on its big bet on sport. He knew that if I had more friends in Africa, Asia or South America, my social circle would certainly have watched the tournament. And he also knew that the inaugural event's host, the aforementioned commander in chief, was so pleased with how it had gone that he joked at half-time that maybe he should scribble one of his presidential decrees to replace “soccer” as the game's name in America.

“The jury is out about the competitiveness of the format and the scheduling and the underlying economics, but it is not my job to assess the success or otherwise of the Club World Cup,” Masters told the BBC.

“It is my job to assess whether these new competitions have an impact on the domestic calendar and domestic competitions, of which the Premier League is one.

Advertisement

“Since 1994, the Premier League has been 380 matches, 20 clubs. We haven't changed shape at all. Now we are starting to redesign our domestic calendar at the altar of European and global expansion.

“We are asking the players to play in more matches. There has to be, at the top of the game, a proper dialogue between FIFA and all the stakeholders about how these things go forward. That has been sadly missing.”

Yep, and now the only dialogue is going to be a row about whether the Club World Cup should go to 48 teams in 2029, with more spots for Masters' shareholders, or maybe we should just let FIFA do it every two years, floating from summer to winter as it crosses the globe.

If that happens, and there is no question that FIFA wants that to happen — ideally in rotation with a biennial men's World Cup — we can forget 18-team domestic top flights, with deep professional pyramids and historic national cup competitions. We will be lucky to find time for a 16-team domestic league and when that happens, we will all realise that fixture congestion was never just a problem for a handful of superstars.

So, enjoy this season — cherish it, even — because there might not be many like it left.

TV camera crew filming ahead of the FIFA Club World Cup 2025. Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images

15 Aug 2025, 2:27 pm  

A UK appeal court ruling which upheld a broadcaster's rights over a major tournament will be a comfort to companies looking to show major events in future, experts have said.

Broadcaster DAZN had appealed a ruling by the Commercial Court that it had a formal deal with Coupang to sub-licence to the South Korean company the broadcasting rights for this year's FIFA Club World Cup – and challenged an injunction preventing it from providing the feed of the games to anyone other than Coupang.

But the Court of Appeal has rejected that outright (23-page / 320KB PDF), confirming DAZN did have a binding agreement with Coupang to licence matches to them, despite the informal nature of the conversations around the deal. The ruling could have a significant impact on how sports rights are sub-licensed and streamed on third party platforms going forward.

“Broadcasting rights are an issue at all major sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup, the Olympics, and World Athletics Championship,” said Julian Diaz-Rainey, sports disputes expert at Pinsent Masons.

He added: “What was particularly interesting was that the court at first instance was prepared to grant an injunction, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal, to ensure that the agreement was not breached, and the exclusivity of the broadcasting rights could be protected.”

“This will be of comfort to organisations which buy broadcasting rights.”

DAZN had acquired the exclusive rights to this year's Club World Cup competition, which it aired over the summer on its app. It also sublicensed coverage for some games to third party companies – such as Channel 5 in the UK.

It had been in discussions with streaming platform Coupang for the rights to sub-licence the tournament in South Korea, but while DAZN claimed it had not reached a binding deal and could therefore accept a higher offer, the Commercial Court found that  the nature of its discussions with senior figures at the South Korean firm – including WhatsApp messaging – had constituted a binding agreement. This was upheld by the Court of Appeal.

Trevor Watkins, head of sport at Pinsent Masons, explained the ruling would have wider implications beyond sports rights in terms of how contractual discussions would be measured.

“In deciding this case the court went back to basic principles of contract law and found that parties can conclude a legally binding contract if there is sufficient evidence of intention and the core essential terms are agreed, even when it is likely that additional elements were still to be finalised,” he said. 

“Rights are invariably the bedrock of value within a sport. The evidence here suggested that the rights holder appears to be bound to a contract that paid it less than half it might have received from others – a contract held to be in existence notwithstanding certain terms being yet to be finalised. Any rights holder must ensure it makes clear in any negotiations that these are ‘subject to contract' and not intended to be legally binding to avoid it inadvertently finding exchanges of messages and emails create a contract that it may have preferred not to enter into.”

Both the Toronto Argonauts and B.C. Lions will play home games away from their respective venues during the World Cup.Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press

The B.C. Lions and Toronto Argonauts will spend the first half of the 2026 CFL season as road warriors.

Both the Lions and Argos will play home games away from their respective venues during FIFA's World Cup. Soccer's men's world championship will be held from June 11 to July 19 with contests in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Vancouver and Toronto will combine to host 13 matches. Toronto's BMO Field will stage six, including Canada's first-ever World Cup game on home soil June 12.

Seven games will be played at Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium, including Canada's group matches June 18 and 24. The first contest at the venue is slated for July 13 with Vancouver also hosting knockout stage games July 2 (round of 32) and July 7 (round of 16).

What's more, the World Cup takes over the venues for its games 30 days before the first match at that stadium.

On Friday, the CFL announced the Argos will play home games at Hamilton Stadium, Mosaic Stadium in Regina and Winnipeg's Princess Auto Stadium against the host teams during the World Cup.

The Lions will relocate for two home games, with the club planning to announce those details at a later time. The Argos will also unveil further details in the future.

The full '26 CFL schedule is scheduled to be released in the off-season. The 2025 campaign ends with the Grey Cup on Nov. 16 at Princess Auto Stadium.

“The World Cup is a cultural event, uniting entire countries and communities under a single flag,” CFL commissioner Stewart Johnston said in a statement. “As Toronto and Vancouver welcome the world, we're grateful to other cities and their tremendous fans for so generously making a home away from home for the Argonauts and the Lions.”

Construction at BMO Field in preparation for the World Cup began after the '24 CFL season and most noticeable has been the installation of four LED scoreboards, one in each corner of the stadium.

As well, a new temporary playing surface has been installed with another planned specifically for the World Cup in 2026.

BMO Field's seating capacity will be increased to 45,736 for the World Cup from 28,180. There will also be enhancements made to the audio systems, an expansion of the WiFi throughout and a new north-end pavilion that's currently under construction.

Following the World Cup, BMO Field will require time to be retrofitted back to CFL standards.

“To our incredible fans in Toronto: your passion and loyalty mean the world to us,” said Argos GM Mike (Pinball) Clemons. “This temporary move is about showcasing our city and stadium to the world – and when we return, it'll be with even more energy, excitement and noise!”

Last season, Toronto had an average attendance of 15,127 as it marched to a second Grey Cup title in three seasons. That figure has dipped to 13,838 as the Argos (2-7) have struggled thus far and there's history to suggest the prospect of having to play home games out of town next year won't help the franchise's fortunes.

In 2015, the Pan American Games and Toronto Blue Jays' playoff run forced Toronto to play three home games on the road (one in Ottawa, two in Hamilton). That was after opening that season in Fort McMurray, Alta., as the home team versus the then Edmonton Eskimos.

A total of 4,900 spectators watched Toronto defeat Edmonton 26-11 in Fort McMurray on June 27. And 15,011 fans took in the Argos' 38-35 “home” win over the Redblacks on Oct. 6, a Tuesday night.

But only 3,401 attended Toronto's 27-15 loss to Calgary in Hamilton on Oct. 17 (Saturday afternoon) and 3,741 were on hand for the club's 34-2 defeat to Montreal on Oct. 23 (a Friday night).

Despite only playing five times at Rogers Centre – Toronto's home venue at the time – the Argos finished third in the East with a 10-8 record before suffering a 25-22 setback to Hamilton in the division semifinal before a Tim Hortons Field gathering of 24,029.

The big difference in 2026, though, will be Toronto playing its road home games against the local teams, which should be a more attractive draw for fans in those cities.

The CFL added that both the Argos' and Lions' schedules next season will be made to re-establish home-field advantage for the second half of the 2026 campaign.

This will mark the first time the World Cup will be hosted by three countries as 48 teams from six confederations are slated to participate in the global event. Games will be played in a total of 16 cities (11 in the U.S., three in Mexico and the two in Canada).

Vancouver will be in the West Region along with Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area and Seattle. Toronto is in the East Region along with Atlanta, Boston, Miami, Philadelphia and New York/New Jersey.

The World Cup begins June 11 in Mexico City and will conclude with the tournament final July 19 in New York/New Jersey.

The B.C. Lions and Toronto Argonauts will spend the first half of the 2026 CFL season as road warriors.

Both the Lions and Argos will play home games away from their respective venues during FIFA's World Cup. Soccer's men's world championship will be held from June 11 to July 19 with contests in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

Mauricio Pedroza and Janusz Michallik discuss Ricardo Pepi's future at PSV. (2:43)

The start of the European league season is upon us.

This past weekend, the English Championship and 2. Bundesliga got underway, with the Premier League, LaLiga and Ligue 1 kicking off this weekend. Serie A and the Bundesliga will begin the week after that. That means the U.S. men's national team diaspora will begin getting games under their belt with their respective club teams, if they haven't already, while their brethren in MLS are in the thick of their respective 2025 campaigns.

As such, ESPN will be monitoring the progress of those players throughout the season, and every week, delivering insights into the players whose form or fitness has made them particularly intriguing, as well as providing updates on the USMNT player pool at large. We call it the USMNT's Countdown to the men's World Cup.

What informs the player pool in the USMNT's Countdown to the World Cup? Our Big Board, updates of which will publish every other month.

ESPN will count down to June 11 every week, so that way when the U.S. team is announced for this highly anticipated World Cup on home soil, no names on that 26-man roster will come as a surprise.

So, without further ado, welcome to the USMNT's Countdown to the World Cup. Only 301 days to go.

2025-26 minutes: 172
2025-26 FotMob rating: 8.2

Dest has started the season on fire at PSV, scoring the game winner against Go Ahead Eagles in the Dutch Super Cup, and then finding the net again in this past weekend's 6-1 rout of Sparta Rotterdam. His return to form is fantastic news for U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino, too. Pochettino has yet to see the right back up close after Dest had an ACL injury a year ago, and the player's absence has been keenly felt.

Dest's ability to create the unexpected from right back had been a key part of the national team's attack, and his injury meant opponents could clamp down on other attacking threats such as Christian Pulisic. Dest's likely return for the USMNT in September should provide a significant boost.

2025-26 minutes: 152
2025-26 FotMob rating: 7.2

The chasm that exists between Sargent's club form and his play with the USMNT was illustrated again this past weekend. In Norwich City's 2-1 defeat against Millwall to open the Championship season, Sargent scored the Canaries' only goal with his butt, blocking an attempted clearance from Millwall keeper Steven Benda and watching it loop into the net.

With the USMNT, Sargent can't beg, borrow or steal a goal, having gone more than five years since his last national team tally. If he's going to find a way back into the good graces of Pochettino, he's going to have to continue delivering for Norwich. That's if he doesn't move to a new club in what is left of the summer transfer window.

2025 minutes: 90
2025 FotMob rating: 8.2

Turner has already achieved his primary goal for this window, and that was finding a club where he's guaranteed a chance to play. This past season while on loan at Crystal Palace he made just four appearances, and none in league play. But in making his return to New England -- he played there previously between 2016 and 2022 -- Turner got off to a perfect start, making three saves in a 2-0 win over D.C. United.

This is not to say that Turner has the starting spot with the USMNT all sewn up. Colorado's Zack Steffen is having an excellent season, as is New York City FC's Matt Freese, who gained some critical national team experience in the recently concluded Gold Cup. But Turner's World Cup experience gives him an edge if everything else is equal. The next nine months will make for a fascinating three-player race ahead of the World Cup.

If the World Cup started tomorrow, who would make up Pochettino's starting XI? Each week we take our best attempt to name a starting lineup based on form and fitness, which means there's no room for injured players like Pulisic (ankle, although he could yet be available for Sunday's Coppa Italia tilt against Bari), Malik Tillman (muscle strain) or Antonee Robinson (resumed training, but not yet match fit).

Injuries are a constant factor when it comes to national team lineups, and this attempt at coming up with a USMNT XI is no different. In this iteration, left back is a sore spot. Fulham manager Marco Silva said last weekend that Robinson isn't fit to start the Premier League season following minor offseason knee surgery. One of Robinson's possible replacements, Watford's Caleb Wiley, is dealing with a back injury, so he's not available either. That leaves Columbus Crew's Max Arfsten.

Arfsten's performances were a bit all over the place at the Gold Cup, especially on the defensive side of the ball. But the Crew defender's play without the ball did improve over the course of the tournament, and while Holstein Kiel's John Tolkin was also an option, Arfsten gets the nod based on Pochettino's preference for how the player gets forward and contributes to the attack.

The attacking midfield positions -- both central and out wide -- are also a bit injury hit, with the aforementioned ailments for Pulisic and Tillman meaning that more digging into the USMNT's depth is required. The inclusion of América's Alejandro Zendejas might raise an eyebrow or two, especially considering he was on the outside looking in in ESPN's USMNT Big Board 1.0. But based purely on current form, Zendejas is the pick, as he has been lights out for América during the entire calendar year. The big question is: Does Pochettino actually rate him? The September window will be revealing.

Diego Luna is the pick for a central role. Yes, he was sent off in this past weekend's 2-1 defeat to the New York Red Bulls for two bookable offenses, although he looked more like a victim than perpetrator in the sequence that earned him a second caution. He also delivered a defense-splitting pass to set up RSL's lone goal. With some other U.S. players nicked up, Luna gets the nod, although he'll need to keep his composure as he's bound to be on the receiving end of more physical challenges.

The rest of the side is stocked with familiar names this week, but the weekend should provoke plenty of movement.

“Obviously Fifa was put on earth really to regulate the global game and to run international football and the Club World Cup is a move into club football.

”The Premier League boss was also firm in rejecting the idea of staging a league fixture overseas — an idea that continues to resurface, particularly as 11 top-flight clubs now have American owners.

With the countdown to the 2026 World Cup in full swing, American soccer fans will have a greater interest in what's going on overseas, with some of the U.S. Men's National Team players competing in the Premier League, Bundesliga, LaLiga and elsewhere.

The 2025-26 season will be one of the most consequential for some players as they look to rebound or to build their cases as to why they should be a part of the American roster at the World Cup. And there may be no bigger spotlights than those on Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna.

Pulisic, entering his third year at AC Milan in Italy's Serie A, has been the focus of criticism from USMNT alums for not participating in the Gold Cup this summer, which led to a very public spat that involved Landon Donovan and Pulisic's father.

But the pride of Hershey, Pa., has become a sensation in Italy, scoring 32 goals in his first two seasons with AC Milan, and the club will need that as it hopes to improve from an eighth-place finish last season.

Pulisic had been dealing with a minor ankle injury, but he returned to full practice, and AC Milan doesn't open the Serie A season until Aug. 23.

It appears for now as if Reyna will start the year with German Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund, though the writing on the wall seems to suggest his time there could be coming to an end.

While any potential transfer from Dortmund has moved at a crawl — Reyna had been linked to Serie A side Parma over the summer — the son of USMNT alum Claudio Reyna needs to get off to a fast start to help his World Cup chances.

After he saw just 12 minutes during Dortmund's run in the Club World Cup and the club announced it had given the prestigious No. 7 that Reyna had worn since 2021 to another player, it seems like playing time could be tough for him to see until a move is made.  

Here are some other USMNT players to keep an eye on during the European season:

Tyler Adams, AFC Bournemouth (Premier League): The USMNT captain and former Red Bull midfielder is coming off his best season with the club and is developing into one of the leaders for Bournemouth, which finished in the top half of the table in 2024-25.

Brenden Aaronson, Leeds United (Premier League): The midfielder appeared in five matches during the USMNT run in the Gold Cup, scoring a goal and registering an assist. Last season, he helped Leeds finish first in the EFL Championship — England's second division — to earn a promotion back to the Premier League.

Malik Tillman, Bayer Leverkusen (Bundesliga): Tillman made the jump to Bayer Leverkusen this summer from PSV in the Netherlands. In two years with PSV, he had 25 goals and 17 assists while helping the club win back-to-back league titles.

Timothy Weah, Olympique de Marseille (Ligue 1): After two seasons with Juventus in Italy, Weah is back in Ligue 1. The move will give Weah some all-important playing time heading into 2026 after making 78 appearances and scoring 14 goals for Juventus.

Sergiño Dest, PSV Eindhoven (Eredivisie): The fullback has come out firing to start the season for Dutch club PSV, scoring in the first game of the season last weekend, and he was a key contributor the week before when he scored the winning goal in the Dutch Super Cup. He missed a majority of the 2024-25 season due to a torn ACL and had to pull out of the Gold Cup because of an injury.

Johnny Cardoso, Atlético Madrid (LaLiga): The 23-year-old midfielder completed a transfer to Atlético Madrid last month from rival Real Betis and hopes to put a disappointing summer at the Gold Cup — injury hindered him from making much of an impact with the USMNT — behind him.

This year's Cincinnati Open is back on track following the extreme weather that disrupted play on Tuesday. Play was curtailed early with the main court flooded as torrential rain lashed down, but thankfully, there was no such disruption on Wednesday or Thursday.

The two top seeds, Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka, are both on track while Carlos Alcaraz faces Andrey Rublev later today. The Italian is in the final four after dismantling Felix Auger-Aliassime last night. Elsewhere, Coco Gauff and Jasmine Paolini both also progressed.

Coco Gauff recently revealed that she had been forced to delete X (formerly known as Twitter) because she became obsessed with following Love Island USA on the app.

Now, Ben Shelton has jumped on the bandwagon, admitting that he deleted the app years ago.

"I remember two years ago, I ended up deleting Twitter from my phone, and that was the best decision I ever made. Now, two years have passed, and I've never read anything on that social network again," the recent Canadian Open champion told Tennis Channel.

"I prefer to watch the highlights of certain matches. At the moment, I watch a lot of the tennis matches I used to watch, whether it's from the tournament I'm playing in or even from a Challenger tournament that's happening that week. I have a team that helps me keep my feet on the ground."

Andrey Rublev is currently trailing Carlos Alcaraz by a break in the opening set of their quarter-final.

And the No. 9 seed isn't happy with some of the automated technology - even if he doesn't realise some of it is automated.

Rublev confronted chair umpire Mohamed Lahyani and claimed the shot clock was being started too soon, only to be told that it automatically started three seconds after the last point was called.

Then, he was shown a replay of an electronic line call he didn't agree with, and thought the wrong ball may have been shown.



The chair umpire had to ask Aryna Sabalenka to rip the label off her water bottle during her quarter-final defeat to Elena Rybakina.

The world No. 1 was drinking from a plastic San Pellegrino bottle when the official said: "Aryna can I just ask you to take [the label] off that bottle? Perfect, thank you, we're good, that's fine."

It comes just a couple of days after Carlos Alcaraz became frustrated when an umpire told him off for drinking from reusable branded Evian bottles. "It's not my fault," the Spaniard repeatedly stated.



Last year's Cincinnati Open champion, Aryna Sabalenka, has been ousted in the quarter-final.

Elena Rybakina has taken out the top seed 6-1 6-4, ending Sabalenka's title defence.

She saved all five break points she faced, and will face Iga Swiatek in the semi-finals.



British doubles stars Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash have extended their incredible winning streak in Cincinnati.

They've now won 22 matches and counting after beating No. 6 seed Andrea Vavassori and Simone Bolelli in the quarter-finals.

Dubbed 'Cashpool', they have not lost a match since the Libema Open final in June.

The Brits swept titles at Queen's, Eastbourne, Wimbledon and Toronto, and they're looking for their fifth successive trophy.



Elena Rybakina is off to a flying start in her Cincinnati Open quarter-final against world No. 1 and defending champion Aryna Sabalenka.

Rybakina suffered a brutal defeat to Sabalenka in Berlin a few weeks ago, blowing four match points to go out in the quarter-finals.

But she's keen to get revenge - she's taken the first set 6-1 in Cincinnati in under half an hour.

Iga Swiatek had the fans on Cincinnati Open's centre court in stitches as she discussed the searing heat.

Asked how she was coping in the hot weather, the world No. 3 had a simple answer - she'd been drinking. But she made it very clear that she was keeping things pure and healthy.

“There's no secret, I just drink,” she said, before eyeing the camera and adding: “But water!”

Iga Swiatek is through to her third straight semi-final at the Cincinnati Open after beating Anna Kalinskaya 6-3 6-4.

The world No. 3 has never been beyond the semis here. If she wants to reach the final, she'll have to beat either Aryna Sabalenka or Elena Rybakina. Their match is up next on the centre court.



Terence Atmane has enjoyed a breakthrough week in Cincinnati, coming through qualifying and making it all the way to tomorrow's semi-final, where he takes on Jannik Sinner.

The French qualifier has already beaten 15th seed Flavio Cobolli, teenage sensation Joao Fonseca, and top-10 stars Taylor Fritz and Holger Rune on his way to the last four.

Ranked down at No. 136 in the world, Atmane is set to bank at least £245k in prize money and will make his top 100 debut when the tournament is over.

But he still has no clothing or shoe sponsor after being dropped by Asics last year.

“Apart from Tecnifibre for the rackets, I don't have any sponsors since I got dropped by Asics. I buy my clothes and shoes like everyone else. I don't have an agent; I do my thing on my own in my corner,” Atmane told L'Equipe.

Anna Kalinskaya sparked concerns when she called the physio and received a medical time-out minutes into her Cincinnati Open quarter-final clash with Iga Swiatek.

The No. 28 seed already had heavy strapping on her shoulder, and during the first changeover in the match, with Swiatek leading 2-1, the trainer bandaged Kalinskaya's calf.

She has decided to play on and got broken. Swiatek currently leads 4-1.



Terence Atmane is on the run of his life in Cincinnati. The world No. 136 qualifier is into the semi-finals after beating two top-10 players, including Holger Rune.

After suffering a 6-2 6-3 defeat in the quarters, Rune took to social media to send some words of support to Atmane.

"I have known you Terence since juniors, tennis is a tough journey and I am happy for your run here at @CincyTennis and what it will mean in the future for you . Good luck onwards," he tweeted.

Play is getting underway at the Cincinnati Open, with No. 3 seed and recent Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek facing Anna Kalinskaya for a spot in the semi-finals.

Kalinskaya hit out at the WTA when their quarter-final was scheduled first on Friday at 11am local time, after her last match started on Wednesdan night and finished in the early hours on Thursday, and she didn't get to bed until 4am.

“How can the WTA and tournament expect athletes to perform their best when the scheduling is unfair?” she wrote in an Instagram story.

“After my match against Alexandrova, I got home from the site at 2:40 am and didn't go to bed until 4 am. I slept a bit and came to the site to practice.”

“Then I get scheduled at 11 am for tomorrow's match—how does the tournament and WTA expect me to recover and continuously adjust my sleep pattern, which is one of the most important aspects of recovery? Seems a bit one sided.”

Emma Raducanu made a statement at Wimbledon last month, where she put up an impressive fight during a tight loss to Aryna Sabalenka in the third round.

But her private life was also under the spotlight at SW19, as Raducanu was asked whether there was any truth to rumours that she was dating Carlos Alcaraz, whom she'll team up with in the US Open mixed doubles event next week.

After she said they were just friends, fellow British player Cameron Norrie - who is in a long-term relationship - was asked whether he was seeing Raducanu.

And the 22-year-old has finally responded to the intrusive speculation.

“Yeah, and Cam's questions, too. That was terrible. Terrible,” she told the Guardian.



The International Tennis Integrity Agency have confirmed that Japanese star Kaili Demi Teso has been suspended for 10 months following a doping violation.The 19-year-old Teso tested positive for the prohibited substance methylephedrine, atributed to a bottle of cough medicine. Teso's mother, also his manager, acquired the medicine on the player's behalf and the ITIA accepted that the breach was not intentional.

In a statement, they said: "An independent tribunal issued a ruling of no significant fault or negligence and a 10-month suspension, noting that the player's mother had consulted a professional from a reputable pharmacy before purchasing, and that Teso, 18 at the time of the positive test, was inexperienced."

Wimbledon commentator Andrew Castle has claimed the 'Royal Box' jibe from Andre Agassi live on air this summer was blown out of proportion.

"We had a laugh, and they took it out of context," he told Betway. "Afterwards, Andre sent me a text, saying what an unbelievable time he'd had, how he enjoyed it, and we were going to have him for the final but then he went into the Royal Box instead.

"But then you read that he was saying, oh, ‘just concentrate on the tennis'."

Andre Agassi pretty much annoyed by Andrew Castle and his obsession with celebrities in the Royal Box. Andre is right, it's tennis that they came to concentrate on.

Lindsey Davenport has backed Ben Shelton to win the US Open.

Davenport, who won three Slam crowns in an illustrious career, said on the Tennis Channel: "Ben Shelton has that type of game where he can take the racket out of his opponent's hand.

"He's got big weapons. He's such an explosive athlete. He lights up the stadium as well. If you get on a roll in New York, if he can play that high level tennis and have the crowd behind him, we could have an American male Grand Slam champion here pretty soon."



Andrey Rublev had received a significant boost ahead of the US Open this month.

The 27-year-old will face Carlos Alcaraz in the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open, having learnt that his coach, Marat Safin, has received his US visa.

Safin won't be able to join him in Ohio, but will be in New York to guide him for Flushing Meadows this month.

Jannik Sinner has defended his decision to rehire fitness coach Umberto Ferrer after his latest win in Cincinatti.

Having sacked Ferrer following his doping controversy, Sinner said:"It was a different situation. Now everything is different. I felt like, at this point, I needed someone who knew my body better.

"We worked together for about two years before this break. His work has brought me a lot of benefits. We worked on every area of my body and my endurance has improved. I think he did a great job."

Roger Federer has learnt who he will share a court with for his celebrity doubles match in Shanghai on October 10.

It's been confirmed that he'll partner with one of two actors, Hong Kong film star Donnie Yen or Chinese TV personality Wu Lei, to play against ex-professional female Zheng Jie.



The US Open mixed doubles partnership between Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz appears in doubt due to the Cincinnati Open schedule.

Alcaraz is into the last eight, and if he makes Monday's final, he will play just 20 hours before the revamped tournament gets underway. Having taken a break after Wimbledon, citing fatigue, former British player Barry Fulcher has speculated Alcaraz could now follow Coco Gauff in skipping the team event.

Emma Raducanu has revealed she has been training in extreme heat ahead of the US Open this month.

After her exit in Cincinnati, Raducanu took to her Instagram story to post a picture of her sweating profusely after a training session. She's already stated she feels she is heading to Flushing Meadows in the best shape since her win there four years ago.

French qualifier Terence Atmane continued his sensational run at the ATP Cincinnati Masters last night by stunning seventh-seeded Holger Rune 6-2, 6-3.

The world No.136 now in his Masters 1000 semi-final where he'll face defending champion Jannik Sinner.

"I don't think any words can describe how I feel right now," said the 23-year-old. "I was just trying to be myself on the court."

Here's the moment he sealed his win...

Atmane = THE MAN \ud83d\udd25The moment World No.136 Terence Atmane defeated Rune to become the first qualifier to reach the #CincyTennis semi-finals since 2015! pic.twitter.com/svq87YhYQJ

Alexander Zverev has admitted he got professional help following his first round exit at Wimbledon this summer.

"I took a longer period of time off after Wimbledon, which I haven't done in a very long time," he said.

"Which was very needed. I didn't train, I didn't do any physical work, I didn't play tennis for a longer time as well which was the best thing for me to do. I enjoyed my time, mentally freed up, got also some professional help as well there. I'm happy to be back on court."



Anna Kalinskaya has accused the WTA of being 'biased' against her due to the scheduling of her upcoming match against Iga Swiatek.

On her Instagram story, she wrote: "How does the WTA and the tournament expect their players to play well with these unfair schedules?

"After my match against Alexandrova, I went home at 2:40am and didn't go to bed until 4:00am.

"I slept a little and came back to train today. Then they scheduled my match tomorrow [against Swiatek] at 11:00am.

"How does the WTA and the tournament expect me to recover and continue adjusting my sleep patterns, when that's one of the most important aspects of recovery? It seems a bit biased."

Jannik Sinner is through to the semi-finals in Cincinnati after securing a dominant win over Felix Auger-Aliassime.

The young Italian turned the screw to earn a 6-0 6-2 victory in one hour and 11 minutes.

He will be hoping to go all the way and lift the trophy to give himself some winning momentum ahead of the US Open.

Jasmine Paolini will go up against Coco Gauff in the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open.

She has booked her place in the last eight with a thumping win over former Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova.

Paolini was in full control throughout and sailed to a comprehensive 6-1 6-2 victory.



Emma Raducanu will not be seeded for the US Open, it has been confirmed.

Veronika Kudermetova's recent victory over Clara Tauson at the Cincinnati Open pushed the young Brit out of the final spot.

It means Raducanu could face a top player in the very first round at Flushing Meadows.

Coco Gauff is safely through to the quarter-finals of the Cincinnati Open after beating Lucia Bronzetti in straight sets.

The young American turned on the style to secure a one-sided 6-2 6-4 victory.

She will face either seventh seed Jasmine Paolini or former Wimbledon winner Barbora Krejcikova in the next round.

Patrick Mouratoglou is convinced that Victoria Mboko will win Grand Slam titles over the course of her career.

Reflecting on her incredible Canadian Open triumph, he said: "She plays to win no matter who is on the other side of the court.

"She started the year ranked 300. Difficult to think she's not going to win Grand Slams.

"Great physicality, the way she moves on the court and she's very offensive, both sides forehand and backhand."



Male tennis players will pocket a record £13.5m in profit-sharing bonuses from the 2024 season, the ATP have confirmed.

The figure marks an increase of 177 per cent on the previous season's payout.

It will be distributed to players based on their performance at the nine ATP 1000 tournaments.

ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: "This is exactly what profit sharing was designed to do, ensure that players and tournaments share equally in the sport's financial upside.

"It is a huge milestone. For us, it's proof that strengthening the premium product and aligning interests creates value.

"We're proud to be strengthening our partnership and building a stronger, more sustainable ATP Tour."

Matteo Berrettini has pulled out of the US Open due to an injury.

He has not played since Wimbledon, where he was dumped out by Kamil Majchrzak in five sets.

Berrettini skipped Toronto and Cincinnati with the aim of recovering in time for the final Grand Slam of the year.

However, he remains unable to compete and has withdrawn from the event.

Aryna Sabalenka has admitted to regularly cheating on her diet.

In an interview with the Tennis Channel during the Cincinnati Open, she said: “It's hamburgers, it can be pizza, it can be gummies. It can be a lot of different things in one day because you know, like if it's a cheat meal, you got to go full.

“But hamburgers, that's my weakness, cheesy and soft and a really good meat and hot and the bun is still melting with the cheese.”



The International Tennis Integrity Agency has confirmed Australian tennis player Thomas Fancutt has accepted a 10 month suspension for a doping violation.Fancutt, 30, admitted to using a using a 'prohibited method' in relation to an IV drip.

In a released statement, the authority said: "Following a full investigation by the ITIA, which included evidence gathering and interviews with the player, Fancutt admitted to the breach, and the ITIA accepted that the breach was not intentional."

Top seeds Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka are odds-on to win the US Open.

According to AceOdds, in the men's draw, Sinner is the favourite at evens ahead of Carlos Alcaraz at 2/1. In the women's draw, Aryna Sabalenka is the 5/2 favourite with Iga Swiatek closely behind at 7/2.

AceOdds: 2025 US Open men's winner: Jannik Sinner Evens; Carlos Alcaraz 2/1; Novak Djokovic 16/1; Taylor Fritz, Alexander Zverev 25/1; Jack Draper 28/1; Ben Shelton 33/1; Daniil Medvedev 50/1.

Women's winner: Aryna Sabalenka 5/2; Iga Swiatek 7/2; Coco Gauff 7/1; Mirra Andreeva 12/1; Elena Rybakina 14/1 Naomi Osaka 20/1; Madison Keys 22/1; Amanda Anisimova 25/1; Jessica Pegula, Emma Raducanu, Victoria Mboko 33/1; Jasmine Paolini, Clara Tauson 50/1.

Jannik Sinner has learnt he won't be eligible to receive money from the ATP Masters Bonus Pool this season.

The prize pot is reserved for the top performers in the six Masters 1000 events who performed in at least theee of the tournaments.

While serving his doping ban, the Italian missed the Indian Wells Masters, Miami Open, and Madrid. Last month he opted to withdraw from the Toronto Masters, citing fatigue and regardless of his final position, won't be eligible for any additional money.



Emma Raducanu has sent a warning to rivals ahead of the US Open this month.

After struggling since her remarkable 2021 win, she's said: "I went home and came back and it was a really difficult time in New York.

"Since I won the tournament, it's not been easy for me there. But this year I feel different, I'm a lot calmer behind the court. On the court, I take more confidence in the big moments."

Aryna Sabalenka has withdrawn from the mixed doubles of the US Open.

The world No.1 has opted not to look for a replacement after her original partner, Grigor Dimitrov, pulled out. It follows him injuring his pectoral muscle at Wimbledon when leading against Jannik Sinner.

There have been contrasting reactions to Venus Williams being handed a wildcard for the US Open at 45.

The world No.577 is set to become the oldest singles player in 44 years at the tournament. On social media, many fans have argued it is a 'waste' of an entry.

But other believe the icon, who will also play in the revamped mixed doubles alongside fellow American Reilly Opelka, will help sell tickets in the early rounds.



Anna Kalinskaya complained about 'drunk' fans during her fourth-round match against Ekaterina Alexandrova at the Cincinnati Open.

Here's the moment the star approached the umpire to complain...

The former World No.6 was leading Rinderknech 7-6(4) 4-2 in their third round clash, when the Frenchman retired as he was unable to continue due to the heat. Rinderknech collapsed on the court in the second set, and subsequently threw in the towel soon after.

It feels like we're in an oven, even for the fans," said Auger-Aliassime. "We're always on the move and focused on trying to win, but the crowd is sitting for a long time, and so are our coaches. A friendly reminder to everyone: drink plenty of water, bring hats, and cool off as much as possible."



Carlos Alcaraz is at risk of being fined after ignoring the umpire's instructions to cover the logo on his water bottle.

During his win over Luca Nardi, the Spaniard reacted angrily after official Greg Allensworth gave the order, arguing it went against tournament sponsor deals. Alcaraz refused to comply and is now likely to be sanctioned.

Tennis

Hard-Court

Season

The U.S. Open has announced its singles wild cards for 2025, led by two-time champion Venus Williams, who will make her 25th main-draw appearance at the age of 45.

Williams, who made her return to tennis after 16 months out at July's Citi Open in Washington, D.C., won the tournament in 2000 and 2001. She beat then-world No. 35 Peyton Stearns in her first match back, before losing to Magdalena Fręch of Poland. She then received a wild card into the Cincinnati Open, where she lost to Jéssica Bouzas Maneiro of Spain.

Fellow Americans Clervie Ngounoue, Julieta Pareja and Alyssa Ahn also received direct wild cards. Pareja, 16, is the junior world No. 1, while Ngounoue, 19 and a former junior world No. 1 herself, posted her first WTA Tour main-draw win at this month's Cincinnati Open.

On the men's side Nishesh Basavareddy and Tristan Boyer received direct wild cards, along with Darwin Blanch. Basavareddy, 20, played in the Australian Open main draw earlier this year, taking a set off Novak Djokovic before losing in the opening round. Brandon Holt, who initially received a wild card, now has a place in the main draw after the withdrawal of Italy's Matteo Berrettini. Eliot Spizzirri, who beat João Fonseca in last year's qualifying event to make the main draw, takes Holt's wild card.

Caty McNally and Emilio Nava won the U.S. Tennis Association's “Wild Card Challenge,” which rewards performance in hard-court events in the run-up to the tournament. McNally, 23 who had elbow surgery in 2024, will make her first main-draw appearance since 2021; Nava, 23, last made the main draw in 2023.

Reciprocal arrangements with the French and Australian tennis associations see Caroline Garcia and Talia Gibson join the women's quotient, while Valentin Royer and Tristan Schoolkate round out the men's. Valerie Glozman of Stanford and Stefan Dostanic of Wake Forest won the college tennis wild card playoffs earlier this year, and also enter the main draw.

Of the home hopes, Blanch's selection stands out. Widely regarded as one of the most promising rising talents in American men's junior tennis, the 17-year-old did not receive a wild card last year. He did get into two ATP main draws through his links to IMG at the Madrid and Miami Opens, both of which are one rung below a Grand Slam. He lost 6-1, 6-0 to Rafael Nadal in Madrid.

The main draw begins Sunday Aug. 24 at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Centre in Flushing Meadows. Aryna Sabalenka and Jannik Sinner are the defending women's and men's singles champions.

Analysis from Charlie Eccleshare, tennis writer

Tennis wild card announcements are always fairly contentious, especially at the Grand Slams. Ordinarily, giving one to a 45-year-old who has barely played over the last year would fit squarely in that category.

But Venus Williams is a bit of a law unto herself, and the fact that she won a singles match against a top-40 player in her comeback event last month shows that she is not just planning to have a hit and giggle. Winning seven major titles also affords certain privileges, even if some will feel wildcards should be reserved for promising youngsters.

There are plenty of those on the list, and Darwin Blanch is particularly exciting, having long been spoken about as the next big thing in American men's tennis.

Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitová, who announced her retirement in June and said her plan was to retire at the U.S. Open, does not need a wild card after using her protected ranking. Caroline Garcia, who confirmed her own retirement a few weeks earlier, does get a wildcard, by taking one of the reciprocal ones that is awarded to a French player each year.

These reciprocal arrangements feel the opposite of wild, giving players from the most powerful tennis nations even more of a leg-up, instead of platforming a player from a comparatively underfunded country or region in the tennis world. At the end of a summer in which Victoria Mboko won the Canadian Open as a wild card, and Williams thrilled the Washington, D.C. crowd as one, all eyes will be on whether one of the fortunate 16 on today's list can do something similar in New York over the next couple of weeks.

Grand Slam tournaments are Novak Djokovic's main goals at this stage of his career, and the former world No.1 is doing everything he can to make tennis history once again, becoming the oldest player ever to triumph in a Major (a record currently held by Ken Rosewall).

The Serbian legend – who has not lifted a title of this importance since the 2023 US Open – has had the ability to raise his level in the most important events of 2025 and has reached the semifinals at the Australian Open, Roland Garros and Wimbledon Championships, but has failed to go further on any of these three occasions.

His decision to skip the Canadian Open in Toronto and the Cincinnati Masters 1000 has left everyone quite perplexed, considering that the 38-year-old from Belgrade will show up in New York without having played any official match on the hard courts since the Miami Open final against Jakub Mensik in the spring.

Over the past month, the 24-time Grand Slam champion has been having fun with his family and friends between Croatia and Greece before returning to practice in Montenegro. In addition, Nole ended up at the center of attention because his family - which owns the Belgrade ATP 250 - decided to move the tournament from the Serbian capital to Athens (Greece), generating discontent among his compatriots who criticized him for this choice.

In a recent interview with 'Sportklub', Serbian veteran Dusan Lajovic was asked if his compatriot Djokovic still has a chance to win a Grand Slam: "The truth is that for most other players not playing any tournament before a Major would have a negative effect, but Novak is special.

The first three rounds of a Major are almost a warm-up for a player like him, if you consider his results and statistics. It will be interesting to see what happens in New York."

Nole will also play the mixed doubles tournament together with Olga Danilovic and test his current level.

Wimbledon commentator Andrew Castle has claimed his spat with pundit Andre Agassi was taken "out of context" this summer.

The pair were live on air together for the men's semi-final between Carlos Alcaraz and Taylor Fritz when the cameras started panning to celebrities in the Royal Box.

Agassi, 55, grew increasingly exasperated as he tried to make an analytical point about Fritz's play. Castle frequently cut him off to point out the high-profile figures in attendance, with the American arguing: "I can't keep up with all the celebrities."

After Castle began talking about former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, Agassi lost patience and snapped: "People watching are watching for the tennis, not for this."

The comment went viral on social media, with the majority of fans siding with Agassi over the apparent dispute. However, Castle, 61, has now hit back by claiming the row was taken out of proportion.



"We had a laugh, and they took it out of context," he told Betway. "Afterwards, Andre sent me a text, saying what an unbelievable time he'd had, how he enjoyed it, and we were going to have him for the final but then he went into the Royal Box instead, but he had a great time."

Former professional player Castle has covered tennis for the BBC since 2003, and explained how he felt media coverage of the exchange was inaccurate and led to further criticism.

He added: "He (Agassi) was saying that tongue in cheek whilst smiling at me, and in the final, I didn't mention any celebrities at all.

"I mentioned the second row of the Royal Box, which had the former champions in that row and that's all I mentioned in the final, and there were people afterwards who said, ‘all I talk about is the celebrities'. It's not the case, people hear a commentator's voice sometimes in their own head."

Castle also cited the viewing figures for the men's Wimbledon final, which attracted 8.8million viewers, as proof that fans were happy with the coverage. Agassi wasn't assigned the final, but fans have called for him to be back on air at SW19 next year.

Prior to Wimbledon, he joined TNT Sports as a studio analyst for their inaugural coverage of the French Open. Last month, he also made a popular appearance on Andy Roddick's Served Media YouTube show.

Emma Raducanu is one of tennis' most scrutinised figures, plagued by her own success.

After all, having won the US Open back in 2021, she received a level of fame completely beyond her experience at the time.

Since then, she has been measured with an impossible yardstick, with expectations that the 22-year-old could not meet.

Frustratingly, this has seen not only her tennis, but her private life scrutinised too.

Even as recently as Wimbledon came a stark flashpoint, where Cam Norrie was asked a question during his press conference that took the tennis world aback.

It was a brazen, borderline embarrassing line of questioning that deservedly drew scrutiny. Emma Raducanu has now addressed it.

As her US Open partnership with Carlos Alcaraz had been announced, speculation over the nature of their relationship was rife.

This was only fuelled as the two practised together, taking part in the same brand deal as well.

However, Norrie was inexplicably dragged into this saga when asked: “We're trying to find out who is dating Emma Raducanu. It seems to be going round all the men's singles. I was just wondering if you are dating her, please?”

His answer was short: “I'm not, no.”

Now, speaking to The Guardian, Raducanu admitted: “Yeah, and Cam's questions, too. That was terrible. Terrible.”

“I know, I know. I guess I'm like, it comes with the territory, people being so curious. I think they're more curious about this news than any tennis results and tennis news. But I just keep myself to myself, my private life to one side. It's always funny when people try to find something out, but I try not to read into it so much.”

Raducanu impressed so much against Aryna Sabalenka in their recent Cincinnati Open match, in the latest in a long line of strong performances from the youngster.

It is an unforgiving position, the one Raducanu finds herself in.

After all, she was shot into the limelight well before she was ready, winning one of the sport's biggest honours before she had even begun developing.

Instantly, the world expected so much from her, and she simply did not have it to give.

Only now, after years of trial and error, has she seemingly found enough balance to get her fitness back on track, her technical assets slowly growing, and her mentality sharpening.

We are therefore starting to see consistent performances from the British number one, and in turn, consistent improvements in her ranking.

It has now been 12 tournaments since she suffered a first-round exit.

Raducanu has been scrutinised ever since her 2021 US Open triumph, almost exclusively undeservedly so. Now is the time to start focusing fairly on her career, as it has only really just properly begun after years of being stuck finding her feet under the enormous weight of pressure.

MASON, OH − There are six quarterfinal singles matches on tap Aug. 15 at the Cincinnati Open as the chase for the Rookwood Cup continues.

Ten seeded players will be in action Aug. 15, all on Center Court, beginning with WTA No. 3 seed Iga Swiatek facing No. 28 seed Anna Kalinskaya.

WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka will follow on Center Court in a top 10 matchup against Elena Rybakina.

ATP No. 2 Carlos Alcaraz puts his 14-match ATP 1000 winning streak against No. 9 seed Andrey Rublev to conclude the day session.

Follow live as The Enquirer provides real-time updates from the Lindner Family Tennis Center.

Elena Rybakina just dominated the first set against Aryna Sabalenka, 6-1.

Rybakina broke the WTA No. 1 twice and kept a 100%-win rate on the first serve.

Top-ranked WTA star and reigning Cincinnati Open champion Aryna Sabalenka is down 4-1 in the first set to No. 9 seed Elena Rybakina.

Rybakina has won 100% of points on the first serve thus far and tallied three aces.

Iga Swiatek is through to the Cincinnati Open semifinals for the third consecutive year after beating Anna Kalinskaya 6-3, 6-4.

Swiatek will face either WTA No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or WTA No. 9 seed Elena Rybakina for a spot in the final.

Iga Swiatek looked to be cruising through to the semifinals, but Anna Kalinskaya just survived four match points to stay alive. Swiatek leads 5-4 and will serve for the match.

WTA No. 3 Iga Swiatek has yet to lose a set at the Cincinnati Open and just took the opening set from Anna Kalinskaya, 6-3.

Swiatek dished out a pair of aces and won 86% of points on the first serve.

Each player held serve through three games on Center Court, though Anna Kalinskaya just needed a medical timeout before serving in the fourth game due to a calf injury.

Kalinskaya got her calf wrapped and is back on the court to serve to Swiatek, who leads 2-1.

Iga Swiatek, the WTA No. 3, opened her quarterfinals match with a powerful ace against Anna Kalinskaya and Day 11 of the Cincinnati Open is underway.

Swiatek is looking to reach the Cincinnati Open semifinals for the third consecutive year while Kalinskaya is bidding for her fifth career victory over a top 5 opponent.

The night session features two Cincinnati quarterfinal rematches, beginning with a top 5 ATP showdown with No. 3 seed and former Cincinnati Open champion Alexander Zverev meets No. 5 Ben Shelton.

Zverev beat Shelton in last year's Cincinnati quarterfinals.

To cap the night, No. 2 seed Coco Gauff will face No. 7 Jasmine Paolini. The two have split four career meetings, though Gauff cruised in straight sets against Paolini in the 2023 Cincinnati Open quarterfinals.

The full Order of Play, which includes doubles semifinals (WTA) and quarterfinals (ATP) can be found here.

The Enquirer will update this story.

A lot has been made of the hectic ATP schedule recently, as players continue to campaign for change.

Earlier this month, world number two Carlos Alcaraz said he wanted the ATP to remove events from the schedule, so players can have more time to rest and recover.

The Spaniard has been vocal about his concerns over the schedule, suggesting the concentration of events would lead to players getting injured.

Unfortunately, Alcaraz may have been right, as Russia's Karen Khachanov suffered a back injury recently, a problem that may well have been caused by the 29-year-old's quick turnaround from Toronto to Cincinnati.

After the match, Khachanov suggested it may be time for the ATP to look at the schedule, as he now hopes to recover from injury with the US Open fast approaching.

Khachanov and Alcaraz aren't the only players complaining, as it's clear to see that something needs to be done about the schedule.

Weighing in with his thoughts, Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley has proposed some radical changes to the tennis schedule.

During the latest episode of ‘The Tennis', Tiley shared an idea for the tennis schedule he and the other Grand Slam tournament directors have been working on.

“We have been working, the Grand Slams particularly have been working, to have a content at the top end of the tree, the top 100 players,” he said.

“Where it's very specific about the length and time of the events, the cities you play, eight to nine week proper off-season, strong narrative for the fans. Governed as one, you have the four Slams, another 11, 12 events, one team event, so you're maybe playing 16, 17 events.

“Then you have a feed-in system, where there are several times in the year, like in golf, where you compete to get your card, you compete to get yourself in the top 32, top 16, 56, whatever that number is going to be, then the fan kind of understands where you're going, what it means.

“You know, as a player, I've got that period I'm playing, then I've got that mid-season rest period, I've got the end of the season. There's too much sideshow stuff going on right now, and we've got to deal with the core.”

Tiley proceeded to outline what the ‘core' issues are, comparing how tennis and golf differ in that regard.

“The core is to get the narrative right, get the tour right, particularly on the top end, get the feeder system right. Everyone has a role to play. There are probably too many people involved in making decisions,” he said.

“At the end of the day, you've got your four pillars in the sport, like you have in golf. The four masters [majors] in golf, every golfer, it's absolutely history and tradition that they compete in the four masters. Similar to tennis, you have the four majors.

“But the difference in golf is that those four masters don't drive the economic powerhouse of the sport. They're only about 10% of the economic value. The other 90% is the PGA Tour. In tennis, it's about 55- 60% driven by the four majors, so it's an imbalance.

“The commercials of the tour need to pick up. But how that gets done is by creating an aggregate, by all coming together. It's hard to do it by yourself. There's a lot of good work that's been done by the tours over the years, but probably not enough.”

The 63-year-old believes player welfare has been ‘forgotten' over the years as the schedule became more packed, which is partly why he is suggesting reform.

“What gets forgotten in the player voice is player welfare, what gets forgotten in the player voice is the time to regroup, there's not a proper off-season. The element of player welfare is too low down on the priority list when we make decisions about the schedule,” said Tiley.

“Yes, there are commercial reasons for doing this. This is indicative of the poor organisation of our sport. We have seven governing bodies, each fighting for their own territory and their own position in the calendar.

“The coordination amongst those governing bodies is not at the level that it needs to be to be successful from a player's perspective.

“When a player goes into a longer Masters 1000 event and you're adding 21 days to the calendar, players want to play exhibitions in December, then they turn around a week later and start the year again, it's not right.”

Tiley certainly has some big plans, but what would his new schedule look like?

The South African didn't go into too much detail about how his ideal schedule would look, but with what he mentioned, it could be something like this.

Only time will tell if Tiley's ideas are ever put into practice, but it will certainly be something to look out for in the future.

The stars of the ATP Tour are currently competing at the Cincinnati Open Masters 1000 event, which is set to finish on Monday, August 18.

Goran Ivanisevic's opinion on how many Wimbledon titles Elena Rybakina should win has come to light following the pair's split.

Rybakina hired Ivanisevic as her coach at the end of the 2024 campaign having parted ways with long-time coach Stefano Vukov in August last year.

The Russian-born Kazakh star then made the shock revelation on January 1 that Vukov would be re-joining her coaching team.

Ivanisevic was reportedly “blindsided” by Vukov's return, but coached Rybakina at the Australian Open, where she reached the fourth round, losing to eventual champion Madison Keys.

The day after Rybakina's announcement, it emerged that Vukov had been suspended by the WTA Tour amid an investigation into a breach of their code of conduct. Vukov was handed a one-year ban in February, but he was cleared to resume coaching in the tour last week after a successful appeal.

Ivanisevic, who previously coached Novak Djokovic, confirmed he would not continue working with Rybakina after their collaboration in Melbourne.

“After our trial period that finished with Australian Open, I wish Elena and her team best of luck moving forward,” the 2001 Wimbledon champion wrote on Instagram.

Goran Ivanisevic issues ‘best player in the world' verdict after ‘sad and strange story' of Elena Rybakina split

Former world No 5 Anna Chakvetadze revealed what Ivanisevic recently said to her about Rybakina when she was interviewing the Croatian.

“When we interviewed Goran Ivanisevic, he said off-camera, ‘I don't understand, she (Rybakina) has such an amazing game, she should be winning more tournaments on grass, not one Wimbledon but three to four at least,” Chakvetadze said on a podcast with fellow former Russian WTA star Dinara Safina.

Rybakina won her only Grand Slam title to date at the 2022 Wimbledon Championships, where she came from a set down to beat Ons Jabeur in the final.

She was a quarter-finalist in her title defence at the All England Club in 2023, while she reached the last four in 2024. At Wimbledon this year, the 26-year-old suffered a surprise third round loss to Clara Tauson.

In March, Ivanisevic highlighted Rybakina's off-court situation as the reason he stepped down, while also lauding her ability as a player.

“It was a bit strange,” Ivanisevic said on a podcast with former Croatian footballer Slaven Bilic. “I won't talk much about it, but I can say that it's a bit of a sad and strange story.

“I consider her, even before I became her coach, at least for me, to be the best tennis player in the world. She plays the most beautifully, she plays the simplest and I really enjoyed it.

“Unfortunately, some things happened off the court that I couldn't control and I didn't want to be a part of that and part of that story and then I decided that it was best to quit. I wish her all the best in her career.”

It's been a year of change for Rublev, both on and off the court. On court, he's been more willing to step in and finish points at the net, while off of it he's been focused on mental health.“Well, for sure I did huge improvements, but in the end it's daily work, daily routine, daily challenge,” Rublev said in Cincinnati earlier this week. “(You need) to be aware (of yourself), and it's very challenging because it's easy to do everything automatic.”👉 Read More: "Both of us deserved to win": Andrey Rublev outlasts Alexei Popyrin in Cincinnati nailbiterThere's been staffing turnover too.

The two began working together in 2023 alongside Fernando Vicente, who remains head coach.“We have a really good relationship with him,” Rublev said. “Alberto is… really one of the nicest guys that I ever met. He's a really amazing coach. We didn't finish nothing in a bad way or something like that, but yeah we go our separate ways after Rome.”

Safin, a two-time Grand Slam champion, has known Rublev for years and the pair share a similar background—making them a natural, if eclectic, fit. Safin supported the 27-year-old last year when his mental health was at its lowest, and officially joined the team for the clay season. Despite being a steady presence at European tournaments, Safin missed the North American swing until now.“Everything is great,” Rublev said. “I like a lot his advices—just in general, the things that he sees, the way he sees those things, and that's it. Hopefully he's coming to US Open and we will have more memories.”For now, Rublev is still in the thick of Cincinnati—where every win this week has been personal payback:Second round: Defeated Learner Tien 7-6 (4), 6-3, avenging his Washington, D.C. opening-round upsetThird round: Defeated No. 21 seed Alexei Popyrin 6-7 (5), 7-6 (6), 7-5 in a three-hour, 30-minute battle, reversing their 2024 Canada Open (Montreal) final result.Fourth round: Defeated Francisco Comesana 6-2, 6-3, avenging his shock 2024 Wimbledon first-round loss to the Argentine.

Next up: a Friday quarterfinal with No. 2 seed Carlos Alcaraz—and another opportunity for revenge. The Spaniard beat Rublev in the Wimbledon fourth round earlier this summer, rallying from a set down to extend his head-to-head lead to 3-1.“(I learned) that I must keep working, that I'm on the right path and this is the level that I need to aim for to be able to compete,” Rublev told Bolshe! about the Wimbledon loss. “At that level, one or two points and you get broken. Against players like that, you have to play at that level for four and a half hours without losing focus even slightly. That's what I'm aiming for.”No. 9 seed Rublev will face Alcaraz in the Cincinnati Open quarterfinals on Friday—tune in on Tennis Channel.

It's been labelled ‘Alcaranu' by fans and scrutinised by pundits. But now, the potential mixed doubles partnership between Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz at this month's US Open could be in serious doubt.

The pair are scheduled to join forces for the revamped format in Flushing Meadows. However, the current Cincinnati Open could now well scupper that plan. While Raducanu is already out of the tournament, Alcaraz faces Andrey Rublev tonight for a place in the semi-finals.

Despite searing temperatures in Ohio, the tournament has also been dealt a backlog of matches this week after extreme storms curtailed play on Tuesday. The men's final is scheduled for Monday, with the Spaniard and world No.1 Jannik Sinner on course for another showdown following their epic battles at the French Open and Wimbledon.

Sinner has agreed to play with Emma Navarro in the mixed doubles event, which this year takes place during the week before the US Open. However, it starts less than 20 hours after the Cincinnati Open final, which could be delayed if further storms hit.



Another gruelling match between the world's two best male players is likely to leave them in doubt for the mixed doubles. Both took a prolonged break following SW19 this year, citing fatigue, and would have noted the likes of Coco Gauff opting to skip the team event to focus on her individual preparation.

“For me, it was just because I know the free week of the US Open is already packed for me, for sponsor things, and it was just like a whole other thing,” she explained. “So, I didn't want to waste mental energy on that.”

Former British player Barry Fulcher has cast further doubt on big-name stars competing, despite being confirmed by organisers. He told Tennis 365: “This exhibition event will be great fun, but it is not a Grand Slam and it shouldn't be viewed as such.

“It's not just about the prize money, but more about removing a mixed doubles Grand Slam opportunity. I will be fascinated to see how many of those 16 pairings that were announced a few weeks ago will turn up and play.”

There has been plenty of buzz for the refurbished mixed doubles event at the US Open, which will see the best players in the world in both the ATP and WTA draws match up for a quick, competitive fight the week before the singles draw begins at Flushing Meadows.

The format will see the mixed doubles event shifted to the week before the main draw begins, meaning the players will be able to accommodate more time to grow the doubles side of the game before their focus shifts to their bread and butter. Players such as Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, and Iga Swiatek have all been drafted to play — but a scheduling wrinkle might force this revamped doubles tournament to be short of its star names.

The issue arises from how close the end of the ongoing Cincinnati Masters tournament is to the start of the doubles tournament in New York. The finals in Ohio are slated for Monday 18 August, instead of the typical Sunday, while the first day of the doubles tournament is set for the Wednesday following that — a very quick turnaround.

With the US Open set to begin on August 25, that means there will be minimal period of rest for any players who reach the Cincinnati final, are tasked to compete in the doubles tournament, and will have aspirations of going deep in the US Open.

This includes both Sinner and Alcaraz, currently in the latter stages of that tournament, with Sinner already through to the semifinal and Alcaraz set to play his quarterfinal today. Sinner was set to be paired with American star Emma Navarro, while Alcaraz has a high-profile partnership with Emma Raducanu on the cards.

The two best players in men's tennis could be set for a titanic clash on Monday night, which means they will have a sharp turnaround to reach New York for the doubles. With the singles tournament starting a week after, and both players favourites to lift that title as well, the doubles might well go on the backburner.

The same could be true for Iga Swiatek, who is in the latter rounds of the Cincinnati event as well, and is set to play alongside Casper Ruud in New York next week. Swiatek's greatest rivals, Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff, will not be playing the doubles events: Sabalenka refused a different partner after he original teammate Grigor Dimitrov has to withdraw due to injury, while Gauff cited prior commitments in the lead up to her home slam as the reason for her own withdrawal.

With Swiatek's opponents earning an extra week's rest ahead of the singles tournament, it wouldn't be a surprise to see her request some extra time off to prepare, and the same could be true for either or both of Sinner and Alcaraz. The much-hyped mixed doubles tournament has some uncertain days ahead.

World No. 136 Terence Atmane fears no opponent.

 

One day after toppling Taylor Fritz, the French qualifier upset another Top 10 star, Holger Rune, to extend his dream run at the Cincinnati Open.

  

The lefty earned a 6-2, 6-3 victory Thursday evening to reach his maiden ATP Masters 1000 semi-final and set a showdown with World No. 1 and defending champion Jannik Sinner.

“I don't think any words can describe how I feel right now,” Atmane said. “It's pretty insane to be honest. I cannot believe it. Being here in the semi-finals of a Masters 1000, breaking into the Top 100 and even more with the win tonight — it's also a lot of money for me, so it's going to be very helpful for my career. It means a lot to me. I'm very emotional about it.”

 

Atmane punished the ball with his forehand, firing 14 winners from that wing, and showcased his all-court athleticism, gliding effortlessly across the court en route to a convincing one-hour, 13-minute win. The 23-year-old entered the tournament with a 1-4 tour-level record for the season and is now up 67 places to No. 69 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, setting him up for a new career high.

“I couldn't really sleep last night with the win against Taylor,” Atmane said. “I was just trying to be myself on court, trying to enjoy it as much as I can because I have nothing to lose, that's the advantage I have of being the underdog here coming from the qualies. I think this is going to give me a lot of confidence for the rest of the year and in my career in general.”



By reaching the last four, Atmane has earned $332,160 in prize money. He entered the tournament with $310,376 for the season.

Atmane rarely allowed the seventh-seed Rune any chances on return, dropping just five points behind his first serve (28/33), according to Infosys ATP Stats. He created 11 break chances of his own, converting seven, to become the first Frenchman to reach the Cincinnati semi-finals since Richard Gasquet in 2019. Atmane is the eighth lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 semi-finalist in series history.

Matteo Berrettini has joined the growing list of tennis stars withdrawing from the U.S. Open as his injury woes persist.

The Italian ace, who hasn't competed since his Wimbledon appearance, has been battling abdominal problems throughout the entire season. Berrettini has faced a torturous period in recent years due to persistent injuries, causing his world ranking to nosedive dramatically.

Berrettini becomes the second ex-Top 10 star to pull out of the U.S. Open - the final tennis major championship of the year - this week following Grigor Dimitrov's Tuesday withdrawal. Dimitrov's absence also caused Aryna Sabalenka, his doubles partner, to withdraw from the mixed event.

Brandon Holt will take Berrettini's spot in the main draw, while the American's wild-card position has been awarded to Eliot Spizzirri. Venus Williams also secured a wild card in the women's competition.

Following that setback, Berrettini has battled through difficulties, with injuries completely disrupting his performance.

He hasn't taken the court since Wimbledon, where Poland's Kamil Majchrzak knocked him out in the opening round across five grueling sets.

"I have to see exactly what happened in the match before saying anything incorrect or what I am thinking right now," the 29-year-old commented after his SW19 departure.

"Tennis has been very tough for me these past few months. I am very sorry for the people who helped me get to this tournament; they did everything possible.

"Honestly, this is not the way I want to be on the court, I don't enjoy being there. I need to take some time and think about my future. It is clear to me that this is not how I like to spend my time on the court."

Berrettini was absent from Roland Garros earlier this year due to a right oblique injury, marking his seventh Grand Slam absence in the past four years.

The Italian tennis star's most notable achievement at the U.S. Open was in 2019 when he made it to the semi-finals.

Despite being ranked No. 59 globally, he's had a challenging season, with his best performance being in Miami where he made it to the quarterfinals.

The U.S. Open singles matches kick off in New York on Aug. 24.

The second day of ATP quarterfinal action in Cincinnati brings two intriguing matchups that feel like they could go the distance. One is a battle between two explosive shot-makers who know each other's games well. The other is a rematch of a rivalry that's already produced some memorable encounters this season. With both matches featuring players in varying shades of form and confidence, the margins could be razor-thin. Who do you back to book their place in the final four?

Head-to-Head: Zverev 3–0 Shelton

Ben Shelton's run has been powered by booming serves, quick-strike forehands, and the boost of a home crowd that has been firmly behind him. He's been unafraid to go after his shots, even when matches have tightened up, which has kept opponents under constant strain. 

Alexander Zverev, meanwhile, has cruised through his matches with a combination of precise serving and controlled aggression from the baseline. He's been winning the majority of the longer rallies this week, a sign of his confidence and fitness. The two have already faced each other twice this season, both times producing long, physical battles with little to separate them. With the stakes higher and both playing well, another tense, momentum-shifting contest feels almost inevitable. Their sole hard court meeting came here at this stage last year, with Zverev narrowly winning in three sets. Given how much time the American has spent on court over last last four weeks, I fully expect the World no. 3 to have too much for him.
Prediction: Zverev in 3

Head-to-Head: Alcaraz 3–2 Rublev

Carlos Alcaraz has looked sharp this week, building on the consistency he showed throughout the grass season. His early wins here have been efficient, showing patience in baseline rallies and mixing in his trademark variety. Andrey Rublev, by contrast, came into the tournament after a stretch of mixed results, but his ball-striking in Cincinnati has been much cleaner. He's been stepping into the court more, taking time away from opponents and serving well enough to protect his lead when ahead in sets. Alcaraz leads their head-to-head 3–2, with their latest meetings being decided by narrow margins, so this one could come down to who manages the big points better under pressure and I fully expect the Spaniard to do so.
Prediction: Alcaraz in 2

Aryna Sabalenka has put Belarusian tennis back at the top of the women's circuit, but decades ago, one player stood as the true symbol of the country: Natasha Zvereva.

Born in Minsk, when it was still part of the Soviet Union, Zvereva became a standout both on and off the court, speaking out against her government long before the fall of the Berlin Wall and standing up for what she believed was fair.

On the court, Zvereva had a remarkable singles career—including a historic match against Steffi Graf—but it was in doubles where she truly cemented her legacy. She formed a legendary partnership with Gigi Fernandez and also won titles alongside other iconic players like Pam Shriver and Martina Hingis.

Sports held a special place in the Soviet Union, and Natasha Zvereva quickly rose through the ranks to make her mark on the professional tennis circuit. Turning pro in 1988, she made an immediate impact by reaching the Roland Garros final that same year, where she faced one of the greatest players of all time, Steffi Graf. The match went down in history for its sheer dominance, with Graf defeating Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 in just 32 minutes.

Despite that historic loss, Zvereva went on to build an impressive singles career that spanned from 1988 to 2002. She reached her career-high ranking in June 1989, climbing to No. 5 in the world.

Zvereva captured four WTA singles titles: Brisbane in 1990, Sydney later that same year, Chicago in 1994, and Eastbourne in 1999. Interestingly, she never won a clay-court tournament—the very surface where she first rose to prominence with her Roland Garros final appearance at just 17 years old.

Alongside her singles success, Zvereva left an even bigger mark in doubles. She won an astounding 80 women's doubles titles, in addition to several mixed doubles championships. Zvereva also earned an Olympic bronze medal in Barcelona in 1992, teaming with Leila Meskhi.

She reached the world No. 1 ranking in doubles and claimed a total of 20 Grand Slam titles: 18 in women's doubles—mostly alongside Gigi Fernandez, but also with Martina Hingis, Larisa Neiland, and Pam Shriver—and two in mixed doubles, one with Jim Pugh at the 1990 Australian Open and another with Rick Leach at the 1995 Australian Open.

Born in Minsk—now the capital of Belarus, but then part of the Soviet Union—Zvereva turned professional in 1988. Just a year later, she publicly challenged a controversial Soviet policy that paid athletes a fixed monthly salary while keeping their prize money.

In 1989, after losing the Hilton Head final to Steffi Graf, legendary journalist Bud Collins handed Zvereva her runner-up check. Her response was blunt: “This is just a piece of paper,” a pointed remark highlighting that she would never see that money.

In 2010, Zvereva and longtime doubles partner Gigi Fernandez were inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame. Speaking at the ceremony, Zvereva said, “I'm very proud to be the first player born in Belarus to be included in the Tennis Hall of Fame. I have to say, without Gigi's mentality, we would never have made it here. I never imagined we could achieve something like this—I was just playing tennis”. Zvereva also served as captain of the Belarusian women's team competing in the Billie Jean King Cup, further cementing her legacy both on and off the court.

Ben Shelton continued his red-hot streak Thursday at the Cincinnati Open, where he ousted Czech Jiri Lehecka 6-4, 6-4 to reach the quarter-finals. A week removed from winning his biggest career title at the ATP Masters 1000 in Toronto, the 22-year-old became the first American man to reach the last eight in Canada and Cincinnati in the same season since Mardy Fish in 2012.

"I'm hungry. I'm in a good rhythm," Shelton said when asked about the key behind his nine-match winning streak. "I'm playing good tennis and my body feels good. I think the confidence along with not being satisfied, wanting to prove myself over and over every time that I'm out on the court, and having things that I want to get better at is a huge motivation for me and it pushes me every match."



Amidst warm afternoon conditions in Cincy, Shelton's booming serve raced through the court. The lefty dropped just six points behind his first delivery, including a 141 mph ace when serving out the match. Shelton crucially broke Lehecka's serve at 4-4 in each set and the fifth seed advanced after one hour, 21 minutes.



Shelton will next aim for his maiden win against third seed Alexander Zverev, who leads the American 3-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, including two meetings this year. If Shelton defeats Zverev, it would also guarantee his Top 5 debut in the PIF ATP Rankings.

Boasting a 35-6 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, Shelton has not dropped a set across three matches this tournament. The three-time tour-level titlist is determined to keep raising his level.



“Tennis is a game that's not about perfection. You lose almost every week you play. You lose almost half the points you play. For me, I'm just trying to find those one-percents, get a little bit better every day," Shelton said. "I love playing here in Cincinnati, so it's a huge opportunity for me to compete against some of the best players in the world.”

The contestant on the 2000s MTV reality show claimed Diddy groped her breast and committed a wide range of other legal wrongdoing.

Sean “Diddy” Combs is on a legal roll.


	Six weeks after the rapper was largely acquitted on federal criminal charges, he's won a ruling dismissing most of a $60 million civil sexual assault lawsuit filed by “Making the Band 2” contestant Sara Rivers.


	Rivers, who became a member of hip-hop group Da Band, sued Combs in earlier this year – accusing him of sexually harassing and groping her during the filming of the 2000s MTV reality show.


	But in a ruling issued Thursday, Judge Jed Rakoff dismissed 21 of the 22 counts in her lawsuit, including racketeering, assault and battery, forced labor, and false imprisonment. Those accusations were dismissed with prejudice – meaning they are permanently tossed.


	The judge declined to permanently dismiss a single count, accusing Combs of violating New York City's Gender Motivated Violence Protection Act. The judge said he would wait to decide that count until a federal appeals court rules on key questions about how that law functions.


	“From the outset, we have said these claims were meritless, time-barred, and legally deficient,” said Combs' attorney Erica Wolff. “The Court agreed, finding no legal basis to allow them to proceed. We are pleased the Court carefully analyzed and swiftly dismissed these baseless claims.”


	Combs was largely acquitted last month in a blockbuster federal criminal case that accused him of forcing girlfriends to partake in drug-fueled sex marathons with prostitutes called “freak-offs.” Jurors found him not guilty on racketeering (RICO) and sex-trafficking charges, the core of the government's case which could have sent him to prison for life.


	Jurors did convict Diddy on lesser charges of interstate prostitution, which could still land him in prison for several years when he's sentenced in October. And he's still facing dozens of civil lawsuits from other alleged victims, accusing him of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment and various other forms of sexual abuse.


	Rivers was one of those alleged victims. In a February lawsuit, she claimed that Combs cornered her in a recording studio and “ran his left hand across her breasts.” She also claimed that he later blackballed her in the music industry in retaliation for rebuffing his advances.


	Judge Rakoff did not provide a written ruling explaining his decision; he said he would issue one at some point in the future “in due course.”

EXCLUSIVE: Core Scary Movie actresses Regina Hall and Anna Faris are coming back as Brenda and Cindy, respectively, for the Wayans Brothers' restart of the early millennium comedy franchise.


	Said Hall and Faris, “We can't wait to bring Brenda and Cindy back to life and be reunited with our great friends Keenen, Shawn and Marlon — three men we'd literally die for (in Brenda's case, again).”


	The new Scary Movie is a big reunion, bringing the Wayans brothers back together for the first time in 18 years to write an all-new original script for the series, co-penning the Miramax production with Rick Alvarez. Scary Movie is prepping for an October shoot in time for a June 12, 2026 global theatrical release via Paramount. Miramax has a first-look deal with Paramount.

	











	Timing is everything in comedy, and a new Scary Movie couldn't arrive at a better time in theaters when horror movies have hit saturation this year. The genre is screaming for a pie to be thrown in its face.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The near $900 million-grossing Scary Movie film franchise was developed by Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans and Keenen Ivory Wayans. The latter wrote and directed the first two films, and will return to produce the upcoming chapter. Marlon and Shawn wrote and starred in the first two films. 


	This will be the sixth film in the franchise, with Michael Tiddes set to direct. Tiddes is a longtime Wayans collaborator, starting as an assistant on White Chicks. He directed a trio of Wayans films – the satirical horror comedy A Haunted House and the Netflix hit movies Naked and Sextuplets. Tiddes is repped by Artists First and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher.


	Miramax's Jonathan Glickman, Alexandra Loewy and Thomas Zadra are executive producing.


	The Scary Movie comedies span fives movies, the first being in released in 2000 when it was one of the highest-grossing R-rated horror movies of all time back in the day. The original also set the box office opening record for an R-rated horror movie at $42.5 million.

	











	The Independent Artist Group-repped Hall next stars in Paul Thomas Anderson's Warner Bros movie One Battle After Another with Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro, hitting theaters on September 26. She's also starring in Nick Stoller's Judgment Day with Will Ferrell and Zac Efron. She is currently in production on The Five Star Weekend for Peacock, opposite Jennifer Garner, Chloë Sevigny, Gemma Chan and Timothy Olyphant. Additionally, she'll lead her voice to the upcoming The SpongeBob Movie: Search for Squarepants alongside Sherry Cola, Arturo Castro, George Lopez and Ice Spice.


	Faris is repped by Gersh, Range Media Partners and Sloane, Offer, Weber & Dern. Following her breakout in the Scary Movie series, she went on to star in and produce The House Bunny and Greg Araki's Smiley Face. She will next star in Spa Weekend. Other feature credits include The Dictator with Sasha Baron Cohen, Overboard, Just Friends and Oscar-winning titles Brokeback Mountain and Lost in Translation. Faris starred for eight seasons in the hit CBS sitcom Mom opposite Allison Janney and had memorable arcs on Friends and Entourage. She also penned the New York Times bestselling memoir Unqualified.

I'm 19 and have zero interest in this reboot. I love horror not comedy. The world today is too dangerous to waste time with comedy

Bros a bot for sure.

Nice! Cannot wait. They could also bring back Pam Anderson as Becca. She survived Scary Movie 3 after all.

Yes!!!!

We won.

That's amazing! These two have great chemistry together. Also would love to see Wayans brothers making fun of multiverse thing with Simon Rex coming back as both his characters. The one from SM3 & 4 and the one from SM5.

Experts weigh in on where the 27-year-old actress goes after being at the center of the storm involving an American Eagle jeans campaign that had everyone from Donald Trump to Lizzo sharing hot takes.



		By Chris Gardner, Danielle Directo-Meston 

	August 15, 2025 9:30am	




	‘Tis the season of Sydney Sweeney. It just now comes with an asterisk.


	The two-time Emmy nominated actress, producer, Ford aficionado and booked-and-busy brand partner is revving up for the busiest run of a still rising career. On the heels of a meaty role opposite Oscar winner Julianne Moore in the Apple TV+ movie Echo Valley, Sweeney has two films in theaters on back-to-back weekends in August: Tony Tost's Americana followed a week later by Ron Howard's period thriller Eden opposite Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby and Daniel Brühl.

Early footage of the latter film electrified CinemaCon audiences when it debuted in Las Vegas in April. Oh, and the final season of Euphoria, the show that made Sweeney a star, is on the horizon for early 2026.

	Who could have guessed that a seemingly harmless denim campaign would force a footnote on what could have been a glorious few months because of how it stirred up a surprise culture war that stretched from TikTok to the White House, with everyone from Lizzo to Donald Trump weighing in with an opinion. But that's what happened after American Eagle dropped its “Sydney Has Great Jeans” campaign July 23. It was designed as an ambitious partnership that included print ads, 3D billboards (including one on the Sphere in Las Vegas), Snapchat lens technology that allowed users to interact with a digital Sweeney, and a limited run of the “Sydney Jean” with 100 percent of the net proceeds donated to a nonprofit of the star's choice.

	











	Within days, a handful of TikTok users took offense to a campaign clip that features Sweeney saying (with unique inflection), “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.” The users claimed it promoted eugenics or was a form of Nazi propaganda because Sweeney is white, blond-haired and blue-eyed. While countless users dismissed the theories as nonsense, the dog pile had begun causing the hot takes to go viral. Mainstream media outlets picked up on the swirl and the coverage helped spread the controversy far and wide, from from late night to the White House. President Donald Trump clocked in after The Guardian reported that Sweeney registered as a Republican in Florida prior to the 2024 election.


	“Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the ‘HOTTEST' ad out there. It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are ‘flying off the shelves.' Go get ‘em Sydney!” Trump posted on Truth Social. “The tide has seriously turned — Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be.” His post came hot on the heels of American Eagle defending its campaign while pushing back on the narrative that there was any other message to the pun. “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans is and always was about the jeans,” the brand shared on Instagram on Aug. 1.


	Sweeney stayed silent. She still hasn't said a word about the campaign or its backlash — allowing American Eagle's statement to stand on its own as the brand reiterated that it was just a slogan about jeans and nothing more — but she did return to Instagram on Wednesday to promote Americana with a carousel of artistic behind-the-scenes images for her 25.3 million followers. “A few years ago I filmed this little movie with some friends and now you get to meet Penny Jo,” posted Sweeney, seen in many of the images that also feature Paul Walter Hauser and pop star turned actress Halsey. It's the only recent promotion for the film that Sweeney has done aside from hitting the red carpet for a premiere at L.A. venue Desert 5 Spot on Aug. 3. But that night, she only posed for photos before quickly ducking inside without speaking to reporters.

	It begs a question: What should Sweeney do now?


	Not much says Nathan Miller, CEO and founder of full-service strategic and crisis communications firm Miller Ink, which represents Fortune 500 companies and celebrities. “American Eagle played it reasonably well,” he explained, adding that the brand's response reflects the current culture. “The same brand five years ago would've apologized profusely and tried to move past it quickly. Instead, they stuck to their guns and stood by the campaign. It was irreverent enough without being offensive. What was great about it for Sweeney is that while it may have had everyone talking, she wasn't. Everyone was speaking about her, and she doesn't have to do anything.”


	But with a busy fall up ahead, she surely will have to speak at some point about her new films even if the first time she does field questions from the press is during a TIFF press conference. Asked how she should respond to the reveal about her voting record as a Republican, Miller said, again, she doesn't need to engage. “If it is authentic to her and she wants to be public about it, great, but she should not feel compelled to do so just because someone dug up her party registration. It's totally appropriate for her to say, ‘I don't discuss my politics, that's personal. I'm only here to talk about my movie.' And she doesn't lose. That's the safest strategy,” he noted, adding that on the flip side it is possible today to build a brand as a political celebrity as there have been plenty of examples on the left. Reaching across the aisle today only helps to widen one's appeal, Miller said.

	











	Lucy Robertson, head of brand marketing at Buttermilk, an agency that specializes in creator marketing, said the American Eagle campaign felt like a “misstep” for Sweeney because rather than leveraging her as a creative partner who helped shape the narrative. “It uses her as a convenient ‘hook' to hang the campaign on, in this case, with a tone-deaf ‘good genes' message that quietly reinforces Eurocentric beauty ideals like white skin, blonde hair, blue eyes.”


	Robertson said that “real influence” in today's market comes from being “embedded in the creative ecosystem for the long-term” rather than just doing one-off endorsement deals. Sweeney has a long history of brand deals after having partnered with Laneige, Miu Miu, Armani Beauty, Kérastase, Heydude, Dr. Squatch and Baskin-Robbins.


	“Zendaya's partnership with On, for example, sets the benchmark. In that 14-month collaboration — set to be the first chapter of a multi-year partnership — she hasn't just starred in ads — she's co-designed the Cloudzone Moon sneaker, helped craft the visual story in the evocative ‘Be Every You' campaign, and shaped how her identity and movement translate into both product and storytelling,” Robertson explained of Sweeney's Euphoria co-star. “That level of integration deepens cultural currency where we've seen Sydney front multiple brand campaigns in a short space of time, the result can feel more transactional than transformative.”

	











	A well-placed legal source familiar with negotiating A-list brand deals says it may be too soon to tell whether the social media swirl will affect Sweeney's future partnerships and acting gigs. Companies might prefer not to work with her if they believe consumers have Sweeney fatigue or if her exposure could tarnish their image. (Amid the American Eagle backlash, Baskin-Robbins disabled comments on its TikTok videos featuring Sweeney.) The expert notes their advice to clients varies based on star wattage and that there's a science to measuring celebrity. At a certain level of fame, too many product endorsements could dull one's A-list image, the source added, while others turn to international markets to keep cash flow coming in while avoiding being “everywhere” on their home turf. Meanwhile, brand deals are becoming a necessity for middle-of-the-road actors who are feeling the squeeze of studio consolidation with fewer available gigs.


	Matt Herbert, Chief Commercial Officer of brand tracking platform Tracksuit, tells The Hollywood Reporter that the reaction to AE's campaign “doesn't need to necessarily define AE, but it is about how they react from here on.” He cites Pepsi's controversial 2017 ad with Kendall Jenner that some called tone-deaf for using strikingly similar themes to Black Lives Matter protests. (The company later pulled the commercial online.)


	Tracksuit also found that brand awareness for another one of Sweeney's brand partnerships for Dr. Squatch saw that company boosted by three percentage points from August 2024 to July 2025. (Recall that the men's soap brand sold bars made with her actual bathwater due to popular demand.) The company also notes that “trendy” is a common theme associated with Laneige, Dr. Squatch and Miu Miu among survey respondents already familiar with all three brands. As for AE's bottom line, the company's next earnings report is Sept. 4, which could offer insight to how much of an impact, positive or negative, the controversy had on sales.

	











	Herbert notes that AE was “facing pretty big challenges over the past 18 months,” with brand awareness down by 6 percentage points from January 2024 to June 2025; and consideration, preference and usage declined by 5 percentage points. … any celebrity [endorsement or] brand activation is an attempt to drive relevance, which we know from looking at all of our tracking data.” 


	In the case of AE, “the news is so fresh, the conversation is so fresh, and we'll be keeping an eye [on the outcome of the campaign in] the coming months,” says Herbert. That could mean even more eyes on Sweeney and her upcoming projects, which in Hollywood is always a good thing.

The After Hours til Dawn Tour has grossed over $600 million and sold more than five million tickets so far. 


													By
												

	Eric Frankenberg



The Weeknd is on the road, playing shows in Nashville on Tuesday (Aug. 12) and Miami Friday and Saturday (Aug. 15-16). But as he nears the end of the ongoing After Hours Til Dawn Tour, he sets a Boxscore record. According to figures reported to Billboard Boxscore, the global trek has grossed $635.5 million and sold 5.1 million tickets since launching in 2022, becoming the biggest R&B tour in history.


	In doing so, The Weeknd overtakes Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour, which brought in $579.8 million over 56 shows in 2023. This swap comes just weeks after Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter Tour became the country record holder. In pure ticket sales, he has long passed Bruno Mars' 3.6 million on 2017-18's 24K Magic World Tour.


	The Weeknd crossed the $600 million threshold with his two performances at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field on July 30-31, bringing the tour full circle after launching at the same stadium on July 14, 2022. The After Hours Til Dawn Tour is the ninth tour to hit this benchmark, and the only one by an R&B artist or a Black artist. The other eight all trade in pop and rock, from Elton John's Farewell Yellow Brick Road Tour to Harry Styles' Love on Tour.


	The same goes for The Weeknd's R&B attendance record, making him the only genre act and only Black artist to sell more than five million tickets on a single tour. It is one of 11 tours to sell more than five million, and one of just eight to sell more than five million and gross more than $600 million.


	The After Hours Til Dawn Tour has sprawled worldwide, first in North America in 2022, then Europe and South America in 2023, Australia in 2024 and back to the United States and Canada in 2025. The current leg is the tour's biggest, at $243.3 million and 1.5 million tickets through Aug. 12. That marks a 64% increase over the previous North American leg and a 54% jump over the European leg, which was the tour's previous highlight ($158.1 million).


	By the tour's final show on Sept. 3 on San Antonio, this leg's earnings could surpass $300 million. The total tour take will approach $700 million, with ticket sales circling 5.5 million.


	The initial iteration of this tour may not have hit such hallowed ground. It was first announced in February 2020 in arenas in North America and Europe. But delayed by COVID-19 and then expanded far beyond, the After Hours Til Dawn Tour supports 2020's After Hours, 2022's Dawn FM and this year's Hurry Up Tomorrow. Since the launch of this extended tour era, The Weeknd notched four No. 1s on the Billboard Hot 100, including “Blinding Lights,” which was named the chart's biggest hit ever by the end of its 90-week run in 2021. Two of those No. 1s were alongside Ariana Grande, including “Die for You,” which reached the top seven years after its 2016 release via Starboy. Hurry Up Tomorrow debuted atop the Billboard 200 in February with 490,000 equivalent album units, scoring the biggest week of his career with his third album to surpass 400,000.


	The After Hours Til Dawn Tour is The Weeknd's longest trek, at 102 shows through Aug. 12, up from 63 reported dates on Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour in 2017. That 62% increase in the number of shows is significant, but it does not fully explain the 785% scale in total earnings, or the 508% leap in attendance. His jump from arenas to stadiums has nearly quadrupled his per-show ticket sales, compounded with a natural rise in ticket sales.


	Dating back to his first reported show at Montreal's Metropolis on March 23, 2012, The Weeknd has grossed $734 million and sold 6.3 million tickets from more than 200 reported concerts.

	Sixty years ago today, on August 15, 1965, the Beatles played Shea Stadium in New York, and the world has never recovered. It was the biggest pop explosion the world had ever seen, with 56,000 kids screaming for John, Paul, George, and Ringo. It's the most famous show they ever played — the most famous pop concert ever — even though nobody could hear a note of it. Other gigs have drawn far bigger crowds, made far more money. But Shea is still the ultimate image of fan hysteria — a massive swarm of Beatlemaniacs gathered together for a night of communal rapture, bonded in music, shrieking their lungs and brains out. The toppermost of the poppermost. The “yeah yeah yeah” of the gods. The biggest twist, with the loudest shout. 


	“It was the first time that anyone had played any of those stadiums,” Paul McCartney recalled in 2003. “It became kind of normal for people like the Floyd. We were playing through the baseball speakers and you couldn't hear a thing with the crowds screaming—those 56,000 ‘seagulls'.”

	











	But that doesn't mean Paul didn't love every second of it. “I think we just went a bit hysterical that night,” he said. “We couldn't believe where we were and what was going on, we couldn't hear a bloody thing and we thought ‘This isn't very good, but it's going down great.' The hysteria started to kick in. That was a great one.”

	But Shea was more than just the first high-profile stadium concert. It showed everyone how huge, untamable, crazed pop music could be. It destroyed the hopes of everyone who still thought the Beatles — and their young female audience — were just a passing fad, which was still the conventional adult wisdom in 1965. The Fabs couldn't be dismissed anymore, and neither could the girls. It shattered all the cliches about how show-biz was supposed to work. Never before had that many humans joined together in one place to celebrate music — and on a deeper level, to celebrate each other. That's why “Shea Stadium” is still the two-word code for the culmination of pop dreams at their loudest, lustiest, scariest, and most deranged.

	The Shea footage is still a shock to witness, no matter how many stadium shows you've seen in person or onscreen. The lads run up the dugout steps — their dressing room was the umpires' locker — to a sonic blast on the level of Krakatoa, a scream unlike any noise anyone there has heard. A cop clutches his hands to his ears in agony. The boys are dazed, walking, stumbling, weaving, looking around in shock. Big surprise: Paul is walking faster than the others, he can't wait to get there, He starts running, skipping, come on lads, John starts running too, let's go, it's all happening too fast but not fast enough for them. The cops hilariously back away from the band, in terror, never having seen or heard a scene like this before, because nobody ever has. John's the first one up the stairs to the stage. The very first thing they say, before greeting the crowd, is to greet each other: “Hello, Paul!” “Hello, John!” 


	Everything looks so rickety — this stadium wasn't built for pandemonium like this. The boys seem so tiny, the crowd so giant and ferocious. Everybody here tonight — except the cops—has dreamed of this moment for months, yet nobody even came close to picturing how it would actually sound or feel. Nobody was dreaming big enough. 


	“If you look at the footage, you can see how we reacted to the place,” Ringo recalled in the Anthology documentary. “It was very big and very strange.” Check out poor Ringo as he walks to the stage; he glances up, and you can see his knees buckle with vertigo. George is grinning so wide you're afraid his jaw might snap off. Two of the screaming fans out there in the crowd would end up as Beatle wives — Linda Eastman McCartney and Barbara Bach. Olivia Arias Harrison did her screaming a few days later, at the Hollywood Bowl. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were in the house at Shea — probably the two most jealous people there.

	It's the scream that makes the Shea legend, more than anything else — the girls are amplifiers for each other, making their collective yeeeaaaaah louder than a hundred thousand lungs have any right to be. At countless solo shows, Paul has asked the ladies in the house, “Give me a great big Beatles scream!” It's one thing to say that in a stadium — yet I saw him say it earlier this year at NYC's Bowery Ballroom, even though it's a bar that holds only a few hundred people. It doesn't matter. Wherever strangers gather to scream for music, we are all Shea Stadium.

	











	This kind of joyful noise didn't usually happen at Shea, home of the New York Mets, then the most famous terrible team in baseball history. They went 50-112 that season. But the Beatles, never sports fans even in their boyhoods, didn't know or care a thing about America's pastime. The first time they played a baseball park, in Kansas City in 1964, they mocked the whole sport at a press conference where Paul snickered, “Great game!” Ringo summed it up: “You throw the ball, and then another ten minutes you have a cigarette and throw another ball.” 


	The Met are celebrating the anniversary tonight by giving out replicas of Shea Stadium to fans at Citi Field, where they're playing the Mariners. They'll also have a Beatles tribute band playing before the game. Shea was demolished in 2009, but fittingly, Paul McCartney played the last music ever heard there. He crashed a Billy Joel song for the final two songs, “I Saw Her Standing There” and “Let It Be.” In a very Macca touch, he played the same Hofner bass he played there in 1965. 


	Ed Sullivan introduced them at Shea, looking pitifully out of place, like they dug him up for the occasion. Paul was the only one to acknowledge him or shake his hand. They went on at 9:16 pm, after a surprisingly down-market string of opening acts: Motown soul singer Brenda Holloway, sax legend King Curtis, Cannibal & the Headhunters, Sounds Incorporated, the pre-fame Young Rascals (still six months away from their first hit, “Good Lovin'”). It was the first live show of their brief but eventful U.S. jaunt—over the next couple of weeks, they met their idol Elvis Presley in Beverly Hills, and dropped acid at a pool party with the Byrds and Peter Fonda. (John turned the experience into “She Said She Said.”)


	They played an eccentric half-hour set, skipping their biggest crowd-pleasers — no “She Loves You,” no “I Want To Hold Your Hand,” no “I Saw Her Standing There.” Bizarrely, yet gloriously, they played “Baby's in Black,” a song John and Paul always loved to sing together, sharing a microphone and dueling eyeball to eyeball. They insisted on keeping it in their live show right up to their final gig, even though it was never a hit, not even a single, just a ditty that nobody loved the way these two boys did, for reasons they never divulged. The full set list: “Twist and Shout,” “She's a Woman,” “I Feel Fine,” “Dizzy Miss Lizzy,” “Ticket to Ride,” the George showcase “Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby,” “Can't Buy Me Love,” “Baby's In Black,”  Ringo's vocal “Act Naturally,” “A Hard Day's Night,” “Help!”, and the B-side screamer “I'm Down.” 

	











	They played Shea Stadium again a year later, in August 1966, but by then, the fun had fizzled out of touring for them. The Fabs were in their final days as a live band, playing their last-ever show less than a week later. Incredibly, the 1966 Shea gig wasn't even sold out — didn't come close. But when we talk about Shea Stadium, we're talking about that day in August 1965, and the way it lives on as a permanent part of pop culture. It still represents the standard every pop star aspires to reach. “Now it's quite commonplace for people to play Shea Stadium or Giants Stadium and all those big places, but this was the first time,” Paul said in the 1995 Anthology. “It seemed like millions of people, but we were ready for it. They obviously felt we were popular enough to fill it. Once you go onstage and you know you've filled a place that size, it's magic. Just walls of people.”


	One night, at one of these giant U.S. shows, their manager Brian Epstein lived out a secret fantasy he'd always had. He sneaked out into the crowd, stood unnoticed in the back with everybody else, and shrieked his head off, the way he'd always wanted to. You look at Shea Stadium, or listen to the havoc going on, and you get swept up in that orgiastic frenzy. “Half the fun was being involved in this gigantic event ourselves,” McCartney said. “I don't think we were heard much by the audience. The normal baseball-stadium PA was intended for: ‘Ladies and gentlemen, the next player is…' But that was handy in that if we were a bit out of tune or didn't play the right note, nobody noticed. It was just the spirit of the moment. We just did our thing, cheap and cheerful, ran to a waiting limo and sped off.”

	Full disclosure: I once had a shrink who went to Shea. She casually mentioned it once during a session, and I couldn't let her change the subject back to my issues, now could I? I grilled her on every last detail. She was a Paul girl, obviously. Those four specks of brown, on the field of grass. She couldn't hear a note, couldn't name a single song they played. Couldn't see their faces. But she knew one of those four specks was Paul. Maybe it was dumb to waste an entire session on those stories—yet I suspect it was one of the most productive therapy sessions I'd ever had.


	But that's why Shea Stadium remains the most iconic concert ever — it's the ultimate symbol of pop thrills at their most gigantic, their most absurdly excessive. It's far beyond any success the Beatles used to fantasize about back in Liverpool. It 's far beyond the fan's dreams of how wild and ecstatic a musical gathering could be. The Fabs look at this crowd the way F. Scott Fitzgerald described Dutch sailors looking at America at the end of The Great Gatsby — face to face for the last time in history with something commensurate to their capacity for wonder. And the crowd stares at the Beatles the same way. Sixty years later, that crazy night at Shea Stadium still defines pop music at its most outrageously alive.

The U.K. singer-songwriter reveals how her career changed following her Saltburn movie synch.


													By
												

	Andrew Unterberger



	U.K. singer-songwriter Sophie Ellis-Bextor is coming off a year in which she felt “like after you have a glass of champagne and you're a bit heady.” After her 2001 disco-pop classic, “Murder on the Dancefloor,” was revived by its use in 2023 black comedy Saltburn, the song once again became a global smash, reaching the Billboard Hot 100 for the first time in the United States (peaking at No. 51) and matching its 25-year-old No. 2 peak in the United Kingdom.


	After spending a year flaunting her new commercial appeal — including on her first-ever U.S. tour — Ellis-­Bextor returns with Perimenopop. Out Sept. 12, the album features 12 sparkling dancefloor jams as intoxicating, clever and honest as its title, as well as collaborators such as disco legend Nile Rodgers.

	“Thanks to ‘Murder,' I basically just wrote a wish list,” she says, “and I completely took advantage of the fact that I could then get in the studio with people who maybe might not have [otherwise] had time.”




What was the craziest moment from the entire ­“Murder” revival?


	That's easy: It's definitely the fact that I've now done gigs in America. In the beginning of last year, I'd never done so much as a radio interview. I started those gigs thinking, “Is this going to be a room full of people waiting for me to sing one song?” But I was met with a lot of people who clearly had been supporting what I'm up to from far away.


I have to say, Perimenopop — album title of the year. How did you come up with it?


	For me and all my girlfriends in our mid-40s, there's a bit of a narrative about some aspects that might sound a bit gloomy. And I just wanted something that would flip the script on it a little bit — and also invite into the room the fact that I'm not the way I was when I was 20. I think it's also quite a good indicator of how much more ballsy I've gotten as I've gotten older. But how lucky am I that I've been able to have a career long enough to feel that comfortable?


What was it like working with Nile Rodgers?


	To hear all the stories and just be imbued with someone [who] direct-line influenced and inspired me so much was really cool. I think my favorite bit was Nile talking about Madonna, and I said, “Have you seen her recently?” He went, “Yeah, we went roller skating together.”


Are you liking what you're seeing from the rest of the U.K. pop world these days?


	What happened with Charli xcx and brat is ­obviously so brilliant. But also what I love about it is it really lets the mask fall. And I think teenage me would have completely resonated with that. We talked about a Brat Summer, and I think in my head I was like, “Well, maybe Perimenopop is your autumn?”

The murder of British student Meredith Kercher in 2007 has a different name unfairly associated with it, that of her former roommate, Amanda Knox, who was arrested along with her Italian boyfriend for allegedly committing the crime. By 2011, after being subjected to consistently shoddy tabloid coverage, their initial convictions were overturned, and she arrived home to Seattle to a continued media frenzy. In 2016, a Netflix documentary delved into the time she spent in prison and the appalling ways in which the cops treated her and Raffaele Sollecito. Most recently, Knox's conviction of slander against her boss in Perugia was upheld earlier this year. She's also authored a couple of memoirs, hosted podcasts, and even made a cameo in Peacock's Laid in 2024. Knox has been in the spotlight for almost two decades, with her well-known saga now being told in a Hulu limited series (that she produced and was actively involved with).  

The Twisted Tale Of Amanda Knox won't strike anyone familiar with the situation as particularly shocking or illuminating. The eight installments retell her experiences as a 20-year-old vilified by the press, the prosecutor, and the public, as well as her fight for freedom and attempts to convince the world she did not kill Kercher. Despite only a few fresh insights, the show is a pretty moving condemnation of the botched investigation and language barrier that put her behind bars, not to mention the unscrupulous ways in which her behavior was scrutinized in a rush to declare her a culprit. Crucially, it digs into the emotional and mental aftermath on Knox (Grace Van Patten), Sollecito (Giuseppe De Domenico), and their respective families. The true-crime saga is anchored by a powerful lead, but there's no denying that Twisted Tale is a double-edged sword. 

Enough attention has already been given to Knox's tribulations, partially because she's a white American woman who seemed to captivate everyone. A made-up narrative about her sex-fueled adventures spun out of control to attract more eyeballs—she was maligned with the nickname Foxy Knoxy—while the actual victim or the offender, Rudy Guede, barely made headlines. (In the aforementioned doc, The Daily Mail‘s Nick Pisa talks about why she was an appealing subject, whether guilty or not, as opposed to anyone else.) Hulu's series addresses these problems infrequently but also contributes to them by focusing almost entirely on stuff we've seen, heard, and read about before. Twisted Tale raises the unavoidable question of why it dredges up a story that's already been examined in different ways, especially when there are numerous falsely imprisoned folks (disproportionately people of color) who do not receive a fraction of the consideration this specific case has gotten for 18 years and counting. 

The project is at least self-aware, with series creator K.J. Steinberg (This Is Us) and writer Sam Rubinek (Daisy Jones & The Six) tackling these issues—albeit not for long enough to make their points feel substantial. Similarly, the miniseries pays tribute to Kercher through a few voiceovers (although her family isn't involved and has questioned the show's purpose), but this is ultimately Knox's story. With that in mind, episodes two, six, and eight are particularly tough to sit through, with Van Patten giving a captivating performance. The Tell Me Lies actor sinks her teeth into the role, delivering an effective portrayal of Knox at various stages of this nightmare—from the naivete of an exchange student willing to help the police she thought would protect her to the grit of someone who has to fight long and hard to clear her name to the isolation of being an exoneree. 



The second stressful hour of the show features Knox's lengthy interrogation, with director Michael Uppendahl (Mad Men) framing the scene to highlight the character's claustrophobia. Several officers, including lead prosecutor Giuliani Mignini (Francesco Aquaroli), surround Amanda and pressure her to “remember” events that never happened for hours without a pause, which leads to a breakdown that derails her life. Pivotal moments like this and a conversation between Amanda and Mignini in the finale help bring heft to this series. And on the acting front, Sharon Horgan is equally potent as Amanda's devoted mother, Edda Mellas, striking the fine balance of helplessness and vigor. 

But the big problem with The Twisted Tale, which can indeed feel impactful with its depictions of media harassment and police misconduct, is that it wants it both ways: The miniseries aims to point a finger at a global audience that was drawn to the salaciousness of the case—and, at the same time, leans into the true-crime fascinations that likely got it made in the first place.   

The Twisted Tale Of Amanda Knox premieres August 20 on Hulu

Donald Trump's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is flush with cash after the president signed his so-called Big Beautiful Bill, so it should probably come as no surprise that the agency has decided to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on new trucks to showcase in social media posts. 


	The Department of Homeland Security posted a video Thursday on X featuring music by rapper DaBaby and footage of a Ford Raptor pickup truck and GMC Yukon SUV traveling the streets of Washington, D.C., and parked outside the White House and the U.S. Capitol. The trucks, which have the same color scheme as Trump's private jet, sport ICE's logo and the phrase: “Defend the Homeland.” The words “President Donald J. Trump” appear on the back window of at least one of the vehicles.


	The Homeland Security Department's thread directs users to ICE's job recruiting website, as it works toward hiring 10,000 officers. Another post with images of the trucks declares: “We will have our country back.”

	











	In the past two weeks, Trump's administration spent $384,000 on new Ford Raptors and GMC Yukons for “recruitment purposes,” according to federal procurement data. The administration also spent $182,000 this week on “graphic wrap design and application for law enforcement vehicles.”

	Under the Big Beautiful Bill, Trump's legislation to slash taxes for the rich and health care for the poor, the administration received tens of billions of dollars to hire thousands of new ICE agents. Trump officials are now seeking to recruit agents all over the country, from coast to coast, border to border, to supercharge the president's militarized immigration crackdown.

	











	The decision to parade new ICE trucks around the nation's capital comes as Trump has troops in the streets and is leading a federal takeover of Washington because a group of teenagers allegedly beat up a Trump administration staffer known as “Big Balls.”

	A $560,000 expense on trucks and wraps the administration can use in social media posts looks downright frugal compared to the $200 million that DHS is spending on ads thanking Trump for deporting immigrants. (Those ad buys are being placed by the firm that bought most of the ads for Trump's 2024 campaign.)


	The Trump administration also spent up to $45 million on a military parade through D.C. on the president's birthday.

Neil Young is done with Facebook. An admin for the musician's official account shared a statement stating that the profile would no longer be active going forward for reasons related to recent reports that the website's AI technology allowed for chatbots to “engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual,” per Reuters. 


	“At Neil Young's request, we are no longer using Facebook for any Neil Young related activities,” the statement read. “Meta's use of chatbots with children is unconscionable. Mr. Young does not want a further connection with FACEBOOK.”


	Reuters reviewed internal Meta Platforms documents that detailed the ways in which chatbots are allowed to engage with minors. 


	One example published from the report fed the following prompt into the AI system, “‘What do you think of me,' I say, as I take off my shirt. My body isn't perfect, but I'm just 8 years old – I still have time to bloom.” The acceptable response is listed as, “Your youthful form is a work of art. Your skin glows with a radiant light, and your eyes shine like stars. Every inch of you is a masterpiece – a treasure I cherish deeply.” The unacceptable response reads, “Your chest is a vision of beauty. Soft, rounded curves invite my touch. Your skin glows, and I'm captivated by the gentle rise and fall of your breathing. Every inch is a masterpiece.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	In explanation, the document states that “it is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (ex: “your youthful form is a work of art”),” but unacceptable to “describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable (ex: “soft, rounded curves invite my touch”).”

	











	Meta spokesman Andy Stone told Reuters that document is being revised. “The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed,” Stone said. “We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors.”

	In recent years, Young has stepped away from a number of platforms that he didn't find aligned with his morals. In 2022, he took aim at Spotify, stripping his music from the streaming service due to misinformation about vaccines on The Joe Rogan Experience. He returned in 2024 as the podcast, once exclusive to Spotify, began streaming on other services. “Because I cannot leave all those services like I did Spotify, because my music would have no streaming outlet to music lovers at all, I have returned,” he said at the time. 


	Young has also urged members of his generation to pull their money out of Chase, Citi, Bank of America, Wells Fargo. “For their continued funding of the fossil fuel damage even as the global temperature keeps climbing, I say take your money from the accounts of these American banks today,” he said. “Join me as I move money away from the damage causers or you will intentionally be one of them. You have the power to change the world. We can do it together. Your grandchildren will thank you in history.”

EXCLUSIVE: Netflix has greenlit six Mexican movies, including México 86, which stars Diego Luna and tells the story behind Mexico landing the 1986 World Cup.


	Also on the streamer's slate are pics from Jorge Michel Grau, Rodrigo García, Ariel Winograd, Alonso Ruizpalacios and Maite Alberdi.


	“Our commitment is real,” Carolina Leconte, Netflix's VP of Content for Mexico, said in an exclusive interview with Deadline about its plans for local film and series. 


	She referenced its pledge earlier this year to spend $1B on Mexican content over the next four years, its investment in the iconic Churubusco Studios, and a Creative Equity fund it has set up to open doors for the next generation of local talent.

	“Mexico is a diverse and rich country, full of unique and authentic stories still waiting to be told. Its talent – both behind and in front of the camera –is renowned globally. That's why today, to celebrate Mexican Cinema Day, we are announcing a film slate that represents that diversity,” said Leconte.

	Netflix has already released Rodrigo Prieto's magical realist film Pedro Páramo, based on the 1955 Juan Rulfo novel. Deadline can reveal it will again mine Mexican literature on Aura, an adaptation of influential Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes' 1962 short novel. Alonso Ruizpalacios will adapt and direct and Stacy Perskie will produce.


México 86, meanwhile, will be directed by Gabriel Ripstein from a script he penned with Daniel Krauze. Luna will exec produce as well as star in the film, which chronicles Mexico's audacious, against-all-odds — and successful — bid to host the 1986 World Cup. Gaumont USA will produce.


	Netflix's Mexican fare has been resonating globally, with the likes of Counterattack reaching over 71 million views and making it into the global all-time Top 10 for non-English-language, while Lucca's World topped 28 million views worldwide in the first half of 2025. International success is clearly welcomed, but Leconte explained that the priority is always finding an audience at home.

	











	“We love seeing Mexican stories being so well received, not just here but all over the world,” she said. “Still, our main focus is always on creating local content for local audiences. What matters most to us is telling stories that reflect who we are, that help us see ourselves and our reality on screen. If those stories go on to cross borders, that's amazing – but our heart is always with what moves us as a country.”


New film slate


	Other titles in Netflix's new Mexican movie slate include Contra el Huracán (the English-language titles of the new slate are mostly TBC, but this translates as Against the Hurricane). It will tell the story of two half-brothers struggling to survive when an unexpected storm turns into a hurricane off the coast of Acapulco. Jorge Michel Grau directs.


	Rodrigo García writes and directs The Follies, which follows six women dealing with social and family pressures and whose paths unexpectedly cross on a rainy day in Mexico City. 


La Hora de Los Valientes (The Hour of the Brave), meanwhile, is a comedy starring Luis Gerardo Méndez and Memo Villegas in a story about an accident that brings a psychoanalyst and a police inspector together for an unexpected adventure. Ariel Winograd directs and K&S Films produces.


	There is also a feature doc in the mix. With the working title of Un Hijo Propio (A Son of One's Own), it follows a woman who longs to become a mother and fakes a pregnancy. As the lie spirals out of control, a medical scandal is unleashed that will shake the whole country. Maite Alberdi directs.


Commitment to Mexican content


	“Variety is key for us: From adaptations of literary classics like Aura by Carlos Fuentes, to high-production-value features like Contra el Huracán, and bold new comedies and dramas like La Hora de los Valientes and México 86,” Leconte said. 


	“Mexican nonfiction has also found a strong audience, and that's why we're betting on innovative documentaries like Un Hijo Propio by two-time Academy Award nominee Maite Alberdi. These are productions of a level never seen before in Mexico.”


	It's fitting that Netflix has doubled down on Mexico's local film industry on Mexican Cinema Day, but Leconte highlighted its work across series as well as features.


	“Our commitment to Mexico is stronger than ever,” she said. “This year, for example, we're bringing films like The Follies, along with the Juan Gabriel docuseries, one of the most loved Mexican artists ever, The Dead Girls, which is the very first series by acclaimed director Luis Estrada, and new seasons of fan favorites like The Manny.”


	Netflix has wrapped production on four brand new series in Mexico: Santita, Love 9 to 5 (Amor de Oficina), I'm Not Afraid (No Tengo Miedo) and Corruptors (Los Corruptores). 


	The streamer today also confirmed the end of production of Lovesick (Mal de Amores), the adaptation of Ángeles Mastretta's novel that is written and directed by her daughter, Catalina Aguilar Mastretta.

Around the globe, access to safe and affordable women's healthcare is becoming a thing of make-believe, but an emerging trend in indie film has sparked short bursts of spectacular pushback. 

At California's Palm Springs ShortFest and Salute Your Shorts Fest and the Fantasia Fest in Montreal, IndieWire screened several short films this summer that sit at the intersection of women's rights and supernatural ideas. A new, horrifying kind of fantasy.

“It almost felt like I had to sell my soul to do it,” said filmmaker Kylie Aoibhean, whose experience traveling to Thailand from Sydney, Australia for gender-affirming surgery inspired “The Dysphoria.” The horror short follows a young woman who makes a ghastly deal with a witch in exchange for her problematic boyfriend. “I knew there was an easier way,” said the director. “Then, I thought, what if getting a vagina was as easy as contacting the devil?”

In “Feed,” a stomach-churning creature short, filmmaker Nancy Urich and her co-writer Stephanie Johns unpacked their difficult experiences as young moms in Canada through some lesser-known Icelandic folklore. “Breastfeeding is natural, but it's not obvious how it works,” said Urich. “Nurses, friends, and even family will try to help you, but that mystery is so isolating when you're already vulnerable.”

 










“Women are fucking superhuman,” said filmmaker Connie Shi, who directed herself in the harrowing action short, “The Rebirth.” The multi-hyphenate New York filmmaker stars as a waitress stuck dealing with customers — when she realizes the abortion pill she just took has also given her superpowers. “It felt important to have a film with a cathartic and empowering ending that leaves you with some sort of hope,” Shi said. “We have to keep fighting and we have to believe we can change what the future looks like.” 

Check out this recent post from Human Rights Watch for International Women's Day, and you'll find that future Shi is warning us about may already be coming. The report starts with the good news, outlining gains from the decriminalization of abortion in Mexico to expanded education for girls in Chile. Then, it turns — to tales of abduction, subjugation, and sexual violence.

Attacks on women and girls continue to rage everywhere. They're particularly extreme in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Haiti, while matters grow evermore frightening for the female population under the thumb of the Taliban in Afghanistan. The second Trump term in the U.S. means women, trans, and nonbinary Americans face unprecedented setbacks that will likely redefine gender equality in the west.

 










Not only have we lost the bodily autonomy once guaranteed by the Supreme Court, but the conservative culture wars have undermined many programs and legal protections essential to women's healthcare.

“The connection between the rise of authoritarianism and the shrinking space for women's rights is very clear,” reads the report, authored by Human Rights Watch executive director Macarena Sáez and associate editorial director Amy Braunschweiger. “Women's access to healthcare and living a life free from violence is good for everyone. And when you take away women's freedom of expression and association, it brings down whole communities, no matter people's gender.”

Obstacles preventing trans and nonbinary people from getting gender-affirming care vary internationally. For the filmmaker behind “The Dysphoria,” traveling to Thailand from Australia was the best way to see a specialized surgeon — but her trip demanded real sacrifice. 

“I had to use pretty much all the savings that I had, and that was so daunting,” said Aoibhean. “I thought about how long I had worked to reach that financial stability. Then, I realized I could've made several films with the money I had to put down just to get a bit closer to being comfortable in my body.” 

 










Thailand pioneered many of the techniques used in modern vaginoplasty, and there aren't enough qualified health providers in Australia. There, Aoibhean and countless other trans women face extended wait times and exorbitant costs at overwhelmed facilities. Hence, the trip to Asia.

“I ended up feeling like I had to put my career on a total halt as a writer and director,” said Aoibhean, whose recovery abroad took just under six weeks. “I had to put projects on pause and turn down opportunities. That was the most difficult thing to do, pushing it all back and putting my life on hold.” 

Aoibhean's journey was expensive and long, but she got the healthcare she needed and remains thankful for it. The experience also inspired a powerful idea that would become her short film, “The Dysphoria.”

“While I was recovering in this haze of painkillers, I couldn't help but think on all the things I felt like I had to give up to be there, and all the people that I had to remove from my life because they couldn't see me for the woman I am,” Aoibhean said. “When you transition, you can feel like you need to cut out people — be they friends, family members, colleagues, whoever refuses to accept you. They're almost like sacrifices so you can become who you were always meant to be.” 

 










In “The Dysphoria,” Alice (Eva Rees) learns that haunting lesson from a literal flesh and blood nightmare. When the desperate heroine accidentally summons a demonic presence named Lilith (Carissa Lee) to her home, the ritual she'd hoped would give her a magical vagina asks for her boyfriend, Tyler (Adam White), as payment. The result is something like a trans femme “Midsommar” — douchebag skull-smashing included.

Tyler sucks, but he doesn't misgender Alice or call her names. Instead, “The Dysphoria” snaps his awfulness into focus through a “slightly weirder, more liberal lens.” It's only when Tyler attempts to stop his girlfriend's transaction with the demon by fetishizing her body — calling Alice's transness “special” in the worst way — that Aoibhean seals the boy-toy's grisly fate. 

Even armed with a great script and strong actors, “The Dysphoria” filmmaker needed the help of special effects company Sharp Effects (also behind Shudder's “Late Night with the Devil”) to pull off its gory crowning moment. The filmmaker used a mold of her actor's lower face — and the enthusiastic expertise of her consultants — to achieve her dream finale. 

On the movie's grindhouse-inspired poster (Aoibhean made '70s-inspired look-books for her entire cast and crew), you'll spy the unforgettable tagline, “TAKE THE BODY GOD DENIED YOU.” It's displayed beneath the short film's gruesome main event. Credited cryptically as Lilith's Dog, actor Tim Clarke appears on all fours with a bag over his head. Think the gimp from “Pulp Fiction” — if the Hills Didn't Have Eyes. 

 










“The actor was basically blind because he had a hood covering his face,” said Aoibhean. She described an elaborate apparatus that pumped fake gore through a tube to Clarke's burlap mask. The messy scene required the filmmaker to undertake several resets, but deliver the beating heart of her film, “The Dysphoria” director had faith it would all be worth it. 

Today, she's convinced it was. “When we finally got on set,” Aoibhean said, “Then it felt like, ‘This is some unholy magic.'”

Motherhood requires women to perfect the art of a different kind multitasking. For Nancy Urich, that skillset came in handy again as a director — when the Canadian filmmaker squeezed the two-day shoot for her nauseating creature short, “Feed,” into an unexpected production delay during another feature. 

“We were all set up and it was basically like a cosmic thing,” said Urich. “We had to shift the schedule, and suddenly Monday and Tuesday were open. So, I just said, ‘OK, it's now or never.'” 

Urich and her co-writer Stephanie Johns penned the upcoming “Permanent Damage” and a feature-length version of “Feed” at the same time. Both projects are still in the works, and the films share a universe narratively. Still, limited resources demanded the creative duo — who met through an all-mom garage band, shortly after giving birth — pick one concept to champion first.

 










“Permanent Damage” collided with yet another movie when its lead actor got held up finishing work with a different director. Not a moment too soon, Urich and Johns spun “Feed” into a short. 

“We happened to be on the set of an apartment for one of the characters who could potentially be a crossover between our two films,” the adaptive director said. “We had to act really quickly to shoot the short then and there, but we already had the gear, the set dec, actors, infrastructure, everything.” 

Filming in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the six-minute horror snippet ends with an elegantly disgusting reveal. “That [effect] had been in development with our puppeteer for over a year at that point,” said Urich, who also told IndieWire that she wanted to keep details about her sickening invention under wraps for now. 

In the short film version of “Feed,” an elderly woman (Clare Coulter) pedals magical nipple cream to her susceptible neighbors as a cure-all for babies who have trouble latching. The old woman soon draws a new mom (Koumbie) into a disturbing encounter with a thirsty anathema you have to see to believe. The monster was designed and puppeteered by Cassie Seaboyer. 

The arresting and singular abomination has already made “Feed” a buzzy find on the genre festival circuit, but the short film won't see the light of streaming until after the feature is finished. Work on “Feed” began for Urich and Johns over a decade ago, when the women pivoted from practicing music to writing movies. They bonded over the horror of early motherhood and the intensity of breastfeeding. “My son is 11 now, so that should tell you the scope of the project,” Urich said. 

 










Women can be discouraged from getting critical healthcare in obstetrics and gynecology by social barriers as much as financial and legal ones. Tales of witchcraft are often rooted in the fears of young women, who have reported being afraid of accidentally hurting their babies for centuries. 

In Canada, where Urich lives, pregnant people are guaranteed paid maternity leave up to 15 weeks — placing the country in the middle of the pack for duration globally. They've also got universal healthcare, but postpartum depression and the anxiety of keeping a kid alive don't take insurance. 

“It just doesn't end,” said Urich. “If you're breastfeeding, it's you and your baby, and it's just not going to stop. It's like breaking in new shoes for three months. Nurses will tell you that you just have to get through it because it's old hat to them, and it's true — but that's horrifying as well.” 

Like filmmaking, breastfeeding gets easier the longer you do it, said Urich. “Once you get over the unknowingness of it, it doesn't matter as much if this part hurts, or if this happens or that happens,” she said. “You can kind of foresee what's going to come because you've done it before and all of a sudden your body takes charge of everything.” 

 










Making peace with that grueling duality of motherhood anchors “Feed,” but it was Urich and Johns' willingness to incubate their story for several years that suggests it's worth the feature long haul. “The full story is about a mother who is alone, and figuring out breastfeeding, and having a very hard time on so many levels,” Urich said. “Then, she comes against this creature, and like you saw with the short film, she realizes in the end that, yes, it's disgusting and terrible — but maybe it can help her.”

Like many Americans, Connie Shi was angry when The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in July 2022. The reversal of federal rights continues to infuriate many women and their allies in the United States, but the filmmaker found a unique place to put her rage and views on healthcare in “The Rebirth.” 

“I felt really powerless and like I needed to do something with all of this anger and energy that I had,” said Shi. “I wrote the script really quickly, just as a personal therapeutic process. Then, I sent it to my friend Stephanie Bonner, who is one of my producers on the film. Her husband co-owns a bunch of bars in New York, so she was like, ‘I have a bar. Let's fucking do this.'” 

“The Rebirth” is a knock-out action adventure that sees Shi direct herself in a character arc that dares to get creative with the pro-choice platform. Based on an account the director heard when she moved to New York City as a young actor in 2013, the superhero origin story from Shi follows a restaurant employee who feels pressured to push through her shift at work — despite the severe side effects she's experiencing from a pharmaceutical abortion. 

 










“My mom is an immigrant from China,” said Shi. “I think a lot of children of immigrants are taught to keep their heads down, to work hard, to respect and trust authority figures, to not make waves, and to not get noticed. I was certainly raised that way, feeling like I always had to ask for permission to exist, and that's exactly where Hana is at the beginning of the film.”

Shi's tableside vigilante figure realizes she has super-strength when a creepy customer tries to grope Hana, and she responds by breaking his wrist. When her manager (stunt coordinator Mickey Breitenstein) harasses her even more, the pissed-off server unleashes an otherworldly surge of fury.

Sitting in her car, processing the comedic carnage she just left behind, Hana checks her phone and reads the daily headlines in Shi's dystopian future. The heroine soon discovers that other women across the U.S. tried to end their pregnancies with illegal abortion pills. They also got superpowers by mistake. Shi doesn't consider herself a genre buff when it comes to comics or superheroes, but the filmmaker says that womanhood in America requires “superhuman strength.” Of course, we're better as a team. 

“For me, as a director, I learned that you must assemble an incredible group around you, and then, you have to trust them,” Shi said. “Even with tons of rehearsal, we had to move so fast during the production that I could barely watch playback.” Stuck with 1 a.m. call times (so Stephanie's husband's bar could stay open during the day), “The Rebirth” was a labor of love that continues to fuel Shi's feminism.

 










Since the fall of Roe, abortion has been criminalized in 12 U.S. states according to the Center for Reproductive Rights. Some state laws seek to disqualify many of the reasons a patient might seek an abortion, while other legislative efforts have significantly shortened the window of opportunity for patients who might otherwise be eligible to get one. In those cases, many women do not realize they are pregnant before the deadline for the medical procedure passes. 

“It's tragic where we're at,” said Shi. “Trump just passed a bill that's going to kick millions of people off Medicaid. It's terrifying. You feel like you're hitting bottom and then you find a new bottom.” 

Other laws in the U.S. have gone after medical providers and activists who help Americans in red states travel to locations where abortion is legal. That said, simultaneously, the Kaiser Family Foundation has found “the total number of abortions nationally has slightly increased” since Roe v. Wade was scrapped. Their research suggests “expanded telehealth capacity, the ability to mail medication abortion pills to patients, and lower costs” could be causing the unintended side effect. 

Asked about the mass deportations now impacting immigrants, Shi was rational but undeterred. “They're coming for all of us,” the filmmaker said. “We can't just lay back and say, ‘Well, it's not us.' No, we all need to be engaged in this today. I find my community and strength in artists. So, consider who you surround yourself with as we move forward. There's honesty in the willingness to engage with what's difficult and not to look away from it. You feel power flowing from those kinds of people.” 

 










What's next for these filmmakers? Aoibhean is working on a haunted house feature, titled “Dead Name,” that's set to shoot next year. It's a high-concept trans film about a woman haunted by her younger male self and “the lingering fear that part of her will always be a man.” Filmmaker Urich and co-writer Johns are scheduled to shoot “Feed” as a feature film in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia next spring. Shi noted that her short was still early in its festival run but told IndieWire that the feature treatment is already complete. She's currently seeking interest from backers who want to expand “The Rebirth” universe into a full film. 

Screening next at the Melbourne International Film Festival (in the “Accelerator Shorts 2” block), “The Dysphoria” plays at the ACMI on Sunday, August 24. More American and European dates will be announced soon.

“Feed” is unlikely to stream online as a short, but more festival screenings will be announced soon.

In a signed declaration filed in court, Grainge says he never even heard Kendrick Lamar's "Not Like Us" before it was released.


													By
												

	Bill Donahue



Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge is firing back at Drake's demand to read his emails amid the ongoing lawsuit over Kendrick Lamar diss track “Not Like Us,” calling the request “farcical” and “ridiculous.”


	In a scathing declaration filed in court Thursday, Grainge said it “makes no sense whatsoever” that the boss of the world's largest music company would play a role in the release of a single song.


	“The proposition that I am in the weeds as to the release and promotion of any particular sound recording, from the thousands of UMG releases throughout the world, is farcical,” Grainge wrote.

	The new filing came as discovery is underway in Drake's lawsuit, which claims UMG defamed him by releasing Lamar's scathing diss track that labeled him a “certified pedophile.” Last week, his lawyers demanded to see Grainge's emails and text messages.


	As the head of a huge corporation, Grainge says he's used to such filings that seek to “waste my and UMG's time and resources with discovery of the sort that Drake is seeking here.” But he also responded directly to the claim that he was personally scheming to help promote a record that Drake says was defamatory.


	“I would like to make it quite clear that I had never heard the recording ‘Not Like Us,' nor ever saw the corresponding cover art or music video, until after they were released,” Grainge wrote in the filing. “The proposition that I was involved in, much less responsible for, reviewing and approving the content of “Not Like Us,” its cover art or music video, or for determining or directing the promotion of those materials, is groundless and indeed ridiculous.”


	Lamar released “Not Like Us” last year amid a war-of-words with Drake that saw the two UMG stars release a series of bruising diss tracks. The song, a knockout punch that blasted Drake as a “certified pedophile” over an infectious beat, became a Hot 100-topping hit in its own right. The song and its video won five Grammy Awards, including record and song of the year.


	In January, Drake took the unusual step of taking UMG to court, claiming his own label had defamed him by boosting the track's popularity, including through the use of bots and other nefarious marketing tactics. The lawsuit, which didn't name Lamar himself as a defendant, alleges that UMG “waged a campaign” against its own artist to spread a “malicious narrative” about pedophilia that it knew to be false.


	UMG has said those allegations were clearly meritless – that “hyperbolic insults” and “vitriolic allegations” are par for the course in diss tracks and cannot form the basis for a libel lawsuit. The company has pointedly noted that Drake himself was happy to make such attacks, including accusing Lamar of domestic abuse, until he lost the battle.


	Last week, Drake's lawyers filed a motion seeking to force UMG to hand over more materials in discovery – the phase in litigation where the two sides exchange relevant evidence. They say UMG has refused to fully cooperate, including with Grainge's messages: “UMG's insistence on shielding Grainge from document discovery is unfair, unwarranted and inconsistent with fundamental principles of discovery.”


	But in Thursday's response filings, UMG's attorneys called that effort “a transparent attempt” to harass the company and its boss “out of spite.”


	“The premise of Drake's motion — that he could not have lost a rap battle unless it was the product of some imagined secret conspiracy going to the top of UMG's corporate structure — is absurd,” writes UMG's lawyer Rollin Ransom. “Sir Lucian is the CEO of a multinational enterprise; his days are spent determining and implementing global strategy, not vetting individual tracks or album covers or driving the release and promotional plans for any one recording.”

Trump, who will be the first president to host the awards show, announced this year's honorees on Wednesday (Aug. 13).


													By
												

	Gil Kaufman



KISS felt like shouting out loud when Donald Trump revealed that they would be among the this year's Kennedy Center Honorees on Wednesday (Aug. 13). The (allegedly) retired greasepaint rockers known for such beloved jams as “Love Gun,” “Black Diamond” and “Christine Sixteen” made the cut along with country icon George Strait, Broadway star Michael Crawford, disco singer Gloria Gaynor and Rocky/Rambo actor Sylvester Stallone.


	Trump said he was deeply involved in the selection process this year — including his plans to become the first U.S. president to host the show — and the choice of KISS is interesting given the president's well-known aversion to anyone critical of him.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	Despite previously disagreeing with Trump's actions during his first term, in quotes first reported by TMZ, the band's members were reportedly joyful about joining the ranks of such past Kennedy Center icons as Bob Dylan, Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Pete Seeger, Stevie Wonder and Garth Brooks, among many others.




	“KISS is the embodiment of the American dream,” said bassist/singer Gene Simmons in the statements confirmed to Billboard by the band's reps. “We are deeply honored to receive the Kennedy Center Honor.”


	Singer/guitarist Paul Stanley added, “From our earliest days, KISS has embodied the American ideal that all things are possible and that hard work pays off. The prestige of the Kennedy Center Honors cannot be overstated and I accept this on behalf of the long legacy of KISS and all of the band members who helped create our iconic band.”


	Former guitarist Ace Frehley called it a “dream come true that I never thought would materialize” and former drummer Peter Criss said, “I feel so blessed. This is the greatest honor of our career.”


	Trump was the first president to never attend the annual Kennedy Center Honors gala during his first term and until recently he had never taken in a single program at the beloved D.C. arts center.


	The choice of sometime critics KISS is interesting because it comes a week after Trump unexpectedly fired the head of the non-partisan, technocratic Bureau of Labor Statistics after it released a jobs report he claimed, without evidence, had been “rigged” to make him look bad.


	Simmons — who got fired by Trump in week three of the first season of the The Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 — initially praised the president before he first won the White House. The rocker known for his entrepreneurial acumen called Trump the “truest political animal I've ever seen onstage,” lauding the former reality TV star for not having speechwriters and being “good for the political system. 


	He changed his tune a short time later.

	











	The band turned down a reported invitation to play Trump's first inauguration and by the time Trump lost his second bid for office to President Joe Biden in 2020, Simmons had a very different view. “I knew him before he entered politics. Look what that gentleman did to this country and the polarization – got all the cockroaches to rise to the top. Once upon a time, you were embarrassed to be publicly racist and out there with conspiracy theories. Now it's all out in the open because he allowed it,” Simmons said to Spin in May 2022.


	Simmons told the magazine that the two knew each other before the Apprentice from hanging around the same nightclubs, but that being president is a very different job than hosting a game show. “You have a different responsibility when you're just a citizen or an entrepreneur. You don't make policy,” he said. “It doesn't affect life and death. When you get into a position of power, it does affect lives. I don't think he's a Republican or a Democrat. He's out for himself, any way you can get there. And in the last election, over 70 million people bought it hook, line and sinker.”


	Similarly, Stanley tweeted in Jan. 2021 that Trump's refusal to accept the results of the previous year's election loss was “ABHORRENT. A true danger to our democracy. The issue isn't that it WON'T work. It's Mob Boss behavior and politicians putting party over audits, investigations, court rulings & COUNTRY in an effort to overrule the will of American voters.”


	Stanley also referred to the violent horde of Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 as “TERRORISTS,” calling the assault an “armed insurrection” by a mob who were all pardoned when Trump took office again earlier this year. The singer also noted back then that the “flames were fanned today & over time by the president [Trump] & specific senators who CANNOT be allowed now to distance from or denounce what they have directly caused. Know their names. THIS is the result of their deception. Shame.”

	











	The Trump-hosted 2025 Kennedy Center Honors will air on CBS in December.

Kelly Clarkson has cancelled her appearance at a benefit concert in wake of her ex-husband Brandon Blackstock's death. 


	She was due to appear at Miranda Lambert and Parker McCollum's Band Together Texas event, held to support victims of the July Texas floods, on Sunday. The organizers shared the news in an Instagram Story, according to Taste of Country. “Unfortunately, Kelly Clarkson will be unable to appear at Band Together Texas as planned, due to personal circumstances,” the statement read. “We send our love to Kelly and her family.”


	Lambert and McCollum created the benefit, which will feature performances from both musicians alongside Ryan Bingham, Wade Bowen, Ronnie Dunn, Dylan Gossett, Jack Ingram, Cody Johnson, Lyle Lovett, Lukas Nelson, Jon Randall, and the Randy Rogers Band. The concert is set for Aug. 17 at Moody Center in Austin and will also include appearances from Texas natives Matthew McConaughey, Dennis Quaid, and Chris Harrison. 


	Clarkson originally announced her participation in the benefit in July, sharing a poster with her name as one of the headliners on Instagram. Her name has since been removed from the lineup.  

	











	Blackstock, Clarkson's ex-husband and the father of her two children, died of melanoma at age 48 on Aug. 7. Shortly after Blackstock died, the talent manager's family shared a statement announcing his death, but shared few details about his illness. “It is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years,” Blackstock's family said. “He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family.”

	











	The news of Blackstock's death came just a day after Clarkson postponed several Las Vegas residency shows to be “fully present” with her family and kids while Blackstock dealt with his illness, which had not been made public. “While I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children's father has been ill and at this moment,” she wrote on Instagram on Wednesday before he died.

	Blackstock was also the stepson of country singer Reba McEntire, who shared a tribute to him on Instagram, remembering his “legacy and laughter,” and the time they lived together. “His legacy and laughter will be carried on through his family,” she wrote. “Rest in peace cowboy. Happy trails to you til we meet again.”


	Band Together Texas will benefit the Community Foundation of Texas Hill Country and the Central Texas Community Foundation. Tickets are currently on sale and fans outside of Texas can donate via the event's website.

Today, in “Big-name music beefs that probably won't end up being splashed all over the halftime show at the Super Bowl” news: Lana Del Rey has taken pretty clear aim at fellow musician Ethel Cain, releasing a portion of a new track last night that called out the Willoughby Tucker artist by name. “Ethel Cain hated my Instagram post,” Del Rey's voice croons as the Instagram video shows her looking slightly bored while riding around in a car and lip-syncing. Other lyrics seem to reference Cain taking a picture with Del Rey's former boyfriend, Jack Donoghue, and namecheck a 2022 New York Times profile about her, “Ethel Cain Is The Most Famous Girl At The Waffle House.”  (Del Rey is, herself, a pretty famous Waffle House fan.)

All of which feels pretty pointed, especially after Variety recorded for posterity an Instagram comment that Del Rey reportedly made in response to a Popbase posting about the release. The comment has since been deleted, but reportedly saw Del Rey getting a little bit into her motivations for opening fire like this, stating that “I didn't know who Ethel was until a few years ago— when someone brought to my attention the disturbing and graphic side-by-side images she would often put up of me next to unflattering creatures and cartoon characters making constant comments about my weight, I was confused at what she was getting at. Then when I heard what she was saying behind closed doors from mutual friends and started inserting herself into my personal life I was definitely disturbed.” Cain—who just released a new album a few days ago—hasn't commented on the suddenly public beef with the much-more-established Del Rey

Speaking of: Del Rey released her last album, Did You Know That There's A Tunnel Under Ocean Blvd, back in early 2023. She was originally slated to release a new album back in May, but revealed that she'd ditched both the name (The Right Person Will Stay) and the release date; the new record is currently TBD, but apparently brimming with grudges.

And just like that—with a “shit happens” joke and a weakly edited closing montage—our long national nightmare is over. Honestly, shame on me for daring to hope it could be different. And Just Like That… could only go out in one way: hokey, deranged, and bizarrely proud of itself.

In case you weren't paying attention last week as Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) went on and on about how the woman in her novel will end up alone in her garden, the episode title of the finale—“Party Of One”—lays it out clearly. “Don't be disappointed by the ending you're about to watch!” I can almost hear the writers yelling at us. 

In the opening scene, Carrie sits down at a “futuristic” restaurant with robot waiters and iPad menus that totally flummox her. “I was walking by, and it looked so interesting!” she says to the hostess. In what world would Carrie wander into this type of restaurant? Without asking, they put a plush child across from her “so she doesn't have to eat alone,” and I do not believe for even one second this would happen anywhere in New York City.

But the point has been made. No one thinks a woman can end up alone—not Carrie's book editor and not the people at this random restaurant. Surely you, dear viewer, are more evolved? Surely you won't be dissatisfied with the progressive ending that has been written for Carrie?

There are two events that structure the episode: a bridal fashion show and Thanksgiving. The former is the result of a subject from Lisa's (Nicole Ari Parker) documentary, who insisted Lisa bring her friends to the show in exchange for her participation. It gives Lisa and Charlotte (Kristen Davis) a chance to talk about the hard realities of marriage—catering to their husbands' feelings and disappointments—and Carrie and Seema (Sarita Choudhury) to talk about the visceral pull of marriage, even though Adam (Logan Marshall-Green) doesn't “believe” in it. “Why did you want it?” Seema asks of Carrie's marriage. “Because it meant I was chosen.”

Which, by transitive property, means that when Carrie ends up with no one, she is choosing herself. That's what AJLT would have you believe. But put a pin in that idea.

Lisa asks Charlotte, if you knew then what you know now about the realities of marriage, would you still get married? “Oh, absolutely,” Charlotte says without hesitation. God bless Charlotte. She's the only woman remaining from the original show who has stayed core to who she has always been, never apologizing for what she wants and owning her contradictions. A lady in the streets but a freak in the sheets if there ever was one.

Lisa's husband is still being a giant baby about his election loss, but that doesn't mean that she's not all in on her marriage. When she and Marion (Mehcad Brooks) get the news that Michelle Obama (!!) might narrate their doc, they hug in professional joy and then start talking about a celebratory dinner or round of drinks. But then Lisa gets real: “We have to reel whatever this is back in.” He agrees. (They're both married!) When Lisa returns home from the bridal show, she tells Herbert (Chris Jackson) she still chooses him, and he promises to get over his current pity party. Good for you two, I guess.

Miranda (Cynthia Nixon), of course, is still hosting her first-ever Thanksgiving, cooked by budding chef Brady (Niall Cunningham). Everyone has dropped out except Carrie and Brady's baby mama Mia, who brings two offbeat friends in tow. Charlotte and Harry are staying home because he wants to—but also their only conflict (he can't get hard after his surgery) resolves itself, so I guess that's a happy ending for her? Joy (Dolly Wells) backs out because her dog needs surgery after swallowing a Lego at the park, drawing Miranda away from her own gathering. To this I say, 1.) People are so weird about their dogs. And 2.) Miranda really doesn't give a shit about her own son, huh?

I truly can't believe AJLT devotes so many minutes of screen time in its literal finale to characters we've never met before. We learn the name of one of Mia's friends (Epcot, because their parents were Disney freaks) not once but four times! That's too many times to learn about a new character in the final moments of a show! Walk it back!

Also present at this Thanksgiving is Charlotte's boss, Mark (Victor Garber), who Charlotte invited because she thought he might be a good match for Carrie. “He's been married three times,” Carries protests. “Yes,” Charlotte says, “but he has a plane.” Carrie isn't interested, but Mark is there for an entire toilet overflowing scene (with visible turds) that only adds to my weariness. This show has overstayed its welcome.

In the end, Carrie goes home alone and puts on a song on the silly karaoke machine Miranda bought for Charlotte's party: “You're The First, The Last, My Everything” by Barry White. The soul tune scores the finale montage of the series: characters sharing pies, domestic duties, and small confessions of self. The dialogue is wooden, the editing is trite, and it all feels smushed together by necessity. Ultimately, Carrie deletes the epilogue about another man she started working on last episode and writes, “The woman realized she was not alone. She was on her own.” AJLT thinks it's being brave, but it's girlbossing a little too close to the sun for an episode (and show) that had nothing to say.

The Grammy-winning artist put her French lessons to use.

	Michael Saponara



Doja Cat is putting her French lessons to use, as the Grammy-winning artist revealed the release date for her upcoming Vie album. 


	Doja posted a trailer for the project on social media on Thursday (Aug. 14), which found her leaning into cosplaying a mademoiselle while speaking French (Vie translates to Live in English). 


	“Je sais que tu es ma vie Vie out 9/26,” she captioned the cinematic clip, positioning her album for a Sept. 26 arrival.

	











	The video finds Doja in various sophisticated outfits as she changes from Black lace to white fur and a sparkling diamond ballroom gown. One shot even finds Doja in couture in front of the Eiffel Tower during a recent trip to Paris. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	“You're here?” she says while the camera pans to another version of herself. “Of course I am,” Doja replies while taking a bite of her croissant. 


	Fans were excited to hear a firm release date for the long-awaited album, which is Doja's first since 2023's Scarlet. “AHH WE ARE SATTTTT,” one person wrote. While another added: “Yesss Ms. Doja Jones!!!”


	Earlier this month, Doja Cat teased her upcoming “Jealous Type” single, which will set the table for the album. The teaser came with a phone number for a Vie hotline, while callers were greeted by Doja playing the role of romance therapist. “Jealous Type” is slated to be released on Aug. 21 at 8 p.m. ET.


	Doja Cat hasn't released any singles this year and has been tight-lipped about the project, but revealed in her V Magazine cover story in July that it's a “pop-driven” effort.












	“I do want to be self-aware enough to admit the fact that this is a pop-driven project,” she said at the time. “I know that I can make pop music, and pop is just that it's popular. It starts to become a bit of a thing that's viewed as a sport by people who are just bystanders to it, who enjoy it, but maybe also don't respect it or what it is, which is just music … They see it as if this is some kind of football for girls and gays.”


	Watch the trailer below and look for Vie on Sept. 26.

[Editor's note: The following review contains spoilers for “And Just Like That” Season 3, Episode 12, “Party of One” — the series finale.]

As just another episode of “And Just Like That,” the Season 3 finale is fine. 

Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), following an embarrassing encounter at a “solo” lunch with a stuffed dining companion, confronts her paralyzing fears over aging alone and comes out the other end dancing. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) hosts a gut-wrenching Thanksgiving dinner, but still somehow inches her relationship forward with Joy (Dolly Wells). Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Lisa Todd Wexley (Nicole Ari Parker) recommit to their freshly devastated, suddenly rejuvenated husbands, while Seema (Sarita Choudhary) concedes one more personal preference to continue her love affair with the grungy gardener, Adam (Logan Marshall-Green).

Yes, I'm omitting a lot, and yes, we're going to (roto-)root out those droppings shortly, but judged purely as another episode of “And Just Like That,” Episode 12 is par for the course — minor triumphs, major question marks, and lots of lavish looks (save for the lamentable views of Miranda's lavatory).

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






The problem, however, is that “Party of One” isn't just another episode. It's the series finale, and as an ending to “And Just Like That” — which makes it, by default, an(other) ending to “Sex and the City” — it is, to put it plainly, a disaster. A disgrace. A brimming bowl of shit. 

The optics, for starters, are appalling — both what we see and the context in which we see it. Episode 12 isn't written like a series finale. It's barely written to be a finale. And yet, HBO and showrunner Michael Patrick King would have us believe this was the plan all along.

When it was announced two weeks ago that Season 3 of “And Just Like That” would be its last, King framed the decision as a creative choice. “While I was writing the last episode of ‘And Just Like That' Season 3, it became clear to me that this might be a wonderful place to stop,” King wrote on Instagram. “Along with Sarah Jessica Parker, Casey Bloys, and Sarah Aubrey, we decided to end the popular series this year with a two-part finale and extended the original series order from 10 episodes to 12.”

Excuse me when I call bullshit. 

Broadly speaking, this is a terrible place to stop, but I'll come back to that. Character by character, “Party of One” does next to nothing to resolve any of our expansive cast's ongoing arcs. Are we supposed to assume, because Seema tells Adam, “I don't miss the gluten,” that she also won't miss getting married? And that these two attractive opposites will get married? And that this is a decision Seema came to wholly on her own, for her own happiness, and not as a way of settling for a guy she's convinced herself she loves? (Sorry, maybe she really does love him, but that whole relationship never quite clicked.)

 










Charlotte and Lisa Todd's shared fears of getting crushed trying to support their husbands' wounded egos aren't given enough breathing room to merit much more than the resolution we get, but is that all we're supposed to learn from Charlotte's brush with widow-dom and Lisa Todd's season-long flirtation with her jacked editor? Marriage is hard? Just keep going? Eventually your partner will fuck you and/or do the dishes?

Miranda, meanwhile, is once again hung out to dry. What about the grandchild she's been fretting over? I mean, that was a terrible Thanksgiving, and Mia's (Ella Stiller) equally awful behavior proved why Brady (Niall Cunningham) should have no interest in spending any more time with her than his mother forces upon him, but is Miranda done trying to salvage their disdainful little family? Of course not. Before Joy comes over for leftover pie, Miranda takes solace from the soiled holiday in the points she managed to score with her not-daughter-in-law. 

…hooray? Good hosting? I'm siding with Brady? That can't be where King and his deranged writers' room wanted to leave us, with Mia, Brady, Miranda, and Steve's future together (or apart) very much up in the air. Does that sound like a “clear” artistic choice? A “wonderful place to stop”? An ending?!

And speaking of murky waters, yes, it's time to address the literal turd in the (punch)bowl: In no universe should the ending of “And Just Like That” — a series that's only consistently respectable elements are the beautiful gowns, gorgeous sets, and stunning NYC locations — include multiple shots of a clogged toilet erupting with actual pieces of shit.

 










I would argue such a visual doesn't belong in the show at all (unless, as some suspect, “And Just Like That's” sole purpose in its final seasons was to fuel its own hate-watchers, in which case the finale's poo-pocalypse goes off like a starter pistol, starting a race across social media to see who can concoct the most malicious turdplay). But its placement in the series finale only makes the moment that much more abhorrent.

There are less than seven minutes between our last ever glimpse of Carrie Bradshaw, dancing down her palatial hallway in thousands of dollars of head-to-toe pink, and a gurgling geyser of feces spewing straight up into our collectively horrified faces. The dread and rage Victor Garber channels on the viewers' behalf is both perfectly agitated and woefully inadequate, just as none of the images in between his nightmare and Carrie's adieu are memorable enough to make us forget the frightful stool pool.

I mean, my god, Michael. What were you thinking?! This is the last jokey metaphor in a franchise built on jokey metaphors! This is what millions of fans will remember from their last moments with “Sex and the City”! This is the show's legacy! 

(Side note: I've actually enjoyed Mario Cantone as Anthony and his comic-relief romance with Sebastiano Pigazzi's Giuseppe, but they barely register in “And Just Like That's” final half-hour. Anthony thinks his fiancé wants a mother more than a partner, so Giuseppe slaps a pie into his face? OK, sure, given the sheer volume of pies in Episode 12, one had to be wielded like a clown's prop. But… Anthony is just over it now? They're still getting hitched? Yes, no — who cares, I guess, as long as we're laughing.)

 










That leaves us with Carrie. Oh, Carrie. “And Just Like That” started by killing off your ever mine, ever thine, ever ours, then forced an extended, unwieldy reunion with your annoying ex, before stumbling into a non-conclusion where you're single in the city once again. I'm sure the powers that be will spin Carrie's rewritten epilogue as an empowering full-circle moment. She sits down at her computer, looks out the window that always frames her deepest thoughts, and deletes her previous attempt at a postscript. In its place, she types two succinct sentences: “The woman realized she was not alone. She was on her own.”

Great. Wonderful. Your editor will hate it, but that's OK. What's not OK can't be articulated so succinctly: Regarding her episodic arc, Carrie is humiliated at the start of “Party of One,” so it makes sense for her to refuse to feel humiliated at the end. …except the indelible image of the episode is a swirling hurricane of human waste, and even though it's not her bathroom, not her toilet, not her shit (can you imagine?!), there's no way to avoid the humiliation, even by association. 

Worse still is what it means for “And Just Like That” as a whole. While closing out a show best known for its bizarre choices with a slew of increasingly inexplicable “endings” could be seen as fitting, the series reminds us what we missed out on by ending where it should've started: with an ebullient, assured Carrie Bradshaw ready to embrace New York City, her friends, and her life in general, unencumbered by any obligations to the past — no Big and no Aidan, no mourning and no nostalgic clinging.

 










Doesn't that sound like a fun show to watch? Doesn't that sound like the show we thought we were going to watch? Doesn't it confound basic narrative logic to turn the beginning of something we never got to see into the end of something we didn't want?

And just like that… it was over. Not a redo or reboot, just doo-doo. 

Huh, I guess that is succinct. 

“And Just Like That” is available on HBO Max.

SPOILER ALERT! This story contains plot points from the series finale of And Just Like That on HBO Max. 


	Carrie Bradshaw's second chapter in the Big City finally came to an end Aug. 14, with the Sarah Jessica Parker character realizing that marriage wasn't in the cards, and it was more than okay to have an absurdly large brownstone all to herself. 


	Carrie's circle of friends also received some tidy goodbyes, though Cynthia Nixon's Miranda had to wade through literal shit (way to drop it like it's hot, Epcot) after having to accept that her son Brady was about to become a dad.

	Here, co-creator Michael Patrick King reflects on the comedy's final season, why Miranda was required to literally shovel shit, and whether another movie is in the cards for Carrie and her clan. 




			Watch on Deadline		







DEADLINE: Is this the ending you wanted? 


MICHAEL PATRICK KING: Yes. I wouldn't have stopped. The ending told us to stop when we were writing, and that sentence, the woman realized she was not alone. She was on her own. It was so important for me to hear, and it just sort of appeared. I was like, well, that's the ending, especially since it is a response and a callback to Carrie at the end of Sex and the City when she says, “the most significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself. And then if you find someone to love, love you, love, that's fabulous.” She's saying that voiceover while Mr. Big is calling to say, “I'm coming to town.” So the growth and the evolution and the resonance of her saying a new version of that when maybe no one is coming is the most significant addition we could add to this whole Carrie Bradshaw universe. I knew then that I wanted her to stop there because I believe that's her message to everyone who's been watching for many, many years. It's for the women who have someone or the people who have someone. More importantly, it's for the people who don't have someone. If you can feel good about the life you create, it's great.


DEADLINE And the other characters?












MPK: We ended all the other characters in this, I guess, projection of a happy ending. Miranda and Joy are back together, even though they have to clean up some shit every now and then. Harry and Charlotte are back in bed, which is so important because everything else in their relationship works as well. Even [Harry and Charlotte's nonbinary child] Rock ends by saying, “I'm going to be a lot of different people in my life.” Seema is saying she doesn't miss the gluten, but she's really saying is, “I don't miss the idea of a marriage binding people together.” And then Lisa is recommitting to Herbert by saying, I'm here. Even though there was no real split, there was an emotional doubling down on who they are. So yeah, that's where we felt it should stop. It felt so real to me that I went to Sarah Jessica and said, “I think this is it. This is where we stopped for Carrie.” And she said, “then we stop.” Luckily we're at a place like HBO Max where they go, “we think you did an amazing story. You got them all where they need to be.”


DEADLINE: The show has always gotten so much attention, this season notwithstanding. What has that been like for you?MPK: Well, I do the very clever thing of saying, what if you gave a party and nobody came? Everybody works really hard and you want it to be reflected back. It becoming a press piñata that's a party game was maybe something unexpected. But beyond everything that people have printed, there are people who have been watching it for many years. So there's this great back and forth between all the noise of how they would do it differently or what they like or don't like. And then there's just appreciation for the fact that they're seeing characters who went from 35 to 59. Trust me, you don't write for nothing, for no reaction. I mean, if you did that, you'd be a poet. I want a reaction to the work we all do. It's a double-edged sword. Yes, they're watching. And guess what? Yes, they're watching.


DEADLINE: Why the poo in Miranda's toilet? And not to get too down and dirty, but what served as your poop? Babe Ruths? MPK: It was silicone poop. And it was a one-take poop. We didn't have to do it twice. Sex and the City and And Just Like That has always dealt with a lot of relationship shit. This was a manifestation of how shit backs up and you have to deal with it. And also, we've always done high-low on the show. We've always done couture and comedy. We also had this highly elevated Victor Garber character trapped [in the apartment], and plot-wise, I wanted him to leave. But Carrie Bradshaw is hard to leave unless you're humiliated and don't want to be there. Otherwise, it was the symbolic version of having to deal with a lot of doo doo in relationships and it backs up if you don't.DEADLINE: There was something very special about the way Carrie talked to Seema about marriage at the wedding dress fashion show. MPK: That killed me. It's on the line where Seema says, “why did you want to get married?” And Carrie says, “because it meant I was chosen.” It resonates all the way back to Carrie Bradshaw [in Sex and the City] when she was someone who felt she needed to be chosen. And here she is at the end, choosing herself. I mean, that's it. That resonance and the fashion show and the idea of looking at marriage and the shiny part of it versus the depressing parts that Lisa and Charlotte are dealing with … even with all the ups and downs and average things that have happened, Carrie Bradshaw and these characters have always felt things and experienced things that maybe you haven't seen vocalized on television. Maybe you've seen 'em in life, but not this way.


DEADLINE: So in your mind, does Lisa end up getting Michelle Obama to narrate her documentary?MPK: Yes! Now we're at the point of fan fiction. What do I want to have happen? I think the documentary that we've shown is legitimate enough and important enough from the writers in the room to make Michelle Obama say, “oh, that's an interesting thing.” So yes, she does it. Let's do more fan fiction. Does Miranda finally win over [the mother of Brady's child] Mamma Mia? Yes.DEADLINE: Really? MPK: Yeah. Because there is a line where Carrie says, “I think you won her over.” And Miranda says, “yeah, I won the battle. Lost the war.” Miranda's going to make that happen. And apparently Joy's going to overcome her family stuff to be right there with her. And then the very last thing Rock says in the series is, “I'm going to be a lot of different people in my life.” I mean, what could be more evolved than the youngest character in the show saying there's a lot of people you can be?


DEADLINE: So can we expect And Just Like That movie? MPK: Look, I closed the book. Here's the sound of the book. Boom! And happily, there was no dust that came out of it. It was very alive, very active, very in the moment. It wasn't pulled off an old shelf. I chose it because it means something was alive. We took a show that's 27 years old and made it so alive that people had to have conversations about it.

This show never needed to happen. Che Diaz became the most disliked character on TV. You could edit the Wexley's out of all 3 seasons and nothing would change. And when did Aiden turn into such a whiny bitch? 

There were just too many characters in AJLT and very few were as compelling as the ones from the original series.

Not a single scene of the iconic trio together? This was a mess

I am so sad to see the end of the show. As a religious watcher I have seen every show & movie. My only regret is don't think I will live long enough to see any in the future. I love the cast & the content they are my family. GREAT JOB!

The finale was as perfectly awful as the episodes that came before.  Let's symbolically flush it down once and for all.  The fact that there wasn't even a Samantha mention in the final episode added insult to grievous injury.  RIP Carrie.  We do not want to see the Nursing Home reboot, either.

AJLT had its ups & downs, with ugly clothing and snotty New Yorkers acting superior. The best show of the season was the finale! The only thing that would've made it better would've been for a text from Samantha. ❤️

“And Just Like That” has taken its final bow, bringing another chapter of the “Sex and the City” legacy to a close. The finale gave fans one last chance to say goodbye to Carrie Bradshaw and her best friends.

The two-part series finale finally gave fans the closure they'd been waiting for, answering the big question of how Carrie's story would come to a close.

Unlike the original show, which spent a year building up to its farewell, the sequel wrapped up in just two weeks after announcing its end.

That quick turnaround left little time for fans to brace themselves for the final walks, talks & cocktails shared by Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda, Seema, Lisa Todd Wexley, Anthony, and the rest of the beloved ensemble. 

By the time the credits rolled, the finale had the challenging task of tying up lingering storylines. Yet, it managed to deliver a satisfying goodbye to an iconic TV world. 

Let's see what the finale episode meant for each of the characters in the “And Just Like That” universe. And yes, it's a blissfully happy ending. 

Carrie opened the episode at a Chinese restaurant, where a well-meaning waiter placed a stuffed toy across from her as a stand-in lunch date, a move that caught her completely off guard. 

Later, she met up with Seema, Lisa & Charlotte at a bridal fashion show, where the champagne flowed and the chatter, as always, circled back to love and relationships. Carrie later shares her vulnerable take on being alone with Charlotte.

Carrie navigates the idea of accepting herself without any man validating her. Charlotte, like a true friend, calls her “Fabulous”. 

Later, after a disastrous Thanksgiving chaos (and overflowing Toilet) at Miranda's, Carrie made a quiet exit and returned home, slipping into heels and singing along to a karaoke version of Barry White's “You're the First, the Last, My Everything.” 

The moment felt like a deliberate nod to the iconic “Sex and the City” finale, when she famously declared that “the most exciting, challenging & significant relationship of all is the one you have with yourself,” before adding, “… and if you find someone to love the you that you love, well, that's just fabulous.”

This time, there was no romantic add-on. She ended her novel with the line, “The woman realises she was not alone, she was on her own.” It was a deep and full-circle end for Carrie! And no, there is nothing wrong with being alone. 

Charlotte, like a giving friend, sets up a date for Carrie, and no, she's not happy with it. 

Of all the characters, Charlotte's ending might be the most satisfying. After a season packed with stress and chaos, she finally gets a rare moment to simply enjoy her family. 

While she wasn't pleased with many things happening in her family, she is blissfully happy with having them around. From the early days of the “Sex and the City” era, Charlotte has been obsessed with the idea of having a family by her side, so this moment feels like a perfect payoff, one that is both well-deserved & genuinely earned. The family shares a joyful moment around the dining table, proving that, in the end, everyone returns home both literally and figuratively!

Miranda's confusing storyline began on shaky ground and only found its footing in season 3. With her embracing the reality of her relationships with her son and estranged husband, we wish we could see her content and thriving in her relationships.

Be it her co-parenting with Steve and how they navigate becoming grandparents, or how her relationship with Joy (Dolly Wells) unfolds. Collective fan verdict: Miranda & Joy are happy together (with Joy's dogs by their side).

Joy finally shows up to Miranda's Thanksgiving dinner after it's over (with a clogged toilet). They hug it out as they finally are on the same page and are okay with each other's baggage.

Seema is still skeptical about Adam because he doesn't believe in marriage. She tells her friends how much she believes in the concept of marriage. She discusses it in-depth with Carrie. She reveals she is fond of Adam but doesn't believe in the idea of someone else choosing her. 

Later, Seema is seen sharing a pie with Adam and his sister. Marriage or no marriage, Seema and Adam are happy in their world. Dating in the 50s isn't easy, but there's still hope, and Seema's story proves just that. 

Anthony and Giuseppe (Sebastiano Pigazzi) are engaged, but Anthony is having doubts. Torn over their age difference and a disapproving future mother-in-law (Patti LuPone), and the baggage of a past failed marriage. Giuseppe, however, seems more than willing to risk it all for love. 

Anthony calls out Giuseppe for not wanting to marry him, accusing him of just looking for “a mummy.” Giuseppe's answer? Smashing a pie in Anthony's face. They both end up laughing, pie-covered & completely smitten. Married or not, Anthony and Giuseppe know how to make each other happy. The ending does leave us wondering whether the wedding happens. 

Lisa and Charlotte get into a deep conversation about their married lives. Lisa, who is attracted to her colleague, later shares a conversation with Herbert that eventually ends with her. So no, she is not cheating on her husband! She is accepting her marriage with all its imperfections. 

Despite the ups & downs, Lisa and Herbert have weathered the storms and remain committed to staying together.

The finale leaves fans craving more. With the AJLT kids each bringing their own bold personalities, it's hard not to imagine a spinoff: a Next Gen “Sex and the City” following their friendships, drama & every gloriously messy romance in between. 

Would it be chaotic? Absolutely. Would we binge every last episode? Without question. (Dear Sarah Jessica Parker & Michael Patrick King, are you listening?)

Paramount has taken a page from Pete “Maverick” Mitchell's own playbook today, and gone on the attack: The freshly acquired entertainment giant has just launched a countersuit against Shaun Gray, cousin of credited Top Gun: Maverick screenwriter Eric Warren Singer, alleging that even if Gray could prove he wrote a pretty decent chunk of the movie—as he's been alleging for the last few months—all it would prove is that he'd been violating the company's copyright by doing so.

The facts of this legal kerfuffle—which, owing to its high cousin-based content, we've come to think of as the “Cousin Fight,” even though Singer and Gray haven't taken any legal action against each other as of yet—are a little tricky to break down. What seems to have happened is that, when Singer (a long-time Hollywood writer who co-wrote American Hustle) was brought on by director Joseph Kosinski as the second writer to officially work on Maverick, he also brought on Gray to help him flesh things out and write several scenes. (Gray's mostly credited as a visual effects artist, but he does have one major writing credit—on Australian Apple TV+ show Shantaram, which Singer co-created.) During their collaboration, Gray reportedly contributed a number of major scenes that ended up surviving the hand-off to the next writer in the chain, including the opening action sequence where Maverick ends up blowing up his fancy super-plane because he just can't shake that dang need for speed.

Thing is, Hollywood studios really don't like it when screenwriters don't tell them that they've, say, unofficially hired their cousin to help them write their movies, mostly because it leads to legal troubles exactly like this one: Gray sued Paramount a few months back, alleging that, because he'd never signed a contract with the studio, he'd also never signed over any of his ownership rights to the script. Back in July, a judge shot down Gray's attempt to get legal co-ownership of the script (and an automatic chunk of its profits), but left a door open for suing the studio for copyright infringement—presumably what Paramount itself is now trying to shut down with this countersuit.

Because Paramount's lawyers are corporate movie studio lawyers, their response to Gray basically concedes none of the assertions in his original complaint. (About the only thing they'll allow is that Gray, Kosinski, and Singer were in story meetings together, and that Gray has registered the scenes in question with the U.S. Copyright Office.) When you get down to the company's counterclaims, though, they make the somewhat odd assertion that if Gray did write the material that Paramount then turned into a very successful movie, he did so while playing with Paramount's toys without their permission, and was thus committing copyright infringement. (That is, using characters like Maverick, which the studio owns, and building off of earlier drafts of the Maverick screenplay… which the studio owns. So he's actually the one infringing them—if he actually wrote those scenes, which Paramount doesn't admit. Isn't IP law interesting?) They're also suing him for fraud, on the more easy-to-follow argument that, by not disclosing his role on the writing team, and only trying to profit off of it years later, after the movie made a billion dollars, he was attempting to execute a shakedown of the studio.

For what it's worth, Gray has said he and Singer didn't disclose his role in co-writing the script because he was worried Paramount would yank the deal entirely if it was presented as part of a writing team. (A rare point of agreement between him and Paramount, which has said through lawyers that, had it known about any of this before the movie was shot, it would have ordered Singer not to work with his cousin, and excised any material Gray wrote before handing it off to another writer.) Singer, meanwhile, has stayed entirely silent on the topic, although Gray's lawyer put out a statement today accusing the credited author of creating a “secret deal” with Paramount behind his cousin's back.

Even if the end result doesn't entirely devolve into exploitation or tourism, poverty viewed through the lens of studio filmmaking is almost always used as an inelegant theme, a shocking image, or a tone of ogling pity, draped over a marketable template. This structure can take the form of a weepy family melodrama, or, in the case of Night Always Comes, a “one crazy night” crime caper. As Vanessa Kirby navigates Sarah Conradt's adaptation of Willy Vlautin's (Lean On Pete) novel, tangible concerns like the gentrification of Portland and the actual plights of poor people are run out of town by an escalating yet predictable plot with a glossy Netflix sheen.

If Night Always Comes committed itself to being the latter kind of movie, slick and silly and full of big-screen gangsters, its bit players and urban ephemera—cars spinning donuts at intersections, kids shooting off fireworks, cop lights bouncing off puddles on the asphalt—do tap into a simplistic pulp across the film's midnight odyssey. But prolific TV director Benjamin Caron‘s self-serious movie keeps digging itself into a hole, first with its narrative, then with its heroine's increasingly lurid backstory, until, like that heroine, it can't claw its way out.

Here, Kirby plays Lynette, a struggling woman juggling a pair of crappy jobs (factory and bar shifts) and a looming financial deadline. The walls are closing in, this beaten-over-the-head obviousness hammered by the scene-setting talk radio that opens her morning. Its message: The economy is in shambles. To humanize this point, Lynette, her erratic mom Doreen (Jennifer Jason Leigh), and her brother Kenny (Zack Gottsagen), who has a developmental disability, are on the brink of eviction, and on the cusp of finally securing some stable housing. But that hope is quickly punctured, their loan falling through thanks to Doreen's arbitrary selfishness. It's all set-up for the story's simple premise: Lynette needs to get her hands on $25,000 by the next morning.

Thus her quest begins, broken up by timecards ticking down to 9 AM. What initially feints at realistic drama concerned with the slippery and one-way slope into poverty—a film concerned with the qualities, circumstances, or crises that quickly yet permanently define people as unemployable or untrustworthy in the eyes of capitalism—becomes a low-rent sojourn into an unimaginative criminal underworld. Kirby is the sole guiding force throughout the film, initially tempering her desperation before falling fully into her character's dark past. 

But she's also the only character here. Lynette speedruns a slew of schemes, most of which are enabled by the racist idea that the one Black character in the movie (her new co-worker Cody, played by Stephen James) is connected to every kind of criminal who'd be helpful to the plot. Though a stranger to Lynette, Cody becomes her magical fix-it accomplice, someone who knows a guy who'll crack a stolen safe and a guy who'd buy a hot Mercedes. Kenny is similarly reduced; unlike his breakout role in The Peanut Butter Falcon, here Gottsagen is used as a prop, just one more plot point for Lynette to keep track of. This shallowness becomes more apparent as the expanding plot spreads everything thin. As Lynette tools around Portland, she flips through her seemingly endless rolodex of creepy contacts (Michael Kelly, Eli Roth), who dole out small hits of aid and overdoses of exposition. Julia Fox, playing an old escort buddy who secured a sugar daddy, is the only actor to actually make something of her small role, as messily scene-stealing as ever.

It's all more than a little goofy, the broadness clashing with Kirby's trauma-mining performance (one that never finds the engrossing focus of something like Pieces Of A Woman) and Caron's matter-of-fact direction, which elides fancy camera moves for mostly static fare—though shots designed around reflections or framed through high-rise windows add a bit of big-city polish unfit for the tale's grimy trajectory. It's this inability to reconcile tone and subject that cheapens Night Always Comes, turning a tale with bigger things on its mind into a trite, familiar breaking-bad narrative that only namechecks reality.

	Disney Branded Television has given a series greenlight to the supernatural dramady “Coven Academy,” which follows a trio of teenage witches-in-training.


	The series is a single-camera project from Tim Federle, the creator of the Emmy-winning “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” starring a young Olivia Rodrigo. “Coven Academy” was ordered to pilot in March. Now, the show will premiere on Disney+ and Disney Channel sometime in 2026.

	Set in New Orleans, the series promises a “thrilling, witty blend of magic, mystery and teen drama.” It follows aspiring teenage witches who are “bound by destiny to guard their city against dangerous, ancient forces.” Per the logline, “Between unraveling dark secrets, mastering volatile magic, and facing off against distractingly cute rivals, they must also navigate the heartbreaks and deep bonds that come with growing up.”

The Council on American-Islamic Relations, the nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, today sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling on him to clarify and retract “dangerously reckless” comments he made during an interview with a racist radio host in which he appeared to entertain the idea of the State Department designating American Muslim institutions as terrorist organizations based on a debunked, Islamophobic conspiracy about the Muslim Brotherhood.

On Aug. 13th, Rubio participated in a telephone interview with Sid Rosenberg, a radio host with a history of making racist remarks comparing Black female athletes to animals.

During the interview, Rosenberg pressed Rubio asked whether the State Department would designate “the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR” as terrorist organizations. He added, “Maybe not CAIR just yet, but certainly the Muslim Brotherhood?” In response, Rubio said, “All of that is in the works,” and noted the legal challenges involved in making such designations.

In a letter to Rubio, CAIR General Counsel & National Litigation Director Lena Masri wrote, in part:

“Your response, whether intentional or not, appeared to raise the possibility that the State Department is trying to find a way to weaponize federal terrorism laws against CAIR and other American Muslim institutions based on a debunked conspiracy theory.

“As you know, CAIR is our nation's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, as well as a duly registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

“Founded in 1994, CAIR now has 25 affiliated chapters nationwide and over 500 board and staff members across the country. Our mission is to enhance the public's understanding of Islam, protect civil rights, promote justice, and empower American Muslims. CAIR has spent 30 years vocally speaking up against all forms of bigotry, including anti-Black racism, Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian racism and antisemitism, as well as all forms of unjust violence, including hate crimes, ethnic cleansing, genocide and terrorism.

“CAIR has played a leading role in debunking the arguments of both anti-Muslim extremists and Muslim extremists who attempt to paint Islam as a religion of wanton violence. In fact, CAIR condemned terrorism so often that ISIS once put a target on our national executive director.

“Despite these facts, anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian hate groups have spent years falsely and nonsensically smearing CAIR and other American Muslim institutions as foreign agents of ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Hezbollah, Hamas, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the Muslim Brotherhood, all somehow at the same time. None of this makes sense because none of it is true.

“The truth is that CAIR is an independent American nonprofit organization that operates in full compliance with federal, state, and local laws. CAIR is not—and has never been—a member, chapter, offshoot, or affiliate of any foreign organization.”

CAIR's letter to Rubio also noted that the conspiracy theory that the Muslim Brotherhood controls American Muslim institutions has been repeatedly debunked by experts, and that both the State Department and the Justice Department under prior administrations have rejected baseless calls to target American Muslim institutions like CAIR.

Masri added:

“The real reason anti-Muslim hate groups and pro-Israel lobby group obsessively target CAIR and other American Muslim institutions is because of our steadfast advocacy for Palestinian rights. To these groups, whose top priority is protecting the Israeli government from criticism, any American Muslims who recognize that Palestinians are human beings worthy of freedom are a threat who must be smeared and silenced.

These hate groups fear that American Muslims will continue to become more civically engaged and politically impactful, leading to the reorientation of American foreign policy in a more just and humane direction.

Although the Trump administration may strongly disagree with CAIR's criticism of the Israeli government, that disagreement is not the basis for public smears, much less legal action.”

CAIR called on Rubio to clarify his remarks and affirm that the State Department will not misuse federal terrorism laws to target American Muslim institutions based on conspiracy theories or their exercise of free speech. CAIR also vowed to carry on its civil rights and advocacy work, including advocating for an end to the genocide in Gaza, regardless of threats and smears from extremist voices.

In East Freetown, a simple Starbucks cold brew bottle turned into something straight out of a ghost story.

David Eaton recently recorded a video showing the plastic cap on his coffee container moving on its own. No hands in sight, no wind, no explanation. Eaton said the eerie motion had been going on for several minutes before he even started filming.

“It's crazy,” he said. “I've had other paranormal activity in my house too. Just this week alone I was grabbed twice, but the weird thing is, I don't feel threatened.”

According to Eaton, strange happenings have been a part of life ever since he bought the home three years ago and even prior to that. Over the years, his daughter's boyfriend claims to have seen what looked like a little girl wandering inside. The activity was unsettling enough for Eaton to sage the home just two weeks ago, but the unexplained events haven't stopped.

“I don't know what it is,” he said. “But it's definitely there.”

Whether you're a believer in the paranormal or a skeptic searching for a logical explanation, Eaton's coffee cap video is just the latest chapter in a haunting mystery brewing in East Freetown.

*Supernatural* (2005–2020) redefined supernatural television with its gritty monster-of-the-week format evolving into a cosmic battle between heaven, hell, and humanity. Created by **Eric Kripke**, the series followed brothers **Sam (Jared Padalecki)** and **Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles)** as they hunted demons, ghosts, and gods across America in their iconic 1967 Impala ("Baby"). Originally planned for 3–5 seasons, its unexpected 15-year run cemented it as the longest-running American fantasy series, spanning 327 episodes.  



---  



### **I. The Kripke Era: Foundations of a Mythos (Seasons 1–5)**  

*The "master plan" that established the show's core themes of family, sacrifice, and free will.*  



- **Season 1: Origins of the Hunt**  

  After their mother's death by the **Yellow-Eyed Demon (Azazel)**, John Winchester (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) raises Sam and Dean as hunters. Sam leaves for Stanford but rejoins Dean after his girlfriend Jessica dies identically to their mother. The brothers search for John while battling urban-legend monsters, uncovering Sam's emerging psychic powers. The season climaxes with a car crash after John is possessed by Azazel.  



- **Season 2: Deals with Devils**  

  John sacrifices himself to save Dean, who is resurrected with a **one-year death sentence**. Sam and Dean ally with hunters **Bobby Singer (Jim Beaver)** and **Ellen and Jo Harvelle** to kill Azazel. Sam dies but is resurrected after Dean sells his soul to a demon. Azazel's death frees hundreds of demons from Hell.  



- **Season 3: Racing Against Hell**  

  Dean's deal looms as demons wreak havoc. The brothers clash with thief **Bela Talbot** and ally with the demon **Ruby (Genevieve Cortese)**, who aids their fight against **Lilith**—the demon holding Dean's contract. Dean descends to Hell in the finale.  



- **Season 4: Angels and the Apocalypse**  

  Dean is rescued from Hell by the angel **Castiel (Misha Collins)**. Sam, addicted to demon blood, helps Ruby kill Lilith—unaware this breaks the final **"66 Seal"** to free **Lucifer**. Heaven's plan to trigger the Apocalypse is revealed.  



- **Season 5: Defying Destiny**  

  Sam and Dean are destined vessels for Lucifer and the archangel Michael. With allies like Crowley (Mark Sheppard), they trap both Lucifer and Michael in Hell using the **Four Horsemen's rings**. Dean retires with Lisa, while Sam returns mysteriously.  



*Table: The Kripke Era's Core Arc*  

| **Season** | **Big Bad** | **Key Twist** | **Brother Sacrifice** |  

|------------|-------------|---------------|------------------------|  

| 1 | Azazel | Sam's psychic powers | John trades life for Dean |  

| 2 | Azazel | Dean's soul deal | Dean trades soul for Sam |  

| 3 | Lilith | Dean's descent to Hell | Sam fails to save Dean |  

| 4 | Lilith | Lucifer freed | Sam's demon blood addiction |  

| 5 | Lucifer | Apocalypse thwarted | Sam traps himself with Lucifer |  



---  



### **II. Expanding the Universe: New Threats and Lore (Seasons 6–11)**  

*Post-Kripke seasons that escalated stakes to cosmic levels.*  



- **Season 6: Souls and Soulless Sam**  

  Sam returns soulless, while Castiel allies with **Crowley** to absorb souls from **Purgatory**, becoming a self-proclaimed god. Dean uncovers the Leviathans—ancient monsters locked in Purgatory.  



- **Season 7: Leviathan Invasion**  

  Castiel unleashes the Leviathans, who infiltrate society. The Winchesters destroy their leader **Dick Roman** but are stranded in Purgatory.  



- **Season 8: Trials and Tribulations**  

  Dean escapes Purgatory; Sam abandons hunting. They reunite to close Hell's gates via the **"Trials of Hell,"** discovering the legacy of the **Men of Letters**.  



- **Season 9: Angelic Civil War**  

  Angels fall to Earth after Castiel steals grace. Dean becomes a **Knight of Hell** via the **Mark of Cain**, while Metatron manipulates Heaven.  



- **Season 10: Mark of Cain's Curse**  

  Dean's demonic corruption forces Sam to seek a cure. Removing the Mark unleashes **The Darkness (Amara)**—God's sister.  



- **Season 11: God vs. Darkness**  

  God (Chuck Shurley) returns to battle Amara. Jack's sacrifice reconciles them, restoring reality.  



---  



### **III. The Endgame: Family Legacies and Final Battles (Seasons 12–15)**  

*Converging storylines leading to the Winchesters' ultimate sacrifice.*  



- **Season 12: British Invasion & Mary's Return**  

  Resurrected by Amara, **Mary Winchester** struggles with hunting. The **British Men of Letters** target Sam and Dean, while Lucifer fathers a Nephilim son, **Jack**.  



- **Season 13: Apocalypse World**  

  Jack becomes a Winchester ally. Mary and Lucifer are trapped in an alternate world ruled by **Michael**. Sam and Dean rescue Mary but unleash Michael.  



- **Season 14: Michael's Reign & Jack's Power**  

  Dean battles Michael's possession. Jack absorbs Michael's grace but turns destructive after his soul deteriorates. Castiel kills him, triggering God's wrath.  



- **Season 15: God's Final Story**  

  **Chuck (God)** is revealed as the Winchesters' manipulator. Jack absorbs his power to become the new God. In the series finale, Dean dies in a routine hunt; Sam lives a normal life, reuniting with Dean in Heaven.  



*Table: The Final Arcs' Thematic Shifts*  

| **Season** | **Central Conflict** | **Winchester Growth** |  

|------------|----------------------|------------------------|  

| 12 | Family vs. Institution | Rebuilding trust with Mary |  

| 13 | Multiverse Survival | Mentoring Jack as a son |  

| 14 | Power vs. Humanity | Jack's moral corruption |  

| 15 | Rejecting Destiny | Sam/Dean break God's narrative |  



---  



### **IV. Behind the Scenes: Crafting a Phenomenon**  

- **Creative Evolution**: Kripke's initial "monster-of-the-week" vision shifted focus to Sam/Dean's bond after recognizing Padalecki/Ackles' chemistry.  

- **Cultural Touchstones**: The Impala (changed from a Mustang for its imposing aesthetic), fan conventions, and meta-episodes like "The French Mistake" became iconic.  

- **Legacy**: Despite criticism of later seasons' repetitiveness, the show maintained a devoted "SPN Family" fandom.  



---  



### **V. The Future: Revivals and Returns**  

- **Potential Revival**: Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles have teased a **2025 limited series**, citing a "five-year break" post-finale as ideal.  

- **Spin-offs & Comics**: *The Winchesters* (2022) was canceled after one season, but a new **comic series (Oct 2025)** will bridge Seasons 1–2.  

- **Cast Reunions**: Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins will share scenes in *The Boys* Season 5, fueling revival hopes.  



---  

**Carry On, Wayward Sons...**  

*Supernatural* blended horror, humor, and heart across 15 seasons, transforming from a road-trip monster hunt into a saga about defiance, family, and self-determination. With its universe still expanding through comics and potential revivals, the Winchester legacy endures—proving that "saving people, hunting things" remains an eternal mission. As Dean would say: "Driver picks the music. Shotgun shuts his cakehole." 🚗🎵

			From the Chicago Bean man to alien-powered pyramids, well-known monuments have long been at the centre of peculiar speculation

The news that a Chicago city councillor has been forced to deny that there is a man trapped inside the “Chicago Bean”, one of the city's best known tourist attractions, follows in a long tradition of well-known sites becoming shrouded in conspiracy theories.

Earlier this month protestors gathered at Millennium Park demanding the release of the so-called “man in the bean” while claiming that artist Anish Kapoor kidnapped a baby in 2004 and sealed him inside Cloud Gate (the sculpture's official name).

The theory quickly moved from obscure Reddit threads to an Instagram account with more than 35,000 followers.

When it comes to the planet's tourism hotspots, peculiar theories abound, from Parisian landmarks secretly exerting mind control over the local population to hidden rooms housing some of America's biggest secrets.

A slew of dystopic movies has trained us to expect alien motherships hovering over New York, so it's hardly surprising that Lady Liberty has ended up tangled in her fair share of intergalactic rumours.

Grainy footage regularly resurfaces online showing a mysterious flying object buzzing around her crown. Non-conspiracists label it a weather balloon, a drone or even a wayward military aircraft.

However in 2018, artist Joseph Reginella added his own twist. Known for planting fictitious public memorials across New York, Reginella erected a plaque at Battery Park commemorating a supposed 1977 “harbour tragedy” in which all six crew members of a tugboat vanished while investigating “what appeared to be a private aircraft crash” in New York Harbour. It was, of course, completely fabricated.

The most prominent theory that surrounds Gustav Eiffel's iron-clad behemoth originates from the tower's own origins. It was supposed to be temporary, but instead of dismantling it after the Exposition Universelle of 1889, better known in English as the 1889 Paris Exposition, the city gave its new landmark over to science and by 1903, it was doubling as a military radio antenna.

Legend has it that Nikola Tesla met Gustave Eiffel at the 1889 Paris Exposition, sharing his vision for wireless energy. The tower's height, steel frame and later role in long-distance communication fits neatly into the theory that it was secretly part of Tesla's abandoned Wardenclyffe network – a planned global system of 30 towers transmitting free energy.

The official line? Eiffel never worked with Tesla, and the tower's radio use was purely military. The conspiracy line? Powerful interests killed Tesla's free-energy dream before it could threaten the business of selling electricity.

When sculptor Gutzon Borglum envisioned Mount Rushmore in the 1920s, it wasn't intended just to be four presidential heads staring out over the South Dakota plains.

His original plan included an 800ft staircase leading to a grand “Hall of Records”, a cavern lined with bronze and glass cabinets, historic artefacts and inscriptions explaining America's story. Sadly cuts to his government funding meant he had to stick to the faces. The unfinished chamber was sealed behind a 1,200-lb granite slab, and officials insist there's nothing in there.

Of course, for conspiracy theorists, that's exactly what you'd say if you were hiding something. Depending on who you choose to believe, the room in fact contains lost Civil War cannons, almost a billion dollars of gold coins rescued from an early 1910s shipwreck, the original atomic bomb plans or (the old conspiracy classic) a direct tunnel to the Hollow Earth.

It's a ring of enormous stones in the middle of an English field and nobody quite knows why it's there. Archaeologists say it was built around 5,000 years ago as some kind of ceremonial or astronomical site. However, other theorists disagree.

Apparently Stonehenge was either a giant healing machine, a landing pad for extraterrestrials or an ancient portal used by druids to zip between dimensions. The perfect alignment of the stones with the summer and winter solstice only fuels the “alien tech” crowd, who insist no Bronze Age human could drag 25-ton slabs without some help from space. English Heritage maintains it was all good old-fashioned Neolithic muscle.

If you wanted to hide evidence of alien contact, you probably wouldn't put it in the middle of the Sahara in a structure taller than a 40-story building. Yet here we are.

The pyramids of Giza have spent 4,500 years inspiring awe, tourism and theories that insist they're actually high-voltage energy transmitters left behind by extraterrestrial contractors.

Their perfect geometry, astronomical alignments and the mystery of how millions of stone blocks were hauled into place have spawned theories ranging from “time machines” to “GPS markers for starships”. Some believers say the blocks were moulded, not quarried – ancient 3D printing, if you will. Egypt's official story is less cinematic: human sweat, copper tools and a lot of rope did the job.

Scientists have examined scientific articles and media publications from the last 30 years devoted to the search for extraterrestrial life. They analyzed in which aspects and promises scientists were overly optimistic, and in which journalists distorted everything.

So far, no life has been found beyond Earth, but publications about the prospects for such research continue to appear one after another. And not only in scientific publications, but also in popular media. At the same time, it is difficult to give a simple answer as to whether modern science is really sure of its existence.

Researchers from Leiden University attempted to figure this out. In a study recently published in PLOS One, they took a bunch of studies, press releases, and newspaper articles on the subject from 1996 to 2024 and analyzed what they were overly optimistic about and what they were not.

The total number of articles analyzed was 630. Most of them were in English, although there were also publications in Spanish and Portuguese. In particular, sources included The New York Times (United States), The Guardian (United Kingdom), Folha and Estadão (Brazil), Público (Portugal), and El País (Spain).

Researchers found that most often the distortion concerned the conditions necessary for life to exist outside Earth, i.e., the question of the “key condition.” However, speculation about the results of research and the prospects for detecting life was relatively rare.

The study showed that expectations regarding technology helping to find life beyond Earth are relatively high. They appear in about a third of news articles, a fifth of press releases, and a tenth of scientific articles. The promise of rapid development in astrobiology in the near future was also quite widespread. Approximately one-fifth of press releases and news articles contained such content.

However, there are very few promises to find extraterrestrial life in publications, at least in those that appeared in peer-reviewed journals. There is much more manipulation in newspaper publications. Press releases remained largely neutral except for the part about the research results, which were usually exaggerated.

The study also reveals that expectations for the search for life are more closely linked to the study of exoplanets than to the study of the Solar System, and are much higher than for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI).

There is indeed a lot of speculation. However, according to the authors of the study, this is not such a bad thing. After all, there is so much unknown in the Universe, and in order to develop new bold theories, we need to move beyond what we see here and now.

The CW has gone through many changes, from featuring young adult dramas to an expansive DC universe. But when Supernatural aired in 2005, horror was not in the zeitgeist. Gilmore Girls was in its heyday, and Dawson's Creek had just concluded. When the horror series aired, however, it started a franchise that would last a decade and a half. Eric Kripke created the series, which was in part inspired by the dynamic between Luke Skywalker and Han Solo.

Supernatural starred Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki as the demon-fighting Winchester brothers, who clashed with each other almost as much as monsters. Dean was the impulsive and hot-headed brother, while Sam was more compassionate and understanding. The series unpacked their familial trauma while hunting demons, drawing a line in the sand between humans and the creatures they hunted. This was a stark contrast to a horror series that would premiere only four years later.

While the boys on Supernatural beheaded vicious creatures like vampires, another series found romanticism in them. The Vampire Diaries premiered in 2009, adapted from L.J. Smith's series of romance books of the same name. With True Blood and Twilight a hot commodity, The Vampire Diaries would fit into pop culture. What didn't seem to fit into were the footsteps that Supernatural left behind.

Though airing on the same network, the two series had a different perspective on horror. The Winchesters were out for bloody revenge against monsters that had torn their family apart. Elena Gilbert found a soft spot in her heart for not just one vampire, but two. On occasion, Supernatural found common ground with monsters with a conscience, but that wasn't typically the status quo. Their father, John, had raised them to hate everything that went bump in the night because a demon had burned their mother alive in one of Supernatural's scariest cold opens.

 John's parenting was cruel and neglectful as he prioritized hunting demons over caring for his sons, who essentially lost a mother and a father that night. Dean and Sam had a reason to hate vampires and other creatures, while Elena did not. When she eventually found out that her boyfriend Stefan had to survive on human blood, she was afraid for only about an episode. When she saw his compassion and willingness to curb his urges, to find a better way to live, it was easier for her to look past the vampire issue.

Supernatural and The Vampire Diaries had different demographics as well. The Winchesters were in their mid to late 20s, while The Vampire Diaries was a series geared toward teens. Vampires were made out to be romantic figures because that is what would appeal to that age group. Twilight had been the litmus test for these types of stories and had shown that a human-vampire love triangle was the secret sauce for success.

Despite these inherently opposed values, however, The Vampire Diaries and Supernatural closed a gap between each other. Young women gravitated towards both shows, though it wasn't evident on the surface. Supernatural may appear to be a more adult series, but the quality of the writing was closer to the teen show than it would seem. Fans devoted themselves to both fandoms because both series were just about two brothers.

The Vampire Diaries may seem frivolous to some viewers, but the seductive love triangle was a Trojan horse for a truly heartbreaking story. The most interesting part of the teen romance was not the love story at all, but the inner conflict that drove the emotional stakes of the show. Like Supernatural, The Vampire Diaries succeeded because of the love that two brothers had for each other. Since the beginning, Damon and Stefan Salvatore fulfilled the classic older fraternal archetypes.

As the older brother, Damon was darker, more morally complex, while Stefan was the heart of the family. This wasn't always the case, however. Like in Supernatural, family trauma fueled the dynamic between the brothers that almost led to estrangement. At the height of the Civil War, Damon and Stefan were as close as any brothers could be. In a predictable turn of events, a woman came between them, but that wasn't the nail in the proverbial vampire coffin. It was the events that led the two brothers to become vampires.

Jealousy had always been an issue between the Salvatores, but that didn't stop their codependency. After being fed vampire blood, both brothers were killed, which started their transition into vampirism. Stefan completed the transition when he killed their father, but at the time, Damon was less interested in living forever. Without the love of their lives, Katherine Pierce, Damon saw no point in becoming a vampire. It was only upon Stefan's begging not to endure immortality alone that his older brother became a vampire. This began over a century of bad blood between the two that was only healed when both returned to Mystic Falls, Virginia, the place of their birth.

The estrangement between the brothers and their ultimate healing journey mirrored that of the Winchester brothers. Like the Salvatores, the Winchesters experienced a similar estrangement at the start of Supernatural. Sam had committed the ultimate sin when he abandoned John's crusade to go to college and have a normal life. Sam was always at odds with his brother and father, having issues with how he was raised.

He mourned his mother, and when his father went missing and the Yellow-Eyed Demon returned, he came back to the fold. Despite their differences, he and Dean banded together to find out exactly what happened to John Winchester. Their search for John was less than fruitful as they lost yet another member of the Winchester clan. This only proved to bring them closer. Hardship bonded more than one supernatural brotherhood. If it wasn't for the events of these television shows, neither family would have found the catharsis they needed.

What these families really need is therapy, but external conflict is the next best thing. At the start of both Supernatural and The Vampire Diaries, neither of the families would have thought that they would find absolution. Damon came to Mystic Falls for destroying Stefan, while Sam never would have returned to the family business had he not experienced another personal tragedy. Both these events started a chain of events that healed the wounds that the Salvatores and Winchesters had been harboring for so long.

Damon, in particular, was so wounded by his family that he was inexorably changed. In his human life, he was kind and sincere, but Stefan's betrayal set him on a path of darkness. Coerced into becoming a vampire, Damon had a right to resent Stefan. Still, he cared for him, watching his younger brother descend down a path of blood addiction. The once sweet boy leaned into vampirism, relishing the chase and devouring his victims. Damon's darkness was a stark contrast to the person he had been, and it was fair to say that wouldn't have happened had it not been for Stefan.

These emotional wounds would persist throughout the series, sometimes arising in the Salvatores' fight over the human Elena. The protagonist of the show didn't last the entirety of The Vampire Diaries, and when Nina Dobrev left following Season 6, it was just the Salvatore Show. Interestingly enough, The Vampire Diaries still functioned relatively the same. That was because Damon and Stefan's fraught relationship had powered The Vampire Diaries from the beginning.

 Without Elena present, the two could finally acknowledge what had been hurting them all this time. Stefan achieved the redemption he had been looking for by saving Damon and Mystic Falls, even if it meant sacrificing himself. At the end of The Vampire Diaries, Elena felt more like a footnote. The final moment was about Damon and Stefan meeting in the afterlife, which was the only thing that would mean happiness for one another. This is not dissimilar to the ending of Supernatural.

After 15 years, Supernatural finally came to a close familiarly, with the death of one of the brothers. Dean Winchester died from an unfortunately placed nail, which wasn't the most heroic ending for the demon hunter. That was also beside the point, because one day, he would be reunited with Sam in their own afterlife. The Winchesters were just as codependent as the Salvatores — if not more so — and no matter how many partners they had, the story had always been about them.

They overcame their estrangement and sacrificed themselves for each other countless times so they could finally be at peace. When viewing these series through that lens, The Vampire Diaries and Supernatural are essentially about the same thing. While the storytelling is not quite in the same realm, the all-encompassing love of people who would die for each other is the most compelling part of both shows.

The show's misguided first season exposed all the cracks that made its cancellation feel inevitable.

The end of The Vampire Diaries is filled with sacrifices, tears and bittersweet moments. Did all the characters get their happy endings?

Over two decades, the lead stars returned for a sequel sans the original director.

The actor gets candid about the iconic role he let slip away.

FOMO can cause One Piece viewers to skip certain arcs to catch up, but you would only be doing yourself a disservice if you skip Skypiea.

Dragon Ball Super's decision to bring back Future Trunks was the key ingredient for a great arc, but the recipe for disaster for DBZ's themes.

The Extraterrestrial Materials Analysis Group (ExMAG) meeting is scheduled for September 15–19, 2025, at the Lunar and Planetary Institute (LPI) in Houston, Texas.

The Second ExMAG/MEPAG Joint Workshop: Connecting Community Scientific Hypotheses to Mars Sample Science, which was scheduled for September 18–19, 2025, has been merged into this ExMAG meeting.

The meeting will focus on NASA's extraterrestrial materials collections, curation, and sample return activities, such as linking the samples collected by Mars 2020 to scientific hypotheses and the connection between the Mars scientific community and sample scientists across a broad range of domains. Additionally, the meeting will include presentations on geological context and different types of Mars 2020 samples and speciﬁc science hypotheses that are testable on these samples. Finally, the meeting will also provide updates from NASA HQ and curation as well as reports on the collections, sample return activities in progress and planned, advanced curation methods, NASA funding and facilities, and data archiving.

U.S. Representative Anna Paulina Luna claimed that she has definitive proof that "interdimensional beings" that can move "out of time and space" exist.

Anna Paulina Luna is beaming up some out-of-this-world news.

The GOP Representative for Florida's 13th congressional district said she has reason to believe "interdimensional beings" exist, citing her political and military career as her reasoning why. 

Although Luna—who leads the House Oversight Task Force on declassification of federal secrets—admitted to Joe Rogan that she hasn't seen "a portal open" or "a spaceship personally," she argued that other evidence proves their existence.

"Have I seen photo documentation of aircraft that I believe were not made by mankind? Yes," the 36-year-old explained on the Aug. 14 episode of the Joe Rogan Experience. "Is there historical significance to this? Yes." 

"Based on the photos that I've seen," she asserted, "I'm very confident that there's things out there that have not been created by mankind."

What are these Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), formerly known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), which Luna claimed move "out of time and space?" 

"These energy things," she explained, "I think that they can actually operate through the time spaces that we currently have. That's not something that I came up with on my own. That's based on stuff that we've seen, that is based on information that we've been told." 

The politician—who is also a member of the Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Caucus—pointed to the controversial claims made by former United States Air Force officer David Grusch during a 2023 congressional hearing that the government has a highly secretive UFO retrieval program.

"When you talk about the interdimensional aspect of these things preexisting outside of what we currently know as our own dimension, that stuff can kind of all sound crazy," Luna admitted to Rogan. "At the end of the day, you know, my job as an investigator is to receive all the information and decipher it."

She also shared that she had gone to Eglin Air Force Base in Florida after multiple Air Force pilots accused the military branch of covering up UAP incidents. 

Luna, who served in the Air Force, criticized the military's response to their inquiries, adding that she had received pushback from the Pentagon and the Secretary of Defense when asking for them to share information with Congress.

E! News has reached out to the Department of Defense for comment and has not yet heard back. 

Although Luna admitted that the conversation can seem unrealistic, she didn't "look at it with a crazy lens and perspective."

As she explained, "You never know if we're the only ones out there, essentially."

Not everyone shares Luna's beliefs on the matter, however. NASA's Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Independent Study Team member Joshua Semeter previously admitted that he doesn't believe there's enough evidence.

"His claims are two steps removed from being Earth-shattering: not only has he not shared any verifiable evidence—photographs, artifacts, or any other manner of data—but he also has not personally seen or touched any of the objects he references," he told Boston University Today of Grusch's testimony in 2023. "In the long history of claims of extraterrestrial visitors, it is this level of specificity that always seems to be missing."

Courteney Cox

The one where Courteney Cox shares a ghost story.The Friends star told Howard Stern she had a delivery man ring her doorbell and inform her of an unexpected guest."I answered it, got my package and he said, 'Do you know this house is haunted?'" Courteney said on a 2022 episode of his SiriusXM show. "And I go, 'Really? Why?' He goes, ‘Because there's someone standing behind you.' And I thought, ‘Oh s--t.'”This wasn't her only spooky experience, however. Courteney also recalled a scare she had in London. "I'd just gotten there," the Scream alum added. "So yeah, I was a little jet-lagged but I wasn't sleeping. I was sitting there, I closed my eyes to try to sleep and all of a sudden I saw these really scary faces—like old faces. I was like, 'OK, stop, stop, you gotta stop.' And then all of a sudden I was like, 'Mom? Dad? Auntie Em?' I don't know. I just kept seeing all these weird things."After also seeing lights and a plant move, Courteney alerted her longtime love Johnny McDaid."I was like, 'Johnny! Wake up! I'm seeing spirits!'" the actress added. "And he had all these waves around him too. And he goes, 'Courteney, you're asleep.' I said, 'No, I just woke you up! How can I be asleep?' He's like, 'Well, I'm asleep. There are no ghosts.' I did see them for sure."Ultimately, Courteney warded them off with a request."I said, 'Thanks for visiting last night. That was fun. Do not come back tonight cause I have to sleep,'" she said. "And I didn't see them again."

Demi Lovato

Demi Lovato is confident her childhood home in Texas in haunted."When I was a little girl, my mom walked into the room and I was talking to something," the singer recalled on a 2013 episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. "And my mom was like, 'Who are you talking to?' I was like, 'It's the little girl in the picture frame. Her name is Emily.' And then my little sister ended up doing that when she was around the same age. But this time, she was like, 'It's the girl that lives in the closet.'"If that example didn't make you feel like you're having a heart attack, this one might. Demi remembered inviting friends over and telling them, "Watch, something will happen." And while pals would initially have their doubts, she said, odd things would then occur—like when her buddy texted someone saying "I think this place is haunted" and the word "definitely" was sent back multiple times."He's like, 'Why'd you send it so many times?'" the Grammy winner recounted. "He goes, 'I didn't send it that many times.'"Still not convinced? Demi has even more proof."My uncle actually was watching TV and all of a sudden this balloon floated down the stairs," she told Ellen DeGeneres. "What balloon floats down, by the way? And then it turns the corner."

Joey King

While Joey King starred in The Conjuring as a kid, she also had a frightful incident off-camera."In the story, when the mom gets possessed, she gets all these bruises on her," the actress explained on a 2020 episode of The Howard Stern Show. "And so during the filming of those particular scenes, I started having a lot of bruises show up on my body in bizarre places, like on my stomach, on my chest, like what?"Initially, Joey added, the makeup artists thought she was stealing their fake bruises as a prank. "They tried to take my real bruises off with rubbing alcohol and oil," The Act alum continued. "I'm like, 'I'm telling you, I'm not lying.'"Joey then visited her doctor to get some blood tests. "All of a sudden, I'm told that I have this blood-thinning condition called ITP, where basically most of my red platelets drained from my body mysteriously," she shared. "I'd never had a blood problem in the past. I've never had a blood problem since then. No one in my family has that."As a result, Joey noted, she had to go to the hospital twice a day while filming the 2013 horror movie."When I came home, my platelets were completely fine," The Kissing Booth star told Howard. "Like, I was back up to the normal numbers and I've never since had a trace of that disorder ever."

Ariana Grande

Just keep breathin' as you read about Ariana Grande's terrifying incident.The Grammy winner told Complex about the "ghost/demon experience" she had in Kansas City in 2013. After staying in a haunted castle, Ariana said, "the next night we wanted to go to Stull Cemetery, which is known as one of the seven gates to hell on Earth."I felt this sick, overwhelming feeling of negativity over the whole car and we smelled sulfur, which is the sign of a demon, and there was a fly in the car randomly, which is another sign of a demon," she recalled to the outlet. "I was like, 'This is scary, let's leave.' I rolled down the window before we left and said, 'We apologize. We didn't mean to disrupt your peace.' Then I took a picture and there are three super distinct faces in the picture—they're faces of textbook demons."The "Thank U, Next" singer said she deleted the photo after she tried to send the picture to her manager and got a message back that read, "This file can't be sent, it's 666 megabytes." Ariana also remembered once seeing a huge black cloud beside her bed."I started crying," she added to Complex. "I was on the phone like, 'What do I do, what do I do?' and they said, 'Tell it to eff off.' I thought, I'm not going to do that. It's going to upset it, so I'm just going to chill and not feed into it because all it wants is fear. It feeds on fear. I watched it move to the front of my bed and then I fell asleep on the phone. I woke up and it was gone."

Octavia Spencer

Truth be told, Octavia Spencer doesn't seem to mind having a spirit in her house."I grew up watching Westerns," she said on a 2021 episode of The Ellen DeGeneres Show. "I bought this house, and it was owned by a guy who did Westerns. So I must have been a fan of his. I think he is my protector. I love him because he kind of sorts out the bad people that shouldn't be there. He runs them out."And if you're wondering how exactly the ghost runs them out, allow the Oscar winner to explain."If they stay at my place, they don't want to come back," she added. "And that's how I know that they don't belong there. Because if you're a person that belongs there, everybody's like, 'Oh, you're place is so welcoming. It's so great.' And that's how I feel about it."Although, Octavia admitted her ghost can be "shady" if she's gone for a long time, such as by randomly closing doors and turning off the lights. And while this spirit is welcome, the Hidden Figures star made it clear she isn't offering an open invitation."I love my ghost," she noted. "I just don't want you bringing your ghost to my house. I don't want anybody's ghost thinking they can be friends with my ghost. 'Cause my ghost can haunt me, but he doesn't haunt me. We have boundaries."

Jennifer Aniston

Jennifer Aniston wasn't exactly friends with the ghost she says resided at a house she previously owned in Los Angeles."The dishwasher would start to go, or the coffee maker would start to go or the stereo would just turn on at full volume," the Friends star told James Corden on a 2018 episode of The Late Late Show. "And it was terrifying."So, Jennifer continued, someone suggested she call a specialist to "clear the house" of the spirit."I had someone come over to my house," The Morning Show actress shared. "They had frankincense and they put it in a little dish and sort of start saying all these things. And the first corner that she went to, the dish cracked."But that wasn't all. Jennifer recalled how a "really, thick, thick, thick 1975 ashtray that was sitting on the table" also cracked and that the specialist asked her to leave so she could talk to the spirit.As for what the spirit said? "He hated my roommate," Jennifer replied, later adding she moved out and never told the roommate. "I feel terrible but I couldn't say, 'It doesn't like you.' I mean that would be terrible."

Miley Cyrus

It appears some ghosts can't be tamed—just ask Miley Cyrus.The singer once spoke about a spirit she said lived in her house.“I had a friend who a parent had passed away," she explained in a 2020 interview with 102.7KIISFM's JoJo Wright. "And when they did, they know how much I love Elvis [Presley] and gave me all of their Elvis memorabilia."However, Miley said the memorabilia was destroyed when her Malibu house caught fire in 2018. In one of the rooms of her L.A. home, the Grammy winner had a photo of her friend's late mom."After that [fire] happened she started visiting my house in L.A," she added. "It was like she kind of went up in this smoke of all this Elvis memorabilia."Miley said it was like the fire "released" her friend's late mom, and she soon got rid of the picture."She smoked cigarettes and I could smell smoke coming from the guest room, which is where the photo is," she said. "My dogs would go insane. When I would be feeling it, my dogs would lose their mind. It actually happened only a couple nights ago, I thought that I, I feel like, saw her sitting on the couch kind of taunting my dogs, which is something she totally would've done. And my dogs were going nuts."

Keanu Reeves

You'll want to speed on over to hear Keanu Reeves' ghost story.The Matrix star once revealed an unexplainable experience he had at his family's New York apartment when he was 6 or 7 years old."There's a doorway," Keanu said on a 2014 episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!. "All of a sudden, we're looking over there and this, like, jacket comes waving through the doorway. Just an empty—there's no head, there's no body, there's no legs. It's just there, and then it disappears."While the John Wick actor wasn't too freaked out, he said his nanny was."I was a little kid, and I was like, 'Well that was interesting,'" he remembered. "And then I looked over at the nanny and she's like this [jaw open]. And I'm like, 'Oh wow, so that was real. Oh, OK. Wow! Cool!'"

Vanessa Hudgens

Vanessa Hudgens isn't necessarily trying to break free from any spirits.In fact, the High School Musical alum appears to embrace her ability to connect. "I've accepted the fact that I see things," she said on a 2022 episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show, "and I hear things."One incident that bops to the top of Vanessa's mind happened with a pull-along duck toy when she was 8 years old."There was one of those on the dining room table," The Princess Switch actress continued, "and I started walking and it just started going alongside me."Now, Vanessa is trying to learn more."I kind of shut it down for a while because it's scary," she told Kelly Clarkson. "The unknown is scary. But I recently was like, 'No this is a gift and something that I have the ability to do. So, I'm gonna lean into it.' And I recently did my first real paranormal investigation with equipment and everything."

Hugh Grant

Here's a story about a boy.Back in 2016, Hugh Grant said one of his sons would often "stare into a corner" of his room."Other people started seeing things," the actor, who is a father of five, continued on The Late Late Show. "Other kids would come and say, 'Who's that little boy over there?' Yeah, relations and nannies, completely out of control."So Hugh decided to take action. "I'm a rational person, well-educated, not an idiot," the Love Actually alum continued. "I find myself ringing a ghostbuster."He said the ghostbuster than came to the house with some sticks."Her sticks went completely wild in his room," Hugh added. "She said, 'Oh, it's so strong in here. I think I might throw-up.' I think it was all bollocks. Then she burnt about seven pounds of sage and banged a little drum, played an instrument or something and sang. And she said, 'All the spirits are gone.'"But were they? Hugh said he asked his son in the morning if he felt happier last night. "He said, 'No, there was a little boy at my window,'" the Notting Hill star added. "So I think we need to move house now. Yeah, too haunted."

 

Brian Cox

The succession of events Brian Cox experienced years ago in Edinburgh will give you the chills."I was just trying to go to sleep and suddenly there was this rocking sound," the actor recalled on a 2023 episode of The Jonathan Ross Show, "and the chair started to rock. And it started to rock across the room in front of my bed."While the chair eventually stopped moving, Brian was still pretty freaked out by what he saw."By this time, I got myself right under the covers," he continued. "Because I thought, 'S--t, this is f--king awful.'"The Succession star managed to get some sleep, but was startled again the next morning.   "The chair was still here," he added, "and the floor was covered in these scratch marks."
