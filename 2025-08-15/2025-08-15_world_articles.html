Adams ruled that the prosecution's delays violated Marsicano's due process rights and their right to a speedy trial. In March 2023, law enforcement officers arrested close to two dozen protesters, including Marsicano, at a Stop Cop City music festival. Marsicano spent more than two weeks in jail and was then released on a $25,000 bond. All of the protesters were charged with domestic terrorism, but, more than two years later, none have been indicted. “Since Defendant's bond hearing, there has been no further progression or prosecution of this individual case other than bond modifications made at Defendant's request,” the judge wrote in his ruling. “Furthermore, as explained above, the State's delay appears to be deliberate, weighing heavily against it.” The judge found that, the “personal and professional consequences that Defendant has faced as result of this indefinite charge, without legal forum in which it may be timely challenged, are forms of actual prejudice to Defendant.” Despite overwhelming opposition, construction on the facility was completed and many protesters still face criminal charges. “My team's aggressive, participatory, and political defense got us this huge win,” Marsicano said in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are heading to Alaska for pivotal talks that could unlock a long-sought peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. A peace deal, or a simple thawing of relations between Moscow and Washington, could also pave the way for what, until recently, seemed fanciful to most American companies – doing business with Russia. “I noticed (Putin's) bringing a lot of business people from Russia, and that's good,” Trump said aboard Air Force One on Friday. “I like that, because they want to do business, but they're not doing business until we get the war solved.” Anton Siluanov, Russia's finance minister, and Kirill Dmitriev, a senior economic negotiator and head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, are among those attending the talks with Putin. “If we make progress, I would discuss (business opportunities), because that's one of the things that they would like; they'd like to get a piece of what I built in terms of the economy,” the US president told reporters. But restarting business with a country that the West has largely turned into a diplomatic and economic pariah via sanctions will be no easy feat. Since then, more than 1,000 global companies have either voluntarily exited or curtailed operations in Russia, according to a list compiled by the Yale School of Management. Household US names like Apple (AAPL), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Mastercard (MA) were among those who left, yet there have been some holdouts continuing to do some business in the country. Meanwhile, Chinese firms including automakers and tech companies have filled the gap left by their Western counterparts. Russians have also turned to copy-cat versions of American brands. For example, Stars Coffee emerged after Starbucks (SBUX) exited in 2022, adopting an audaciously familiar logo of a woman with a star above her head. So, if Western companies did return en masse, would Russian consumers welcome them? Western sanctions have focused on hitting Moscow where it hurts: limiting the revenues it can collect from its massive exports of oil and natural gas. Last year, those revenues accounted for 30% of Russia's federal government budget, according to an analysis by The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. The European Union, once a top Kremlin customer, has banned all seaborne imports of Russian crude oil, and whittled Moscow's share of its natural gas imports delivered via pipeline to about 11% last year, from more than 40% in 2021. The bloc still imports Russian liquefied natural gas via sea tankers. But Russia has adapted, re-routing its barrels of oil to alternate customers, like India and China. According to Vortexa, an energy data firm, Russia now accounts for 36% of India's crude oil imports and is the country's top supplier. But New Delhi has been defiant, saying that Russian oil is necessary for the energy security of its 1.4 billion-strong population. One key sanction – a price cap on Russian oil imposed by the Group of Seven nations in 2022 – may be difficult for America to fully unwind without international support. Companies located in the G7 are prevented from providing shipping, insurance and other services needed to export Russian seaborne oil unless it is priced below the threshold. Simply doing business in Russia has become harder since the war. Crucially, it has become more difficult for Russian banks to send and receive money from abroad. Corruption has also worsened from already high levels. But, by 2024, Russia had slid further down the Corruption Perceptions Index to 154th place, tied with Azerbaijan, Honduras and Lebanon.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump said he is “not going to be happy” unless a ceasefire in the war in Ukraine is agreed today. Speaking from Air Force One en route to Alaska for a summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, the US president said: “I want certain things. ”I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today. Mr Trump has also warned that he would “walk” if his meeting with Putin doesn't go well. “I think it's going to work out very well and if it doesn't, I'm going to head back home real fast,” he told Fox News on board Air Force One. Mr Trump left Washington for Anchorage on Friday. Putin has stopped over in the city of Magadan in Russia's far east, where he is expected to meet the local governor and visit an industrial facility. In the video, the US President called for a ceasefire but said that “nothing is set in stone” ahead of talks with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday. “I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today. You know, we're not putting up any money. … But what I do care about is they lost last week 7,011 people, almost all soldiers; 36 people in a town which got hit by a missile. Donald Trump has said he does not know what would make his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin a success. Asked what would make the meeting a success, he told reporters aboard Air Force One: “I can't tell you that. I'm not going to be happy if it's not today,” he said, adding that Europe and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy would also be involved. General Alexus Grynkewich, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, is in Alaska to provide “military advice” to Donald Trump and Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, a source has told AP. Grynkewich, as the commander of both NATO and U.S. forces in Europe, is in Alaska to provide military advice to President Trump and Secretary Hegseth as President Trump tries to bring this war to a peaceful close,” a senior NATO military official told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. He has previously spoken of the need to get military aid into Kyiv quickly, including after President Trump said in July that NATO would be coordinating deliveries of U.S weapons. Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin appear to be on friendly terms, but their representative lobby hacks are not so amenable. The long security delay is causing frustration amongst some American journalists concerned their Russian counterparts will get a better seat at the summit. One disgruntled journalist asks: “Can we make sure Americans are seated before the Russians?” American and Russia media have been kept apart on separate buses. Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia was still killing people on Friday and not showing that it wanted to end the war. It continues precisely because there is no order, nor any indication that Moscow is preparing to end this war,” he added. Russian sabotage and reconnaissance units punched through exposed defences in eastern Ukraine, slipping as far as six miles behind the front line in just 48 hours, according to battlefield reports. Kyiv has since diverted special forces units to confront the insurgents on the ground in an attempt to prevent any more of Ukraine falling under Russia's control before the summit in Alaska. Ukrainian forces have also evacuated Druzhkivka, a town near the front line in Donetsk, as intense fighting continues. Hillary Clinton has posted on X: “If Donald Trump negotiates an end to Putin's war on Ukraine without Ukraine having to cede territory, I'll nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize myself.” Mrs Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state and Mr Trump's 2016 Democratic opponent, added: “Trump should know by now that he's not meeting with a friend of the United States today. It has long been thought that Mr Trump is desperate for a Nobel Peace Prize and has a particular grudge against Barack Obama for being decorated only eight months into his first term. It was an early start for the world's media hoping to get a view of today's summit. Tired-eyed hacks, including your two Telegraph reporters Connor Stringer and Dominic Nicholls, began the journey to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, where Donald Trump will meet Vladimir Putin at 11am. It's 11 degrees on the ground and cloudy overhead. After being herded onto awaiting school buses, we were shuttled to a holding area on the camp, where we now wait to be screened by the secret service. Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev said ahead of the meeting on Ukraine between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump that the mood is “combative”, Russia's RIA news agency reported. The leaders will discuss the full spectrum of US-Russia relations, not only Ukraine, and their talks will be aimed at restoring ties, said Dmitriev, who is responsible for investments and economic cooperation “You can expect that it will take up a minimum of six to seven hours,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia's Channel One state TV ahead of the summit, adding that Moscow anticipated a “productive” meeting. Former US Vice President Mike Pence says he is “praying” for Donald Trump to “stand strong” during his meeting with Vladimir Putin. Mr Pence served as Vice President from 2017 to 2021 during President Trump's first term but the pair fell out after the January 6 Capitol riots.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. According to a +972 Magazine and Local Call investigation published Thursday, the Legitimization Cell is a public relations unit that is tasked with finding a narrative to create cover for some of the most highly criticized actions by Israel's military. “If the global media is talking about Israel killing innocent journalists, then immediately there's a push to find one journalist who might not be so innocent — as if that somehow makes killing the other 20 acceptable,” an Israeli intelligence source told journalist Yuval Abraham. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. “The idea was to [allow the military to] operate without pressure, so countries like America wouldn't stop supplying weapons,” another Israeli source said. Observers have seen this pattern play out numerous times, including in the recent assassination of famous Gaza journalist Anas Al-Sharif, who Israel killed along with five other Al Jazeera journalists earlier this week. Israel has long smeared Al-Sharif as a member of Hamas — claims that he always denied and for which Israel has not provided any evidence that can  be independently verified. Last year, after killing Al Jazeera journalist Ismail al-Ghoul, Israeli officials claimed that he was given a Hamas military ranking in 2007 — when al-Ghoul was only 10 years old. +972 and Local Call report that the Legitimization Cell is responsible for narratives like its denial of responsibility for the strike on Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City in October 2023 — a high-profile strike that killed hundreds of Palestinians. The bombing gained widespread media attention as one of Israel's first strikes on Gaza's health care system that it has now destroyed, with Al-Ahli put out of service by Israeli attacks. But this claim was roundly debunked by analysts and multiple news outlets. And the phone call, too, was fake — a Palestinian human rights activist told +972 and Local Call that it was actually a benign phone call between him and his civilian friend that had been intercepted by the military. “There was this phrase, ‘That's good for legitimacy,'” one source told +972 and Local Call. Israel has long had a robust propaganda operation — so robust, in fact, that Israel has exported some of its intelligence and surveillance technologies. Members of one of its well-known intelligence units, Unit 8200, are trained in Israel but go on to work across numerous sectors, including as journalists in the U.S. at outlets key to shaping American opinion.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But what ensued after I bought it online for about $100 revealed how, for such relics and those who covet them, the present is in some ways much more complicated. I always wanted to own a fossil, and once the algorithm picked up on that desire, ads flooded my Instagram feed. It then became impossible to resist the thrill of purchasing a piece of one of the largest predators that ever existed: Spinosaurus, a semiaquatic meat-eater that could reach almost 60 feet (about 18 meters) in length — longer and heavier than Tyrannosaurus rex. When the package arrived, in a pretty glass dome and with a preprinted certificate of authenticity that stated it came from North Africa, the long pointy tooth looked the part to my untrained eyes: yellowish brown, with varying textures and a stonelike appearance. But some obvious cracks that suggested the specimen had perhaps been patched together from multiple fragments left me wondering: Was it real? Stone tool discovery could offer new clue in mystery of ancient ‘hobbit' humans To find out, I took it to London's Natural History Museum, where Susannah Maidment, a senior researcher and fossil expert, examined it. “This is almost certainly from Morocco, because almost all Spinosaurus fossils that we know of are from the Kem Kem formation of Morocco, and they're intensively excavated there,” Maidment added, referring to a fossil bed in southeastern Morocco that has yielded an abundance of predatory dinosaur specimens. “The thing about teeth is that dinosaurs and other reptiles shed them continuously, so one dinosaur will have many, many teeth over its lifetime. As a result, according to Maidment, I probably paid too much for it. However, her next observation quickly replaced that concern with another: “This … has almost certainly been illegally exported and illegally excavated,” she said. Last year, a Stegosaurus skeleton nicknamed “Apex,” measuring nearly 27 feet long (about 8 meters), sold for $44.6 million at a Sotheby's auction in New York City, becoming the most valuable fossil ever sold at auction. Hedge fund manager Ken Griffin reportedly scooped up the specimen, which was discovered in 2022 on private land in Colorado, and it is currently on loan at New York's American Museum of Natural History. The sale was just one in a series of recent high-profile auctions that sent near-complete dinosaur skeletons into private ownership. Even though Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History purchased Sue and still has it on display, the pooling together of private funds led to its acquisition and kick-started the era of big-ticket fossil auctions. Seventy-one T. rex specimens are now in private hands, versus 61 held by public trusts, according to a recent study. Dinosaur fossil found underneath a Denver museum's parking lot Peter Lovisek, a fossil broker and curator at Fossil Realm, a gallery in Ottawa, said a key turning point for the market — “where these pieces began to be seen as cultural icons, artworks, investment assets” — was the auction of a 40-foot-long T. rex named “Stan,” which sold for $31.8 million in 2020. “Since then, Instagram has become a hub for the fossil industry,” he said. CNN reached out to Instagram for comment but has not received a response. And things are just getting started, according to Salomon Aaron, director of David Aaron, a London gallery dealing in ancient art and fossils. “I think the dinosaur trade is actually still incredibly undervalued,” Aaron said. Specimens have now been found on every continent, and more than 50 countries have contributed named species to science, with the United States, China, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Mongolia, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom topping the rankings. Puzzling fossils unearthed in China may rewrite the human story One enduring misconception, perhaps fueled by the multimillion-dollar auctions, is that fossils are rare. “Across the world, people assume that everything's going to be unmanageably expensive, but that's not the case,” said Matt Dale, who owns Mr Wood's Fossils, a fossil shop in Edinburgh, Scotland, which also sells online. And three, why is it so cheap?” Dale said. “The bulk of the stuff in my shop comes from unusually rich sites, where there's an awful lot of material, which makes it much more practical and feasible to collect it and sell it on a commercial basis. After telling me that she thought my fossil was illegal, Maidment explained that “the Moroccan fossil law states that you must have a permit for excavation and that you must have a permit for export, and you can only get a permit for export if you have an excavation license. Other online retailers offering similar merchandise that I contacted also didn't respond to my interview requests. However, the shop could have legally purchased the fossils from a third party, or at one of many fossil trade shows such as Arizona's Tucson Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase. CNN reached out to the Tucson Gem, Mineral & Fossil Showcase for comment but has not received a response. In the UK and the US, if you find something on your land, you can do whatever you want with it,” while in some parts of South America, for example, the person who discovers an artifact has a weaker claim, Maidment said. But Morocco seems to fall into a sort of legal gray area when it comes to fossil exports, said Maidment and David Martill, emeritus professor from the UK's University of Portsmouth. Despite laws in place intended to regulate export of these artifacts, almost all fossils excavated in Morocco end up on the commercial market, according to Martill. “I am very familiar with the fossil black market in Morocco, because I work there, and we have huge problems at our (excavation) sites, where commercial fossil dealers who are black market smugglers come and excavate illegally from our sites, probably from the specimens that we're digging up,” Maidment said, speaking of those who operated without a proper permit. “Sometimes we find the fossils, and then they take them, and then they sell them on European websites for up to 30,000 euros. Morocco's Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development, which regulates “the fields of geology, minerals, hydrocarbons and energies,” has not responded to CNN's requests for comment. The full extent of the questionable movement of fossils across borders is hard to pin down, but it has included important specimens such as Ubirajara jubatus, a feathered dinosaur species first described in a now-retracted 2020 paper from a one-of-a-kind skeleton that had allegedly been illegally exported to Germany from Brazil. Germany's State Museum of Natural History Karlsruhe returned the rare remains to Brazil in 2023 among a wave of similar high-profile repatriations, including a 56 million-year-old crocodile fossil that Morocco recovered from the United States. A few years earlier, in 2015, actor Nicolas Cage returned a T. rex skull he bought for $276,000 at auction in 2007 to the Mongolian government. It's more difficult for smaller, less expensive fossils that have been illegally exported to make it back to their country of origin, although in 2022 French customs returned nearly 1,000 fossils from the Araripe Basin in Brazil that had been stolen  to be sold online. Neither Martill nor John Nudds, an honorary lecturer in the department of Earth and environmental sciences at the UK's University of Manchester, would go as far as calling my fossil illegal. Nudds said he knows of at least one reputable wholesaler based outside Morocco that sells “an awful lot” of Spinosaurus teeth exactly like mine. Part of the reason why fossils may occupy a legal gray area, Nudds added, is some ambiguous wording in UNESCO's 1970 Convention, which was designed to prevent the illegal export of items of cultural importance across many categories. According to Nudds, the wording makes it unclear whether the objects of paleontological interest are in their own category, which would include all fossils, or if they are part of the “rare collections,” which would not. Elmahdi Lassale, CEO of M2 Rocks & Minerals, a Moroccan wholesaler and exporter of minerals and fossils that sells directly to retailers in the US, UK and Europe, confirmed that under Moroccan law, since 2020, fossils are classified as geological heritage. Excavating and exporting them isn't strictly off-limits, according to Lassale, but to do so commercially, a license must be obtained from the Ministry of Energy Transition and Sustainable Development as well as a validated customs certificate. In practice, it means that before each export, Lassale sends the ministry a list of the individual items he wants to sell. “If we talk about dinosaur bones or teeth, it's (almost) impossible to export from Morocco (even) with a license,” Lassale said. However, he said he is aware that other fossils do get out of the country via “illegal suppliers” as well as “through informal shipments via tourist luggage and small couriers, creating a mixed online market of documented and undocumented specimens abroad.” He estimated the total trade of fossils in Morocco to be worth $30 million to $40 million annually, including official and unofficial exports, and that about 80% of fossils are exported. In a large trade show such as the one in Tucson, he said, there will be on average around 200 Moroccan fossil dealers. Martill and Nudds viewed my fossil during separate video calls. However, the human cost of obtaining even an imperfect specimen can be serious, he said. “Let me tell you now that the man who dug that out of the ground risked not only his life but his lungs as well,” Martill said, adding that he has gone into fossil mines in Morocco and spent time with miners. You're well underground, and the place is incredibly dusty. They have little head torches, and they dig with tiny crowbars fashioned out of the steel that you use to reinforce concrete. Taking all that into account, he said, what I paid for my tooth fossil “is probably pretty cheap.” Lassale agreed the fossil diggers in Morocco often work in challenging conditions, including temperatures as high as 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), and with minimal protective equipment, while earning about 120 to 180 Moroccan dirhams (about $13 to $20) daily. He added that his company only partners with artisans and cooperatives that provide safety measures such as shade tents, water and protective goggles to workers, though he said such practices are not common industrywide. “It's very easy to make a lot of money with this, but it's not easy to dig out minerals or fossils — small artisans, they put their health at risk” to support their families, Lassale said. “Unfortunately, we hear about that every year — not just fossil but also mineral mines,” he said. But things could be different for fossils from  countries that have strong restrictions on fossil exports. That's why experts recommend prospective buyers avoid anything advertised from countries such as Brazil, Argentina, China or Mongolia. “I guess the best advice would be to only buy something if you can see it and hold it in your hand,” Nudds said. “If you're going to buy online, then maybe avoid those countries which do ban exports, because that's where you're more likely to find forgeries.” Other than such deceptions or distortions, when it comes to how to purchase a fossil properly, experts offered guidance that would apply to buying pretty much anything online: Do your research, look for a reputable seller, and ask for paperwork or proof that the item is sold legally and ethically. Perhaps the more important question is should you buy a fossil at all? I still look at the Spinosaurus tooth on my bookshelf and marvel that it's the oldest thing in my house by at least 94 million years. But given the complexities around fossils' cultural status and scientific relevance, the dangerous working conditions in some excavation areas, and the fact that many countries are now recovering fossils exported illegally, it's no surprise that the answer to that question has stirred disagreement, even within my small cohort of paleontologists. “Do not buy your fossils online,” said Maidment of London's Natural History Museum. “Unless you can absolutely verify that they are being sold legally, and that they're in your country legally, it's best to just not to do it at all. It shouldn't be something that one person owns.” And scientists like me, there's only so much that you can do with one isolated dinosaur tooth. “I think it's great that you can have a fossil. You got something there which is 90 to 100 million years old,” Martill added. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The leaders walked down their respective red carpets and Mr Trump clapped as the Russian president approached, before greeting him with a handshake. Mr Trump has warned that he would “walk” if the meeting doesn't go well and that he will not be happy if a ceasefire is not agreed today. The first picture showing Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin sitting down together has emerged. Margo Martin, Special Assistant to the US President and Communications Advisor, posted a photo on X showing the two leaders sitting on wooden chairs surrounded by their advisors. Vladimir Putin wasn't just given the red carpet treatment as he stepped out of his plane in Alaska - capped off by applause and a warm handshake from Donald Trump. The Russian leader could be seen pointing at his ear. A media briefing between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin descended into chaos as the two leaders were seen for the first time since their joint car ride. The two leaders, flanked by the American and Russian delegations, stayed largely silent as they found themselves facing a media scrum full of shouting reporters ahead of talks which will take place behind closed doors.. One reporter could be heard shouting: “Mr Putin, will you commit to a ceasefire?” and “Mr Putin, will you commit to not killing any more civilians?” Seated alongside Mr Trump was Steve Witkoff, the US' Middle East envoy who has previously negotiated with Putin, and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state. Both men will join talks with Putin and the Russian delegation. In scenes of absolute chaos, a voice could be heard repeatedly saying “thank you press, thank you press” before another man shouted: “Everybody get out of the room.” US media was quick to criticise Donald Trump after the US president applauded and shook hands with Vladimir Putin as they met in Alaska. Donald Trump has just departed Air Force One, walking down the boarding stairs onto the tarmac of Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska. The pair walked down their respective red carpets and Mr Trump clapped as the Russian President approached before greeting him with a handshake. They then walked side-by-side in conversation before both entered into Trump's presidential armoured car, known as ‘The Beast', where they sat together in the back seat. He will be joined by foreign minister Sergey Lavrov and aide Yuri Ushakov at a three-on-three meeting with Donald Trump and his team, according to Reuters. Mr Trump will be joined by Steve Witkoff, his special envoy who has met with Putin five times in recent months, as well as Marco Rubio, the secretary of state. “Putin will lure you in in a moment,” Fiona Hill, who served on Mr Trump's security council during his first term, told The Telegraph.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Created by the cartographer Gerardus Mercator for navigation, the projection distorts continent sizes, enlarging areas near the poles like North America and Greenland while shrinking Africa and South America. “It might seem to be just a map, but in reality, it is not,” the African Union Commission deputy chair, Selma Malika Haddadi, told Reuters, saying the Mercator fostered a false impression that Africa was “marginal”, despite being the world's second-largest continent by area, with more than 1 billion people. Such stereotypes influence media, education and policy, she said. Fara Ndiaye, a co-founder of Speak Up Africa, said the Mercator affected Africans' identity and pride, especially children who might encounter it early in school. “We're actively working on promoting a curriculum where the Equal Earth projection will be the main standard across all [African] classrooms,” Ndiaye said, adding she hoped it would also be the one used by global institutions, including Africa-based ones. Haddadi said the AU endorsed the campaign, adding it aligned with its goal of “reclaiming Africa's rightful place on the global stage” amid growing calls for reparations for colonialism and slavery. The AU will advocate for wider map adoption and discuss collective actions with member states, Haddadi added. The Mercator projection is still widely used, including by schools and tech companies. Google Maps switched from Mercator on desktop to a 3D globe view in 2018, though users can still switch back to the Mercator if they prefer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Findings help decipher mechanisms through which ‘forever chemicals' cause disease, aiding in treating health problems “This gives us a hint as to which genes and which Pfas might be important,” said Melissa Furlong, a University of Arizona College of Public Health Pfas researcher and study lead author. Pfas are a class of about 15,000 compounds most frequently used to make products water-, stain- and grease-resistant. They have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease and a range of other serious health problems. The chemicals are the main ingredient in most firefighting foam, and are frequently used in “turnout gear” worn by firefighters because of their heat repelling properties Furlong said she was surprised to find the number of genes and biological pathways that were impacted by Pfas, which suggests the chemicals may cause or contribute to a broad range of health problems. Genes play a range of roles in developing or preventing disease, and Pfas essentially change the way the genes are supposed to act, Furlong said. A gene may act as tumor suppressor, but the Pfas interferes with how it expresses, which affects whether cancer develops, or the type of cancer. For example, PFOS, among the most common and dangerous Pfas compounds, reduces levels of miR-128-1-5p, a gene tied to cancer development. Branched forms of PFOS were linked to changes in five other genes, including some that regulate cancer development. A seven-week expert course to help you avoid chemicals in your food and groceries. Furlong said it remains unclear at which step in the biological processes disease is triggered, but the picture is clear enough to point to possible treatments. Pharmaceutical companies are trying to develop drugs that could alter gene activity and potentially prevent Pfas-linked disease from developing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Over the past decade, walking has become a popular tool for fitness. And with some augmentations, it can make you break a serious sweat. Walking also has all sorts of positive impacts on your health. The Heart Foundation in Australia noted that walking a half-hour or more each day can lower the risk of stroke, heart disease and type two diabetes. Try these three daily exercises to keep your hips happy and healthy The activity's accessibility makes it an easy choice for a healthier lifestyle, especially when starting out. “You can walk pretty much anywhere, but also the idea that if you're getting out of bed in the morning, you're already doing it,” says nutrition coach and personal trainer Jeremy Fernandes. Fernandes studied kinesiology at Western University and devoted his career to working with clients across various levels of fitness. Three popular variations include the incline treadmill, using weighted vests or backpacks and walking at interval speeds, known as “Japanese walking.” Most treadmills have a feature that positions the machine on an incline, mimicking walking uphill outside. “The logic is that increasing the incline on your treadmill will result in a greater metabolic cost, meaning your body has to work harder,” said Fernandes. The trainer estimates that people would see an approximate 50-per-cent increase in calories burned when walking on a 10-per-cent incline, compared with walking on a zero-per-cent incline. It can also be easier on the joints than running or jogging. “It will reduce overall impact forces, which is maybe more of a concern for folks with pre-existing joint issues or those training hard to build muscle and strength,” said Fernandes. Dozens of videos about the 12-3-30 workout – treadmill walking with an incline at 12 per cent and speed at three miles an hour for 30 minutes – can be found across the platforms, anecdotally praising the workouts for fat loss. Fernandes notes that incline treadmill walks are safe to try for anyone who isn't dealing with a chronic lower-leg injury. Weighted vests have also been marketed for women to help combat osteoporosis and increase bone density while aging. Weighted vests and backpacks are good for adding some extra intensity to cardio exercises. But along with the benefits there's a lot of hype. While there have been small studies showing positive relationships between walking and bone destiny in postmenopausal women, there hasn't been enough research to definitively say that it works. “Folks with neck and back issues should be extra cautious with adding in rucking or weighted vests to their routine, as the added stress on these areas may cause issues,” said Fernandes. For anyone keen to step up their daily stroll, consider “Japanese walking.” The exercise consists of three minutes of normal walking followed by three minutes of walking at a faster pace, repeated for five rounds. Also referred to as 3-3 walking or interval walking, the technique was created by professors at Shinshu University in Matsumoto, Japan. A 2007 study by Shinshu University showed that middle-aged and older adults participating in interval walking had lower blood pressure and better aerobic capacity than those who walked 8,000 steps a day at a moderate pace. Quick, intense exercise may put the brakes on aging, research shows The fitness expert notes that interval training in many different forms has always been popular for exercise. “It may have benefits in terms of aerobic health. Switching up your pace and walking for brisk intervals can be a great entry point into exercising. It's also something we can incorporate into daily activities we're already doing such as grocery shopping or strolling into work. Still, if you're thinking about augmentations that make walking more challenging, first make sure you're actually willing to walk without them. I still aim for at least 8,000 a day - but sometimes, life just gets in the way. But even if it's only an extra ~3000 steps, this simple 30 minute protocol on my walking pad can make a huge difference.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A PayPal sign at the company's headquarters in San Jose, California, U.S., on Jan. 30, 2024. It's a fact little known around the world: Some of the biggest names in tech were founded by Ukrainian-born entrepreneurs, including PayPal, WhatsApp, and Grammarly. These companies, now headquartered across the U.S. and Europe, owe part of their success to Ukrainian-born entrepreneurs whose innovations have shaped how millions communicate, pay, and work online. Here are 10 of the world's most recognizable tech companies founded or co-founded by Ukrainians. He became PayPal's anti-fraud architect and co-created one of the first commercial Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA). Levchin's current net worth, according to Forbes, is estimated at $2.1 billion. With almost 3 billion users sending over 150 million messages daily, WhatsApp is one of the world's most popular ways to stay in touch. A decade later, more than 40 million users rely on Grammarly daily to help them proofread and spell check their texts. After Shevchenko and Lytvyn's net worths hit $4 billion in 2021, they became the first tech founders to top Ukraine's wealth rankings ahead of traditional oligarchs. Founded in Kyiv, Ukraine, where it maintains its headquarters today Reface, founded in 2018 by a group of Ukrainian developers, is an artificial intelligence product company best known for its face-swapping application for videos and photos. In 2020, Reface raised $5.5 million for product development from Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and investors including "South Park" creators and music managers of stars Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, Britney Spears, and Miley Cyrus. The first Ukrainian unicorn, founded by Dmytro Zaporozhets from Kharkiv, Ukraine When developer Dmytro Zaporozhets from eastern Ukraine's Kharkiv got frustrated with existing code management tools, he decided to build his own in 2011. Since then, Zaporozhets' initial side project, GitLab, has grown into a comprehensive coding platform used by over 50 million registered users worldwide. In October 2021, the company went public on NASDAQ, valued at $11 billion, with shares jumping 35% on the first day of trading to reach a market cap of $14.9 billion. After the company listing, Zaporozhets became Ukraine's then-richest software engineer with a fortune of nearly $460 million. The app's success has earned Yatsenko a $1.2 billion fortune. The application now serves over 60 million customers worldwide and is currently valued at $45 billion. As of 2023, every fifth Mac on Earth had at least one MacPaw application — a testament to how big this bootstrapped software company has become. Founded by Oleksandr Kosovan while studying at the Kyiv Polytechnic Institute in 2008, he created CleanMyMac, an optimization tool for Mac users to clean and speed up their computers. This success evolved into other products like Setapp, a subscription service for Mac apps, and AI assistant Eney. The company now serves 30 million users worldwide, with MacPaw's software downloaded in over 180 countries, all without external investment. Founded in 2009 by Dmitry Sergeev in Kyiv, it grew into a global content empire, competing with industry giants like Getty Images and Adobe. Depositphotos today employs nearly 450 people in six countries, including Ukraine. Petcube was the first company in the pet-tech sector to create smart cameras that let owners watch and play with their pets remotely. Since then, Petcube has sold more than 1 million products worldwide. The U.S. market, which consists of 85 million pet owners, was the first target and still makes up 80% of sales, typically through online retailers like Amazon. Preply, an online marketplace connecting language learners with tutors, was founded in 2012 by Ukrainian entrepreneurs Kirill Bigai, Serge Lukyanov, and Dmytro Voloshyn. Today, over 100,000 tutors teach hundreds of thousands of students worldwide in more than 90 languages, the company told the Kyiv Independent in a statement. While the company's value isn't publicly known, various estimates from 2022 and 2023 put it somewhere around $430 million.

MOSCOW, August 15. /TASS/. Russia is holding talks with Iran on the construction of small modular nuclear power plants (NPP) on its territory, hoping to enter into relevant agreements in the future, Rosatom Chief Executive Officer Alexey Likhachev said in an interview with the Rossiya-1 TV channel.

In early 2025 Iran suggested that the agenda of cooperation in nuclear energy with Russia be expanded by adding the construction of small modular nuclear power plants in the Islamic Republic to the discussion, he noted.

"Such negotiations are underway. I hope that sooner or later such agreements will be concluded," the chief executive said.

Russia has always been an active participant in the process of resolving the so-called Iranian nuclear issue, he stressed, adding that as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was formed and launched Moscow played a key role in providing technical and diplomatic support to Tehran.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Others live for today and figure tomorrow will sort itself out. I saw myself, greying and tired, in a white room. That vision came on the heels of a long buildup. Others live for today and figure tomorrow will sort itself out. “You're not alone in this,” it said, which is true. Almost half of Canadians lose sleep over money issues, according to a Financial Stress Index. “Your concern shows you're thinking ahead, which is a great first step.” Next, it asked for details about my age, savings, income, expenses, retirement goals, eligibility for the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security, and whether I plan to buy a home. I spend about $3,000 a month, have no debt or pension and rent in Toronto with my husband, who works full-time in technology. My freelancing income swings between $1,000 and $5,000 a month. Reddit threads and a big bank's advice team agreed that you should have around one year of your annual salary saved by 30, which I almost do. But that's based on an entry-level salary, not enough to survive in one of Canada's most expensive cities. Still, it continued to reassure me that I was on the right track, highlighting my lack of debt, low expenses and solid savings. But it also flagged risks like needing to save more for rent later since I don't own property. It even told me to get the ball rolling on conversations about kids and home ownership with my husband. Four wealth traps that can derail your retirement It didn't go into detail about whether my income was enough to survive the expenses of a home or child, how much more I needed or if my income would live up to the cost of living over the next few decades. Within seconds, it returned with numbers and showed just how. If I don't touch my TFSA until retirement, it said I'd have almost a quarter of a million dollars. Would we be paying for our theoretical kid still? I had a lot of questions, but not enough will to poke holes in my perfect story. I was ready to escape the spreadsheet vibes, so I ended by asking it to show me what a day in my retirement could look like. I asked ChatGPT to generate a picture of me in retirement, and this is what it created. Ms. Khozema asked ChatGPT to generate a picture of her in retirement, and it produced this image.ChatGPT Between them, I occasionally co-hosted a podcast, edited a few articles and blogged about my travels from an Egyptian courtyard while my husband brought me coffee. It said that I could live a comfortable life travelling and hosting friends for dinner parties in Egypt. The white box in my head started collecting colour. ChatGPT read like it knew me, which makes sense, because I often talk to it about recipes, work and travel. I often feel numb and cynical when thinking about retirement. It helped me romanticize a future I was afraid to imagine. It was like holding up a mirror and being told, gently, that maybe I'm not failing. But if you're in a job limbo, renting or just financially anxious, it can offer hope in moments of chaos. At the very least, it's better than picturing yourself in a blank white box. Ms. Khozema found that consulting ChatGPT about her retirement goals helped relieve some financial anxiety.Ali Elmoudi/The Globe and Mail The 20 most livable cities in Canada for retirement Here's how home owners can age in their own place, even if they are struggling to afford it Knowing how to plan to spend your time in retirement is as pressing as how you will save for it How much does it help to postpone retirement a couple of years?

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed “remorse” over World War II in his address at the annual government-organized national memorial service for the war dead in Tokyo on Friday. “We must once again deeply inscribe the remorse and lessons from that war into our hearts,” Ishiba stated. A source close to Ishiba emphasized that the prime minister had intended to include the word “remorse” in his address. It has been 13 years since a prime minister last used the word “remorse” in their memorial address. The mention of remorse became a fixture after former Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama issued a statement on the 50th anniversary of the war's end, in which he acknowledged past colonial rule and aggression. In his 1994 address, Murayama expressed “deep remorse” and stated that Japan had “caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries, particularly to those of Asian nations.” Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

About 4,500 people, including family members of the war dead and representatives from various fields, attended the government-organized memorial service. The Emperor and Empress and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba were in attendance at the ceremony, which began at 11:51 a.m. A minute of silence was observed as the clock struck noon. Representing the families of the war dead, Hajime Eda, 82, of Kawagoe, Saitama Prefecture, whose father died in the Korea Strait, delivered a message of remembrance. Of the 3,432 family members of the war dead scheduled to attend Friday's ceremony as of Aug. 8, 3,380 were related to deceased Imperial military personnel or employees, according to the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry. Family members of those killed in the atomic bombings and other war victims totaled 52. Of those, a record 1,826 were born in the postwar period. No parents of war dead have been in attendance for 15 years. This year's ceremony was the first with no spouses of war dead, except for 2021, when attendance was severely restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Passing on the experiences of the war to future generations remains an issue to be addressed. This year, 14 children between the ages of 8 and 17, including a great-grandchild of a person who died in the war, handed out yellow chrysanthemums. From the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937 to the end of World War II in 1945, about 2.3 million Japanese military personnel and employees, including those detained in Siberia after the war, lost their lives. About 800,000 civilians were killed in air raids and the two atomic bombings. Our weekly ePaper presents the most noteworthy recent topics in an exciting, readable fomat.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic has accused participants in the August 13-14 protest in Novi Sad of attempting to burn people alive inside the office of the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), Informer TV reported. "That night, they tried to burn people alive. Can you imagine what they would do to those inside? "Now everyone understands who we are dealing with and that they never wanted peace. All this time, it was only about violence." According to Interior Minister Ivica Dacic, 42 police officers — including 26 in Belgrade — were injured during mass riots at rallies across the country, and 37 people were detained. The gravest incidents took place in Novi Sad, where SNS premises at several locations were vandalized. Dacic described the unrest as one of the most violent attacks on police in recent years, with protesters using stones, metal bars, sticks, and fireworks. The Interior Ministry reported that five government vehicles and 22 pieces of equipment were damaged. Around 100 people also attacked members of the Cobras special detachment in Novi Sad.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Editor's note: This story has been updated with details on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's arrival. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet in Alaska later in the day as Washington intensifies efforts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. The Russian leader is expected to meet with the local governor and visit an industrial facility before departing for Alaska, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. An airplane with Russian journalists has also arrived in Anchorage, state media claimed. I think he's going to," Trump told Fox Radio. Meanwhile, the White House has said Trump prefers diplomacy but is ready to increase economic pressure on Russia if necessary. "Certainly, there are sanctions and many other measures that the president could utilize if he has to. Not that he wants to… diplomacy and negotiation have always been the way for this president," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Aug. 14. Trump has previously said that if the Aug. 15 meeting goes well, he will seek a trilateral meeting between himself, Putin, and President Volodymyr Zelensky. Russia has issued maximalist demands to Kyiv in previous direct peace talks, including that Ukraine give up its NATO aspirations and demilitarize. Months earlier, U.S. attempts to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia failed. Kyiv and Moscow later held three rounds of direct peace talks in Istanbul, which were largely inconclusive. Volodymyr Ivanyshyn is a news editor for The Kyiv Independent. He is pursuing an Honors Bachelor of Arts at the University of Toronto, majoring in political science with a minor in anthropology and human geography. Volodymyr holds a Certificate in Business Fundamentals from Rotman Commerce at the University of Toronto. He previously completed an internship with The Kyiv Independent. Trump said he and Putin plan to discuss territorial exchanges in Ukraine, but Kyiv itself must make the decision. "But I'm not here to negotiate for Ukraine," the U.S. president said. The corps claimed that Ukrainian units are operating inside the city, and civilians can move about, though travel within Pokrovsk remains heavily restricted. "This is a Russian tactic before any negotiations," Alina Alekseeva, the deputy head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, told the Kyiv Independent. Beka Museum urged immediate action, highlighting Russian President Vladimir Putin's role in the forced deportation of Ukrainian children and other atrocities committed under his rule. EU ministers could reportedly agree in early September to open the first negotiating cluster with Moldova, a key legal step toward membership, ahead of the country's Sept. 28 parliamentary elections. I think he's going to," U.S. President Donald Trump said.</p>
